        "author":["O'Malley, Michael H."],
        "description":"This paper focuses on linguistic prosodic units related to boundaries between syntactic units. Specifically, rules for predicting the location of such boundaries, and factors affecting their location, are discussed. Examples are given on how prosodies can be used for syntactic analysis. Addressing the question of prosodic units and their distribution, two theories, both based on a hierarchy of units, are contrasted. A third theory, suggested as a possible basis for further refinement and testing is stated as follows: an NP that is not a single unstressed pronoun ends with a phrase- or clause-level boundary; NP's with embedded clauses have boundaries before the clause. A study conducted to test this rule is described, and several flaws in the rule are pointed out. Areas in the  study of prosody that need further research are pinpointed. (AM)",

It is shown that such rules can be formulated either as equations or in the form of matrices. The elements involved can either be specific phonological or morphological forms, or they can be labels for one or more forms. Using such labels has the advantage that one may deal with several different levels of abstraction simultaneously. (Author)",

The instructor may use the iconic and indexic signs in a film to teach the arbitrary signs, or  vocabulary, of the foreign language. The second section of this paper deals with the teaching of film as literature. Methods of stylistic analysis used for written literature may be applied to film to increase understanding and research into this art form. (CK)",

        "description":"The possible relevance linguistics could have for curriculum development in native language teaching is explored. The discussion focuses on three question: (1) Does the study of linguistic theory in school contribute to the development of the students' language competence? (2) Is the study of language a subject worth teaching? (3) Can linguistic study of communication in the classroom contribute to the development of language behavior? Language study is viewed here as a necessary and worthwhile activity because it expands the students' ability to critically analyze language use, various attitudes toward language behavior and social conditions, and the impact of linguistic differences. Linguists need to study language development under school conditions, so that major problems can  be identified and alternatives designed in terms of language learning situations and optimal environments. In addition, careful analysis of the linguistic environment outside school and of its impact on language behavior should be considered a precondition for successful innovations in native language teaching. Theoretical language study must be integrated with actual language use in the classroom. Under this fundamental condition of integration, the study of language theory plays an important role in the language learning process. (PMP)",

        "description":"Bolivia has a multilingual population divided among three language families: Spanish, Quechua, and Aymara. In practice, however, the country has a monolingual system, since Spanish is the language of government, education, and professional and technical fields, and dominates in urban areas. Quechua and Aymara prevail in rural areas and in native music, folklore, and religion. The schools are operated in Spanish, under the theory that linguistic unification will provide equal education and integrate the nation. One result is that education ignores the rural and native identity and reinforces patterns of discrimination and inferiority, when a multilingual-multicultural educational system would be more responsive to the people's needs. For many rural people, radio is a major source  of information and entertainment. Although most broadcasts are in Spanish, the few native-language programs attract many listeners and help develop an awareness of the multilingual society, thereby changing the attitudes of both the dominant and submerged cultural groups. Radio as an educational tool may achieve results superior to traditional educational methods by: (1) creating a Quechua and Aymara solidarity through native-language broadcasts of popular appeal, and (2) providing an outlet for linguistically diverse groups and involving them in active learning.

This lack of geographical focus has prevented the development of easily identifiable aspects of ethnic concentration, such as a Chinese school or a Chinese business district. Apart from the obvious racial component, Chinese ethnicity in Houston involves an individual's largely voluntary association with organizations classified as business or fraternal, religious, and educational. The Chinese language is spoken in all three categories of organizations. Both Cantonese and Mandarin are found, as well as a regional dialect of Cantonese, Taisanese. It is unusual, however, to find third-generation Chinese who speak Chinese as a  mother tongue or learned language. The Chinese living in Houston do not seem to be interested in maintaining an ethnic mother tongue. There is, however, considerable interest in preserving family traditions and influence, and the future of a conscious, Chinese ethnic identity seems secure. (Author/PMP)",

        "description":"This paper, based on Rosenbaum's (1967) grammar of adult English, attempts to apply ideas of deep structure and transformations to child grammar. The main rules predicated include phrase structure rules, segment structure rules, contextual features, and transformational rules. In this approach, the role of transformations is to segment and place elements into the string, rather than to change meaning. This process appears similar to what a child does as he learns a language. Lexical entries described by this theory can provide insights into what the child does with new forms. Rules suggested here are given, not as models of what a child has done, but as characterizations of it. By examining the functional load of transformations, a new measure is derived to capture syntactic  complexity--that of mean transformations per utterance (mtu). This outline for writing grammars for children can capture generalizations about children's grammatical development that have previously been missed. The technique provides a basis for comparing data from several studies and for breaking down the unreplicable nature of most child language data. (CK)",

Stops and nasals were easier than fricatives and sonorants; by 1 year 7 months the labials were essentially mastered; fricatives were more difficult, and the /r/ sound had not been achieved at all. Final consonants were also studied, as were vowels and clusters. Vowels /i/, /a/, /u/ were simpler, but /e/ and /o/ harder to say, both in stressed and unstressed use. The phonological processes were examined to determine what organizing principle is at work in sound selection.

        "description":"Research is being conducted to determine the factors behind linguistic retardation in children. A first question raised was whether the linguistic system of the deviant child is qualitatively different from that of a normal child. A matching-up of deviant and normal children according to linguistic level suggests that the onset of base syntax may be delayed in the deviant child by three and a half years, and that the time needed to pass from one level to another may be two and a half years longer in the deviant child. A further study showed that the deviant and the normal group had similar organization of phrase structure grammars, but that the deviant group did not use major linguistic categories in as many different contexts as the normal group. To determine what this  information could relate about the nature of the deviant child's deficit, utterances are being collected and analyzed on the basis of semantic categories. Preliminary analysis suggests the deficit lies in the ability to develop additional terms and relationships in which to use them. This information leads to the question of a cognitive deficit. Experimentation tends to support the idea that linguistic level and symbolization correspond more closely in deviant children than linguistic level and general nonverbal development. A final hypothesis is that children with linguistic deficits reflect a base representational rather than a base intellectual deficiency, and that diagnostic tests should reflect this pattern. (AM)",

The term \"aphasia\" is discussed as it is used to describe adult and child language disorders. A first experiment on the auditory functioning in aphasic and nonaphasic children suggests that the auditory processing defect in child aphasia lies in short-term auditory storage or memory. A subsequent study, which sought to measure the relationship between stimulus duration and signal detection, had equivocal results which lead to speculation about signal threshold and internal filter. It is suggested that low frequencies present special problems for temporary storage and detection. A final conclusion states that either a  phonological base is a requisite foundation of subsequent linguistic development, or that auditory dysfunction does not adequately account for developmental aphasia.

His progress was studied over a year and a half period, in three one-month segments. His speech was recorded by tape and transcribed. Techniques used to elicit consonant clusters included real word imitation, imitation of nonsense words, and adult imitation of the child. Rules for dealing with consonant clusters were abstracted from the data, and general phonological strategies were determined. Finally, predictions were made regarding the subject's future developmental phonological processes. (AM)",

These hypotheses were tested on six Spanish-speaking children. The intervocalic position was chosen as that of maximal contrast. On a weekly basis, over a period of five months, the subjects were asked to imitate nonsense syllables containing the form VCV, allowing for the collection of data on all 18 Spanish consonant phonemes in three environments: a-a, i-e, and u-o. In addition, spontaneous speech and real word imitation was allowed, but not  analyzed in this report. The sessions were recorded on tape and phonetically transcribed. Taking instability to indicate recent acquisition, the results neither disprove nor prove the first part of hypothesis 1; seem to support part 2 of hypothesis 1; and seem to support hypothesis 2. The conclusion calls for further study on younger Spanish-speaking children. An appendix lists all stimulus items that were used. (AM)",

        "description":"To the question of whether Chomsky's hypothesized Language Acquisition Device (LAD) in young children is an adequate and feasible model of language acquisition, this paper answers that LAD should be reformulated so as to include semantics; that &quot;informant presentation&quot; rather than &quot;text presentation&quot; is responsible for language acquisition; and that nonlinguistic knowledge may be crucial in syntax acquisition. The first argument is supported by experiments which show that learning strategies differ according to whether or not the learner has semantic information. The second argument is supported by experiments which show that parents present semantic-specific and phonology-specific feedback to the learner, and, indirectly, syntactic feedback. Finally, situations are discussed in  which nonlinguistic knowledge may be the basis for linguistic hypotheses. The paper's conclusion is that this approach may lead to insight into the link between cognitive development and language acquisition. (AM)",

        "description":"This paper offers some ideas on the types of behavior that can be considered precursors to language and that also lay the foundations for logic, mathematics, physics, etc. The paper posits the problem of whether a theory of language must be formulated before one can formulate a theory of language acquisition, or whether the reverse is true. The solution offered is the study of what is acquired at different ages, and how each stage relates to the others. This must be done by a selective study of the types of behavior that may lead to speech. After a definition of the essential features of language, prelanguage behavior may be studied. Among these behaviors is the development of what Piaget calls sensorimotor intelligence, i.e., modification and coordination of isolated action  patterns present at birth. By the second year this behavior culminates in object-permanency, or the objectivization of the existence of objects and persons and their representation in the mind. A third behavior is communication, which includes vocalization, gestures, and postures. A final behavior is \"babbling,\" which leads to the first word. The paper ends with speculation on the specific contribution of these four behaviors in the acquisition of the various levels of a particular language. (AM)",

A central question is whether there is a continuity between babbling and speech. The paper presents the views that: the infant's ability to assimilate and adapt to his environment antedates the maturation of his visual and auditory systems; generalization in infant cognitive behavior takes place before symbolization; babbling is systematic and reflects phonetic preferences found in later speech; from the physiological point of view babbling is an integral part of speech acquisition. The panel concludes that: a definition of terms is necessary; the variance between child and adult speech presents a special problem; neurological studies are relevant to language  acquisition; there is a continuity between babbling and speech; and further research is needed.

        "description":"This paper reports on an experiment designed to collect data on children's perception and use of semantic attributes. Forty-five children ranging in age from 2 years 8 months to 6 years were given a picture test involving judgment of similarities between objects. The test consisted of 47 groups of pictures; each group contained a stimulus or a card and a set of two to three additional pictures on a page, all sharing an equal number of attributes with the stimulus. The subjects were divided into two groups. The first group looked at a stimulus and then pointed to the picture most like it. The second group was given nonsense names for each stimulus, such as \"bork,\" and was then asked to identify another \"bork.\" The features explored were: shape, size, color, texture/material,  sound, function, situation, detail shape, pattern, age, sex, mass, real, animate, human, and species. It has been proposed that the earliest features a child attends to are perceptual. The results of the present study, described in detail here, seem to suggest that no preferential hierarchy exists among various perceptual categories. Whether shape, size, or color, etc. will be the most salient feature may depend on a particular context, namely what the respective values of the competing features are. (Author/PMP)",

The data on which these models are based is summarized, and various hypotheses on which the models depend are tested. The issue of the ordering of phonological segments in the stored representation of words is considered in Chapter 3. The issue of the interrelations of lexical items and the form of the storage network is considered in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 deals  with the possibility of a hierarchical representation of the phonological structure of lexical items.

Bilingual education in the United States is usually dual medium, either for maintenance or conversion to a wider culture, aiming to produce a bilingual individual or to help assimilate an alien into American culture. The Bilingual Education Act has improved the situation for immigrants and American Indians, who previously were forced into monolingual education. In the Pacific islands, education had focussed on conversion from the native language to the colonial world language. Currently, however bilingual programs exist, and native dictionaries and grammars are being written and orthography  reformed. Writing and teaching materials must be developed in the vernacular languages and competent teachers found and trained in order to establish successful dual medium, maintenance bilingual curricula. Schools in Indonesia, Malaysis, the Philippines and Singapore often teach local, national, and world languages. Currently, national languages are assuming ascendancy as colonial languages become foreign tongues. In all three areas of the world, bilingual education is both a source of identity and a factor in social change. (CK)",

Of fundamental importance are: a deep analysis of type of error and reasons behind it; an understanding of the process of second language learning; and a description of the learner's model of the target language, as a basis for  remedial treatment.

American Finnish differs from native Finnish in its assimilation of a substantial number of loan words that augment and sometimes replace the original vocabulary. Many loan words deal with employment, foodstuffs, or environment, and have been adapted to Finnish morphology and phonology by a series of word-formation and pronunciation rules. These include stem formation to attach suffixes, consonant cluster simplification, stress adjustment, devoicing obstruents, and altering fricatives, affricates, labials and vowels to conform to Finnish phonology and inflection. One American Finn was found who speaks and writes a form of Finglish different  from that recorded by researchers: it is based on English.

Part 1 states the hypotheses which underlie the data analysis, describes testing methods and results, and outlines recommendations which resulted from the evaluation. A section on process evaluation indicates that the instruction process seemed to be going very well, with competent teachers using teaching aides and audiovisual materials effectively. A teacher questionnaire indicates satisfaction with the Brown Institute, but stresses the need for curriculum development and for a uniform program of literacy teaching. The lack of native speaker fluency among teachers is noted. The administering of a personality test and an intelligence test is  described, along with special problems, score analysis, and recommendations. Part 2, management analysis, discusses the planning, installing, operating, communicating, and evaluation aspects of the project and deals with the general impact on parents, community, teachers, students, and other participating institutions. An appendix contains a monitoring system which defines management responsibility, bi-weekly project activity reports, as well as other illustrative materials. (AM)",

Part 1 deals with instructional evaluation. The project objective, the mastery of both English and Portuguese speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills by all students, is stated, followed by a description of the ethnic background of the participants. Pretesting and posttesting procedures are described as well as their results. A test of self-concepts and attitudes showed generally positive attitudes. Process evaluation produced changes such as articulation of itermediate objectives and the implementation  of a kindergarten program. These changes are dealt with in the section on instructional recommendations. A teacher survey focused on team teaching and Portuguese curriculum needs. A section on staff development discusses the use of the Brown University inservice program and the Rhode Island College Portuguese Curriculum Materials Center. Part 2 management evaluation, deals with planning and operating the project, its impact on the participants, objectives for the current year, management, and bi-weekly reports.

It is suggested that the rate of speed of phonic presentation is not commensurate with the rate of comprehension. The proposed method seeks to prevent cognitive overloading by using a speech compressor on native-speaker tapes and following this by repetition. An experiment measuring the effect of this method on listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills implies that one particular method is not so important as specialized strategies directed to specific groups of students and individual language skills.

Newspaper sources can be used as a basis for constructing a learning activity packet with three phases. The prereading phase contains sound-symbol correspondence and vocabulary exercises, structure analysis and/or structure review programmed for self-instruction and selected to correspond to the student's language level. In the reading phase the student is required to read for information, for specific details, for interpretation or for critical analysis. The postreading phase consists of a structural and lexical analysis of the material. Postreading exercises are also used to help the student understand the context within which words are found. Filmstrips,  motion pictures, and slide programs can also be assimilated into this program through preparation of scripts and correlated recordings. The film source itself is used as a supplement to increase student interest and motivation. Other sources of reading material suggested here are textbooks published and used in the foreign country, current magazines, business and government publications, and letters from student pen pals. These sources provide appropriate material for the three-phase format as well as insights into the culture being studied. (PMP)",

        "description":"The data presented in this paper indicates that the present Spanish language program at Mesa College serves only one quarter of the student body and probably even a smaller fraction of the community. This situation exists because the recommended curriculums for 52 of Mesa College's 66 lower-division majors, largely nongeneral liberal arts and one- and two-year terminal education majors, do not make available a sufficient number of elective hours for students to take the standard 15-hour beginning comprehensive (all four skills) Spanish course. Evidence is presented to show that there is a need for foreign language skills among the three quarters of the student body now being neglected. Interviews with instructors, department heads, and division chairmen suggest that the interests  of one-fifth of these students can be served best by a foreign language other than Spanish. The needs of approximately one-third, however, can be served best by a new, innovative, three-hour, one- to three-quarter, limited-objective (understanding and speaking skills only), career-oriented Spanish program. It is estimated that within a few years following adoption of such a program, foreign language enrollment should be at least two to three times larger than it is at present. (Author/KM)",

It was decided to have a retrospective look at the nature of higher education's response. Therefore, a conference was organized of a selected number of New England colleges and universities that had a marked increase in their enrollment of black students since 1967. This monograph is the report of that conference, being selective rather than exhaustive in terms of institutions reporting. Several recurring facts emerged during the conference: (1) The criteria now used for predicting the capacities of black college applicants are inconclusive; (2) There is a  wide variation in percent of black college enrollment from school to school; (3) The percentage of attrition is low for black students when compared to the national figures; (4) Supportive pre-freshmen and ongoing academic programs geared especially to help minority students have been very successful; (5) Aggressive and frank counseling can best be done by black adults with less risk of lack of trust by the black students, and (6) On every campus there is a dearth of black adult role models.

        "description":"Since its inception in 1972, the Higher Education Cooperation Act (HECA) is proving to be an effective agent for improving Illinois higher education, and at a nominal cost. Various HECA projects aimed at encouraging international cooperation and increasing access to higher education have involved in some way nearly every public and private college and university in the state. In spite of minimal funding, many HECA projects are already operating with distinction. The Quad-Cities Graduate Studies Center has brought quality graduate education to hundreds of students in the Quad-Cities area without the need to establish a new graduate institution or new graduate program. The Southern Illinois Collegiate Common Market is bringing senior and junior institutions together in an effort to  provide needed inservice education for the citizens of this region without duplicating ongoing programs. Rigorous evaluation of the heca program has been undertaken by the HECA staff members and by external consultants. After an introduction and summary, this document defines HECA, how it works, and how effective it is. Appendixes include fiscal 1973 HECA grants approved; the fiscal 1974 HECA grant; and a brief picture of the recent history of interinstitutional cooperation in Illinois. (Author/PG)",

This symposium was centered on the British experience and the present state of thinking in the United Kingdom, and includes fifteen papers read by British lecturers and five by non-British lecturers that summarized similar or contrasting experience in other European countries. Underlying all contributions to the Symposium was the conviction that after the golden age of well-financed expansion in the 1960s higher education is likely to go through much leaner times in the present decade. The constraints of this new situation will in all countries make it necessary for planning to become more efficient and for reform to seek a broader  consesus on the central issues. The papers are divided into three sections: the British Experience, the Challenge of the New Media, and Planning for Efficiency. The final report concerns the Carnegie reports and their relevance to higher education in Europe. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"Characteristics and perceptions of nonreturning students for the spring 1973 semester at Arkansas State University were determined by mailed questionnaires, and the College and University Environment Scales (CUES), Second Edition (Modified), and comparison data. The sample group of 585 academically qualified students, was compared to the fall semester 1972 student population with respect to sex, academic classification, academic major, degree program, and grade-point average. Data indicated: (1) There were 1,381 students enrolled during the fall semester of 1972 who did not re-enter the university in the spring of 1973. (2) More than half of the 914 eligible nonreturning students were classified in the lower division and 361 were freshmen. (3) The mean grade-point average for  nonreturning eligible students was equal to or greater than the grade-point average required for satisfactory progress toward the degree. (4) There was no significant difference between the grade-point average of those eligible students who did not return in the spring semester of 1973 and those who made up the fall 1972 student population. (5) The descriptive statistics and treatment of the data by means of the normal deviate test led to the conclusion that attrition was independent of academic classification, college, major, and degree. (6) The number of nonreturning students who were undecided with respect to college, major, and degree was disproportionate to the number of enrolled undecided students in the fall semester of 1972. Additional findings and statistical data are included.  (MJM)",

        "description":"An external degree is one that may be earned outside the central structure of a college or university. The most common form of external degree program is the evening college in which students, who are usually working adults, meet the standard requirements for a four-year degree by taking a part-time program after work. No allowances are made in evening college programs for what adult students may have learned outside the classroom, even though this learning may be equivalent to what they are required to learn for their degrees. Sensing this problem, a number of programs were developed in the late forties and fifties to take advantage of the rich experience that many adults have had in their lives. Most often such programs provide not only an opportunity for credit for life  experience but also for teaching methods and requirements that seem to be more appropriate for mature students. The adult degree programs of nine schools are examined in the report; Brooklyn College, Queens College; Mundelein College; Roosevelt University; University of Oklahoma; Syracuse University; Goddard College; University of South Florida; State University of New York College, Brockport. The most significant findings of the study are: (1) these programs seem to be reacting to the move toward vocational orientation in undergraduate programs. (2) The programs are moving away from their unique designs toward compatibility with more traditional programs. (3) Lack of full time faculties keeps the staff of these programs from exercising authority within their institutions.  (Author/PG)",

In the 1972 study the focus was on applicants accepted by Hofstra but who decided not to attend (no-shows). Approximately 45 percent of the 1972 population completed and returned the questionnaire. In 1973, the questionnaire was mailed to both no-shows and those who did attend. In the former and latter categories, 28 percent and 31 percent, respectively, completed and returned the questionnaire. The AAS was designed to elicit certain kinds of information about factors relevant to university life. Such factors include academic, location, financial, social activities, external advice, and a general category that includes items that are mixtures of two or more  factors. Findings indicate: (1) No-shows rated their attended university more positively than they did Hofstra, although they rated Hofstra in a positive manner as well. (2) In 1973, more than 50 percent of the no-shows rated Hofstra positively on the following academic items: academic reputation, course offerings, availability of desired major, innovative curriculum, and quality of the faculty. (3) The positive rated items included under location were: commuting convenience, easy access to home for residential students, and general geographic location. (4) Under social activities, the positive items were: degree of freedom allowed students, extra-curricular activities, and dorms available.

Student interests are particularly important because of their new lobbies, and because of the new direction in federal funding under the Education Amendments of 1972, which channel a substantial proportion of federal higher education funds to institutions through student choices. Last, the higher education community has also come to recognize that public and congressional  understanding and support for its goals and programs are important to its well-being.

Participating states are able to make arrangements for their residents who qualify for admission to enroll in specific programs in other states on an in-state tuition basis.

The Common Market concept recognizes that it is impractical to attempt development of programs in every field of knowledge--especially since there already exist in each Southern state programs, not offered in some of the others, capable of accommodating additional students. Through the sharing of such programs, the Market will assist in eliminating unnecessary duplication and increasing availability and access to programs necessary  in meeting the educational needs of citizens in the participating states. The graduate opportunities available to residents of Southern states through the Academic Common Market are listed in this document, state-by-state. As a result of arrangements worked out by the participating states, students entering these programs through the Market will not be required to pay out-of-state tuition fees.

This study of relationships between state governments and the academic community in a 14-state region of the South provides clear descriptions of the needs of state governments and delineates the capabilities and limitations of the academic community in meeting those specific needs. The report identifies the obstacles to overcome and recommends specific steps that can be taken to achieve more productive working relationships. Recommendations include: (1) Establishment of a coordinating council (in states where appropriate) to serve as a facilitator and harmonizer in improving working relationships between state government and the  academic community; (2) reassessment by state agencies of ways they can draw effectively on the specialized resources of the state's institutions of higher education; (3) establishment of separate line items in the budgets of appropriate state agencies to help alleviate the difficulty of financing public service activities; (4) establishment of public service positions in central boards of higher education (where appropriate) to encourage member institutions to provide services to state government.

These definitions and procedures have been developed to facilitate exchange of information among institutions of postsecondary education, providing institutions with some assurance that data they exchange are useful for purposes of comparison. The procedures and definitions recommended in this manual and other manuals about IEP are &quot;targets&quot; for institutions. While it is anticipated that most institutions will be able to follow these recommendations, some  institutions may not have available the required information, and others may not be able to provide it at a reasonable cost. Any effort at exchange of data among institutions involves some compromise in an attempt to accommodate the wide variation among institutions. Consequently, while comparable information for exchange is the goal of IEP, NCHEMS cannot guarantee the absolute comparability of data as the final result of IEP. Hopefully, the implementation of IEP will represent reasonable progress toward that goal. (Author/PG)",

The purpose was to access some of the impacts that declining financial support for graduate students and recent labor market difficulties for Ph.D's have had on graduate departments. Findings indicate: (1) In the majority of disciplines studied, the result was a general stability in the percentage distribution of graduate enrollments among quality categories over this period of adjustment. (2) The cutbacks in federal support for graduate students have had a larger absolute impact on the highest rated departments because they are the largest departments and have the most federally  supported students, but these departments have not suffered disproportionately relative to the others. (3) Private universities enrolled a slightly smaller proportion of graduate students in the fields under study in FY 1973 than in FY 1968, but the highest rated graduate departments in private institutions actually increased their proportion of enrollments relative to comparably rated public departments. Additional findings and statistical data are included. (MJM)",

(2) The public institutions reported a 7.0 percent increase, with 96,037 students enrolled for the 1974 term. (3) Among the private institutions, total enrollment declined by 159 students, or about 1 percent. (4) The public institutions reported a total of 150,370.8 units (each unit  equals 10 contact hours of participation). (5) Although the number of all types of degrees conferred by the public and private institutions remained constant, 19,890 in 1973 and 19,893 in 1974, there were increases in four of the six degree-level categories.

A comparison of YRO and YRO alternatives and the success of conversion planning led to four basic conclusions and recommendations: (1) The concept of YRO is sound and can result in significant total cost savings; however, the advantages of conversion to YRO can be great, or nonexistant, on an individual campus. These differences prevent the overall conclusion from being applied to every campus and college. The decision to offer YRO must be a local one, based on the economics of the individual campus. (2) The decision to offer summer quarter at a particular campus or college must be based on a complete investment analysis. This will highlight  the cost advantages of YRO at that campus or college. (3) Each college or campus that is to convert to the quarter system, and then initiate YRO, should follow the conversion planning schedule presented in this report. (4) Because the score and breadth of summer quarter course offerings have a profound effect on cost/full-time equivalent students, it is recommended that each college and campus study the effect of reducing the scope and breadth of the summer quarter course.

These three areas involve significant issues in financing higher education. The fourth section reviews a variety of legal contracts between institutions and their students that may also be affected by the lower age of majority. Examples include contracting with adult students, notifying parents when a student is in academic  difficulty, and obtaining parental consent for medical treatment. (Author)",

Forth-eight styles of abstracting journals were produced which, although based on the same source material, differed in depth of coverage, frequency of publication, content of entry, and whether an index was included. One style of journal was produced with each possible combination of these parameters. Each style was sent for a trial period to four users who marked items not noted and followed up from each issue and completed a questionnaire at the end of the experiment. The results show a distinction between expressed preferences on the parameters studied and the styles which proved most useful in practice. In particular, although most users said they would  prefer abstracts, the citation-only styles were most useful. The bulk of a publication appears to be an important factor in determining usability. The experiment also demonstrated a demand for a much wider range of information from researchers and teachers than from practitioners. (Author/SL)",

The first area of investigation was of concepts of death evidenced at the child's various developmental stages, as documented in numerous psychological studies. The second area studied was the various reactions to death which a child might display. The third area discussed was the cultural attitudes of present day American society toward death, with special emphasis on how these attitudes influence the child's conception of death. Lastly, a review was made of American children's literature from colonial times to the present, noting the treatment of death as a reflection of the cultural values  of each era. Twenty-two books of juvenile fiction, for children up to age 12, were evaluated in terms of their treatment of death as a major theme. Most of the books were found to be of outstanding value in acquainting the young child with wholesome death concepts, were psychologically valid, and complied with accepted social attitudes toward the subject.

Pertinent published literature on ILL networks is reviewed in terms of network structure, operations, satisfaction of requests, and costs. A flow chart model of the Illinois ILL network is outlined, and then alternate approaches are considered for the mathematical modeling of an ILL network. Network flow theory and simulation are discarded in favor of a hierarchical queueing network which will be analyzed using approximations that will be validated with simulation. An initial version of this model, named ILLINET, has been programed into an on-line interactive package where the  user can input alternative network operating policies and test the effect on average delay in satisfying a request, probability of satisfying a request, total network operating costs, and unit costs. Six possible hardware applications of computer and communications technology are discussed, ranging from simple telephone and WATS line to the possible use of a computer to control the whole network.

A ratio of one library media staff member for every six teaching staff members is recommended. A starting collection of 20 items per pupil or 9,000  items, whichever is greater, should eventually be expanded to 40 items per pupil.

        "description":"An investigation was made of the organizational characteristics of two college learning resource centers as compared with two traditionally organized college libraries with separate audiovisual units in order to determine the advantages of each organizational type. Interviews, observation, and examination of relevant documents were used to determine organizational characteristics, types and qualities of resources, facilities, staffing, and services at each institution. The author concluded that the services provided by the two types of organizations are not necessarily different, and that the attitudes of director and staff have the most important influence on the success of the service. A bibliography, letters, and interview documents are attached. (LS)",

The report concludes that both can be taught if math content is structured as a sequence of problems in which students induce organizational rules from examples.

Information was sought on current DPL usage and nonusage practices of these three groups, their levels of awareness and attitudes toward the DPL system, and their principal information needs and sources. The project's data collection phase consisted of three surveys conducted concurrently between February and June 1974. Personal interviews were conducted in a sample of households, while questionnaires were mailed to businesses and government agencies. The data analysis phase of the project produced a number of recommendations for specific  actions by the DPL to make the system more responsive to its current and potential users.

GAO found that federal library support programs have helped to improve materials and services in school and public libraries nation-wide. Some problems were noted in state procedures for allocating federal funds which tended to limit the funds available to local governments to provide services for those most in need.

It was found that rates ranged from $4.95 to $8.75, with the average monthly service at $5.65. Fees had little to do with an overall citizens' rights; the companies with higher rates generally made no provisions for citizens' rights. Local government officials have rarely requested opportunities for citizens' services. Rates, number of subscribers, dates of franchise, and amount of citizen access are shown in charts. (SK)",

Other questions studied--attitudes toward telecasts; attitudes toward rebroadcast of the Judiciary Committee meetings on public television; attitudes toward who should pay for congressional telecasts; audience-perceived bias of newspapers, magazines, and television; television's effect on confidence in government--turned up mostly inconclusive evidence due to a large percentage of nonrespondents and a large percentage of &quot;no opinions.&quot; The study concluded that the public affairs  audience is little studied and little understood.

The survey showed that public radio listeners were more educated, more likely to be progressive, more likely to be white, less likely to watch TV or attend sports events, and more likely to listen to classical music.

Since CTV is being merely used as an extension of what exists, it has become an added cost rather than a method of reducing costs. Consequently many educators are calling for action now while CTV is just in the development stages--programs must be developed and empirically tested, and in some cases the FCC must act to support educational provisions.

The groups were analyzed in terms of characteristics, rationale for service, needs for library and information services, inadequacies in existing services, and strategies for change. The reports of the 16 experts were presented at the NCLIS User Conference at the University of Denver, Colorado, in May, 1973.

The final evaluation disclosed that faculty members particularly appreciated the time saved by the service and the comprehensive, up-to-date searches. Many planned to make greater use of the service. The conclusion reached by the study was that the project contributed significantly to improving the quality and quantity of the teaching and research conducted by  faculty users and did it in a cost effective manner.

Specific questions involved the image and role of libraries in education textbooks and courses, and the implications of that image. Analysis of questionnaires sent to heads of education departments and reference librarians in Kentucky teacher training institutions, along with analyses of textbooks used, revealed that the library image presented to would-be teachers is often blurred, distorted, lackluster, or nonexistent. The general impression gleaned from the study is that the public school library is generally felt to have little effect on the education of  students. Since those institutions which did provide instruction on library use found no adequate textbook for the purpose, the author has provided an outline for such a unit.

        "description":"The practices of media personnel regarding the duplication of copyrighted materials were studied through an opinionnaire designed to elicit responses (yes/no/perhaps) to 24 hypothetical work situations involving the possible duplication of seven categories of copyrighted media: film, filmstrips, videotapes, records, audio tapes, slide/tape series, and printed matter. The opinionnaire was distributed to those who attended the Ninth Annual Educational Media and Technology Conference, July 22-24, 1974, at the University of Wisconsin - Stout, Menomonie, Wisconsin. Over 160 responses came from media and library personnel of all professional levels, as well as from graduate students, teachers, and media sales representatives. Responses were tabulated by type of media in question and by  professional status of the respondent. It was concluded that reproduction would have occurred in the majority of cases. Learning resource directors were the group most willing to reproduce all types of copyrighted media; library directors and salesmen were in the groups least likely to do so. Audio tapes were the media most frequently copied; films and slide/tapes, the least frequently copied. This report includes a literature review on copyright principle and legislation. (SL)",

        "description":"A study was designed to test the expectation that different individuals have different cognitive styles, which, if true, may be useful in investigating characteristics and psychological impacts of media utilization. Cognitive style refers to an individual's way of acquiring and processing information. Characteristics of the visual type and haptic type are identified based on an earlier study by Viktor Lowenfeld. The hypotheses were that the visual type could be expected to discriminate visual detail and to react impersonally, thus testing out as field-independent and reflective; and the haptic type could be expected to be unable to discriminate visual detail and to react emotionally, thus testing out as field-dependent and impulsive. Three tests (which are not included) were used  to classify subjects as reflective, impulsive, or indefinite; field-independent, field-dependent, or indefinite; and visual, haptic, or indefinite. The results of the study imply that: (1) Visuals tended to be field-independent on a test of perceptual style, while haptics tended to be field-dependent; (2) Visuals tended to be reflective on a visual test of perceptual tempo, while haptics tended to be impulsive; and (3) Haptics made more errors on the tempo test than did visuals. It is suggested that further research be conducted to see if these trends appear in other samples. (KKC)",

        "description":"A study was made to determine whether different methods of visual presentations would affect the retention rate of individuals with two distinct types of perception--visual and haptic. The visual type, according to a study by Viktor Lowenfeld in 1957, is marked by the following characteristics: (1) ability to see wholes, break them into visual details, and then recombine them into visual wholes; (2) tendency to visualize kinesthetic and tactile experiences; and (3) ability to hold visual images mentally. The haptic type is marked by the following characteristics; (1) inability to discriminate fine visual detail; (2) inability to visualize tactile experiences; and (3) inability to hold visual images mentally. The experimental task was designed to test the ability of subjects to  view three pictures of a piece of equipment. One group received a sequential linear presentation of three pictures, and a second group received a multiple image presentation of the task. The findings of the study suggest the following: (1) Visuals performed better over-all than haptics on a task which required the apprehension, retention, and utilization of visual cues; (2) A simultaneous multiple image presentation of visual stimuli resulted in better over-all performance on such a task than a linear presentation; and (3) Haptics benefited more than visuals from the use of multiple images. Therefore, changing methods of presentation may increase other aptitudes in which haptics are weak. (KKC)",

To determine if a student's ECS is related to learning from a simulation game, an exploratory study was conducted with a sample of 24 fifth grade students. The students were divided into two groups to play two simulation games from the social studies curriculum Man: A Course of Study. Group 1 played three rounds of the Bow and Arrow Hunting Game, followed by the Crossing Place Hunting Game. Group 2 played the games in reverse order. Knowledge gain was measured by identical pre- and post-tests. After the gaming, an ECS test battery was administered to all participants. ECS elements were classified as to their frequency  within the high- or low-achieving student groups. Results indicated that those students likely to derive maximum cognitive knowledge from a simulation game were those who gather information by listening, prefer peer group interaction, and tend to reason on the basis of rules. Students who tend to receive the least benefit from games derive information from both reading and listening and prefer independent activities. (SL)",

Both sex and level of perceptual speed ability were held to be patent predictors of poorer quality and slower work in instruction via compressed sound motion pictures. A compression rate of 25 percent was held least effective  for females and most effective for males; a 33-1/3 percent rate, least effective for those of low perceptual ability and most effective for those of high perceptual ability.

Because of the encouraging results of field trials, the department committed itself to a major production effort, and in the fall of 1972 Media Library program subscriptions were offered to hospitals. Subscribers report usage for both individual and group study by physicians, medical students, and physicians'  assistants. A syllabus has been developed for each of the 18 programs consisting of a statement of objectives, a reading reference list, a summary of the program, and a post test with answers. Media Library has been accredited for continuing medical education hours by several medical associations.

(1) The size and characteristics of the reference group in Canadian education should be studied. With all its subgroups, this group may comprise as many as 200,000 people. (2) The number and types of documents being produced in Canadian education should be reviewed. There may be as many as 5,000 items produced each year in Canada. (2) The number of documents produced in Canada that actually enter the existing information delivery system must be examined. There is no well conceived, systematic procedure to insure that every document produced on Canadian education actually is disseminated. (4) An evaluation of current practices in describing,  organizing, and providing information about education documents is needed. The best sources of bibliographic information include &quot;Canadiana&quot; and the &quot;Canadian Education Index.&quot; (5) Existing bibliographic materials on Canadian education should be documented, and unmet needs should be noted. The preparation of a &quot;Guide to Information and Bibliographic Resources Related to Canadian Education&quot; and the formation of a task group on the improvement of information and bibliographic services in Canadian education are recommended.

While the growth in the volume and technology of information has been great in recent years, the problems surrounding that growth are not as serious as many writers suggest. From a review of recent literature on education information delivery systems in Canada, 13 themes emerge including a call for systems analysis in assessing designing, and implementing such systems. Suggestions are given for the development of a unique information system for Canadian education. The paper concludes with a recommendation for the creation of a task group on the improvement of information and bibliographic services in Canadian education. (DGC)",

Formerly, games and toys designated as \"educational\" were often strategies for painlessly imparting school subjects to children. Today, \"developmental skills\" or \"readiness experiences\" are typical objectives of many of the toys on the market for pre-school children. To date, there is no published evidence to indicate that any educational benefit can be directly attributed to the use of these toys. Yet any claim as vague as \"developing a child's full potential\" or \"providing him with appropriate experiences\" has little hope of being proved or disproved. Such claims worry parents wishing to provide their child with the best possible start in school. Pressed for  evidence, toy manufacturers fall back on educational generalizations, or protest that findings cannot be disclosed lest they fall into the hands of the competition. Educational theorists quoted here proclaim the educational value of most toys to be overrated. (KC)",

Staff profiles and manpower projections were made for each type of library, as was an analysis of the positions, salaries, ages, and educational backgrounds of recent appointees. Among the conclusions of this study were that the Masters of Library Science should constitute the minimum level of educational attainment for entry into the profession, exclusively  undergraduate programs should be gradually phased out, and library schools should work to make their programs responsive to the needs of the library community. Attention should be given to the role of the library technical assistant, to inservice training, and to certification standards. (SL)",

Twenty-five full-time faculty completed two questionnaires: the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale and a questionnaire listing administrative tasks to determine cluster or division preference. Academic background and preparation data were also solicited. No  significant relationship was found to exist between dogmatism of faculty, semester hours in education courses, semester hours beyond the Master's, community college teaching experience, secondary school teaching experience, or four-year school teaching experience and faculty preference for clusters or divisions. Dogmatism and educational or teaching background were also found to have no relationship.

        "description":"In fall 1974, Harford Community College instituted a nonpunitive grading system. Students receive grades of A,B,C,D, or *. A &quot;*&quot; indicates that course requirements have not been met; it is not considered in computing the student's Quality Point Index (QPI). This new grading system, in addition to the national trend toward higher grades, led the college's administrative council to request a study to determine if there have been any recent, significant shifts in QPI or honor lists at the college. Study results show an increase in the percentage of students on honor lists, from 18 percent in fall 1973 to 21 percent in fall 1974. There was an increase in the proportion of students with a QPI above 3 and a decrease in the proportion with a QPI below 2, the proportion of students with&quot;middle grades&quot; remaining unchanged. Compared to 1972, there were more A's and fewer C's given in 1973. Compared to 1973, there were more F/*'s given, as well as more A's, in 1974. The proportion of students taking incompletes in 1974 dropped 6 percent since 1973, and withdrawals rose 5 percent. During the year in which the nonpunitive grading system was introduced, the proportion of students receiving passing grades dropped 2.4 percent. Several reasons for these changes are suggested.

        "description":"The educational discipline of Management is an inexact science. Because of the difficulty in measuring the effects of the academic study of Management on decision-making and related behaviors, a commercial instrument, the \"How Supervise?\" questionnaire, was tested as a possible means of measuring \"before and after treatment\" behaviors. The instrument, nominally a knowledge sampler, was used more as an attitude, perception, and potential behavior sampler. The subjects used in this study were the entire population of credit and non-credit students regularly enrolled in either of the two most basic Management Development courses offered at Manatee Junior College. Five groups of basic Management students were sampled; the total number of subjects was 65. Two equivalent forms of the  instrument were administered on the first and last day of class. National percentile scores were grouped and histographically displayed; the composite results indicate that significant improvement in decision-making behaviors did occur in the individual groups as well as in the composite population. It is recommended that this type of measurement be pursued on a broader base to determine more about the effects of classroom environment, the student profile, and individual professors on positive change in student attitudes and behaviors.

        "description":"Following a short review of the literature and a thorough discussion of the pros and cons of community college tuition, an analysis of educational costs and benefits is made. In Washington, the total cost of community college attendance, including foregone income, is approximately $4,707 per year per student. Of this figure, the student and/or his family bears the responsibility for $3,662 (77.8 percent). Even if there were no tuition and fee charges, these students would still have to pay a large percentage of the educational cost. This situation represents an economic barrier to educational opportunity, which benefits society. Higher education is a social necessity, not a luxury, and should be treated as such in policy and by funding. As a result of this study, three  recommendations are made: (1) That public institutions of higher education be supported at a level which makes access possible without tuition levels which economically would deny opportunity to some individuals; (2) That tuition not be increased until such time as the individual contribution drops below the range of two-thirds to three-fourths of the economic costs of attendance; and (3) The tuition charges be graduated within the public sector to reflect the growth in benefits resulting from additional education.

Following a brief survey of research literature and a review of the sabbatical leave provisions of the California Education Code, findings are reported in tabular and narrative form. Results indicate that most institutions allow sabbatical leaves to 4 or 5% of their full-time faculty each year. Faculty are compensated at half pay for two semesters or full pay for one semester at 39% of the colleges; 22% grant 75-80% of full pay for a one semester leave and 60-75% for a two semester leave. All colleges surveyed indicated a minimum of six years of service before  an instructor is eligible for a sabbatical; 59 percent indicated a minimum of seven years. Advanced study, travel, and/or research were identified by all respondents as legitimate purposes for granting sabbatical leaves; only two identified work experience as a legitimate purpose. 48 percent of the colleges have an established committee structure for sabbatical leave determination. Appendices include a copy of the present SCC sabbatical leave policy, a rough draft of Academic Senate's Proposed Resolution on Sabbatical Leave, and a copy of the survey instrument. (DC)",

Fundamental to the new system is the need for the student to see the relevance of his studies to his occupational goals, as seemingly irrelevant material presents a motivational problem. An effort was made to structure mathematics courses to fit specific student needs within each occupational program. Mathematical skills were broken into groups, and the skills essential to each program were determined. Common blocks of mathematics instruction in fractions, decimals, etc., were supplemented by problems tailored to and written in the individual occupational jargon. Students studied the blocks at their own  pace, and tests were administered at the end of each block. Some students complete their math requirement in one quarter; others may take four or five quarters. A mathematics laboratory with a math instructor and an audiotutorial system for the basic arithmetic program are included in the program. Although there is no statistical data with which to evaluate the program at this time, preliminary reports with respect to learning and dropout rates are favorable. (AH)",

Questionnaires were administered to 61 (77%) of the full-time faculty members and to 195 (13%) of the 1,504 FTE day and evening students to determine their library-utilization habits and their attitudes toward the library. The most important finding was that students who received orientation in the use of the library tended to use the library more often and to hold better attitudes toward the library than those who had not received orientation; this led to the recommendation that instruction in the use of the library become a part of every possible course. Faculty members who use the  library frequently are more often aware of its shortcomings than those who do not use it frequently. Students who use the library most often tend to be full-time freshmen. In general, faculty and students alike indicated positive attitudes toward library service, facilities, and holdings. Faculty members requested more depth and variety in the collection; they must recognize their responsibility to recommend appropriate materials for purchase. (DC)",

J., asking for information on structure, current practices, and finance. It was concluded that the practice of awarding experiential learning credit is most often housed in the office of the Dean of Instruction with the faculty making most of the evaluating decisions based on  documentation, interviews, letters of testimony, job descriptions, and examinations. The criteria against which to measure a person's experiential learning were competencies, courses, and general background of individuals in a wide range of curricula. The maximum credits that could be awarded showed no specific pattern and ranged from three to no limit. Most institutions received neither state nor local funds for this process and 46 percent charged no fees to students. Of those institutions charging fees, most felt that they were equitable.

They believed futuristics to be an important curriculum topic, felt their study had favorably affected their own thinking and planning for the future, and felt more responsible for the future of society. In-class  observations showed that instructors were creative in melding instructional strategies to the requirements of the topic. To determine the integration of program materials with the general field of futuristics and global perspectives, students were asked to list which of the Articles of the U. N.

Few needs assessment studies are similar in terms of the subject matter assessed or the techniques of data gathering. For the purposes of this paper, the multitude of needs assessment studies are grouped into five categories: (1) goals setting and long-range planning; (2) student characteristics and follow-up studies; (3) occupational needs assessment; (4) facilities design and educational innovation; and (5) curriculum evaluation and resource allocation. Conclusions indicate that much of the assessment of educational programs has been based on qualitative rather than quantitative  instruments of evaluation. Evaluation is often a means of placating a funding agency rather than a vital instrument of policy determination and curriculum planning. However, community needs assessment is an inevitable process that will become an integral part in educational planning--indeed, in all areas of socioeconomic planning.

The Professional Development Facilitator (PDF) is the  most active agent in planning, implementing, and evaluating staff development activities. The PDF holds a staff, not line, position and reports directly to the President while serving in a resource relationship to the entire college staff. Graduate schools must develop better pre-service programs, programs for experienced community college faculty and administrators, and special programs for the preparation of future facilitators of staff development for the college campuses.

        "description":"Mattatuck Community College implemented non-punitive grading practices into its grading system in the Fall 1973 semester. These practices centered about the elimination of plus and minus grades, elimination of the grade of F, and liberalizing the course withdrawal policy to allow for withdrawal without penalty throughout the semester. A comparison was made of a sample of fity students who attended under the older traditional grading practices and a sample of fifty students who attended under the new non-punitive practices. The hypothesis of the study dealt with the grade point averages, persistence in college rate, and proportion of penalty and withdrawal grades to non-penalty grades. Findings indicate that the changes in grading practices had no significant effect on grade point  averages or the proportion of penalty and withdrawal grades to non-penalty grades. A significant difference was found in the persistence in college rate of the two samples, the non-punitive grading system adversely affecting student registration for the second term. A threat to the internal validity of the study based on historical circumstances (end of Viet Nam war, end of draft, and state of the economy), is noted as a possible influence on this finding.

In December 1974, the Institutional Goals Inventory (IGI) was sent to 335 faculty members; 208 (62 percent) responded. College Council members and the President were also surveyed. The IGI lists 90 statements of possible institutional goals and requests two responses to each statement--an &quot;Is&quot; response and a &quot;Should Be&quot; response. Both Outcome Goals and Process Goals, select factors which may influence the realization of the Outcome Goals, are considered. The faculty perceived only two Outcome Goals (Vocational Preparation and Academic Development) and one Process Goal  (Accountability/Efficiency) as being currently afforded slightly greater than medium importance. All other goal areas were perceived as being currently afforded only medium or less than medium importance. Each &quot;Should Be&quot; score was higher than its corresponding &quot;Is&quot; score; however, the &quot;Is&quot; and &quot;Should Be&quot; profiles were generally similar, suggesting perceived and desired priority structures which do not differ radically. On the basis of survey results, a goal priority structure is recommended. (DC)",

The sample consisted of 15 from the administration, 14 from the Division of Student Affairs, and 65 from the six academic divisions. Compared with the IFI normative group, the academic faculty in the Alfred State College sample scored their institution higher on the Democratic Governance, Concern for Innovation, Meeting Local Needs, and Institutional Esprit scales; slightly lower on the Undergraduate Learning,  Self-Study and Planning, Human Diversity, and Freedom scales; and notably lower on the Intellectual-Aesthetic Extracurriculum, Concern for Improvement of Society, and Concern for Advancing Knowledge scales. Despite some noteworthy differences, interinstitutional comparison showed the profiles for administration, student affairs, and academic faculty to be similar. The profiles for each of the six academic divisions were also similar. Some differences within the academic faculty were noted based on age, years of service, and rank. (DC)",

        "description":"The impact of decreasing enrollments is being felt by many postsecondary institutions. Some institutions have been forced to close as a result of their failure to recognize the problem and their consequent entrapment in a vicious spiral: decreasing enrollments bring about reduced revenues; declining income results in personnel and program cutbacks; economy measures cause the institution to be less attractive to students, which in turn results in additional enrollment reductions. Effective methods of enrollment analysis and planning must be developed if an institution is to avoid entrapment in the downward spiral. A case study of Johnson County Community College's computerized planning model describes a method of projecting realistic future enrollments. Output from the demographic  model consists of population projections of males and females by age group for each geographic area in the county; a county forecast for all areas may have as many as 200,000 individual projections. The demographic planning model is described in detail, and alternative uses in community planning are noted. Selected applications of the system are suggested in the text. A hypothetical county is created, and a complete demographic analysis of future population and enrollment trends is provided as a means of demonstrating the system. (AH)",

The remaining graduates divided themselves among various combinations of employment, student, military, and housewife duties.

Disappointed by the absence of radical approaches to community psychology, he traces his personal search for a new definition of the role, beyond uplifting rhetoric and depressing reality. Acting on the idea that the place for psychology was in solving concrete and immediate problems, he became involved in the real lives of people by observing and listening. He began to use his psychological expertise in consultation, training, and research roles, and this evolved into the notion of the community psychologist as a resource broker whose function was to \"give  psychology away\" by linking his bank of resources to a community which cared to use them. The community psychologist, in this sense, may work in a variety of communities or organizations, contributing problem-solving skills from the perspective of the \"individual in social context.\" (Author/PC)",

The authors examined in detail the existing prosecution system in the Boston Juvenile Court and surveyed procedures in a number of other cities. The findings show a wide disparity in practice and in the quality of justice dispensed. For example, in the Boston sample the arresting officer alone is responsible for presenting evidence. Equipped with only such legal training as his law enforcement career may have provided him, he frequently must confront either a public defender or private attorney. In such cases, the report suggests, the odds would appear to be weighted against the law enforcement interests of the community. To develop a judicial framework which serves both the rights of the accused  juvenile and the safety of the community, the study recommends that juvenile courts adopt a modified version of the prosecutor-defender structure which now serves the adult criminal justice system. This report includes guidelines for such a juvenile prosecution system. (Author/PC)",

The examination was based on the perceptions of counselors, parents, students, and others as measured through interviews and questionnaires. The overall finding was that guidance counseling, as currently performed, is substantially ineffective. Specific findings included the fact that two out of every five parents surveyed felt that guidance counselors had little effect on their children's development. Counselors did not appear to exercise a marked influence on student decisions with respect to choice of  occupation or postsecondary education. The range of functions normally assigned to guidance departments was found to dilute the resources available for counseling and was wasteful of professional skills. The role and functions of guidance counselors were not clear, and nearly one of four counselors surveyed was unsure as to whether or not counselors themselves understood their roles. Specific recommendations are offered to district and state level boards and departments in an effort to re-establish the importance of guidance counseling services to education. (Author/PC)",

It is the goal of the counselor to help such students, cognitively and psychologically, to meet such challenges. The author discusses the social, cultural, and intellectual gaps which exist and cause problems between professors and counselors and the environmentally handicapped students. The couselors need to help these  students identify goals, make decisions based on those goals, and evaluate realistically the options of movement available to them.

He prefaces his discription of the model by indicating that not all clients, problems or counselors are amenable to this short-term approach. There are three steps or elements in the delivery model: 1) exposition and diagnosis; 2) contracting and implementation; and 3) evaluation and termination. Intake interviews are not utilized with this model; the client engages in the actual counseling process during his first visit. During this initial, and often lengthy, session there is an attempt to arrive at the fullest possible exposition and diagnosis of the client's concern. The model is basically a problem-solving paradigm and the emphasis is  on setting some appropriate goals and contracting for the papameters of the counseling relationship. Time between sessions is utilized by carrying out specific tasks, similar to \"approximating behaviors.\" The third and last phase of the delivery model involves making a joint evaluation of the contractual outcomes and arriving at termination.

It describes the relationship of selected aspects of family background, infant health status, and early developmental history to the intellectual development and maturity of noninstitutionalized children 6-11 years of age in the United States, based on findings from the Health Examination Survey of 1963-65. The strong direct association between both the intellectual development and intellectual maturity of these children and the educational attainment of their parents found in this study were consistent with previous findings. Other significant findings were: (1) lower deviation IQ's for children whose mothers were under 20 and over 40 years; (2) negative  relationship of family size to intelligence of children; (3) lower mean levels of both measured intellectual development and intellectual maturity among children below and above normal birthweight (5-10 pounds); (4) strong association between delayed walking and speaking, and the intellectual development and maturity of United States children. Statistical analyses and an extensive reference list are appended. (Author/PC)",

Eight groups were conducted for clients served by a community mental health center on an out-patient basis, and four groups were composed of extremely maladjusted in-patient clients at a state hospital. The Group Interaction Profile, an instrument which yeilds ratings of each member's verbalizations, was used as the dependent measure. As expected, the results demonstrated that all of the groups engaged in significantly more low than high risk self-disclosure. However, groups of institutionalized subjects emitted a greater proportion of high risk self-disclosure verbalizations than groups of non-institutionalized subjects.

The husband-wife helping process is envisioned as a moderator of the relationship between the experiencing of pressures and strains in life and work situations and reports of personal satisfaction and well-being. Questionnaires were sent to 189 married husband-wife pairs. Some of the findings indicated that wives generally set the stage for the discussion, alleviation and resolution of anxieties and tensions arising for either partner. Couples who were older and married longer revealed a diminished level of mutual helping activity, a decrease in communication about problems and tensions, and greater criticism of each other's functioning as a helper.  The introduction of children into the family appeared to offer diminishing returns to the husband-wife helping relationship emerged as a very significant factor influencing the quality of life of the marital partners.

The pamphlet is designed for educators, community groups, drug abuse professionals, treatment personnel, parents and young people. According to those who espouse the alternatives approach, motives for drug-taking inevitably include the need to escape from boredom, alienation, pain, frustration, and meaninglessness. Alternatives to drug abuse are defined to include those constructive and viable attitudes, values, orientations, experiences, lifestyles, opportunities, activities, pursuits, and programs which can prevent or diminish significant drug abuse by providing greater satisfactions than drugs. Levels of experience, i.e. physical, sensory, emotional, and examples of  alternatives to drugs are presented in table form. Techniques of generating and implementing such programs are discussed, as well as suggestions for evaluation and further research. (Author/PC)",

What is missing in the cooperation-competition literature is a clear explanation of why the two techniques should result in differential levels of student motivation. Expectancy theory is used to suggest two cognitive mediating variables (perceived probability of success and value of success) likely to be influenced by altering the cooperation-competition dimension. An instructional approach (TGT) which alters cooperation-competition is described, using expectancy theory as a rationale for predicting differential impacts on student performance. A series of six empirical studies of TGT are reviewed. The overall evidence  supports the use of TGT as an instructional device and the relevance of expectancy theory to the cooperation-competition literature. (Author)",

It was expected that the older subjects would recall less material than younger adults as a result of poorer organization in long-term memory storage. The learning material consisted of 25 related fictional \"historical\" sentences which could be organized into three conceptual types, five countries, five decades, and five topics. The results of the study indicated apparent age differences in storage ability and large differences in retrieval cue retention and recall; however, it was not possible for the authors to distinguish clearly between storage and retrieval processes, a distinction difficult to make on the theoretical level as well. They summarized that the elderly,  who stored less material, could not be expected to recall associations between cues and events on sentences that were not formed in storage. (Author/PC)",

The setting dimension specifies whether the research will be done in the lab or in the field. The output dimension specifies the form which the data will take, relying on the definition of the &quot;unit&quot; of behavior. The content of interaction involves whether the cognitive-verbal or emotional or motoric levels of social interaction are observed, or some combination of these levels. The scope of observation ranges from great detail in description to enlarged interpretations of social interaction. A new scoring system known as SYMLOG (Bales and Cohen, 1973) is described and discussed as an  integration of many levels of the content and scope dimensions. It is urged that research on social interaction be guided by the needs of solutions for social problems. (Author)",

According to the authors, the non-verbal response of &quot;amount of time talked&quot; proves to be the most fruitful aspect of self-disclosure because it offers a additional advantages to studying the interpersonal process. Time spent talking can be easily measured  with a pocket stop-watch. Subjects are not aware that the length of their disclosures is being taped; hence, it is impossible for them deliberately to distort their responses. The authors attest to the measure's sensitivity and usefulness as witnessed by the stability of findings across studies. (Author/PC)",

Over the past ten years, Congress has passed several anti-discrimination measures, the President has issued Executive Orders, and several Federal agencies have promulgated regulations--all of which prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex. This publication is intended to inform individuals of their rights under the law, to explain the provisions of anti-sex discrimination measures, and to describe the practical steps which may be followed by individuals to insure protection of their rights. This booklet explains current Federal laws which prohibit sex discrimination, as well as policies and regulations of Federal agencies prohibiting sex  discrimination. The booklet describes the major provisions of each law and regulation, and the complaint procedures established under each. Some sections are more extensive than others, depending on the degree of specificity and detail of each agency's procedures. (Author)",

People in organizations are now asking how occupational role demands and technological developments affect employee health. This study examined the effects of an impending shutdown of the computer center at a major university on the user's anxiety and pulse rate levels. The effects of stress on strain were hypothesized to be accentuated for the hard-driving, Type A, \"coronary\" personality. Examination of the mean levels of strain during the impending shutdown showed that the levels of anxiety-tension and pulse rate were significantly higher during the shutdown period. The differences in stress and strain supported the  contention that the period of the impending shutdown was a trying one, and that it did have an effect on the well-being of the computer systems' users. The report summarizes analyses of the actual relationships between the changes in perceived stresses and changes in affective and physiological state. (Author/PC)",

Research studies that indicate a parallel development using Sylvia Ashton-Warner's idea of key vocabulary of children are briefly discussed. The author agrees that three studies do not completely prove a hypothesis, however they tend to support the proposition that the concept of children and their key words has its origins in the comparable quality of conservation as explored by Piaget. The author indicates that if Piaget is right in that children move through sensorimotor, preoperational stages--differing in ages but not in sequence--to that concrete operational stage of thorough understanding, then a similar kind of development must take place as children  proceed through the years to the operation of learning to read and write.

In this program, the prospective teacher's entry into the reading education curriculum is effected with a computer-administered assessment device which gathers information about the student's past experiences to determine the student's needs for further information about reading, reading instruction, and reading-related disciplines. Another part of the assessment device consists of competency based questions about the various fields of information, knowledge of which is strongly recommended for  skilled reading teaching. This information is used to generate a program of instruction for the student through the use of competency based units. The thrust of the project is to more efficiently utilize faculty talents and student time in the preparation of competent reading teachers. Continued assessment of the system is planned to facilitate modification as indicated by graduates of the system. (WR)",

The second discusses a problem that originated in difficulties encountered in the first separation-individuation period even though the precipitating symptomatology was not evidenced until adolescence.

It is argued that models of memory which involve the retrieval of stored copies of originally presented material cannot account for two crucial phenomena: (1) the retention of meaning in spite of losses in memory for specific wording, and (2) the &quot;recall&quot; of information which could only have been obtained by inference. Views of memory which include varying degrees of constructive, interpretive, and reconstructive processes are considered as alternatives to the copy model. These alternatives include theories based on psycholinguistic constructs and visual imagery, as well as positions  involving the abstraction and reconstruction of information by means of more general integrative representations.

Yet, little research has been addressed toward understanding how beginning readers extract meaning from the printed word. This paper reports two experiments that measured latencies in a picture-word interference task to assess semantic processing. Results suggest that picture-word interference was partly semantically based and that children and adults experienced an equivalent amount of semantic interference. The results are interpreted as indicating that even by the second grade children are sensitive to the meaning of printed words. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper deals with the question of academic motivation. It argues that perseverance at learning is not a function simply of inheritance, early socialization, or current cultural conditions, but rather an interaction of these factors with key aspects of the educational environment. Two distinct conceptions of motivation are outlined: motivation in a selective model of education and motivation in an adaptive model. In the main body of the paper four factors are proposed to account for perseverance at learning: aspiration, expectations, external rewards, and intrinsic reinforcement. Each of these is described, and their function in the design of educational programs for children and functionally illiterate adults is discussed. Reading is used as the example in these discussions.  In the final section, the problem of motivating teachers to adopt new educational practices is analyzed in terms of the above mentioned factors. This paper will be of interest to teachers, school supervisors, educational researchers and curriculum designers, and others interested in the psychology of instruction. (Author)",

The findings indicated that requiring a course in children's literature before classes in methods of teaching reading increased the knowledge of selected reading concepts.

Each day the student spends approximately 20 minutes in the Talking Typewriter booth and 20 minutes in the study area.

Five fourth and fifth grade students having a reading score indicating achievement within one year below grade level participated in the study for six weeks. Subjects spent one hour per school day learning how to monitor their reading behavior by using four informal diagnostic techniques: Veath's rule of thumb, the Informal Reading Inventory, the Cloze technique, and the cassette recorder as a means of applying the synthesized concepts of the other techniques. By compiling a list of the questions used by the subjects in the order that they mastered them and by noting the week in the study and the percent of mastery, it was concluded that students can learn to monitor  and evaluate their reading performance and that this can encourage the development of their syntactic and semantic systems expressed through their language.

Numerous recommendations on how to deal with the situation in the schools and in children's reading materials are offered and include the following: complaining to publishers, principals, school  boards, and so on; using outside materials more extensively in the classroom; revising teacher's manuals for existing texts; playing role-reversal games; and having children compare their images of the ideal woman to their images of the ideal man.

The method reported focused on training the student to use minimal visual information while making maximum use of contextual cues in word recognition. The emphasis was on directing attention away from decoding toward extracting meaning from the passage. The 32 poorest readers in the regular second grade reading program in a middle class suburban elementary school were selected as subjects. A 2x2x2 factorial design was used with the subjects who were randomly assigned to one of eight groups. The first experimental factor consisted of the use of hypothesis test training in which the subjects are trained to use context as an  aid in high speed decoding. The second experimental factor consisted of repeated reading training which gave the subject practice in using reading as a wholistic process. The third factor consisted of isolated word recognition in which the subject was given extensive practice in recognizing words flashed with a projector. It was concluded that hypothesis test training and repeated reading training led to improvement in reading skill and perhaps a combination of the two is efficacious, but that isolated word training is not effective.

(1) The two-year experience indicated that tutoring does help children to an important degree. (2) There is nothing to indicate an association between school achievement and self-esteem. However, an improvement  in self-esteem will occur with personal attention from someone the child perceives to be important (i.e., a tutor or teacher). (3) Upswing found no support for the common belief that visual-motor skills are important in the development of reading skills.

        "description":"Project Upswing was a two-year tutoring experiment directed by universities in Denver, Oxford (Mississippi), St. Louis, and San Francisco and involving first graders identified by their teachers at the beginning of the school year as capable of normal achievement but having learning difficulties. Half of the students served as a control group and half were tutored twice a week, one hour each session, by adult volunteers. The project was evaluated for impact of tutoring on children's development of reading skills, visual-motor integration skills, and self-esteem and for effectiveness of tutor training. Analysis indicated that tutoring was effective in helping students improve their rates of progress in reading and their self-esteem but that tutoring had no significant effect on  visual-motor integration skill. As a byproduct of the evaluation, the data suggested that grade retention had negative effects. The mean reading score at the end of the year for both retained and promoted children was in the average range. But at the end of the second year, the reading score for those children who repeated first grade dropped significantly into the low-average range; the promoted children maintained their previous level.

A major goal is to determine whether children receiving this personalized assistance make more progress than a control group who have similar problems but receive no volunteer aid. Another comparison is between children tutored by volunteers who have received no special training and volunteers with extensive training. Children nominated by their teachers as possibly demonstrating minimal learning difficulties in reading were screened for the program in Denver, St. Louis, Oxford (Mississippi), and San Francisco. Each city identified 150  children for the project. These children were divided into three groups, with approximately 50 children in each group. One group was assigned to trained volunteers, one to untrained volunteers, and one was a control group. Short questionnaires were sent to parents, teachers, and volunteers about two months after the project began. Final questionnaires will be sent near the end of the school year. The questionnaire is designed to obtain views on both preservice and inservice training, as well as the children's progress during their Upswing experience. (WR)",

The subject were 87 students from a freshman class who had graduated in the bottom 60th percent of their high school class. The students were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) a noncredit student-directed skills class, (2) a noncredit teacher-directed skills class, and (3) a control group receiving no training in reading study skills. There were two sections of each teaching approach, both sections taught by the investigator. Fifty-minute classes were held twice a week for 15 weeks. Students in both the  experimental and control groups carried between 12 and 15 academic credit hours. An examination of the resultant tables shows that if alternative instructional treatments are provided for students with different characteristics, a greater proportion of students required to enroll in Suffolk University's College Reading-Study Skills program should make scholastic improvement.

Agreement among raters was poor at the start of the rating, but improved dramatically with practice.

Specifically, the investigation evaluated the use of reading guides prepared to aid students in the recognition of patterns of organization in text materials and in making interpretations about their readings. A sample of students heterogeneously grouped according to classes was used to investigate the reading strategy. Part 1, conducted over one month's time, pitted direct, skills-centered instruction in reading class against a strategy of functional reading in social studies. Part 2, conducted over six month's time, evaluated the extent to which  the same strategy facilitated students' acquisition of content, social studies achievement, and general reading achievement. It was concluded that through prepared guide materials, functional instruction in the reading of textbook selections can be valuable in a social studies class.

Both the Afro-American oral tradition and the art of gesture are integral aspects of black theatre. In addition, the tragedy found black theatre is not tragedy in the classic sense, as blacks feel no commitment to an unchanging system from which they have been excluded. Thus there is a harshness evident in black plays as well as a comic-tragic mask. Six plays in particular serve as examples of similarity of deprivation, innovation of styles, and tragic harshness. These are Gordone's \"No Place to Be Somebody,\" Le Roi Jones' (Immaru Baraka's) \"Dutchman,\" Lorraine Hansberry's \"Raisin in the Sun,\" Ed. Bullin's \"In the Wine Time,\"  Charles Russell's \"Five on the Black Hand Side,\" and Lonnie Elder's \"Ceremonies in Dark Old Men.\" (JM)",

One focuses on the manifest, first level of meaning, while the other concentrates on the latent, more complex elements which are implied rather than overtly expressed. The purpose of this study was to apply content analysis to an examination of language produced in various settings in several different colleges. A two-step procedure was employed to collect data: available written and oral records were used to develop categories of recurring concern; and data summaries were used to reveal parallel or contrasting language trends. It was concluded that (1) there appears to be a vocabulary employed in separate meetings different from that used in joint meetings, although the  speakers are the same; (2) there is no particular collegiate pattern for restricting or sharing information in interviews not already revealed at joint meetings or in formal writing; and (3) complex metaphors and imagery are used to gain a more complete understanding of the institutional functioning depicted.

        "description":"A study by Brown and Fraser (1963) shows that children tend to use telegraphic speech, employing content and omitting function words. This limitation involves the grammatical or semantic complexity of the sentences. Braine (1963) attempted to formulate productive rules for the initial stages in the acquisition of syntax by identifying two classes of words: pivots and X-words. Schlesinger (1971) describes semantic structure as beginning with the speaker's intention to express something. This intention is preverbal, composed of conceptions and relations rather than morphemes or words. O'Donnell (1974) approaches child grammar through an adult grammar capable of describing both semantic and syntactic structure. Incorporating the ideas drawn from previous studies, he believes the  differences between child and adult language can be accounted for by both the cognitive differences and the lack of development of the expressive component. It is concluded that recognition of the fundamental importance of role in descriptions of semantic structures can make possible further movement toward a satisfactory grammar of child language.

        "description":"There are many myths about young children based on the definition of creativity as an innate capacity for openness to experience. This definition of creativity as a personality trait or attitude (creativity as expressiveness) has little relationship to creativity as the making of original and socially valuable products. Studies of children's art show the young child unable to transform raw materials from expressive gesture into final product. Children instinctively conceptualize and abstract but do not work with conscious purpose and intent, which is a mark of true creativity. The reported drop in creativity at age eight or nine is actually just a change in the quality of expressiveness; feeling becomes subservient to manipulation of form, to articulation of realistic detail, to  concepts of appropriate match. A longitudinal study of 27 children from grade one through grade six found that creativity becomes more crystallized with age so that after age ten there is reasonable stability in the expression of it.

Items 9 through 16 required pairing a noun with another noun, items 17 and 18 allowed pairing of a verb, and items 19 and 20 allowed pairing of an adjective with another adjective. the instrument was administered to 87 ninth graders. The results indicated that words of the same syntactic category tend to be paired on word associations tasks and that the strongest ties are between words of the  subcategory. The results of administering the instrument suggest that Words in Pairs is easy to administer and score; however, both the number of items were inadequate.

To contrast these views, subjects were given sentences varying in voice, mood, and modality and asked to transform them to various syntactic patterns. Their response latencies were not clearly related to either grammatical or performance model expectations. Error frequencies, however, were related only to the performance model which assumed that subjects transform stimulus sentences directly into response patterns without using a kernel form as an intermediate, linking step. The use of formal grammatical models as if they reflected psychological  processes is seen as being of questionable value. (Author)",

An analysis of past court cases involving obscenity in the arts (i.e., &quot;The Scarlet Letter,&quot;&quot;Ulysses,&quot; etc.) illustrates the problems and dangers of such trials which have resulted in mass book burnings and seizures. The language of the ruling is inexcusably vague: what are the criteria for determining the meanings of words such as &quot;community&quot; and &quot;prurient?&quot; In addition, since all of the decisions rendered by the Supreme Court on obscenity have been arrived at by males, these  decisions wrongly assume that what is of prurient interest to men can be applied to women. There are clear indications that an assault on intellectual freedom will accompany the search for the obscene. (TS)",

A survey taken in 1973 showed there were over 400 therapists treating 3,500 drug addicts, alcoholics, and mental retardates around the country. Poetry therapists discourage their pupils from overconcern with stylistics which engender a sense of artificial double think; they make great use of the fact that we are symbolic beings, capable of emotionally understanding far more than words alone can communicate. At present, there are four ways to run a therapy session: (1) provide group members with varied poetry selections to read and respond to, (2) provide members with poems of a similar mood or topic, (3)  have members write poetry round robin style, and (4) have members write and react to each other's work of original poetry written during the session. Poetry therapy can also be used in the English program classroom as a way to reach disadvantaged students, as a means of promoting a better communication between upper grade students and lower grade students, as an extracurricular activity, and as an extremely humanistic method of getting into the study of poetry.

It was concerned both with the effect of programed articulation therapy on Spanish-speaking subjects and with the role that distinctive features play on the phonological rules that affect articulation of three English phonemes. Fourteen adult Spanish-speaking subjects were involved and each demonstrated a functional misarticulation. Programed therapy proved to be a sufficient technique for improving misarticulation for two of the three phonemes. A comparison between the Spanish distinctive features and the English distinctive features proved that Spanish subjects substituted known Spanish distinctive features for unknown English distinctive features, thus explaining several misarticulations. These results are important to the therapist, for they  point to an efficient therapy program and show that by looking at the underlying rules it is possible to gain a broader and more complete picture of what creates the misarticulations in each of the Spanish-speaking adults.

As a means of understanding the contemporary study of ethnicity among scholars, nine popular sociological and communication journals were searched for articles dealing with ethnic and minority matters for the past six years. Data are presented as generated from a study of the role of interpersonal communication in the socialization of the child into the ethnic group of the parent. The importance of dealing with conceptual problems in the study of ethnic and minority groups is  examined through the use of the above methods. It is suggested that problems typically encountered in the selection of subjects and the operationalization of ethnic group identification can be avoided through adequate conceptualization of the basic phenomena under study. The study also attempts to illustrate the contemporary social map. (Author/RB)",

The theoretical assumptions which prompted design of the methodology view dramatic and fictional works as self-contained operative systems with various subsystems.

Curricular implications of the interdisciplinary approach to literary criticism which drew from the areas of systems science, information science, and behavioral science receive  comment.

Recent research indicates that students taught from the creative model require the same degree of facility in writing skills as those students taught by the traditional method. Furthermore, students in classrooms where creativity is the basis of writing have a more positive attitude toward their teachers and toward writing than do students nurtured in the traditional method. This paper outlines a sequence of readings designed to aid the teacher or department chairperson who is interested in implementing the creative model in a classroom or department. A brief annotation is given for each of the several books listed under 10 headings: (1)  Raising Questions, (2) Creativity Considered, (3) The Case for Creativity, (4) Creativity in Secondary English, (5) The Curriculum, (6) A Theory of Discourse, (7) The Open Classroom, (8) Creative Resources, (9) Practical Advice, and (10) Curriculum Guides.

Using the results of a diagnostic test (with grammar, sentence-combining, and essay sections), the instructor outlines the student's course of study as sentence, paragraph, and essay objectives. This outline serves as the student's personal course syllabus and contract. Upon completion of the contract and demonstration of competence in each of the objective areas, the student is finished  with the course.

Subjects were prelingually or congenitally deaf high school students from the California School for the Deaf and a control group of normal-hearing fourth graders from a California public school. Seven subjects were children of deaf parents and eight were children of hearing parents. The test consisted of 50 deaf English sentences produced by deaf teenagers and 50 standard English sentences which were equivalent in meaning to the deaf English sentences. Sentences were presented on a cathode-ray tube to each subject individually. When the sentence disappeared from the screen, the subjects were required to write it on an answer sheet  as they remembered it. By analyzing the results of this test, it was concluded that there appears to be a variety of nonstandard English that deaf students use instead of standard English and that the deaf have learned many obligatory standard English grammatical and morphological rules, but they apply them optionally. The appendix lists all test items used in the study, and a bibliography is supplied. (TS)",

The experimental group followed a two-week schedule which included the introduction and use of the four marking skills (circle around, X on, line under, and line from object to object). During the work period, several children at a time listened to and followed the directions of that day's lesson, which was prerecorded on tape and lasted approximately seven  minutes. Analysis of data showed that in the pretest 40.29 percent of the experimental group children and 42.85 percent of the control group children had achieved 100 percent accuracy.

The third section finalizes the speaker's definition of revolution: the antithesis of death, the counterpart of life.

It contends that thinking may be an integral part of the selection and experience of stimuli as well as of creating new expressions. No assumption is made about the existence or nonexistence of awareness, although awareness is not excluded from operating as a special set of cognitive rules. The model, inspired by Cushman and Whiting's 1971 San Francisco convention paper, (1) clarifies several lexical and conceptual questions, (2) provides a method for comparing other models and research findings, (3) helps in efforts to comprehend subjective experiencing, and (4) dissolves the  boundary between cognition and communication.

One case approach that an affirmative team may adopt is the utilities or no-needs need case in which they argue for the elimination of the status quo because it is unnecessary or restrictive or both. This paper examines: (1) the four standard requirements of a prima facie case dealing with propositions of policy (i.e., presumption, evils, inherency, and solution); (2) some of the problems which may accompany the utilities case; and (3) the validity of the utilities case within the parameters established. The conclusion drawn from a discussion of these issues is that the utilities case does offer a valid approach for a resolution of discontinuance or a resolution of  reduction, but two problems must be weighted by the affirmative team before adopting this approach: if the negative team can indicate some degree of disadvantage, the affirmative case for limited gain may be more easily defeated; and the affirmative team runs a risk with the judges who may not accept the theoretical validity of the utilities case.

The subjects for this study were 132 public middle school and 180 high school students in a predominantly rural area. The students were asked a number of questions about their own financial resources and the sources of these funds. Neither group of adolescents scored very high on price accuracy, slogan  recall, or intrafamily communication about consumption, although brand specification was fairly high and the various dependent measures were well integrated among both groups. The relatively low level of consumer skills may indicate that the adolescent is not provided with learning opportunities and appropriate modeling experiences from parents, teachers, and other socialization agents.

The method and procedure of the study involved four steps: (1) using a modification of the Potter Interpersonal Trust Test to establish target-person demands, (2) preparing specific questions to determine the direction of the interview, (3) obtaining a standard norm by using the control cell, and (4) developing the experimental cells by alternating the subject-interviewer situation (i.e., No Touch-No Talk,  Touch-No Talk, No Touch-Talk, Touch-Talk) and then recording the results on a table. The results indicate that the significant difference occurs most frequently in comparisons made with both touch and talk. The table shows that as the variables of touch and talk were incorporated, and the more the interviewer participated, the more trust the subjects developed toward the interviewer. (TS)",

If they do differ, what effect do these differences have on receiver's attitude toward the object of that network coverage? Phase 1 of the study examined the speeches of Ted Kennedy and George McGovern at the 1972 Democratic National Convention as broadcast by CBS, NBC, and ABC. The video portions of the speeches were analyzed along four variables which had been previously found to affect receiver judgments: length of shot, image size, camera angle, and severity of camera angle. The differences found in camera treatment resulted in the hypothesis that different camera treatments would result in differential attitudes  of receivers toward a televised political source. Phase 2 utilized 12 semantic differential scales for measuring four dimensions of source credibility. These were administered to approximately 240 college students enrolled in sections of an introductory communication course. Only one significant difference was found: Kennedy's extroversion was significantly lower for subjects who viewed the speech on CBS than for those who watched the same speech on NBC. Character and competence dimensions both collapsed. (HOD)",

Since the effect image size has on receiver behavior is important, television production texts perpetually include discussions of camera shots and refer to close-ups as providing the most information. Yet none of the surveyed research has systematically controlled and examined the effect of camera shots on other communication variables. This study was concerned with the effect of differing camera shots on interpersonal attraction. Two professional comedians, used as stimulus objects, performed two comedy routines, each approximately three minutes in length. The two routines were videotaped. Cameras were placed side by side taking long, medium, and close-up shots of the two comedians. A 30-item, 7-interval likert  type measurement instrument was constructed for the properties of attraction. Factor analysis of the items resulted in a three-factor solution of attraction: task, physical, social. Resulting data gave strong evidence that interpersonal attraction for television performers is a multidimensional construct, with the dimensions operating independently. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In order to examine the effects of manipulating image size (i.e., relative size) and body type of speakers in a television context on source credibility and interpersonal attraction, a study was conducted at Illinois State University during the spring of 1973. Subjects were eighteen intact groups of students enrolled in speech communication class 110, with groups randomly assigned to the experimental conditions. Six individuals (three males and three females) representing three body types--endomorph, mesomorph, and ectomorph--each delivered a three-minute neutral message which was videotaped. One microphone was used, while cameras, placed side by side, took long, medium, and close-up shots. Subjects viewed these speeches and marked their responses on on-scan computer sheets.  Results showed that ectomorphs were perceived as more attractive than endomorphs in all dimensions of interpersonal attraction and in dynamism, competence, and composure dimensions of source credibility. The overall implication of image size and body type interaction appears to be that shots which emphasize favored body types should be used. A list of references and thirteen tables of findings and post hoc analyses are included. (JM)",

The course would be taught on a classroom-field experience basis, and the activities would include lectures, presentations, readings, films, special projects, and tests.

Based on Altman and Taylor's social penetration theory, it was predicted that interactants would display verbal patterns unique to the stage of their relationship and to the intimacy level of their conversation. Friends were found to orient toward two definitions of the situation and to emphasize five pentadic ratios significantly more often than strangers. Strangers relied more than friends on three other ratios. Low intimacy conversations differed from other intimacy levels on one aspect of the definition of the situation and six ratio categories. These findings  suggest that Burke's system offers viable categories for characterizing verbal patterns at the various stages of relationships. (Author)",

Obscenity can be classified in three general ways: religious profanity, excretory profanity, and sexual profanity (i.e., copulative terms, genitalia terms, and sexual irregularities). The purposes of obscenity are to create attention, discredit existing institutions and leadership, provoke response, identify and assert oneself, and provide catharsis. Three general principles determine the effects of these uses of obscenity: (1) who--the degree of shock is determined by the rhetorical agent (e.g., the longshoreman who is expected to use colorful language and the priest who is not); (2) where--the setting (e.g., the church or the locker  room); and (3) how--the tone of voice and the text in which the word is used. Verbal obscenity is a significant rhetorical device, and it is time to help discover appropriate responses to it. (TS)",

As a social prophet or seer, McLuhan was a major force during the 1960's; he helped us discover social and psychic targets in time to prepare to cope with them. By realizing and interpreting the effects of mass communication networks on social and sensory organization and thought, McLuhan also correctly fits into the role of culturologist. And even though many of his theories of mass communication are not capable of social-scientific testing, at least some of them are. Therefore, he can be seen as a communication theorist. Finally, one can view McLuhan as a rhetorical theorist. He begins from an ontological perspective, reconstitutes the  communication process from that point of view, and then returns to the world of things/events/persons, offering advice on message-generating and message-critiquing processes.

Growing first of all from a reaction against positivism and its theatrical counterpart, naturalism, the Theatre of the Grotesque was also an extension of the Crepuscular movement in poetry. Three syndromes which enter grotesque plays in various combinations are aptly expressed in the titles of three of the grotesques: for the marionette syndrome, Rosso di San Secondo's &quot;Oh Marionettes, What Passion!&quot;; for the mirror syndrome, Luigi Antonelli's &quot;The Man Who Met Himself&quot;; and for the multiple reality syndrome, Luigi Pirandello's &quot;Right You  Are (If You Think You Are).&quot; These Pirandellian syndromes have continued and have been enriched in the absurdist and existentialist drama which followed the Theatre of the Grotesque.

Language operates in the public sphere only so long as the symbols used by a speaker to denote his perceptions roughly correspond to the symbols the listener uses for his perceptions. The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein argued that the concept of private language is logically absurd. His argument, in brief, was that it is impossible for a person to maintain any series of symbols corresponding to his perceptions as there is no way for such a series to be accurately maintained. The Austrian playwright Peter Handke seems to believe and support this argument in his plays. An examination of five plays shows Handke exploring various situations which are  created by words in context, the central point being to expose to the audience the fact that plays are neither make-believe nor reenactments; they are events occurring only here now.

(2) Is there justification for using VTR in the whole school? (3) Can VTR be used with remedial groups? and (4) Are there proven methods of effective use of VTR in speech classrooms? The research done in these areas indicates that at least a partially affirmative answer can be given to all these questions. Results show that the video tape playback of students' communicative acts, which focuses on the audience and is accompanied by instructor and student discussion and criticism, can make a positive contribution toward increasing students' insights into the communicative process and focusing their attention on their  audience and the content of their messages.

The notion of communicative intention is contrasted with grammatical categories and with the goal of an utterance. Finally, communicative intentions and goals of utterances are contrasted with the innumerable pragmatic purposes which accompany speech. Together these functions, along with the grammatical components of the sentence, constitute the total speech act which is taken to be the fundamental unit of linguistic communication. The data reported suggest that various intentions gradually become \"grammaticalized\" or \"lexicalized\" in the course of language development. It is concluded that communicative intentions and other functional aspects of language play a  greater role in the organization and choice of utterances than has been supposed by grammatical theories of language development.

Since 1959, additional research has appeared which warrants an updating of Clevenger's synthesis. Such a followup synthesis is the purpose of this paper. It assumes familiarity with the first article. Measuring stage fright by observer rating scales has received considerable attention. A factor analysis of observed symptoms found three factors which are similar to each of the three measurement dimensions, suggesting more complex relationships among the three dimensions than previously assumed. Measurement by introspection has remained somewhat static during the decade, but assessing physiological disruption continues, largely based on assumptions of  reliability and validity. Surprising findings indicate possible inherent stage fright differences between men and women. It would seem that new research trends could lead to finding stage fright a much more individual and complex construct than was previously thought--one which interacts with personality syndromes in ways unique to relationships among the individual, the speaking environment, and the subject matter.

This analysis views actualizing individuals as possessing the unique ability to perceive and utilize the types of behaviors which are conducive to personalizing group interaction. A self-actualizing group member: (1) is perceptive of proper communicative behaviors and able to apply them, (2) is influential in a positive fashion over other group members as a result of his natural mannerisms, (3) has the capacity for identification with others' behaviors, and (4) construes extensive personal meaning to group functioning. It is further suggested that actualizing individuals both build higher levels of  interpersonal trust by engaging in supportive behaviors and effectively manage reciprocal exchanges, leading to an atmosphere conducive to frequent self-disclosures. Twenty-three plausible hypotheses are included as suggestions for further research as related to: (1) the self-actualizing group member, (2) interaction and group environment, and (3) exchange of self-disclosure as behavioral determinants within small groups.

This paper argues two points: that a concern for theory could redirect some of our typical approaches to rhetorical criticism; and that generic criticism must, by its nature, fully respond to this call for theory-building. Four important areas of rhetorical criticism are discussed: (1) what we choose to study in general, (2) what we choose to study in particular, (3) how we choose to study such things, and (4) what we might do with the results. The ways in which rhetorical genres or speech types are conceptualized and dealt with critically will profoundly affect the value of the resulting theory. Three approaches to rhetorical genres which are available are space-time setting, rhetorical purpose, and ideational  thrust. It is concluded that if the theory-based posture were used, it would be possible for rhetorical critics to describe suasive message extensively enough so that intelligent hypotheses would emerge, eventually lend themselves to experimental verification or rejection, and later to theoretical enlargement.

Dialectical enjoinment was restricted because: (1) the disputants remained mired in unresolved epistemological questions; (2) little attempt was made to create common ground between the two alternative philosophies which seemed equally appealing; (3) Darrow refused to clash directly with legal arguments but transcended them to  consider the constitutionality of the Tennessee statute; and (4) the artificial atmosphere created by the commercial interests of the religious controversy probably attracted attention to the Scopes trial but possibly undermined rational judgment.

Most important in organizational communication is the role of the \"liaison person\"--the coordinator of intercommunication.

Research shows that groups formed to be creative and innovative are more successful if they are not highly centralized and dominated. Therefore, by examining the degree of centralization in similar innovative groups and organizations, an assessment of their probable success can be made. Three sources of information are needed to resolve questions on the health or  adequacy of a particular communication system: expert opinion, normative data from a large sample of organizations, and accumulated research findings from studies conducted in actual organizational settings.

The pretest determined the attitude of the subjects on a number of attitude items. Two months later, the subjects were randomly assigned to a role playing condition and placed into dyads where an active participant argued a counterattitudinal position suggesting that all Japanese be required to learn English. Immediately following the treatment, a posttest was administered to measure the attitude change. Three conditions determined whether the methodology used was appropriate:  language problems, experimenter bias, and intercultural differences. By examining the possibilities of these conditions occuring, their effect was lessened, and the experimental research was strengthened.

In the delivery of a speech, a prime consideration is the impact it will have upon  the audience, so that a black speaker is sensitive to the situation and to the audience.

        "description":"In order to test the hypothesis that dogmatism is related to the understanding and appreciation of editorial satires, 116 University of Georgia speech students read and reacted to three editorial satires (two by Art Hoppe and one by Art Buchwald) arranged in booklets in three different orders. Students were asked to choose from a list of five statements following each satire the one which stated the thesis intended by the writer. Students also rated each satire on a semantic-differential type scale ranging from \"extremely funny\" to \"extremely unfunny.\" The last two pages of each booklet contained a short form dogmatism scale. Analysis of data showed that (1) ability to perceive correct theses of satires differing in subject matter seems to be related to low dogmatism, (2)  dogmatism might interact with the topic of a satire in determining ability to perceive satirical intent, and (3) appreciation--humor ratings--of satires seems to result from an interaction of dogmatism and satirical topic.

Subjects were 52 male college students who were divided into two groups: those who held favorable attitudes toward the speech topic were assigned the role of speakers, and those who responded negatively toward the topics were assigned the role of listeners. Experimental conditions were operationalized through three assigned tasks: (1) the speaker predicted the listener's role attitudes toward the speech which he would later deliver; (2) the speaker compared responses indicative of complete agreement for each attitude item with those of the listener; and (3) the speaker constructed the speech. It was concluded from the tables that role taking may be a significant  factor in persuasive communication. Further studies to identify variables that contribute to role playing activity are suggested. (TS)",

        "description":"This study was undertaken to provide a descriptive analysis of the rhetoric of physicians (1) as they communicate with their colleagues, and (2) as they communicate with their patients. To accomplish the first objective, the oral presentations made during weekly conferences by the surgeons at a major hospital were observed for ten months. The rhetorical training, experience, speech philosophy, and preparation of each physician was considered as well as the occasion of the speech and an analysis of the audience. Each speech was evaluated according to its invention, structure, style, and delivery. The second objective of the study was reached by means of observations, interviews, and questionnaires. It was concluded that patients are willing to accept a surgeon's title as  sufficient credentials to obey his directives without question. By the same reasoning, the surgeons themselves often seem to expect their colleagues to accept their judgment without asking for documentation. Most doctors will not disclose all possible information to the terminally ill or those scheduled for operations. The patients, however, report a desire for all details but, rather than asking questions, seem willing to wait for the surgeon to volunteer information. (Author/TS)",

The demand for accountability has made it necessary for the schools to engage in more formal methods of inservice training. In addition to being a means of keeping principals up-to-date and bailing them out of emergencies, inservice training can become a more radical force for changing the structure of the principalship. This paper presents the current range of opinion concerning the goals of inservice training, the skills necessary for effective leadership, the structure of training programs (including teaching methods and materials), and methods of designing, implementing, and coordinating inservice training programs.

Emphasis is placed on those findings, conclusions, and recommendations that deserve special consideration by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Office of Revenue Sharing, the U.S. Congress, and other individuals and organizations having responsibilities for or interests in the general revenue sharing (GRS) program. Major findings of the GRS study indicate that although the GRS program appears to be satisfying many of the goals envisioned by Congress, a higher level of equity of allocations can be achieved through the use of more  accurate and more current data in the computation of allocation amounts for the over 39,000 units of State and local government involved. Lack of currency in population and per capita income data is the major potential source of inequity. The year-to-year fluctuations in GRS allocations that recipient governments have so far experienced can be attributed mainly to the annual updating of adjusted taxes in the allocation formula.

Although such student outcomes may be disappointing, they do not accurately reflect the potential of innovative ideas because many innovations are not implemented according to plan. This interpretation of the problem stresses the complexity of the implementation process and locates the essence of the problem not in inadequacies of innovative plans but in the bureaucratic nature of the educational system itself. Therefore, improving educational results would require policies that promote change in the educational system and in the way it implements innovations. Without a systematic theory of planned change, however,  federal policy has few reliable guidelines. As a requisite to Rand's proposed research, therefore, this report first assesses the literature comprising program and policy studies and then critically examines the analytical literature on planned change in education to select and formulate major theoretical issues. It then suggests an approach for investigating these research concerns and proposes a conceptual model of factors affecting change processes in a local school district. (Author/WM)",

Retention ratios from grade to grade were analyzed for six prior years and the trend extended over the 19-year period from 1974-75 to 1992-93. Actual birth figures, population estimates, and projected New York State public school age-grade matrices were used to estimate future first grade enrollments. These first grade estimates together with retention ratios for each grade made possible projections for all grades beginning with actual enrollment figures for the base year, 1973-74. The high school graduate projection was determined from twelfth grade enrollment estimates. Projected enrollments in special classes for handicapped children are  based solely on the most recent ratios of enrollment in special classes to total enrollment. No attempt was made to estimate the effects of legislative action on such enrollments. Regional estimates of public school enrollment were obtained by apportioning the first grade estimates for the total State according to the historical trend of first grade enrollment in the various regions. Similar methods were used to project nonpublic school enrollment. Projections are presented in graphic and tabular form. (Author/DN)",

The committee was established by the California legislature for the purpose of developing a methodology for evaluating the cost effectiveness of various Federal and State educational projects. The report defines cost effectiveness as a management decision process that allows the decisionmaker to choose from among feasible alternatives on the basis of least costs and maximum program output as measured by student achievement. Five components were deemed to be essential to the development of a methodology for determining the cost effectiveness of educational programs: establishment of terminal objectives by grade for each program,  measurement of pupil achievement in relation to specified objectives, determination of student characteristics that affect learning, identification of costs, and development of a system for the documentation of all program elements. The experience of the committee has convinced its members that it is indeed possible to develop a methodology for the assessment of the cost effectiveness of educational programs. A bibliography is included at the end of the report. (Author/DN)",

First, measures of how well education has done in the past are reported, then education's performance is compared to that of other public functions, and, finally, an analysis of the values, economic conditions, and political alignments that were associated with these outcomes is presented. Using this information, the author attempts to look into the future of education. Major findings indicate that although education enjoyed remarkable growth from the early 1950s to the late 1960s it is now viewed by many as having declining national importance. This has been brought about by the decline in school enrollments and the growing public support for other public functions, the lack of  relationship between expenditures for education and student achievement, and the economic problems and the decline in real growth that now afflict the country. The author suggests that judicial rather than legislative actions will cause any increase in funding for education beyond that suggested by his political analysis. In the future, education's political strength will be least effective at the federal and local levels and most effective at the State level. (Author/DN)",

This paper aims to remedy this problem by illustrating how four major organizational typologies can be interpreted within a composite, four-fold, polythetic typology. The result of this theoretical scheme is the identification of four synthetic types of organizations (utilitarian, political, ideational, and solidary). This second stage typology -- a typology of typologies -- is further extended by using additional typologies drawn from the relevant organizational literature for defining salient characteristics of these four synthetic organizational types. The potential utilization of  the synthetic organizational types for interorganizational analysis is then outlined. (Author)",

Because of its proportional representation, the legally established negotiating council has not integrated the rival organizations into one voice. The AFT tendency to work outside the formal structure allows the CTA voice to speak for teachers. Power relations between school boards and the CTA have influenced the &quot;meet and confer&quot; requirement, resulting in local variations in its interpretation. Further trouble is created by a lack of impasse procedures in the law, which leads to direct confrontation and strikes. Because of power differences between teachers, administrators, and school boards, the Winton Act  assumption of professional orientation and unity of interest has not proven realistic and modification toward private sector bargaining may be forthcoming.

Processes and files are grouped and reorganized in such a way as to produce an optimal design with respect to a specific target machine. Performance criteria for the optimal design are defined in terms of transport volume savings and core memory requirements. Starting with a graph theoretic representation of the interaction between processes (or modules) and files, the methodology consists of two components: (1) a generator of feasible alternatives and (2) a procedure for reorganization and core generation for specific groupings. Not only can an optimal design for the processing system be generated; but due to reorganization techniques, the resultant  modules (defined from specific process groupings) may approach the computational efficiency expected of an integrated program.

A number of systems contain some of the components of GPLAN, and a survey of each system is presented with details of its contribution to GPLAN design. Research on two systems at Purdue is directly leading to the development of GPLAN. One application is concerned with the development of a regional water pollution control planning system; the other is an interactive information system design package. The authors suggest that GPLAN is as  much a major advance over a Generalized Data Management System (GDMS) as a GDMS is a major advance over application programs with formatted sequential files.

Testimony was delivered by representatives of the Department of Agriculture, officials of various State and city school food programs, and a representative of the Peanut Butter Manufacturers and Nut Salters Association.  Included in the report are prepared statements submitted by several of the witnesses, as well as by interested parties not present at the hearing. (JG)",

        "description":"Researchers have given little attention to theory on the measurement of interorganizational relations (IOR). The purpose of this paper is to analyze one factor influencing the development of such a theory. Eight items indicating low to high intensity IOR are postulated: (1) director awareness, (2) director acquaintance, (3) director interaction, (4) information exchange, (5) resource exchange, (6) overlapping membership, (7) joint programs, and (8) written agreements. The theoretical order of these items is tested empirically across four types of organizations distinguished by funding source: (1) voluntary, (2) public, (3) professional, and (4) interorganizational. Guttman analysis is used to test item orderings. The postulated theoretical order and the empirical orderings for  each type of organization are statistically significant. Three items--director awareness, director acquaintance, and written agreements--are in the same order in the theoretical and empirical orderings for all four organizational types. It is concluded that type of organization is a moderator variable. Analysis of the empirical orderings suggests the following revised general theoretical order: (1) director awareness, (2) director acquaintance, (3) information exchange, (4) director interaction, (5) joint programs, (6) resource exchange, (7) overlapping boards, and (8) written agreements. Evaluation indicates the revised theoretical ordering is statistically significant. (Author/DN)",

Since 1970, however, 42 States have lowered the age to 18 or 19 for most purposes, and the 26th Amendment to the Constitution lowered the age for voting in Federal elections to 18. The new statutes will have wide impact on legal affairs. In particular, the ability of young adults to make binding contracts and the legal responsibility parents have for their children will be significantly changed. Even though most secondary school students are under 18 and most school rules do not depend on the age of students, the new statutes will affect secondary school administrators in several ways. In many States, students over the age of majority will be able to establish a legal residence separate  from their parents. Adult students will also have the right to view their school records and to prevent their parents from viewing many of them. In most cases school administrators will no longer be able to require parental consent or permission forms for students past the age of majority. Other areas of concern will undoubtedly become apparent as the courts rule on specific legal questions. (JG)",

The conference encompassed two elements: (1) the substantive questions dealing directly with the problems involved in planning physical environments (within a broad societal framework) and (2) research organization--what needs to be done to insure that the necessary research is carried out. The book is divided into four parts. Part 1 presents the  recommendations of high-priority research for land-use planning and allocation that were developed by the workshop participants. Part 2 contains an introductory chapter and an historical overview of land-use planning in the United States. Part 3 comprises a collection of nine background papers devoted to various topics concerning the social, economic, and natural environmental factors important to environmental/land-use planning. Part 4 contains six committee reports that were prepared during the conference. (Author/MLF)",

On March 1, 1974, the experiment began as Timonium Elementary School, in Maryland, became the first school in the United States to be heated by solar energy. In this brief period, the corporation designed, manufactured, and installed a solar energy collector array complete with mounting trusses, a 15,000 gallon water storage tank, a hot water heating system, and instrumentation. From March 1 to May 15 the wing of the school chosen for the solar experiment received 90 percent of its heat from the solar heating system. Experimental data collected during this period is presented in this report. The report describes the system  in detail, presents the analysis of operation, and discusses recommendations and conclusions based on the results of the experiment. The experiment is considered successful since it has proven that the solar heating of schools is possible, practical, and socially acceptable. In addition, over 1,200 gallons of fuel oil were saved in the brief period the system has been in operation. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to establish the technical and economic feasibility of using solar energy for the heating and cooling of buildings. Five selected building types in 14 selected cities were used to determine loads for space heating, space cooling and dehumidification, and domestic service hot water heating. Relying on existing and proven solar and conventional climatic control hardware, three references designs were selected for detailed cost evaluation in each of the 14 cities and five building types. Mathematical models were constructed of the reference systems. A computer simulation of the reference systems with specified inputs to the program determined the overall system performance. A series of computer programs determined system cost and percent solar  utilization for each of the reference systems. The market penetration analysis was integrated into the cost programs. The social impact of solar energy was assessed by a random telephone survey in three cities. Environmental and economic impact forecasts are calculated. Three proof-of-concept experiments were recommended. Phase 1 and 2 development plans were prepared, and a utilization plan for implementation and commercialization of solar energy systems was prepared. (Author/MLF)",

The overall objective of this program was to obtain data that would assist in evaluating the applicability of solar heating systems in large metropolitan areas. This data was to be an &quot;operational&quot; nature, in contrast to theoretical, and to encompass the areas of construction, societal interactions, economics, and aesthetics, as well as the thermal performance aspects. The data was obtained by constructng and operating a solar heating system of pilot plant scale on a middle school in Boston, Massachusetts. The Grover Cleveland School was the first solar heating experiment to come on line for continuous  operation when heat was supplied at 4:10 p.m. on March 6, 1974. The system was operated through May 15, 1974. The experimental data collected during this period is presented in this report. The report describes the system in detail, presents the analysis of operation, and discusses recommendations and conclusions based on the results of the experiment. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"To the extent that costs do vary among school districts, neither an equal dollar distribution of funds nor an equal-yield per unit of tax effort can achieve equality of educational inputs or the capacity to acquire them. This document addresses problems relating to the development of guidelines to achieve equality in educational inputs, or resources, through provision for adjustments in State disbursements to school districts designed to take into account differences in input prices or costs. It develops a &quot;pilot&quot; adjustment index that measures the influence on teachers' salaries of factors that affect both the demand for teachers and their supply. The index is designed in such a fashion that, when applied to the initial amount of dollars available, the product of the index and  that initial amount will be a sum sufficient to permit all districts to acquire the same quantity of teacher inputs. The approach, in effect, neutralizes differences in demand among districts and compensates for differences in supply conditions facing districts. The authors conclude that the methodology suggested in this paper is capable of providing appropriate guidelines for adjusting dollars per pupil so as to compensate for price differences in teacher salaries.

It argues for the position that adults must stop planning the curriculum in such a way that it segments and separates various aspects of children's lives and must continually reaffirm the validity of play. General considerations in the development of an outside area for young children include the age group served and their developmental needs, the location of the school/center, the time the area will be used, and the climatic conditions of the region. Specific considerations discussed are local and State regulations for safety; professional standards; assessment of available space; the manner in which the space is set up, equipped, and  managed; criticisms of conventional playground equipment; and preparation of the staff, parents, and the children. The paper concludes with an evaluative checklist and a bibliography. (Author/MLF)",

In this article, the structural implications of a transformation in the educational vertical mobility concept due to alterations in functional specialization and referent group orientation is discussed. In turn, four specific propositions are derived from these implications. First, vertical mobility is not exclusively equated with adopting an institutionally specified administrative specialization. Second, primary referent group orientation is not necessarily correlated with expectations of inclusion in the administrative hierarchy. Third, social comparisons of success do not always refer to  identification of institutionally determined administrative potential. And fourth, functional specialization for original admittance into the organization is becoming a dominant expectation for politically viable advancement and successful career patterns. (Author/JG)",

Population growth and widespread consolidation of school districts, depoliticization of school board elections, adoption of the business model of professional school management, development of a multilevel school bureaucracy, and unionization of teachers all have combined to substantially lessen public control of the schools. Two approaches to reforms that may help restore public control are now being considered: (1) reduction of the size or redefinition of the basic management unit of schooling in order to restore personal contact between administrators and the public and (2) introduction of market choices or measures designed to increase direct citizen participation in school decisionmaking. An experimental  school voucher plan that allows parents to choose the school their children will attend is now being tested in the Alum Rock district near San Jose, California. Another plan being tried in Florida makes each school site responsible for its own budgeting and accounting and provides an elected Parent Advisory Council to advise the principal. Although it is still too early to evaluate either experiment, both of these reform efforts seem to promise ways to increase public control of the schools. (Author/JG)",

An assessment model and a dynamic model were developed to help in the identification of educational needs and in the evaluation of public education in the State. The assessment model relates instructional program areas to population, program, and student characteristics through the use of an educational evaluation matrix. In several instructional areas, criterion measures are compared with status measures to identify discrepancies. On the basis of these discrepancies, educational needs are established. The dynamic model is a framework to assess and direct educational change. After a review of assessment study results, the dynamic  model is employed to give priority rankings to identified needs. The document examines the channels for decisionmaking in the planning process and presents a flow chart for developing program documents. Major participants in the planning process include the State board of education, the State superintendent of education, the superintendent's executive planning committee, and the office of planning.

        "description":"In response both to a growing national grumbling about the need for educational accountability and to a felt need to better define and focus on district priorities, the Madison Public Schools adopted a mangement by objectives (MBO) program in 1970. It is on the basis of three years' experience with this program that this book has been written. The publication begins by describing the &quot;change dilemma&quot; that many educators find themselves in. It then examines those observations and assumptions underlying supervision and evaluation in an organization and provides the rationale for the MBO process. Next, it describes the &quot;management contract&quot; that serves as the primary vehicle for operationalizing the MBO process. The publication discusses the prerequisite questions that must be  examined by those who would implement an MBO program in their school system, recommends some orientation procedures, and presents ideas for writing contracts. The process of monitoring and evaluating the contract results is described, and problems that implementors should anticipate once an MBO program is installed are discussed. The book concludes with answers to 18 commonly asked questions about implementing an MBO program in a school system. An extensive bibliography is included. (Author/DN)",

Specifically, it examines the budget share going to teachers as it is reflected in the ratio of teachers to pupils, the salary schedule, and the distribution of teachers by education and experience. The study uses census, financial, and school district information for 602 California school districts for the census year 1970 and the school year 1971-72. Through the use of regression equations for each school district, salary schedules were broken down into three structural elements: starting salary, annual increments for additional experience, and annual increment for educational credits  beyond a B.A. degree. In 92 percent of the school districts, these three variables accounted for more than 98 percent of the variance in salaries in the schedules. The principal statistical results indicate that expenditures on teachers rise at a rate less than proportional to total expenditures, that salary schedules are relatively insensitive to total expenditures, that the distribution of teachers by experience and education appears to vary with total expenditures, and that teacher-pupil ratios are especially sensitive to total expenditures.

A natural experiment in the identification of school districts interested in initiating serious innovation is used to study the differences between school districts that were and those that were not considering innovation in one specific decisionmaking period. In late 1970 the U.S. Office of Education offered every school district an opportunity to receive a substantial grant if the district had a serious and well-planned innovative school program. In this study, the districts that applied are \"initiators,\" and the districts that did not submit grant applications are \"noninnovators.\" The model uses indicators of economic, organizational, and political phenomena to \"predict\" whether or not each  of the sample districts applied for the federal innovation grant. Variables used in the analysis are: grant application, school enrollment, central city or suburban character of the district, poverty measure, board of education selection, and the number of calendar years elapsed since each district's 1970 superintendent of schools was appointed.

Although school finance inequity is the most pressing educational problem in most States, only 18 States have so far enacted new approaches to school finance. No school official should tolerate the injustice of inadequate or nonexistent school finance formulas. Accompanying the need for financial equality is the need for better accountability in education. Accountability should be a two-way process that serves students and solves problems, not just a way to place blame. Accountability should be a negotiated agreement between participants that  specifies the rewards and costs that will accrue as a result of an evaluation of the attainment of specified goals. School management by objectives is a means of attaining performance accountability that is gaining interest in some larger school districts. A basic management by objectives program for a school district involves participation by both central office staff and personnel at the individual schools and establishes the definite objectives and division of responsibility that are crucial to any accountability effort.

The work of Whitehead, Northrop, Toulmin, and, especially, Kuhn suggests the value of viewing research as a social process through which ideas and intellectual techniques are diffused. It is useful for analytical purposes to distinguish between three phases in that process: the period of emergence of community, the transition period, and the period of maturity. The pattern of development in educational administration suggests that the community development period extended up until about 1950 and that the transition period begun in 1950 continues today. The formation of educational administration research organizations and the growing  emphasis on analytical techniques suggest that some of the critical components necessary for the emergence of the period of maturity are now developing.

In Canadian secondary education, this movement will result in redistribution of power, alterations in the nature of education, and increased insecurity of teachers. Teachers, students, and the community at large will have considerable responsibility for the direction of secondary education, although county boards and provincial ministries of education will retain much of their power, particularly outside the area of program planning. Schools will recognize that they cannot solve all of society's problems and will concentrate on developing specific career oriented capabilities and a positive  motivation toward learning, resulting in an increased workload and greater responsibilities for teachers. This trend, coupled with a continuing decline in school enrollments, will result in increased feelings of insecurity among many teachers. This will increase demands for teachers' organizations to undertake activities that facilitate the professional development of their members. Creation of a province-wide council that could coordinate and integrate the efforts of various teacher organizations might greatly ease the task of meeting these needs. (Author/JG)",

One program is designed for disciplines that predominantly use empirical methods, the other programs for disciplines dealing with symbolism and aesthetics.

Specific objectives for each subject area were developed by task forces made up of teachers, supervisors, and administrators from throughout the State working in conjunction with Delaware Department of Public Instruction personnel. An introductory section discusses the Delaware Educational Accountability System. Separate sections describe objectives for each grade in the areas of communication skills, reading, natural science, mathematics, social studies, and physical and mental health. (JG)",

        "author":["Kimberly, John R."],
        "description":"In the context of the rapid technological advance characteristic of post-industrial societies, organizational theorists have paid a great deal of attention to the problem of organizational change. One of the central issues in various analyses of the problem of change in general has been the observation that all organizations do not respond to changes in their environments in the same way. The purpose of this paper is to supplement existing studies of organizational response to change by focusing on the extent of organizational integration into informational environments. The approach used is based on a view of organizations as information processing systems and seeks to understand variability in adoption of innovation in terms of variability in extent of integration into  informational environments. The principal hypothesis tested is that the greater the extent of an organization's integration into an informational environment, the more extensive will be its reponse to environmental change, that is, the more likely it will be to adopt innovations. Data from a national sample of hospitals are used to test the hypothesis. The measure of innovation is based on hospital responses regarding the presence or absence of 12 different new developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of respiratory disease. Findings support the principal hypothesis tested. (Author/DN)",

        "description":"Although the Federal courts have not yet decided any cases involving search and seizure of student's property, various State courts have ruled that the Fourth Amendment protects students from &quot;unreasonable&quot; searches by school officials. However, the courts have generally applied a less stringent standard in justifying searches by school officials than in justifying searches by police. When school officials conduct a search of school premises or ask police to conduct a search to determine if a school regulation or criminal statute has been violated, only &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; is required. If, however, a search conducted jointly by school officials and police is initiated by the police for the primary purpose of seeking evidence of a crime, the more stringent search and seizure  standards applicable to criminal cases may apply. whenever school officials conduct a search of a student's property, a witness and the student himself, if possible, should be present. Observance of these safeguards is important since a search that is ruled unlawful may result in the inadmissability of evidence in criminal or school proceedings and, possibly, a civil or criminal liability for school officials.

The analysis is based on data from questionnaires completed by members of 57 Kentucky school boards, data describing school district social and economic characteristics, and school boards election data. The study reveals that internal group variables (for instance, opposition to the superintendent and disagreement over the proper role of the Federal Government) are the most compelling explanations of school board conflict. However, external variables (especially the social status of district residents) have a good deal of import, indicating that school board decisions are not based on internal factors  alone. In several ways, board members behave like political decisionmakers in other areas, particularly legislators at the State and local levels. (Author/JG)",

Nine of the groups utilized a brainstorming technique to identify solutions to problems in the areas of transportation of pupils, administration, regular classrooms,  specialized classrooms, classroom uses outside the regular school day, extra curricular activities, maintenance, and food services. The remaining groups incorporated problemsolving techniques into their responses to the following hypothethical situations: delay in delivery of instructional supplies, blackouts, diesel fuel reduction, gasoline reduction, natural gas reduction, electrical power reduction, and increase in bus riders.

This report is intended to acquaint educational managers and technicians with this particular approach to the audit problem, with the procedure that has been produced at this point in its development, with its effectiveness, and with technical problems yet to be overcome. SEPA can help in the early detection of technical problems not only within development projects but also among them. Being able to detect and measure the incidence of problems  common among projects will help the department of education increase its responsiveness to the needs of district developers. The use of problem information by projects will increase their effectiveness and efficiency.

A problem  area in the education of the deaf, for instance, is said to be lack of parent information/education from the time the child is suspected of being hearing impaired until he completes his educational program.

The Attitude Towards Handicapped Individuals Scale was used to measure attitudes of acceptance or rejection of handicapped individuals; the Is of Identity Scale was used to measure social adjustment; and the Preferred Student Characteristics Scale was used to assess affective and cognitive attitudes toward instructional goals. Results indicated that sex is not a significant factor in equal acceptance of the handicapped or in the affective/cognitive goals desired by future administrators and that personal adjustment to administrative roles would be similar for both males and females.

The Milwaukee Advocacy is seen to be an agency advocate/ombudsman model serving a predominantly black inner city population, with a legal advocacy program as one projected outcome. The San Mateo/Santa Clara (California) Model is described as a consumer  advocacy model involving young, poor Chicanos in planning and developing community services. Comments on the New York State program (an agent advocate/program developer model) center on objectives, such as preparing legislative proposals, to meet the needs of populations in rural areas and state institutions. Discussed in the second component of the document are major goals, secondary objectives, and rationale for the National Advocacy Project as a whole and for the three models. (LH)",

In the first study, a combination of physical guidance, fading, and reinforcement procedures were used to train an 11-year-old boy to follow 25 verbal instructions. In the second study, a transfer of stimulus control procedure was invoked to train three children to follow the same instructions. Since no generalization occurred to untrained items in studies 1 and 2, a third study was undertaken with two Ss to determine whether being trained to follow instructions in which one verb was combined with several nouns would result in generalization when other verbs were combined with the same nouns. Ss of study 3 generalized to untrained  items; however, there were some difficulties in establishing initial discriminations when training was initiated on the verb. In study 4, six Ss were trained on the individual noun and verb components in isolation. Two of the six Ss developed an intensive generative instruction following skill, three Ss developed a partial generative skill, and one S developed no generative abilities whatsoever. (GW)",

In a section on curriculum design, the rationale for selecting and organizing curriculum content is discussed; the program is traced from design to material development; and curriculum design theories and underlying assumptions are explained. Analysis and revision of curriculum materials is considered in relation to activities such as content reviews by experts and by  staff members and a matrix analysis to determine emphasis on curricular components such as environmental themes and problem-solving skills. Described are problems, concerns, and costs of collecting and processing data (from field-test classes, teachers, students, and observers) to be used in evaluating curriculum effectiveness. Contrasted in a case study of the two classes are variables influencing effective use of the science curriculum such as classroom climate, student/teacher interaction, and teaching approaches that stress learning versus approaches that emphasize student behavior.

College students were asked to predict responses to EMR and normal children to questions designed to emphasize cognitive processes rather than academic skills. Anticipations were analyzed according to the students' sex, academic major, age, hours in special education courses, and experience with EMR children. Data, shown in tables which provide detailed statistical analyses, indicated that all groups of college students anticipated the nonretarded children's responses at a reasonable level of accuracy (mean of 13.2 correct answers out  of a possible 24), but that none of the groups correctly anticipated responses of EMR Ss at any level of proficiency (mean of 5.5 correct answers out of 24). However, special education majors, students in special education courses, students who had had experience with EMR children, oldest students, and females were better than their counterparts in anticipating responses of the EMR group. Appendixes provide questions used in preparing the normative data base, tables that indicate responses of the EMR and the nonretarded groups, instructions to the college students, and correlation matrices.

Source materials were of two major kinds: (1) pre-Revolution sources: the two most recetnly published Javanese dictionaries (see Bibliography, Pigeaud and Poerwadarminta), predating the 1945 Indonesian war for independence; and (2) post-Revolution sources: written materials published in Java for the Javanese, and monologues and dialogues tape-recorded and transcribed by Javanese speakers, all of which came into existence after 1950. The latter materials, numbering nearly 1,000,000 textual words, were processed by computer into concordances. Other sources were word-of-mouth information from native Javanese speakers and published materials that became  available in the early 1970's (the latter could be examined only cursorily in view of time limitations). The dictionary resulting from the research was published by Yale University Press in 1974. It is a general-purpose dictionary representing the Javanese language as it is currently used. The introduction describes the phonology of Javanese and its relation to the conventional spelling; it also contains a summary of Javanese morphology and a description of Javanese social stratification and its manifestation in language usage.

In translation, there is replacement which involves general hierarchical organization, grammatical constructions and constituents, mapping of deep onto surface structures, classes, ordering, lexicon, phonology, concordance, points of ambiguity, and information loss and gain. A fundamental assumption is that the content of a document is independent of the language in which it is expressed. To transmit the content of a document into another language, the translator must be more concerned with the overall effect of his effort than with correspondence of outward form--if he is not to lose the kernel in preoccupation with the husk.

The sounds of Navaho are imposed on spoken English, and the phonological deviations produce morphological and syntactical errors. Mistakes in verb tense and in singular and plural suffixes are common. The value of teaching English as a second language is questionable; perhaps it should be taught as an alternate dialect, and teachers should cite economic opportunity as motivation to learn. Navaho students were tested for their ability to recognize and use comprehension clues in reading English; results indicate that reading skill rests on oral linguistic competence. Teachers could use a knowledge of linguistics to improve their language  instruction. (CK)",

A repetition-of-sentence test, including 64 sentences each composed of two constituent transitive sentences conjoined with \"and,\" was selected as the most efficient method of eliciting sentences representing specific structures. The main conclusions of the study are summarized as follows: (1) Children from 5 to 8 repeat or modify the structure of a dictated sentence on the basis of their grammatical competence; (2) Children's success in repeating  a sentence depends on the specific transformations used in deriving the surface structure;(3) The ability of children to make deletions and substitutions progresses, in a general way, from 5 to 7 years and reaches a plateau between 7 and 8 years; (4) Children's acquisition of optional transformations on sentences conjoined with \"and\" proceeds in a sequence from deletions involving only the verb phrase, to deletions involving a combination of constituents from noun and verb phrase, to deletions or pronoun substitutions involving only the noun phrase.

Frequency and length of language periods in schools are also diagrammed; there is considerable variation in years of study and periods per week, depending on the number of languages taught and the school's emphasis. The average number of pupils per class in all countries ranged between 20 and 30. Everywhere, a main aim of modern language teaching was to  give students a practical working knowledge of a language for better international communication and understanding. Efforts are being made to modernize language instruction, and five methods are being used by teachers; grammatical (on the point of disappearing from the schools), direct or oral, modified direct, audiovisual and applied linguistics or structural.

The study also attempted to determine which patterns might yet be unlearned by both native English speakers and nonnative English speakers. A test of basic English sentence types for bilingual children was constructed and adminstered to 90 native Spanish-speaking fourth graders who had participated for three or more years in any of three bilingual programs or any of two nonbilingual programs.The groups were further classified as urban and border. In addition, part 1 of the test was given to 20 native English  speakers at the fourth grade level. It was concluded that: (1) the native English speakers had less difficulty in identifying the correct sentence types than the bilingual groups had; (2) the native Spanish-speaking groups showed no significant differences in their production performances; (3) the nonbilingual program groups seem to have an advantage in their ability to identify correct English sequences. Appended to the report are the personal data sheet completed by the students, test designs, and parts 1 and 2 of the test. (Author/PMP)",

Legislation committing our nation to bilingual education has been passed, but very little progress has been made so far in implementing bilingual programs. Continuous pressure must be exerted on our national and state legislatures in order that the requisite amount of funds be provided. We must involve ourselves in the decisions of our local school boards and push for the establishment of bilingual education programs there. If such programs are not set up, funded, and properly administered, we must prepare for legal confrontation by lodging community-initiated administrative complaints with the Health, Education and Welfare  Office for Civil Rights or by instituting suits against local school districts. The fact that the Department of Health, Education and Welfare has construed Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to mean that bilingual programs can be legally required indicates that a series of court battles would most likely result in a victory for the nation's school children. Though the short-term cost of establishing bilingual programs will be high, the returns on our investment in equal educational opportunity will be enormous. (Author/PMP)",

In the last part of the paper, the attitude of the Schools Council Project toward West Indian children, speakers of an English-based Creole, and their dialect is summarized as follows: (1) Teachers must be as informed as possible about Creole and able to approach language learning problems from the child's point of view; (2) Many West Indian children have a range of severe language learning problems which have little to do with dialect per se. Most of the Project's teaching materials focus on these  non-dialect and general language development areas; (3) One unit of the four that make up the Project materials does focus on dialect and is designed to help West Indian Children write standard English and to make teachers more aware of the learning problems of dialect speakers; and (4) The teacher must never attack the student's own language. A positive value should be placed on the dialect in class, and dialect differences must be considered objectively. (Author/PMP)",

This discussion includes sections on metalanguage, deep and surface structure and structural semantics, and procedures for relating the English of abstracts to a classification concordance in the same language. The second part describes the experiment, in which a mechanized indexing system was developed and applied to 50 abstracts from a bibliography on documentation. In this system, each text word or symbol is replaced by a code, after which the machine performs step-by-step concatenations, rewriting two or more codes as a single code, until each abstract is rewritten as a single code. Part three is a discussion of problems of semantic representation in: (1)  theoretical background--constituent-structure rules, lexical entries, and conjunction, discourse and relative clauses; (2) expressions such as &quot;a discussion of...&quot; and &quot;this paper discusses...&quot; (3) conjunction, relative changes and presupposition; (4) asymmetric conjunction--proposes an analysis in terms of case theory; and (5) examples drawn from the corpus that present difficulties for current case theory (for example, &quot;as machines learn...&quot;).

Samples of spontaneous questions asked by normal children and linguistically deviant children were compared in this study in order to determine if linguistically deviant (aphasic) children suffer primarily from a syntactic impairment. If this were so, the questions asked by a deviant group matched to a normal group on a syntactic measure would not show the same cognitive stages if the aphasic children were all significantly older than the normal children. The results of this study indicate, however, that the asphasic children do show the same cognitive stages and suggest that aphasia in children is not simply a syntactic impairment, but a cognitive deficiency in  those features of cognition that are prerequisites for language learning.

Government policies often discourage cultural pluralism in an attempt to promote national unity, but these policies suppress the individual's need for identity. Group interaction in complex societies may be divided into eight categories: (1) integration or democratic pluralism; (2) paternal integration or inclusive segregation; (3) rejection or self-segregation; (4) exclusive segregation; (5) voluntary assimilation; (6) involuntary assimilation; (7) marginality or segregation of a small group; and (8) deculturation, where apathy or withdrawal negate any cultural characteristics. Canadian government policy promotes the first of these patterns, integration or democratic  pluralism. Biculturalism and bilingualism are recognized; cultural pluralism is supported and assimilation discouraged. Thus identity and unity both are maintained. (CK)",

The subjects of the study were 10 lower-class black mothers, speakers of urban language, and their children, all born during the summer of 1970. The verbal and nonverbal behavior of each mother-child pair was observed for a total of 10 hours between 1970 and 1974 by means of written transcriptions of dialogue, tape-recorded interviews, and written descriptions of behavior. Results of the study suggest that mothers' speech to children  is much different from mother-to-adult speech, less complex, and less grammatically correct; that nursery language used with the child becomes more varied and less concrete as the child learns to talk; and that the child's speech is influenced by and influences the mother's speech.

        "description":"A design for bilingual/bicultural education should begin with the assumption that cultural, racial, and linguistic differences are an integral and positive part of American society. School districts that want federal assistance in bilingual/bicultural programs should be able to demonstrate a commitment to this philosophy. Program planners should anticipate variation not only among different ethnic groups, but also within any one group, such as differences in performance levels. Particular programs of bilingual/bicultural education, since they are targeted to a given group, should not be assumed to have generality across other ethnic groups. The training of bilingual/bicultural personnel involves capabilities not only for dealing with the primary languages of the children,  evaluating their performance in both languages, and adapting teaching methods according to the children's background, but also for developing a range of insights regarding the children's cultural background. A vital component of any bilingual/bicultural program is the capability for self-evaluation. This design proposes that the logic of discrepancy analysis be applied so that programs can constantly be held accountable not only for the attainment of their stated objectives but also for their schedule for achieving them. No such evaluation can be carried out adequately without the participation of trained evaluators who by membership in the subcultural group will be its most accurate observers. (Author/KM)",

(2) Does over-extension, or inappropriate over-generalization, occur in the child's acquisition of spatial adjectives? (3) What is the order of acquisition of spatial adjectives? The subjects were sixty preschool children ranging in age from 2 years 8 months to 4 years 1 month and were divided into six groups separated by three-month age intervals. The following pairs of spatial adjectives were presented to each subject and then used as test items: (1) big-little,  (2) tall-short, (3) high-low, (4) long-short, (5) wide-narrow, (6) thick-thin, (7) deep-shallow, and (8) fat-skinny. All children were tested individually following a brief play period and instructions concerning the task. Responses were tabulated for each group and analyzed to determine the significance of the factors of age, polarity, and terms. Analyses were also performed to determine order of acquisition. Results indicated that acquisition of spatial adjectives proceeds according to semantic complexity. No differences were observed in the learning of positive- and negative-pole terms, and the children's acquisition of spatial adjectives did not seem to proceed according to an over-extension model. Both members of a pair of adjectives were acquired concurrently. (PMP)",

He must collaborate with his colleagues in elementary and secondary schools and encourage his high school colleagues to send motivated students to appropriate university classes.

The youngest informant was 8, and the oldest 86.

By the end of grade 2, following the introduction of English Language Arts into the curriculum for 60 minutes a day, immersion pupils still lag behind their regular program peers in most English language skills considered, although their level of performance is consistent with their grade level. By the  end of grade 3, immersion pupils match regular program pupils in all English language skills tested except spelling. Throughout grades 1-3 pupils in the two programs perform equivalently in mathematical skills and show the same level of cognitive development. Immersion pupils reveal a considerably higher level of proficiency in French than pupils of corresponding or higher grade levels receiving daily instruction in French as a second language, and do reasonably well in comparison with native French-speaking pupils.

It is recommended that schools and universities, bilingual-bicultural programs and/or agencies, and cultural centers be contacted as possible sources of information and activity for the foreign language student. Teachers should be aware of the career opportunities available to language students. Often it is possible for students to work with non-English-speaking children and older people in some kind of voluntary educational program. Such work provides extra-curricular language experience, as well as a much-needed community service. Community  publications written in the appropriate foreign language are also a valuable tool that can be used both inside and outside the classroom. Organizations and commercial firms mainly concerned with entertainment should also be contacted by the language teacher.

New linguistics programs can no longer be justified in view of the current job market. The number of linguists being graduated each year far exceeds the number of available positions. Consequently, many linguists already trained will not work as linguists, through no choice of their own, in the coming decades. Students in our colleges and universities would be better off majoring in a more traditional, well-charted discipline, with the option of selecting as many linguistics electives, available in several different Departments, as their time and  interests permit. This is not to say that existing linguistics departments must be broken up, but that the present balance between institutions with active linguistics departments and those without should be maintained.

Basic aspects of the theory such as \"interlanguage,\"\"learning strategies\" and \"the interpretation of errors\" are introduced; and empirical data from child language learning studies are presented to support the underlying assumptions that a language learner creates a tentative system of rules from the language data he is exposed to and that this system enables him to use the language. Because of the parallels between second language learning and first language acquisition, it is considered reasonable to extend these assumptions to adult second language learning. In light of this theory, errors are shown to be signs of learning rather than signs of failure. It  is proposed that this calls for a switch in focus from the second language itself, to the learner of the second language. This implies that the teacher's role would be in studying the students' interlanguages and facilitating their development rather than in correcting their errors. The implications and some practical applications of this idea are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"This survey of faculty tenure and contract systems was conducted during August 1974 as a followup to an earlier Higher Education Panel survey of institutional policies and practices affecting faculty employment. A survey questionnaire mailed to the entire membership of the Higher Education Panel (644 institutions) received a 91 percent response rate. Highlights of the survey indicated: (1) There has been no overall change between 1972 and 1974 in the general prevalence of tenure systems. (2) Between 1972 and 1974, there was an upward shift in the percentage of full-time faculty holding tenure. (3) As compared to 1972 data, somewhat fewer of those faculty formally considered for tenure in 1973-74 actually received tenure. (4) Two-thirds of the institutions with tenure systems  reported that they had renewed 80 percent or more of their term contracts expiring during the 1973-74 academic year. (5 ) Of the institutions operating under term-contract systems in 1973-74, almost all (93 percent) had reappointed 90 percent or more of their faculty. (6) As in 1972, almost all tenure institutions have probationary periods, and 2-year institutions reported shorter maximum periods of probation than did 4-year colleges and universities. (7) There is some shift toward longer probationary periods of tenure. Additional results and statistical data are provided. (MJM)",

        "description":"There are various assumptions underlying the University Tracer Project at the University College, Nairobi, Africa: (1) that there is a relationship between subjects studied in university and the employment sought and found; (2) that this relationship will increase as competition for jobs increases; (3) that this relationship is sufficiently flexible to allow for career guidance; and (4) that the experience of earlier graduates will provide a meaningful source of information for the guidance of later graduates. The interview questionnaire, which was administered to all Kenyan third year students at University College, Nairobi in mid-April 1970, had three basic objectives: (1) to learn something about the student approach to the employment market; (2) to learn something about the  reasons guiding the students' choice of subjects in university; (3) to familiarize the graduating students with the objective of career guidance and thereby enlist their support and cooperation later. This paper is a brief review of the questionnaire. Statistical tables display the results in the following areas: total number of students by discipline, year of birth by discipline, home province by discipline, religion, sex, father's occupation, mother's education, postgraduate qualification desired, how job was found, status of job.

The paper then outlines briefly the three major bargaining philosophies that appear to be prevalent (limited bargaining, structural bargaining, and comprehensive bargaining), and goes on to discuss the tenure situation nationally and more specifically as it relates to collective bargaining. The concluding section of the paper dwells on governance and collective bargaining, and specifically the evolving relations between academic or faculty senates and unions on individual campuses.

Less emphasis is on where, and how learning occurs. The shift to an emphasis on the learner also means that the learner decides how far to pursue the chain of validation, evaluation, credentialling, and rewarding. Represented by the concept of postsecondary education, social and educational ideas have been broadened so that the notion that education can occur over a lifetime is accepted. But legislation and administrative machinery now put money and a regulatory force behind the idea that students should choose from a broad range of educational  institutions and that those institutions ought to be considered in planning and legislation. A number of currently operational or planned nontraditional education enterprises that utilize the approaches characteristic of nontraditional education include: (1) the New York Regents Degree program; (2) the State University of Nebraska SUN program; (3) nontraditional educational activities for the postsecondary clientele that are underway in public libraries of the nation; (4) educational efforts conducted by businesses and industries to train and educate their employees or customer's employees; and (5) proprietary schools.

To implement this authority, the Secretary established the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education. The Fund is a governmental, grant-making organization with four distinguishing characteristics: (1) It is comprehensive in scope, covering the entire range of postsecondary education. (2) It is responsive, seeking to yield to external initiative the task of conceiving and developing proposals for basic research. (3) It is risk-taking. The Fund entertains proposals for new and unproven ideas as well as proven ones.  The basic purpose of the Fund is to help fulfill national postsecondary educational opportunities. In fulfilling this purpose, the Fund pursues two general goals: diversity and cost-effectiveness. These are achieved primarily through postsecondary education. Many associations, organizations, and agencies are necessary to the realization of these goals. The Fund thus encourages proposals from the entire range of higher and postsecondary educational institutions. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"In an effort to evaluate the undergraduate pass-fail option system of grading at the University of Texas at Austin, 869 undergraduate students, 269 faculty members, and 35 administrators participated in a questionnaire survey. Results indicated: (1) During the 1973 fall semester, 3,896 undergraduate course registrations out of a total of 155,133 were recorded for courses being taken on a pass-fail option basis. (2) From an examination of the incidence of registrations on a pass-fail option basis within colleges and schools, it is clear that a wide variance in practice exists. Optional pass-fail enrollment in the schools of the university ranged from a high of 166 in the School of Communications to a low of 30 in the School of Architecture. On an absolute basis, the number of  enrollments within a college ranged from over 1,000 in the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences to less than 50 in the College of Engineering and the College of Pharmacy. (3) Students who selected a pass-fail option course were somewhat different from the ABCDF students. With respect to indexes of academic potential and performance, a small but consistent superiority was noted in favor of the pass-fail students. Additional results are included. (MJM)",

Highlights of the study indicate: (1) During the 1958-70 period, 8,685 postdoctorals, equally divided between MD's and PD's, were supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), at a total cost of $86.5 million. (2) Directors of the nation's leading biomedical research laboratories, the postdoctorals now in training there, and former NIGMS postdoctorals, presented strong testimony to the effect that training at this level is essential to the continued improvement of medical science and the delivery of advanced techniques for the diagnosis, care, and treatment of disease. (3) The study indicates that the objectives of the postdoctoral research training have been met  by those supported by the following data: (a) Both post-M.D.'s and post-Ph.D.'s are found on followup to be employed by the nation's medical schools in numbers far beyond those of M.D.'s and Ph.D.'s without training, and having advanced faster up the academic ladder than have comparable groups without postdoctoral training. (b) Post-M.D.'s and post-Ph.D.'s are much more frequently employed by the more research-oriented medical schools than by those less research-oriented and in much greater proportions than are Ph.D.'s and M.D.'s without postdoctoral training.

The report is organized around four basic kinds of instructional development activities that took place on the campus during 1973-74. These activities are: (1) the Instructional Development Program (IDP) that provides support funds directly to faculty members, on an approved proposal basis, to improve classroom instruction. These &quot;minigrant&quot; proposals are reviewed by a faculty-student committee, with awards made on the basis of the quality of the proposal and the likely success of the project in improving the quality of the educational experience in a particular class or course. Each of the 40 IDP projects funded are described briefly.  (2) The summer Instructional Development Program provided 44 faculty members with grants to assist them with instructional development projects. Each project is summarized in the form of brief reports prepared by the participating faculty member. (3) The Educational Innovation Program provided funds for 11 EIP projects ranging from the Humanities Education Theatre Company to Individualized English Composition and the Special Education Junior Semester Off-Campus. Each of the projects is described. (4) The Undergraduate Teaching Assistant Program, designed to involve upper division students in the lower division instructional program and to provide assistance to faculty members teaching such courses, is described and evaluated.

        "description":"This report is concerned with the future of private higher education, however, the recommendations it offers, are directed to the public interest in strengthening the whole higher educational system. The private sector of higher education is enormously valuable to American society and is an influential complement to the public sector. The financial problems of private higher education other than demographic factors and escalating costs--the tuition gap, the unfavorable provisions of federal student aid programs, the indiscriminate creation of new public institutions, and tax reform proposals inimical to private philanthropy--could all be solved or alleviated by quite modest changes of public policy. Each state should provide adequately funded grants having the effect of  substantially narrowing, but not necessarily closing, the tuition gap. This report elaborates on one simple way to narrow the gap, namely, tuition offset grants for all students in private institutions. Other chapters cover correcting geographic inequities in public aid to the private sector; modifying present federal students aid programs; statewide planning; tax laws and tax administration; fund raising by public institutions; and other measures. Appendices include a review of comments on private colleges in recent reports on financing higher education; and implications of the 18-year old majority. Part two contains the conclusions and recommendations. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"A 5-month project was undertaken at the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education to do a preliminary study of the implications of growth policy for postsecondary education. The decision to focus on this level of education was based on the belief that the existing problems of growth and its limits have become too urgent to be left to future generations to solve. Educational responses to the needs of growth policy are particularly crucial at the postsecondary level, for it is the current adult citizenry and leadership that must be affected. A major objective of this project was to develop a conceptual framework for action in the field of postsecondary education in response to the challenges posed by \"limits to growth.\" While many educators are concerned about the social,  economic, and ecological problems associated with population and material growth, there have so far been no detailed and comprehensive plans developed to clearly define, create, and disseminate the kinds of educational innovations these problems seem to demand. This working paper is an initial attempt to respond to this need. The chapters of the paper cover: the equilibrium society; changing institutions, roles and skills; needs for innovation in postsecondary education; recommendations for innovation and change; strategies for innovation and change; and comments on the working paper.

        "description":"In Texas higher education, fiscal 1974 was a year of reassessment. Although student enrollments and state funding for Texas colleges and universities climbed to record levels, caution and concern for the future dominated higher education planning. That concern was prompted by an inflationary economy, shifting state and national priorities, changing methods of delivering educational services, and development of newly created institutions of higher education. Comprehensive reexaminations of state needs evolved as the Coordinating Board's major challenge during the year. Major developments in Texas postsecondary education included: (1) Student enrollment at all Texas colleges and universities continued to climb, reaching 531,952 in fall 1973. (2) To support all agencies of  postsecondary education in Texas, the 63rd legislature appropriated a record $705.3 million from all funds for 1973-74. (3) New degree program proposals submitted to the Coordinating Board for approval reflected efforts by Texas colleges and universities to respond to changing employment opportunities, particularly in the areas of vocational-technical education, business management, and health-related fields. (4) The Coordinating Board endorsed a statewide plan to assist Texas institutions to expand their efforts in adult and continuing education. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"Unprecedented numbers of young college graduates entered the labor force in the late 1960's and early 1970's. At the same time, there was a slackening in the demand for professional workers in several sectors of the economy, such as research and development and education, which have traditionally provided employment for new degree recipients. This article reports on the methods by which recent graduates looked for jobs, the relationship of their major fields of study, their earnings, and their assessment of the career potential of their jobs. The study covers the 873,000 persons in the civilian noninstitutional population who completed the requirements for baccalaureate, first professional, and advanced degrees in the year ended June 1972 and who were not enrolled full-time in a  college or university in October 1972. A majority of the graduates were under age 25, male, and married. Only about 4 percent were black, a number too small to make statistically reliable comparisons with other groups. Overall, men had a higher labor force participation rate than women. There was virtually no difference in the labor force participation rates of graduates when grouped by major field of study: those in business or commerce--most of whom were men--had a slightly higher rate than those in humanities. Supplementary tables and the survey questionnaire are included in the appendixes. (Author/PG)",

It has become a necessity that colleges and universities begin to explore ways to offer a variety of less expensive transportation alternatives to the student. Mass transit, carpools, buspools, and the bicycle are some of the alternatives to be considered. Carpooling is the best method available to reduce the transportation expenses of commuter students. It can also help to alleviate the traffic congestion, pollution, and parking problems on each campus. This careful carpool package has been designed to provide some hints on how to start an efficient carpool system at  higher education institutions. Included in this packet are sections covering: publicity and recruitment for carpools, incentives for carpooling, carpool promotion at the University of Maryland, matching riders, matching geographical areas, informing commuters of prospective carpool participants, resources on carpools, campus bus systems, bicycle systems, a sample survey to investigate transportation patterns, and a sample survey to investigate the feasibility of a bicycle system.

Higher educational institutions vary widely in their organizational structures, purposes and goals, and governance patterns.

These categories are shown to vary systematically on organizational features affecting diversity: environmental relations, complexity of professional task, and institutional size and complexity. It is predicted that the different categories of institutions, reflecting different organizational features, will have different governance  patterns which, in turn, will affect both faculty and the kinds of policy-influencing activities faculty members engage in.

        "description":"In recent years a number of institutions have offered the doctoral degree through nontraditional, external programs. The state of Florida has produced a disproportionate number of such graduate programs, including Heed University (Hollywood), Nova University (Fort Lauderdale), and Walden University (Naples). This paper discusses only the Walden University program. It answers the question whether the open admissions policy of Walden has resulted in a high success rate, defined as the awarding of a doctoral degree, for the 449 doctoral candidates enrolling in the 1971, 1972, and 1973 Walden summer sessions. The analysis presupposes that if an open admissions institution has a graduation rate approaching 100 percent, it either must be suspect or markedly superior to the average  graduate school. Additionally, available data is examined to ascertain whether the quantity or quality of previous academic work is related to completion of the Walden program. The answer to this question has obvious implications for admissions policy and for decisionmaking by prospective doctoral candidates considering the institution. To the extent that other open-admissions level institutions are similar, the implications may have a wider applicability. (Author/PG)",

(2) Most presidents and trustees felt that more attention to long range concerns and better orientation for board members to the institution would improve board functioning. (3) More than half of the presidents rated leadership skills, community stature, and  knowledgeability on higher education issues as the characteristics they believed to be most important in trustee selection. (4) The presidents and trustees of private liberal arts colleges, private universities, and public universities rated their boards as highly effective most frequently: presidents and trustees of state colleges, private junior colleges, and private black institutions tended to give their boards lower ratings.

        "description":"The NCHEMS Costing and Data Management System is designed to assist institutions in the implementation of cost studies. There are at least two kinds of cost studies: historical cost studies which display cost-related data that reflect actual events over a specific prior time period, and predictive cost studies which forecast costs that will be incurred during some future time period. These two kinds of cost studies use different techniques. Historical studies require the identification and aggregation of cost related data in terms of actual units (dollars, credit hours, and so forth). Predictive studies usually represent an institution in terms of historically derived parameters (such as average section size, faculty rank mix), which then are used as a basis for forecasting  costs. NCHEMS Costing and Data Management System supports both historical and predictive cost studies--specifically, the cost study portion of the Information Exchange Procedures (IEP) and the Resource Requirements Prediction Model (RRPM 1.6). Contained in this report is a general description of the system (purpose, institutional information, structure, and capabilities), accounting information, personnel information, faculty activity information, student registration information, student outcomes information, data management (storage, display, calculation, allocation, unit costing) and other possible uses and definitions.

        "description":"This investigation is based on the belief that it is imperative to establish operative school-agency communication if the field instructional agency is to be an educationally focused learning experience for the student. Through the existing governmental organizations, a subcommittee was formed to work toward this objective. The subcommittee evaluated existing methods of communication, revised those that were deemed ineffective, and implemented new ones. It is anticipated that better communication between the school and agency based faculty will improve the quality of field instruction by enabling clinical faculty to: (1) achieve a better relationship with the school, (2) integrate class and field teaching, (3) give their teaching roles greater priority, and (4) participate more  actively in the governance of their college.

These programs are described in this report. The Administrative Intern Program, begun in 1967, selects young men and women with masters of Business Administration degree to serve on administrative staffs of colleges for minorities. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Fellowship Program, begun in 1968, enables black veterans to undertake graduate and professional training in preparation for careers in public service. The Woodrow Wilson Senior Fellows Program, begun in 1973, promotes greater understanding between the academic community and the world of action. Most recently the Foundation has added a program concerned with women's studies. The National  Humanities Series was initiated by the National Endowment for the Humanities in June 1968 to create a pattern of disseminating the humanities to general adult audience throughout the U.S. The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation conducts the series. The Dissertation Fellowship Programs enable students to complete the research and writing of their dissertations in their fourth year of graduate study. Also included in this report is a list of the Board of Trustees, officers and staff, a financial report, and the selection committees of the Fellowship Foundation. (Author/PG)",

A demand model is added, derived from neoclassical production function theory. Empirical estimates are made for white males and white females, using cross-sectional data on states of the U.S., 1960-70. In human capital theory, education is an investment in future income streams. Measurements have been made of the monetary rate of return associated with college education. In this study the human capital model is extended by testing the investment theory of education as an ex ante behavioral theory. The results for white males support the investment theory of education. An increase in the benefit from college education increases the subsequent stock of college educated white  males, and increase in the cost decreases it. Unlike males, the supply of college educated white females is not responsive to changes in their market benefit from college education. However, the male market benefit was a significant female supply determinant. (MJM)",

In many cases, there have been substantial decreases in salary in terms of constant dollars. However, faculty productivity, when measured by credit hour loads, has increased. (2) The 4-year Washington institutions faced increasing competitive problems, since salaries now lag behind the weighted average of the seven comparison states by an average of 12.5%. As a result of these and other findings, the Council on Higher Education recommended that faculty salaries be raised  by approximately 9% beginning January 1, 1975 for the 1975-76 academic year; and that a third increase to meet further cost of living increases be made effective July 1, 1976.

The FCC held that elimination of commercial sponsorship was financially impractical, and refused to establish a specific number of hours for children's programs, but stated that stations have a clear obligation to provide children's programing which would be considered in license renewal. The industry was criticized for confining programing to weekends and  urged to increase weekday offerings. Restrictions were placed on the number of minutes devoted to commercials and on separation of program and commercial matter. Broadcasters were given time to comply, and further review of compliance was promised. Appendixes includes an issue-oriented summary of hearing testimony, plus names of participants in public panel discussions and oral arguments. (SK)",

In 1968 the scope of Chapter 12 was enlarged to include slide sets, video tapes, and other audiovisual materials. Since that time there have been numerous international meetings and discussions on forms of entry, terminology, and definitions.

They should be built around performance objectives. Learning packets allow students to benefit from the strengths of many teachers, and they also help guarantee continuity and organization of the baseline concepts within a school. Learning packets can be utilized best in schools where classroom time is flexible and adaptable to students' immediate needs. Grouping of students is required to  introduce concepts and skills in large groups as well as independent study sessions. The preparation of a learning packet includes the following steps: (1) assessment of curriculum needs, (2) determination of available resources, (3) definition of expected student outcomes, (4) planning of teacher strategies, (5) organization of packet materials into a logical sequence, (6) refinement of student outcomes, (7) designing methods to ensure student feedback and evaluation, and (8) preparation of a teaching guide.

        "description":"Assuming that new developments in communications technology will result in reduced costs for social service delivery, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare needed information about the role it could play in implementing instructional television (ITV). A study was designed to assess general educational programing costs and the potential market for ITV in the future. Although many secondary school educators have acclaimed it as a very important innovation, ITV has not received the utilization originally anticipated. This has been primarily due to limited money and staff for it within schools and among producers of ITV equipment and materials. The role of ITV in secondary schools is expected to remain limited in the near future. However, it has an important role to play in  the home where real incentives exist for home purchase of video-delivered education, especially in continuing and adult education. The potential market of ITV in the home appears to be both broad and deep. Success in attempts at implementation will depend upon the extent of coordination achieved among educators in a research, advisory, and evaluative role; producers in a creative and distributive role; and institutions in an accrediting and certification role. A number of recommendations for implementation are set forth. (DC)",

It analyzes the different technical capabilities and component costs of a variety of distribution system configurations including cable television, pay television, closed-circuit television, video disc, video tape, UHF broadcasts, microwave systems, satellite systems, and computer-assisted instruction systems. A basis for cost comparison is then described. The report notes that while costs for procurement and distribution of program materials or services may be computed, means of obtaining revenue to support the distribution process  often vary considerably. Moreover, those means of support are not fixed; one delivery system may depend on a combination of resources, whereas another system of the same type may be financed by a single method. Finally, the report notes that though the technology described exists, much of it has not gone beyond the demonstration stage. As a result, the most practical cash flow procedures have yet to be determined. (DC)",

Total expenditures for public library service in 1971-72 were $184 million. In order to fulfill the public library's role as an information source for people at the local level, expenditures of $1.7 to $2.1 billion would be necessary in 1974. In an examination of alternatives for funding an adequate level of service for the entire nation, the conclusion was reached that a balanced intergovernmental funding system--federal, state, and local--would be most effective. This could be achieved over a ten-year period with increased state and federal support, decreased local support, a revised Library  Services and Construction Act, coordinated federal and state planning for a national library services program, and additional federal funds for capital improvements necessary to upgrade services in less well-served areas.

While the amendment was intended to prevent the nation's airwaves from monopolization by individuals or groups with specific interests or viewpoints, it has, in fact, restrained freedom of expression. In so doing, the American public is being denied its First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The most compelling arguments in favor of granting the full protection of the First Amendment to radio and television licensees are set forth in the dissenting opinion of Chief Judge David Bazelon in &quot;Brandywine-Mainline Radio v. Federal Communications Commission&quot;. Numerous examples of the inhibiting effects of the Fairness Doctrine can be  cited, including executive level suppression of bold or controversial programing. The Fairness Doctrine has been justified on the basis of the limited number of frequencies available for assignment to licensees. However, there are currently 7,458 broadcasting stations in contrast to 1,749 daily newspapers. Most Americans now consider television and radio to be their most important news source. There is no factual basis for continuing to distinguish the printed word from the electronic press as the true news media. Television should, therefore, be emancipated from the Fairness Doctrine.

In order to assess the bibliographic search process of students, a questionnaire and log form were given to 55 undergraduate students at Bucknell University's Bertrand Library. Forty-seven students completed the log and questionnaire. Each of the 39 usable responses was examined, evaluated, and rated on the basis of six rating scales concerning the statement of the research topic and the conduct of the search. A number of conclusions can be drawn from the information gathered. In general students seem poorly skilled in use of a college library. Instructions on how to use the library seem to have little effect. Students at Bucknell tend to search the card catalog most frequently  by subject. Students seem unskilled in translating their questions into terms compatible with the library system. Students frequently fail to consult appropriate, key bibliographic information sources. Logical progression and systematic approaches to checking sources of information often appear to be absent. The conception of research on the part of many students appears to be limited and unsophisticated. (DC)",

The curriculum is based upon a series of segments, each of which contains several conceptual or topical strands. Thus, for example, one segment of the first-grade curriculum contains four strands, Number Concepts, Addition, Subtraction, and Application. Behavioral objectives are established for each strand. Student responses are both oral and written. Class observation and pupil response data will be used to revise the lessons currently being tested. Each segment will be considered individually and in relation to the entire curriculum. Preliminary work is underway in the  analysis of lesson scripts. The dimensions of the broadcasts to be analyzed are: (a) attitude of the sender, (b) expected behavior of the receiver, (c) language and codes through which the message is expressed, (d) the subject of the message, (e) the contact established between the sender and the receiver, and (f) the form of the message.

        "description":"The relationship between individualized instruction (II) and letter grades is an issue of considerable debate. Ultimately, II and the letter grade system are incompatible. Grading has been a traditional form for ranking or comparing students with respect to performance criteria. The scale typically has been A to F, whereas with individualized instruction grades are usually either A or B. Because II does not rank its students, grades are not &quot;grades&quot; in the traditional sense, but rather are rewards for successfully completing a learning experience. Alternatives for grading II have limitations and disadvantages similar to traditional grading practices. Therefore, it may be best to deemphasize grades in individualized instruction. To do without grades entirely, however, could lead  to some student learning and motivation problems. Because the credentialling function is important in higher education, substitute procedures for that function must be developed if traditional grading practices are eliminated. Such procedures must include frequent and rapid feedback mechanisms for the student. A good case can be made for reducing the frequent and rapid feedback mechanisms for the student. A good case can be made for reducing the frequency of grading in the classroom, and in its place establishing a testing service that would occasionally examine, rank, and report on the academic ability of undergraduates. The concept is particularly suited to II, as both the testing service and II would focus upon specific instructional objectives. (DC)",

Attention was paid to the legal requirements which influence the environment of library networks in general and interstate operations in particular. Three legal patterns were considered: the non-profit corporation, a federal regional authority, and the device of an interstate compact. A relatively new approach, the federal-interstate compact was selected as the most attractive legal base for a regional library agency. Some recommendations for future action and an outline of the compact's provisions are  included.

Yet there is a mismatch between the information needs and the information that is available. To assess information needs, a conceptual framework must be built. Information is defined as a symbol or set of symbols which has the potential for meaning. Finding a useful definition of information needs has been elusive, and the continued study of information needs in various contexts, together with the process by which information is communicated, is important. While there are no uniformly acceptable procedures for determining information needs, the methodologies of the social have direct applications. Many studies have been done concerning information needs. There may be conveniently classified in  one of the following categories: science, social science, the professions, or the general public. The emphasis of past studies clusters into four groupings: (1) the behavior of the user, (2) the nature, amount and source of information being sought, (3) the quality of the information, and (4) the timeliness of the information. Given the findings of past needs studies, 12 guidelines for the design of information systems are presented. (DC)",

Part I of the survey involved the correlation of the aims and goals of North Dakota medical education programs with generally accepted guidelines for medical library development. Questionnaires were also distributed to health care personnel to elicit their opinions about the scope of resources and services desired in a health science library. Part II of the survey involved the on-site evaluation of predominantly medical and health-related library facilities within the state, examining them according to four  categories which correspond to sections of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) guidelines: library resources, library services, physical facilities, and personnel. Results indicated that the greatest present need is the recruiting of qualified library personnel.

The system would perform all the serials control functions: bibliographic control, check-in of current receipts, claiming for gaps in receipts and late issues, binding notification for completed sets, subscription renewal, payment control of invoices, and the reporting of statistical data. After two years of operation, the GE 235 computer was converted to a CDC 3300. The NYSL system requires 85 data elements and is primarily a control record with some bibliographic data. Data base creation was the most time-consuming task, as it involved gathering data from diverse files and generating control data for claiming and binding. The experience of  NYSL has shown the effectiveness of a KWIC Index for multiple access to the file and practical use of Computer Output on Microfilm. Samples of conversion forms, system outputs, flow charts, a list of data elements, and record layouts are contained in appendixes. (Author/KC)",

For some U.S. publishers (Scientific and professional societies, university presses, commercial publishers, and information industry vendors) there has been the problem of achieving an equitable return for granting the Soviets the rights to continue reproducing 270 U.S. scientific and technical journals to satisfy over 100,000 subscriptions in the U.S.S.R. and East European countries. For others, there has been the problem of securing at minimum cost the rights to continue translating over 150 Soviet  journals for the benefit of the U.S. English-reading scientific and technical community. Although initial uncertainties about Soviet negotiating plans and strategy have been reduced by passage of time, accumulation of negotiating experience by U.S. publishers, and the communication of relevant information between U.S. publishers and the Federal Government, less than one fifth of U.S. publishers have completed agreements with the U.S.S.R. A chart giving the status of reproduction rights for 164 U.S. journals is appended. (Author/DGC)",

At least a dozen new community information centers have been established in urban areas with various funding sources and administrative organizations. The future of the public library as one of perhaps several dispensaries of community information is promising, as there is a need for such services and many libraries are ready to meet this need. With sufficient attention given to staff training, staff for these programs may be recruited from the neighborhood. Not every library is suited to this utilization, nor should be. Information on  community resources is often not in print, and must be sought out, compiled, and continuously updated. Computers are well suited to this sort of function, and, once put into a computer, these services can be sold. It is recommended that librarians develop methods of cost accounting on the services to aid in future program development. (KC)",

Potential benefits from such a merger were felt to be economic, political, social, and educational. The investigator found that these schools were not yet ready for such a merger. Several alternative courses of action were suggested which would allow the schools to begin preparing for such a move as painlessly as possible. Supporting the study is a methodology for analyzing library cooperative proposals including a questionnaire, interview techniques, a statistical analysis of  acquisition (on-order) files to determine potential overlap, a processing diary study, flow process charts, a staff dispersion study, cost analysis, and a policies and procedures analysis chart.

It is assumed that the network has an ARPANET-like configuration; that is, that specialized processors at each node are responsible for message switching and network control. The purpose of the control software is to oversee network operations--for example to keep track of message queues and switching functions, to tag messages with addresses and insure that they arrive error-free, and to avoid disruption of network functions where a node or communications line is inoperative. The design presented is intended to insure both efficient use of the network communication resources and attractiveness to users. To achieve the goal of efficiency,  the packet reservation scheme for computer communication by satellite is implemented. To gain the objective of attractiveness, the control software has been designed to make network operations essentially invisible to the user. (Author/DGC)",

Achievement was evaluated by exam grades, adjusted for SAT math scores and math pretest scores. Questionnaires were used to gauge student attitudes toward the course. To determine long range effects of the rwo instructional methods, an analysis was made of the progress of the students, in terms of choice of physics classes, was designed to measure content and behavior under AT and LRL instruction, to show variations between the two methods, and  to determine interrelationships among student achievement, student evaluation of teachers, and teacher behavior. Results indicated that AT and LRL lead to similar levels of achievement, but students with low math aptitude did better under AT while high math achievers did better under LRL.

        "description":"A series of experiments to discover the optimal learning situation were conducted using computer-assisted instruction based on a mathematical model. The instructional systems were adaptive in that the sequence of instruction varied according to a given student's performance history, and the program was organized to modify itself automatically as more students completed their course and their records were fed back. Courses taught included computer programing for the junior-college level, reading for the first three grades of elementary school, and a foreign-language vocabulary program for colleges. It was concluded that an optimal learning situation could be designed if the following elements were clearly specified: (1) the set of admissible instruction actions; (2) the  instructional objectives; (3) a measurement scale that permits costs to be assigned to each of the instructional actions and payoffs to the achievements of instructional objectives; (4) a model of the learning process. It was further concluded that a learning situation will result only if it is realized that the instructional theory must be modified to fit the learning process and that the theory of instruction will influence research on learning.

The program has been successful in factoring polynomials (in simplified form) with a maximum of 84 terms, each term consisting of as many as five variables and a maximum degree of 67. The complexity of this learning task placed unusual requirements on the representation of heuristics. Using the first-order predicate calculus notation permitted the creation and modification of heuristics dynamically during program execution. Constraints on the creation process are implemented in a series of tables by which one can alter the flexibility given to the program. Execution of heuristics begins with a translation of the predicate calculus representation to a reverse Polish string, followed by the  interpretive evaluation of the Polish string. A general procedure for developing and implementing the predicate calculus representation is suggested. (Author)",

Individuals from Black Efforts for Soul on Television and the National Association of Black Media Producers opposed the renewals, claiming that programing offered by AETC did not serve the needs of Alabama's minority population. The commission found the licensee had under-represented blacks at both production and planning levels, and excluded most black-oriented programing available from other sources. The AETC disclaimed responsibility for programing decisions of contract stations and maintained it had been unaware of discriminatory policies. The FCC held the AETC  accountable, and though noting improvements since the end of the license term, denied renewal on the basis of performance during the term. The AETC was granted interim authority to continue station operation, until new applications could be processed. Dissenting opinions are included. (KC)",

It could aid in financing through increased state and federal funding and in personnel management, selection, and training through programs for library education. It could encourage utilization of technology and accelerate interlibrary and interinstitutional cooperation through a coordinated network of networks.

The highly specialized collections and skills of a special librarian should be the major contribution of special libraries to national cooperation, but some libraries may make only financial contributions to networking.

Because of these special circumstances, research libraries may not be able to permit the general public access mentioned in the National Program for Library and Information Services.

The Cosmetic Approach would supplement disciplinary preparation with elective courses on community colleges, but it would not be a complete degree program. The Standard Approach provides a degree program which would include courses emphasizing breadth in a discipline, educational theory and practice, and the historical, psychological, sociological, and educational aspects of the community college, as well as internships and inservice programs. The Center Approach would contain all of the aspects of the Standard  Approach, but would include a research requirement. The annotated, cross-referenced bibliography contains books, articles, dissertations, and speeches from the 1950's to the present, which have been chosen either for their representative nature or for their potential usefulness in developing a program.

        "description":"There is an obvious need for a valid, realistic model for research on the occupational needs of the community for relevant time periods to provide planners with quantified data on which to base decisions. The purpose of this study is to develop a statewide system to: (1) identify job needs at the local community level, and (2) relate job needs to training programs in the educational system. The assessment of both urban and rural community needs is difficult to derive. This model focuses on the local community, and that community's educational training system, as opposed to many other models which focus on the state or national level. Basic data sources that appear most useful in occupational needs assessments are Florida Department of Commerce quarterly employment reports, Bureau  of Labor Statistics labor market trends, local Florida State Employment Service offices Job Bank data, and the U.S. Labor Department Manpower Administration forecasting documentation. This model is of interest not only to educators and manpower specialists, but also to any planner who is concerned either with the supply of trained persons or demand for training services.

These causes can be grouped as self-related and college-related. Self-related factors involve actual and perceived ability, background and motivation for college, family influences and expectations, and previous school experience. College-related factors are those which bear on the student after he arrives on campus. Being a composite of interaction between self and peer groups, faculty, curricula, and institutional practices and mores, in which expectations are tightly interwoven, these factors are far more difficult to evaluate and change for the better. The persister and the dropout are mainly distinguished by respective success in  adapting to a situation, in establishing satisfactory personal relationships, and in adjusting goals in light of realities. Psychological counseling, compensatory education programs, sound financial counseling, and vocational and professional awareness sessions must be seen as integral parts of any college situation. One may only conclude that too many students are being lost from the ranks of today's colleges, and the problem is at least partly solvable. (Author/AH)",

Suggestions and recommendations made in that initial report and the subsequent actions taken on them make up the body of the discussion. Along with a review of organizational and budgeting matters, of special interest is the discussion of the Alaskan community colleges, which are part of the University of Alaska system. The community colleges have emerged from university extension centers, and the philosophy of extension education is still influential in the new colleges. Although both transfer and career programs are available, funding for courses that are applicable to baccalaureate degrees is significantly easier to obtain. Occupational programs have not  received as much emphasis as they need, and it seems desirable that vocational education be taken into the community college programs. Statewide planning and more specific attention by the regents is needed to make sure the community college system is organized for optimum efficiency and service. Toward that end, certain defined limits of autonomy must be allotted to the colleges to allow them to respond quickly to local needs. (MJK)",

A conceptual model comparing the laissez-faire, or traditional system, with the CCM delivery system is used as a backdrop for comparing Harper's ideas with those concepts utilized in the present system of higher education. Harper recognized the limitations of individualism in education which resulted in wasted resources as each institution attempted to be all things to all men. Instead, Harper envisioned principles  such as complementary individualism of institutions, coordinated educational planning, interinstitutional resource sharing, institutional conservation (as opposed to the present Darwinistic system whereby the weak institutions are weeded out), and campus intermigration, to be key guidelines in the ultimate development of higher education.

In order to ascertain faculty members' attitudes on this subject, a random sample of instructors on the central campus of Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale, Florida were asked to complete two questionnaires concerning their areas of community college instruction and curriculum; one of the instruments was objective in nature, while the other required written, indepth responses. Covered in the surveys were such topics as (1) dealing with underprepared students, (2) programmed and individualized instruction, (3) use of instructional &quot;hardware,&quot; and (4) accountability and student evaluation. Although perhaps 25 percent  of the instructors appear to opt for still more innovative curriculums, the majority indicate that the rate of innovation should be reduced--at least for the immediate future. It is recommended that optimum student achievement can perhaps best be gained from a more moderately innovative approach in the areas of instruction and curriculum. (Author/MJK)",

Forty-seven percent of the students worked 21-40 hours a week; 12 percent did not work at all.

Those who worked over 40 hours and those who did not work at all had the lowest GPA's. On the basis of this investigation there is no clearcut  correlation between students' GPA's and the number of hours worked. Other variables not accounted for in this hypothesis are involved.

At the Hawaiian community colleges, certain changes were made in the methodology of computing FTE for students and faculty, and average class size. They divided the total student credit hours by 15, counted division chairmen as two-thirds FTE, and excluded certain classes such as directed study in the computation of class size. This resulted in a lower FTE for students and faculty and an increase in average class size. By comparing course registration reports, schedules of classes, and faculty-staff reports, it was determined that faculty workload has stabilized at about 16.4 class contact hours or 13.3 credit hours taught.  Generally, a lighter teaching load was noted for instructors in terms of hours and faculty-student ratio. But statewide community college figures show considerable increases in all areas: number of students, faculty, courses, classes, etc. Tabular data are presented, showing general FTE information as well as more detailed breakdown for each campus in terms of subject areas taught.

        "description":"The rhetoric of the community colleges presents them as democratizing agents, enabling the underprivileged to move upward in society through education. While this is their purpose, the community colleges also aspire to gain acceptance as regular members of the system of higher education. In Connecticut, the image of the community colleges suffers for several reasons: (1) they must compete with university 2-year transfer institutions; (2) they are not allowed to duplicate the technical colleges' role; (3) they are housed in substandard buildings where no courses requiring equipment are possible; (4) their per capita expenditures are the lowest among state institutions. Their role in social equalization is hampered by the desire to approximate 4-year institutions in student body  makeup, implying a need to avoid high minority enrollments. The faculty is demoralized by a hierarchical governance structure in which it has no power. High turnover and constant tensions among faculty, administration, and students, and an absence of effective leadership have prevented the colleges from developing a clear sense of purpose. This study, based on statewide research as well as a case study of South Central Community College, casts doubt on whether equal opportunity can be fostered under such conditions. (MJK)",

Some of the benefits and potential benefits in the area of student development, faculty development, and community development are suggested, and some of the practical problems of implementation are discussed. Research is classified by methodology and objectives. Methodology is broken down into empirical studies or library research. Objectives of research are classified in terms of subject matter research, pedagogical research, or a combination of the two. It is suggested that the kind of research which combines  intellectual inquiry into one's subject field with the process and substance of instruction and/or community service holds the most potential benefit for most faculty members. This type of research focuses on the need for academic renewal, keeping abreast of the subject field, or intellectual revitalization as an essential part of staff development. (Author/AH)",

Each group in this private women's college was asked to rank, in terms of expectations they held, the following items: learn job skills, mature in relations with others, become more sure of self, clarify goals and values, and become a better student. While parents of resident students were concerned that their daughters clarify goals, parents of commuter students ranked job skills highest. Entering students in general also ranked job skills first and becoming a better student last. In answer to the request for comments, parents showed concern for their daughters' personal growth, students expected career  preparation, and staff concentrated their comments on implementation of these goals.

The selected financial data and related nonfinancial data describing the fiscal operation of community colleges as projected for 1974-75 are summarized. The paper is organized around five topics: Costs in Perspective, Allocation of Resources, Sources of Revenue, Enrollment Data and Output Measures, and Facilities and Capital Data. New Jersey's community colleges have experienced dramatic growth over the 6-year period 1969-75 in both enrollments (290 percent) and operating costs (400 percent), and in the years 1973-75, costs have far exceeded enrollments. This and other trends are expected to continue. More money will be allocated to physical plant  and general expense, less to instruction. While student tuition will continue at 25 percent of educational costs, the remaining 75 percent is shifting from the state to the counties. More students will enroll in career programs and elect to study part-time. Expansion of facilities will reflect the moderate enrollment growth now being experienced. Data is presented throughout the study in tabulated form. (Author/MJK)",

The 313 Pensacola Junior College freshman for whom 1970 Reading Index Scores on the Florida Twelfth Grade Test were available, and who had completed a minimum of 12 hours course work in both the fall and spring terms, 1971-72, were used as subjects. The criterion for academic performance was the cumulative GPA. On the basis of the criteria used and the resultant findings, it was concluded that: (1) The Reading Index Score was found to be a significant predictor of the cumulative GPA in the freshman year of college in terms of the institution participating  in this study; (2) The linear trend showed that 23 percent of the variation in GPA could be accounted for by variance in the Reading Index Score. The report includes a review of the literature as well as tabular data and a discussion of the statistical methods. (Author/MJK)",

There are three plans which provide regular work experience related to college studies and career goals. The Alternative Semester pattern allows two students to hold one full-time position by exchanging work and study schedules every semester. The Parallel Plan is coordinated to allow a student to work part-time and study part-time. In the Extended Day or Evening College New Careers pattern, special arrangements are made for college studies related to full-time employment. The employers cooperate in work assignments and supervision. Learning retention, academic success, career and affirmative action opportunities, and alternative education possibilities  for the nontraditional college student have all improved. Two high priority problems have become apparent--the lack of program orientation to include liberal arts transfer students in cooperative education, and the tendency to gear educationally disadvantaged, low-income students away from full upper division and graduate education. One solution to these problems would be to develop cooperative education programs in a broad range of colleges. Progress indicators relating to San Mateo programs and the Bay Area are discussed.

This practicum sought to demonstrate that computer-based instruction which follows mastery learning principles facilitates student learning and fosters positive student attitudes toward learning.

PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations) is a computer-oriented instructional system that allows instructors  to design individualized lessons for their students. The achievement results of the target group failed to measure up to the goal that 80 percent would achieve mastery. Technical difficulties hampered the results.

Approximately 85 percent of the occupations in Navaho County do not require the baccalaureate degree and thus fall within the realm of community college educational responsibility. Because of the sparse population, the limited resources, the extreme distances between communities, and a lack of a center of population, the following recommendations are made: (1) learning centers should be established in several communities; (2) a core curriculum of information necessary in a variety of occupations should be developed; (3) specialized education should be organized so it may be taught in concentrated sessions; (4) cooperative education and shared  facilities with high schools should be exploited; (5) the availability of educational opportunities to the people must be placed in high priority. Programs in business, automotive, heavy equipment maintenance, construction trades, and health must be offered. These recommendations are based on existing information on occupations and manpower needs in the county, white and nonwhite (Indian) population distribution, and a previous aspiration study of high school students.

Section 1 presents a hypothetical case study of a community college which practices several unique authority-use variations that are in actual use in two-year colleges around the country. The cluster college scheme, a new strategy for participative management, and management by objectives are presented in Section 2. Section 3 addresses itself to several broader implications of community college organization. All areas of discussion are supplementary by the identification and description of those colleges who have implemented and are practicing the variations set forth. The paper is designed to be a practical guide to viable alternatives verified by organizational  practice, thereby being of particular interest to those contemplating organizational restructuring, those planning organizational and authority-use design, and those preparing to enter a community college leadership position.

Enrollment increases were greater among day students (17.6 percent) than evening students (10.9 percent), reversing the pattern of last year. Female enrollment increased more sharply than male enrollment and part-time enrollment growth exceeded full-time growth. The average age of district students increased from 26.6 in fall 1973 to 27.7 in fall 1974; especially dramatic increases were evident in the enrollment of students aged 50 and over. Weekly student contact hours (WSCH) increased 9.5 percent this fall. Day WSCH per student declined throughout the district while evening contact hours per student increased. Possible explanations for the  enrollment increase are: (A) increased Outreach programs, (B) increased recruitment efforts by colleges, (C) a shift of students to less expensive forms of education, (D) a perceived need by students to establish or upgrade vocational skills in the face of a &quot;tight&quot; job market, and (E) augmented student aid programs.

        "description":"The purposes of the first annual Pennsylvania conference on postsecondary occupational education were to consider the role of area vocational schools, 2-year colleges, and senior colleges in a total program of occupational education; to provide participants an opportunity to exchange ideas on the various typics; to improve the expertise of the participants; and to initiate a series of cooperative ventures between the Pennsylvania State University and other Pennsylvania institutions which are aimed at contributing to the overall improvement of occupational education. To achieve these objectives 20 papers were presented concerning the role of community colleges in occupational education, cooperative education programs, career planning and vocational guidance, organizational and  administrative patterns, and curriculum advisory committees. The text of the papers, an evaluation of the conference, the conference program, its registration list, and its advisory committee are presented in the report. (AH)",

The ACO acts as a liaison between junior and senior educational institutions in an effort to make the articulation process easier for the students involved. As of 1974, Florida was the only state to have an ACO in each of its nine public universities. This study reviews literature pertinent to college transfer and presents the characteristics, workloads, roles, responsibilities, information needs, and problems of ACO personnel in Florida.

        "description":"This study assesses the curriculum strategies indicated by the intellectual orientation and personality dimensions of students in a Health Technology Program at a community college. When designing curriculum, educators in allied health programs frequently overlook the characteristics of the students the program must serve. This study explores the influence of several dimensions of personality, as measured by the Omnibus Personality Inventory, and the effect these behavioral attributes might have on academic success. The Inventory Instrument uses 14 scales to measure personality and intellectual dispositions. The mean and standard deviations for each scale of the Inventory and Grade Point Average were plotted for the students, and the composite student (or mean score) was plotted  on an Inventory Graph, showing the distribution of students in medical laboratory technology by types and degrees of learning orientation. The practicum presents a learning process for medical laboratory technology students based on program goals and student characteristics including a sample program for learning hematology. The author suggests that the results and the recommendations from this practicum are applicable to other associate degree health technology programs. (Author/MJK)",

Part 1 evaluates the social, economic, and educational needs for general, technical, and occupational training and education. Existing institutions are currently working at near capacity even though student damand is low. Demand is increasing as Maine's economic base requires more technically trained personnel. This study assesses current facilities and examines the approaches taken by other New England states to determine how best to facilitate new programs. Off-campus locations, temporary facilities, space shared with established institutions, and educational TV and radio should all be exploited until  enough data from student response can be gathered to indicate the most valuable locations for permanent construction. The second part of this report presents detailed information on the occupational opportunities becoming available, including educational and training requirements for certain jobs.

        "description":"The contractual duties of the department chairman at Rhode Island Junior College (RIJC), as at most public community colleges, place him in three roles: administrator, spokesman for his department, and teacher. Because, as a teacher, he is also a member of the collective bargaining unit, a conflict of role assignments occurs whenever the chairman is the target of some accusatory proceeding. In such a situation, the department chairman has no established protector--he is caught in the middle. Recognition of this problem led the author to survey 19 chairmen at RIJC as to their role perceptions. Significantly, opinion concerning whether or not to remain members of the bargaining unit split almost equally. As a result of chairman questionnaire and interview responses, a review of the  literature, and consultations with faculty, administrators, and others, the author recommends that the chairman retain membership in the collective bargaining unit, that each duty in the contract be specifically labeled as to the role it represents, and that the dilemma of who should provide due process be resolved by providing different support depending on the role under attack. Questionnaires and organizational charts are appended. (Author/DC)",

Average proprietary instructional costs were 35 percent less than public costs: they concentrated on specific, short, intensive job training and tended to work their teachers more and to pay them less. Proprietary schools recruited and seemed to hold the less-advantaged student better. Other findings include: (1) Only 2 of 10 graduates of either kind of school who chose professional or technical-level training ever got those jobs; (2) Almost 8 of 10 graduates of either kind of school who chose lower-level clerical or service worker  programs got those jobs, but most earned less than the federal minimum wage; (3) Public and proprietary school graduates had about the same occupational success, after controlling for differences in their backgrounds; (4) Female graduates always earned less than male graduates and ethnic minorities generally earned less than Whites in the same jobs; (5) Apparently because they paid twenty times more for their courses, proprietary school graduates were generally less satisfied than their public counterparts.

The first innovation is the continuing education unit (CEU), which is a means for providing a uniform measure of recognition to the adult non-credit student. A CEU represents ten contact hours of participation in a continuing education non-credit learning experience under responsible sponsorship, and qualified instruction. Current views on the uses of the CEU, as well as its strengths and weaknesses, are documented. The \"You Can\" Program is an innovative approach to developing a national image or identity for adult continuing education. Some of the expected results of the \"You Can\" concept are an elimination of the fragmentation of effort that often occurs in individual community  programs, and a sense of cooperation among all continuing education groups.

Six hundred fifty-six faculty members, representing a response rate of 51 percent, and ninety-three administrators responded to instruments which surveyed biographical data, faculty's perception of their own educational needs, processes utilized by administrators when hiring faculty, and administrators' perceptions of their faculties' educational needs. The study presents the data collected and compares administrator perceptions of faculty to faculty responses. General  results include the finding that two-year college faculty desire to further their own professional education, but that future courses should be relevant to contemporary needs and that course offerings should be more available and accessible than they presently are. The survey instruments, a Faculty Questionnaire and an Administrator Questionnaire, are appended, as well as responses to open-ended questions requiring narrative response.

Twenty-five percent of the respondents reported college attendance prior to enrollment at ACC; 45 percent of these indicated academic difficulties at the prior college. Twenty-two percent of the respondents were presently employed full-time, while 28 percent were continuing their education full-time and 18 percent part-time. Thirty-nine percent of the respondents had already earned additional degrees since leaving  ACC. Fifty percent of those employed were working in the field of their ACC preparation, 31 percent were not, and 19 percent said they did not prepare for any particular field. Overall experience at ACC was rated highly by 89 percent of the respondents. The highest ratings were given in the areas of curriculum and instruction. Student services were less highly rated. (BB)",

Article 126, the Community College Law, which established this tri-partite structure, now needs revision in two directions. It must clarify the powers and duties of local trustees vis-a-vis local sponsors; local sponsors presently tend to usurp powers proper to trustees. And, it must clarify the distinctions between the State Board's roles and duties as the governing board of SUNY and as a coordinating state-level board for community colleges; the blurring of these roles and  duties leads the State Board to forget that the community colleges are not integral parts of the State University and that they cannot be treated as such. The Regents should act to effect these changes, but the main burden for legislative change will rest on the local trustees themselves. The main locus of governance must be retained by strong local boards of trustees and they must stand up for their rights and for what they know is best for their institutions. (DC)",

All 707 of the newly enrolled first time students were surveyed. It was found that the typical ACC full-time entering student attends ACC because it is close to home. He or she is the only college student in his family, is single, and lives at home. He/she is not supported by parents and thus plans to work while in school and needs financial aid. This student, a public high school graduate, wants to study business, social science, or education, and plans to transfer to a four year college. He/she needs educational and vocational counseling, as well as help with reading and study skills. The report also compares ACC student characteristics to  nationwide characteristics. They are more likely to be from poorer homes dependent upon public assistance. They receive less money from their parents and fewer are claimed as dependents by their parents. (ER)",

Former students who had been enrolled at Laney College for at least one term between Spring 1972 and Summer 1973 were invited by letter to reenroll, and 2,668 (14%) of the total population of 19,812 were surveyed by telephone to ascertain the reasons for their nonreturning status. The survey showed that females in the sample had a slightly greater tendency not to return than the males. The majority of nonreturnees were in the age bracket twenty to twenty-five years. The two major reasons for not returning to college were employment (39%), and transfer to another school (23%); other reasons cited included moving to another area, family responsibilities, and enlisting  in the service, as well as perceived poor quality of the college. Of least importance were the two areas within the scope of the college: lack of availability of a course or program (3.6%) and \"too hard or failing\" (1%). It was concluded that \"drop out\" seems an invalid term to be applied to the nonreturning student, since the term \"drop out\" implies failure of the student as well as of the college. (ER)",

Justification for conversion lies in the separate missions of the community college and the four-year college and in the strengths of both types of institutions which allow them to be of benefit to a particular clientele. Articulation of transfer students from community college to the four-year school is also cited as a major problem which could be resolved through the formation of the communiversity. Basic ingredients for the communiversity would include: (1) Being within commuting distance of the people it means to serve; (2) Running a full program from early morning to late evening; (3)  Charging low tuition; and (4) Giving equal standing to both \"academic\" and \"non-academic\" credit. Three problems the communiversity might solve are overstaffing, overproduction of graduate degrees, and lowering freshman enrollments. For community college faculty, the communiversity is seen as an opportunity for job improvement and expansion of course offerings. Administrators are seen as welcoming the challenge of new problems presented by communiversity. (AH)",

Nearly half of the students were eigher presently enrolled in higher education or had graduated from a four-year institution. Transfer students success at other two- and four-year schools show MCCC students to be well prepared; grade-point averages reveal remarkable consistency between  performance at Macomb and the four-year transfer institutions.

The system operates within defined parameters: items negotiated in collective bargaining are excluded from consideration in the Ad Hocracy, as the governance model is intended to complement rather than replace the collective bargaining process; the overriding intent of the system is to augment existing authority, not circumvent it; full and open voluntary participation must be insured. The three  mechanisms for dealing with institutional problems--the administrative action mechanism, the \"trial balloon\" mechanism, and the ad hoc committee mechanism--are presented in full.

After identifying the extent of representation by bargaining agents, the year in which first faculty collective bargaining contracts have been signed, and distinguishing among four-year and two-year institutions and public and private ones, the current status of state collective bargaining legislation is summarized, with an eye toward how much more activity may be generated as additional permissive state legislation is enacted. The main thrust deals with &quot;who bargains with whom&quot; rather than &quot;about what.&quot; Three organizations that have emerged as the major contenders for the representation of faculty interests in collective  bargaining, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association, and the American Association of University Professors, are discussed in terms of national positions as well as numbers of contracts negotiated. Independent bargaining representatives are similarly reviewed.

The first report presents records gathered during four representative two-week, non-examination periods from 1967 to 1974, which show that a daily average of 19% of the students used the library. In 1974, however, average daily library use was 28%, almost double that of the prior three sample periods (15%) and half again greater than the average rate (19%) for all four sample periods; this is attributed to the fact that instructors are now giving examinations on required reading. The ratio of number of books circulated per student averaged 18:1 and the yearly collection-usage-rate averaged 45% during the past four academic years. The second report presents a comparative analysis of library  circulations by subject category for five academic years, 1969-70 through 1972-73. Largest circulation categories reflect courses which are required of many students. Thus, literature, children's books, and social science books are the most frequently circulated because English is a core requirement for all programs offered, Early Childhood Education has been until quite recently the largest single curriculum offered, and social science courses are core requirements for 17 of the 26 programs offered at the college.

Responses on tests of reading ability, logical reasoning ability, and academic motivation, were used to place students in groups representing low ability or motivation (under 40 percentile), average ability or motivation (40-60 percentile), and high ability or motivation (over 60 percentile). All entering students indicate whether they need assistance in various categories, including reading. It is not clearly shown that students who ask for assistance do better or worse than those  who do not ask for assistance. Reading speed and comprehension are shown to be clearly related to academic success. Student scoring above the 60th percentile in reading ability are much less likely to drop out. There appeared to be a lack of awareness on the part of students with low reading ability that they do not read as well as more successful students.

        "description":"The Project 60 group was an experimental group of 53 disadvantaged students who would not have been admitted to Middlesex Community College through the regular admissions procedures. They had a high school average of 1.7 and were largely below average in reading, math, and composition, both in high school grades and individual testing. Project 60 students participated in a special summer session of skill building, motivational aids, and counseling, before going on to regular college courses. A control group drawn from regularly enrolled students was matched with Project 60 students with respect to town of residence, age, and sex. The success of the Project 60 students was not too different from the regularly enrolled students. At the end of the second year, 45% of the regularly  enrolled students had dropped out, compared with 55% of the Project 60 students. Thirty-nine percent of the regularly enrolled students graduated, compared to 15% of the Project 60 students, but 30% of the Project 60 group was still in attendance and intended to graduate. The academic achievement and persistence of both groups of students showed little relation to their high school records or to their scores on the ability test. A special summer session of skill building and motivational aids appears to give disadvantaged students a good chance for college success. (AH)",

Forty-eight 4-years-old were divided into two groups. In the blocked presentation condition, items were presented in category sets of three items, with all items from a single category on cards of one color. In the random presentation condition, cards were also presented in sets blocked on color, but the items on each set were members of different conceptual categories. Results indicated that nonmeaningful recall cues affected young children's typical ways of organizing materials for recall, in ways that either facilitated or were detrimental to the organization and recall of category items. Cues with no meaningful relationship to items  cued cannot serve effectively as \"reminders\" of another category unit, unlike meaningful cues which have been shown in a number of studies to increase the number of categories represented in recall. Nonmeaningful cues can work like meaningful cues with young children in helping them to organize their recalls and, thus, increase the amount recalled from these categories that are assessed. (ED)",

The subjects were 48 infants (24 boys and 24 girls) between 8 and 13 months of age. Most were children of Cornell University faculty or graduate students, but a broad range of families from a small city in upstate New York was represented. Before an infant was tested for stranger response, his mother was interviewed in her home. Interview questions were designed to provide measures pertinent to five general hypotheses about determinants of individual differences in reactions to strangers. These hypotheses were: (1) Infants who have had little exposure to people would be more likely to be upset by strangers. (2)  Babies who protest separation from mother would be more likely to be upset by strangers. (3) Strangers who are visually quite similar to the appropriate sexed parent would be more upsetting to the baby because of cognitive confusion on the baby's part. (4) Infants who are irritable or sensitive would be more likely to be upset by a stranger. (5) Infants whose mothers are protective about strangers would transmit their concern to their infant. A few days after each interview, systematic observation was made of each infant's reaction to two unfamiliar adults. Detailed behavioral descriptions of the reactions were recorded. (CS)",

First, a preliminary structural definition of behavioral development involving a certain domain of elementary phenomena (\"behavioral events in living systems\") and a certain elementary relation (\"precedes in time\") is presented and rationalized. Second, formal models derived from the continuous connected straight line of classical mathematics are constructed for each of the following assertations: (1) Behavioral development is continuous. (2) Behavioral development is discontinuous. (3) Behavioral development is partially  discontinuous. Third, the differences between the respective formal models are summarized. It is shown that each of the three models can be applied to any narrowly defined behavioral content area whatsoever and that, taken together, the models entail a new empirical approach to the old question of whether or not behavioral development in this or that content area is continuous.

The recent &quot;structuralist movement&quot; in the social sciences has also tended to cloud the meaning of structure rather than to clarify it. Using Whitehead's and Russell's logic, the concept of &quot;structure&quot; is analyzed in terms of &quot;relations&quot; and &quot;elements&quot;, and it is emphasized that neither one can be reduced to the other. The remainder of the paper considers the question of how the concept of cognitive structure enters into Piaget's global vision of intellectual development. Differences between Piaget's vaguely typological conception of cognitive structure and the analytic uses of structure as  developed earlier in the paper are pointed out. The premise that &quot;different structure=different stage&quot; is questioned as a working hypothesis for researchers. Recent developmental studies of Piaget's stage-related reasoning skills have failed to confirm the structure-stage connection. (CS)",

The results obtained indicated that the unit-order model used might prove useful in studying the relative effectiveness of mnemonics and  cognitive processing across age groups. Of particular interest are the findings that: (1) children who received mnemonic instructions showed superior recall to learn-only subjects; and (2) simple transformations (imagery) were more effective at all age levels than more complex coding strategies (clustering and narrative).

After an enumeration of the specific faults implicit in the present paradigm for motivational research in education, a new research paradigm is suggested which emphasizes the influence of cognitive processes on motivation. Also stressed is the need to develop a cognitive functionalism that is as precise as behavioral functionalism while not  being immobilized by a mechanistic conception of man. Recommended research areas are: (1) intermediate difficulty, (2) intention, (3) intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation, (4) stages in achievement behavior, (5) the building of effort structures, (6) causal attributions for success and failure, (7) long-term motivational effects, and (8) achievement strivings among females.

Among theorists, there has been increasing agreement and repetition of findings that a child with perceptual-motor dysfunction has difficulty in the reception, integration, or response of stimuli, or a combination of these. Clumsiness, inability to attend to a task or screen inappropriate stimuli, hyperactivity, poor body image, visual disturbances, and poor bilateral  integration are some of the more generalized and frequently mentioned characteristics.

It postulates that teachers and schools have a demonstrated investment in socializing children to a passive, docile, and dependent role, beginning at the preschool level. This role, called \"pupil role,\" corresponds closely to the traditional female sex role and is incongruent with the standard male sex role. Thus, boys experience conflict and stress in school while girls accommodate to the passive learning style associated with pupil role. The long-range implications of these differential interactions are discussed along with suggestions from research and theory about the benefits of active over passive learning strategies. Finally, recommendations are offered for  teacher training and school reform. (Author/ED)",

Six models were studied: Bank Street, Far West, High/Scope, and the models of the Universities of Arizona, Kansas, and Oregon. The teachers of the model programs were studied most intensively under the assumption that they would receive the strongest impact of the programs. Two strategies of study were used: teacher observation and interviews with teachers and key personnel, administrators, and some parents. In the presentation of the results concerning which components  of the HSPV models persisted, the models are grouped into &quot;academic&quot; and &quot;child development&quot; categories according to their educational orientation, and the five main findings are reported and explained.

The main focus in studying program implementation is the question of internal validity, whether the children in the HSPV programs actually receive the treatment being evaluated. Several attempts were made to develop an appropriate measure, though none of the measures was found to be completely adequate. Three types of information needed to develop a good measure of implementation were determined: a definitive model description, clear-cut standards of implementation, and judgments concerning comparability within and between models. The problems connected with obtaining this information were described.

In the research model, two major components which affect student achievement were measured: (1) Teacher Knowledge (knowledge of subject being taught and knowledge of teaching); and (2) Teacher Aptitude (verbal, numerical, reasoning, memory, and kinds of divergent production aptitude). It is hypothesized that certain matches between teacher and pupil knowledge, skill, aptitude, and cognitive style tend to facilitate pupil learning. A preliminary factor analysis of the above components indicates that the Teacher Test Battery  developed in conjunction with this research model was actually able to measure these structures. (CS)",

        "description":"This paper describes a series of experiments which indicate how different reinforcement systems affect cooperative, competitive, and individualized learning structures. Following a brief literature review of prior research, the experiments investigated (1) individual reinforcement for peer tutoring and (2) shared-group reinforcement for peer tutoring. They examined the effects of reinforcement by demonstrating how reward structures can interact with several independent variables in controlling the frequency of cooperative behavior. The studies support the idea that children from various socioeconomic classes, 3-to 11-years-old, in classrooms of 4-17 members, can work together effectively in cooperative instructional situations involving curriculum materials such as mathematics,  vocabulary development, and reading. Also, the results indicate that when appropriate reinforcement is provided for cooperative behavior, helping behaviors as well as student performance are increased. Several research topics are suggested for future research on the development and evaluation of cooperative goal structures. (SDH)",

Four steps are suggested as priorities for parenthood: (1) the ability of parents to speak as a group, with self-confidence and some authority on the fate of children and parents; (2) the acquisition of more knowledge and information on parenthood and child development; (3) the reduction of the \"Television Syndrome,\" or an investigation by parents of the  role of TV in their children's lives; and (4) the ability to produce more empathetic and concerned individuals, with an emphasis on positive reinforcement.

(2) Theoretical bases for qualitative improvements in educational design already exist and should be made more readily available to educational researchers. Among the problems considered are: content analysis, performance testing, &quot;far&quot; transfer, learning processes, developmental stages, and instructional methods. These problems are reviewed with respect to the theory of structural learning, and existing or potential  theory-based resolutions of these problems are proposed. The paper is organized as follows: (1) a brief review of the recent history of educational psychology; (2) a partial list of open problems in educational design; (3) a summary of some of the more immediately relevant portions of the author's recent theory of structural learning; and (4) a discussion of how these open problems have, could, or might be resolved via the structural learning theory.

        "description":"A pilot minicourse program was launched for elementary school children aged 8 to 13 years based on the assumption that children learn best when they can practice what they are being taught, and will show an increased interest in school work when they are given a role in the decision-making process. Students went through a \"college style\" registration four times per year, choosing approximately one-fourth of their school curriculum. Each minicourse was scheduled for a 9-week period, meeting from one to three times per week for an average of 45 minutes each. The school was divided into seven Individually Guided Education units (semi-autonomous teaching divisions of four teachers and approximately 100 students), and each unit had a different schedule and course offerings. Other  practices instigated in the program involved the use of community teachers and a clear communication of course requirements and expectations. Major strengths and weaknesses of the program are discussed from the viewpoint of a special area teacher, a parent, and a classroom teacher. In general, the program has proven to be responsive to such concerns as: \"forced\" schooling and its disciplinary consequences, ability levels, scheduling disappointments, the increased responsibility inherent in the children's development of self-assessment and decision-making skills, and the interest and enthusiasm of all involved in the program.

        "description":"The present study was designed to explore the possibility that exposure to the &quot;Misterogers' Neighborhood&quot; program might increase the likelihood of spontaneous imaginative play in preschool children who watched the program over a period of two weeks. The specific focus of this investigation was to determine whether a well-produced professional program would be more effective in enhancing imaginative play than instruction from a live adult. The study involved four varied conditions: (1) a non TV-viewing control group observed in spontaneous play on two occasions separated in time by a period comparable to that taken up by the experimental conditions; (2) a group who watched the Misterogers' show daily over a two-week period; (3) a group who watched the same show daily in the  company of an adult who interacted with the children about content of the performance; and (4) a group who saw no television at school but received a comparable daily time period of fantasy game-playing and practice in imagery with an adult teacher. An analysis of the matrix of intercorrelations between the independent and dependent variables of the study seems to suggest that children in the 3- to 4-year-old age group remain most susceptible to influence by a concerned adult in their presence who can engage them directly and provide them with immediate feedback for their own responses. It is therefore likely that at the very least, television's prosocial or optimal cognitive benefits may have to depend on some mediation by an adult. (Author/CS)",

The relationship between the home and the school is fostered primarily in two ways: through parental involvement in the Saturday School teaching team once every two months and through the home teaching visits. A crucial component of the program is the early identification and diagnosis of handicaps or potential learning problems; a battery of evaluation instruments have been developed for this purpose. Evaluation results suggest that the program of parent involvement has helped parents to be more accepting of their children, more aware of their needs, and more competent in their interactions with their children. Information from the second project year  indicates that 85 percent of the parents were at the end of the year using appropriate teaching techniques, using positive motivation and reinforcement, and accomplishing the task assigned.

The thesis is based on the fact that too many independent variables exist in a classroom situation to allow precise measurement. The case study involved 23 sixth graders and their teacher, who referred himself and his class for help on behavioral management and instruction because he was concerned with students' resistance to work and hostility toward himself. Baseline data taken over a 5-day period produced certain assumptions about the class. From these assumptions, specific recommendations about the teacher's instructional presentation and the assigned work period were made in  an effort to engineer behavior change and increase the students' grades. Subsequently, math grades and behavior did improve. A reversal to conditions prior to the experimental changes again produced disruptive behavior and poor grades. The findings were considered to be a result of the experimental conditions, but which of the conditions produced the change could not be discerned.

        "description":"This study examines the influence of maternal predispositions toward sex-appropriate behavior and the mother's response to \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" cues in infant behavior. In the investigation, one 6-month-old male infant was presented to 11 mothers who served as subjects. The infant was dressed as either boy (blue clothes) and named Adam, or dressed in a pink dress and named Beth. The two theories tested were: (1) if mothers react only to the infants' cues, their behavior with the child should not differ significantly; and (2) if mothers act on the basis of preconceptions, differential treatment of \"Beth\" and \"Adam\" would be expected. The mothers were observed and tape recorded while playing with the child and interviewed after the play period. The results indicated that  mothers do behave differently toward infants on the basis of the infant's perceived sex in the areas of toy choice and social stimulation. They do not, however, report consistent observed differences in the behavior of boys and girls at 6 months of age. Also, mothers do not seem to be aware of their differential treatment of male and female infants. (SDH)",

Subjects were 242 third-grade children from 11 randomly chosen classrooms. Twenty-one per cent of the children were black. A roster-and-rating scale technique adapted from Roistacher was employed to collect data from the children on two sociometric questions: \"How much do you like to play with this person at school?\" and \"How much do you like to work with this person at school?\" Results indicated that sex had a considerable, consistent influence on the sociometric choices for work and play. Race was also a significant factor, but it was neither as strong nor as consistent as the  sex influence. Also, the data provided support for the use of more than one sociometric choice criterion and suggested questions concerning the goals and techniques of integration. Implications for future research are presented. (SDH)",

        "description":"Children's use of humor in hospital settings and ways hospital personnel might encourage positive uses of humor are discussed in this paper. Three questions are raised: (1) How is humor viewed in hospitals treating children? (2) How can developmental psychology help us understand children's humor? (3) What implications does an understanding of children's humor have for how we work with children in hospitals? Responses to these questions are based on general studies of humor; literature on children's emotional reactions to hospitalization; interviews with parents, hospital personnel, and children; random observation in a nursery school; and participant observations of children of different ages in three hospital playrooms. Four developmental stages corresponding to Piagetian  stages of cognitive development are identified (Infants/Toddlers, Preschool, Elementary School, and Adolescence), and the type of humor characteristic of each is described. It is emphasized that if we can begin to understand that humor is different for children at different ages, and can emphasize the positive functions of humor for children in hospitals (for adaptation to a new situation, building relationships, seeking explanations for one's condition, gaining mastery), then we can both initiate and appreciate humor with children as we work with them in hospital settings.

        "description":"The study attempted to minimize nonspecific response strategies which supposedly mask the positive effect of perceptual pretraining on initial discrimination learning within the predifferentiation paradigm. The subjects were 44 first- and second-graders. Experimental-group subjects received rules learning (RL), pretraining, initial discrimination (ID), and reversal shift (RS) phases. Rules learning consisted of a two-choice discrimination using stimuli varying on shape and orientation-of-line, and was designed to teach subjects to associate a specific dimensional value with the correct response. During pretraining, subjects made \"same-different\" judgments on pairs of stimuli varying on height and brightness. The ID and RS phases again involved a two-choice discrimination with a  subset of the stimuli used in pretraining. Three additional groups controlled for the effects of RL, pretraining, and RL plus pretraining. The results showed that subjects given RL learned the ID phase more rapidly than subjects not given RL (p less than .01) Pretraining did not facilitate ID learning. Neither RL, pretraining, nor a combination of RL and pretraining facilitated RS learning. Similarities between the present study and learning-set literature, the failure of perceptual pretraining to facilitate ID learning following RL, and the failure of RL, pretraining, or both to affect RS learning are discussed.

Kindergartners were prefamiliarized with pictures which were identical, similar, or unrelated to pictures used in the learning task. Consistent with predictions derived from previous research, the learning of subjects who were prefamiliarized with unrelated pictures was superior to that of subjects who were prefamiliarized with identical pictures. In addition, improvement over trials in the similar picture condition resembled that of the unrelated (rather than identical) picture conditions, thereby suggesting that the particular pictorial representations of the experimental materials are at least partially responsible for the effect.

        "description":"Children's performance on multidimensional classification tasks was examined in two experiments. In Experiment 1, preschool, first-, and third-grade children were shown a standard stimulus and were then asked to judge whether several comparison stimuli were the same as or different from the standard. Comparison stimuli differed from the standard on zero to four dimensions (form, orientation, size, brightness, or combinations of these dimensions). Most of the preschool and first-grade children based their judgments on a single dimension of difference, while multidimensional judgments predominated at the third-grade level. In Experiment 2, first-grade children were pretrained to make identity matches in response to the same-different classification instructions. A second  classification task, with a different set of stimulus dimensions, was then presented. Identity pretraining failed to produce multidimensional responding on the second task. Verbal posttest indicated that the children were able to detect more than one set of dimensional differences. The results indicate that there are age-related differences in the number of dimensions children utilize in stimulus comparison. The unidimensional responding of younger children cannot be attributed to failure to understand the same-different instructions or inability to detect more than one set of dimensional differences.

Chapter 1 presents some of the key policy decisions confronting planners of early childhood education programs and highlights the many 'value dilemmas' implicit in the decision-making process. Chapter 2 outlines the ways in which supportive services (health, nutrition, psychological, and social) can contribute to the realization of program goals. Chapter 3 offers suggestions and examples to social workers for  promoting a program of partnership between the family and the school. Chapter 4 provides a description of child care in Sweden, and Chapter 5 documents, in the form of a log, the process involved in one project director's attempt to introduce and promote organizational innovation. This guide is designed for use by persons who must plan local programs, who must review proposals for such programs, and especially for people newly entering the social service professions and who are particularly concerned with day care and early childhood education.

In the first experiment, the central issue investigated was whether facial configuration or height is utilized by infants to respond differentially to children and adults. Five different strangers, a male and a female child, a male and a female adult, and a small adult female of the children's height (midget), each approached 40 different infants between the ages of 7 and 24 months. The infants did respond as if there were three classes of persons; infants as young as 7 months of age reacted to the size-facial configuration discrepancy of the small adult. The second experiment examined infants' relationship with other infants and further explored person differentiation. Sixteen groups of four  infants, either 12-13 months or 18-19 months of age, were observed while in a playroom with their mothers. The data indicate that infants respond differently to unfamiliar adults, peers, and their own mothers. Also, developmental trends in peer interaction were traced, as the 12- and 18-month-olds were found to differ in terms of their peer-peer interactions. (SDH)",

Generally, the target families lived on farms or in small communities, were of low to moderate income levels, and the parents were  undereducated. The program involves a three-dimensional approach which consists of weekly home visits by trained paraprofessionals, weekly classroom sessions in mobile classrooms, and utilization of the Captain Kangaroo TV program and related Parent Guide activities.

        "description":"A theory of energy forces developed in the USSR seems to substantiate the suggestion that academic learning before a child is maturationally ready will reduce his learning potential. The bioplasmic model explicates physical/mental development, cognition, readiness, and deprivation. The invisible but recordable bioplasmic forces facilitate physical growth and are the basis of cognition. The forces are gradually released from physical growth for cognition at ages 7 (concrete), and 14 (formal). Readiness--cognitive capabilities--are determined by the quantity of available forces. Premature learning is ineffective and robs the body (brain), of its full potentialities, causing premature plateauing of cognitive and learning capacities and emotional maladjustments later on. Educational  methods and curriculum should be made more compatible with and supportive of the growth forces of the child. (Author/CS)",

Designed to familiarize rural parents and other lay citizens with the concept and practice of accountability, this handbook defines the shared responsibilities of schools, legislators, school boards, school administrators, teachers, parents, community, and students. Primary responsibilities are defined as follows: Rural schools are accountable for keeping pace with the rapidly changing trends of rural life, preparing students for jobs within the community, for continuing education, or for urban transition.  Legislators are accountable for state laws that provide funds for equal education. School boards are accountable for keeping up with information relative to the spending of school funds and for maintaining communication channels. Administrators are accountable to the school board for district management and information dissemination. Teachers are accountable for knowing and presenting subject matter via suitable methods. Parents are accountable for the learning habits and attitudes of their children. Communities are accountable for educational involvement. Students are accountable for learning. (JC)",

Surveyed 7 years after 8th grade graduation, each subject represented 1 of 14 rural counties with 10 percent or more Spanish-surname population. Areas surveyed included the changing rural environment, the rural education system, educational response, rural to urban migration, and occupational adjustment. Over 60 hypotheses developed from a previous study, &quot;Perspectives of Adjustment: Rural Chicano Youth&quot;, were tested; some hypotheses were found to be valid, some invalid; others produced new factors. For example, the hypothesis that there was a stronger relationship among  Chicano youth than among Anglo youth between family income and high school completion proved invalid; that more Chicano youths than comparable Anglos report feelings of discrimination and discriminatory employment practices proved partially valid (feelings of discrimination were valid, but almost no one in either group attributed employment difficulties to discrimination); that rural Chicano youths who migrate to the city obtain higher paying jobs than those remaining in rural areas proved valid, though the urban jobs were not more skilled.

The operating principles for the Indian program emphasize coordination between on-reservation and off-reservation programs; Indian involvement in policies, procedures, etc.; and total Federal support on a permanent basis. On-reservation goals emphasize teaching useful job skills and providing practical experiences which define ways Indian youth can help their people. Off-reservation goals emphasize getting along in the Anglo culture, but from an Indian point of view, considering such questions as how the Anglo work system operates. (JC)",

Long-term county residents gathered extensive information about each county, its school system, and staff members during the 1967-68 school year. Questionnaires mailed to 1,764 students, surveyed their early history, experiences since 1967, employment history,  social adjustment, advanced education, and migration patterns; those still in school were asked about their school, general course of study, grade point average, and scope of extracurricular activities. Data were analyzed to determine whether the systematic relationships hypothesized actually existed. Some findings were: (1) the dropout problem was critical and its prevention should be the highest priority objective of any program for rural youths; and (2) 27 percent of the black males, 24 percent of the black females, 8 percent of the white females, and none of the white males were enrolled in an NYC project.

Intended for use only in the region's non-Appalachian rural counties (a county with no communities in excess of 5,000 people, or with 60 percent or more of its population living in towns of under 2,500 people), the program stresses 2 efforts: (1) to prevent school dropouts and (2) to prepare these youths to compete more effectively with their urban peers either in the labor  market or in advanced education. Due to the large number of dropouts that occur at the completion of the 8th grade, counseling and a limited work experience component for 8th graders is provided. Although some youths from relatively affluent families are eligible to enter the program, only those who meet established poverty criteria are paid for participation in the work experience component which is utilized as a means of income supplement and a counseling tool.

Data relative to the enrollment, employment, and school success of Mexican Americans in the Fort Worth Independent School District (FWISD) were reported (1972-73). Data were gathered from 27 elementary, 6 middle, and 3 high schools of at least 10 percent Mexican American enrollment. Some findings were: (1) Chicano enrollment was proportionately less in FWISD than in Texas or the Southwest; (2) differences between proportions of Chicano students and Chicano teachers were similar, but somewhat larger than those in Texas or the Southwest; (3) Chicano teachers were not assigned primarily to schools  of large Chicano enrollment; (4) Chicano student academic achievement was low, decreasing with grade level increase; and (5) larger proportions of Chicano high school students dropped out of school than did Anglos. Basic principles relative to all specific recommendations governing Chicano educational reform were: (1) incorporation of Chicano language, history, and culture as integral parts of the educational process; (2) full representation in decision making positions which determine or influence educational policy; and (3) reordering of all government budget priorities for recommended implementations.

The directory lists programs, services, and resources available to migrants in these states. Special emphasis was placed on information and data current as of summer 1974, obtained from Federal, State, and local agencies in the various states. Information is given for each state on: (1) programs; (2) crops and work periods; (3) migrant population and wages by county; (4) labor camps; and (5) supplementary data such as information sources and exhibits which depict county distribution and state relation to the national migratory  patterns. The programs listed provide educational, health, legal, and job placement services to these farmworkers. Some of the listings of organizations, programs, or agencies may contain some obsolete information due to their: instability; being subject to change as new needs, priorities, and objectives appear; or as operating funds expire. Given in the appendix are an annotated bibliography of publications from the National Migrant Information Clearinghouse, Juarez-Lincoln Center and maps of the national migratory patterns, the Navajo Reservation, relative to surrounding states, and a migratory workers' road map.

Mandatory program components were assessment; counseling; intake; orientation; orientation to work, work information, occupational familiarization, and armed  services; and health services. Areas evaluated were: establishment of experimental projects; role of sponsoring agency; project staff; utilization of school advisors; planning; publicity; communications; recruitment activities; summer program; and in-school programs. Two recommendations were: (1) the program should be made available only to those schools in which all youth qualify for participation on the basis of community criteria; and (2) payment to economically disadvantaged youth should be made for all participation in the summer and only for training or work experience during the school year.

All rural physicians were screened to isolate those whose practice was in a rural community of no more than 10,000 population, not more than 15 miles from a hospital, and staffed only by general practitioners. Forty-one physicians in 17 practices (5 solo practitioners and 4 practices of 2-man, 3-man, and 4-man groups) in 15 communities throughout Washington were interviewed between November 1971 and April 1972. They  were asked about medical care in rural Washington, group practice, and the business organization and economic productivity of their practices. Some findings were: (1) Washington's rural areas had fewer physicians per capita than its urban areas; (2) there were hospitals without doctors; (3) many rural towns had physicians reaching ages when retirement or semiretirement is inescapable; (4) rural residents often resided many miles from the closest physician; and (5) more suggestions were made for improving medical care by increasing the number of personnel rather than reorganizing the present personnel into different types of practice arrangements.

An additional problem is hiring teachers who are prepared in several major curriculum areas. Some small rural schools have found ways to combat huge expense for specialized programs and curriculum deficiences by cooperation between schools, shared services, greater use of audiovisual aids, and inventiveness in meeting their special problems. Other  methods used by some small schools throughout the United States to fill many gaps in an otherwise meager curriculum are expanding the curriculum to include vocational and career education to prepare the students for living in either a rural or urban environment, inservice teacher training, better guidance and counseling services, and utilization of community resources.

The framework consisted of a micro-economic analysis of the rural labor market; an analysis of rural urban migration; and an aggregate analysis of rural employment as influenced by interaction in the product and factor markets of four sectors--urban, large and small scale; rural nonfarm; and agriculture. Results showed deficiencies in micro-level information (role of the nonfarm sector and  farm mechanization); migration information (rural-urban income differentials, capital transfer measurements, and migration elasticity); and established macro-models (they lacked adequate employment focus, were partial equilibrium analyses of more complex problems, and reflected institutional assumptions not widely applicable in the African context). Recommendations emphasized development of better theory and collection of more solid micro-level data, specifically further research on rural employment, off farm employment, and migration. (JC)",

Focus was on: (1) Migrants (identity) and the Migrant Process; (2) Determinants of Rural-Urban Migration (noneconomic factors and income differentials); (3) Implications of Migration for Economic Development (distortions in factor markets, migration as capital transfer, and externalities associated with migration). The literature  revealed that younger, better educated people have dominated rural-urban migration in Africa; economic motives have been important in determining the rate of rural-urban migration (little agreement as to the relevant economic variables in the decision to migrate); divergence between the private and social returns of migration (almost no research establishing the divergence magnitude). Future migration theory should include the human capital approach; methodology should utilize sample survey techniques, rather than unreliable census data, and migration research should be linked with policy concerning education, population distribution, industrial decentralization, and rural-urban labor markets.

Empirical evidence assembled for the profile revealed that the rural nonfarm sector was an important source of income and employment in Africa. The most important occupational groups in this sector were &quot;sales workers&quot; and &quot;craftsmen and production process workers&quot; (70 percent). Modifications of the Hymer-Resnick model included relaxing the assumption that output of the rural nonfarm sector cannot be traded  to urban areas and abroad, and considering the effects of the backward and forward linkages of agriculture on growth of this sector. Providing the framework for proposed research in Sierra Leone and other African countries, the modified model included the following components: an estimate of total population of rural and nonfarm establishments; a description of these establishments (type of activity and workshop, number of workers and machines, quantity of output and input, and capital assets); characteristics of the entrepeneur; and farm household activities, income, and expenditures.

Data were collected from 180 families in six villages and 480 migrants from these 180 families who were living in urban Western Nigeria during 1971-72. Policy implications suggested the need to narrow the urban-rural earnings gap; invest in education tailored to labor demands of urban areas; and develop agricultural credit. The effect of migration on the rural economy was associated with increased outlay of hired labor, increased farm size, higher rural earnings per head, and a net transfer of capital. (JC)",

Questionnaires were mailed to both the experimental and control groups approximately 6 months after most of the youths had completed high school. Respondents were grouped according to: (1) youths who entered a post-high school educational or training institution; (2) youths who  did not enter a post-high school institution but left their community in 1972-73; and (3) youths who did not migrate from their community in 1972-73. Criterion measurements for this evaluation were: (1) preparation of participants for the world of work; (2) post-high school education or training; (3) post-high school employment--job hunting behavior, job characteristics, and job satisfaction; and (4) social participation behavior. A longer observation period was recommended in order to obtain a more accurate measure of program effectiveness. (NQ)",

Supervision of the program is the responsibility of the State Department of Education as authorized by the Johnson O'Malley (JOM) Act of 1936. To qualify for JOM Special Program funds, a school must have an eligible Indian enrollment which reflects a minimum 10 percent of their total enrollment. The amount of JOM funds a local school district receives is based on the number of Indian student enrolled, financial needs of the school, and educational needs of participating Indian students. There were 147 schools participating in JOM Special Programs during the 1973-74 school year. There was a total  Indian enrollment of 14,630 with an average attendance of 12,486 (86 percent Indian as compared to 84 percent total attendance) in JOM schools. There were 625 Indian high school graduates and 1,177 Indian eighth grade graduates. Statistical reports (on dropout rates, enrollment, attendance, county allocations, administrative and area office expenditures, and budgets) with an appendix comprise the bulk of this report, though there is a short narrative describing highlights of the year (workshops, seminars, and special areas of concern such as counseling and accountability).

Focusing on the Four Corners Interstate Air Quality Control Region, this study determined which socioeconomic characteristics were associated with concern for environmental quality as measured by willingness to pay for pollution abatement. Sample sites were determined by weighing four pollution concentration zones. Interviews were conducted during the 1972 summer and January 1973 with 747 reservation and nonreservation residents and out-of-region recreationists. Separate questionnaires, designed for each subpopulation, were used to determine willingness to pay via a series of bidding games. To ensure that the means of financing was not a barrier to a respondent's willingness to pay  and since no bidding game was appropriate for all, five games were constructed--a sales tax increase; an additional charge to the electric bill; a monthly charge; an increase to the user's fee; or a change in laws. Responses were analyzed by stepwise multiple regression. Some findings were: (1) few consistent relationships existed between concern for environment and socioeconomic characteristics (age, occupation, income, ethnicity, and organizational participation); and (2) a clear majority were willing to pay for pollution abatement.

        "description":"Migration is not a new concept. All through America's history, there has been a push and pull related to population movement. Most Americans have moved several times and from one geographical region to another. Others have moved only a short distance from their birthplace or perhaps not at all. U.S. census information shows that each year nearly 20 percent of the population changes residence. Traditionally migration has followed the same patterns. The only real changes in America's population movement are the ethnic, race, age, and sometimes sex characteristics of those who migrate and their reasons for moving. This monograph discusses migration in a global sense, including both urban and rural. The monograph's purpose is to: (1) show that when viewed in its historical  perspective, migration has changed only in terms of numbers and racial, sexual or ethnic composition of the moving groups; and (2) point out the accurate prediction of social needs can be made years in advance by examining population trends and the movement of people. Topics covered are: traditional pathways of movement, new patterns of movement, decisions to move, outmigration from the United States, increased psychological needs among migrants, state gains and loss, changing needs in employment, and growth indications of the future.

The Task Force submitted open-ended questionnaires to members of the County Rural Development Panels to secure their perceptions of county health problems. Panel member responses were grouped into categories (responses did not represent a statistical sampling, but did represent 94 of 100 counties). Categories were: shortage of manpower, shortage of facilities, disease and related problems, and environmental health problems. Data were divided into principal problems: priority problems, citizen role, outside assistance needs, and health problems listed by region and  county. A shortage of health manpower and inadequate facilities and services were identified as the major health problems in North Carolina. In the category of facilities, mental health care, family planning, and medical care were problems. Drug abuse and venereal diseases were the two major concerns in the disease category; water and sewer problems were important environmental concerns. As traditional health care methods were not deemed feasible, new systems, health education, and utilization of existing community resources were recommended. (JC)",

A weekend camping trip was initiated under the teenage program, proving highly successful. Two pilot programs were initiated--The Parent Involvement Reading Lab and the Parent Involvement Home Program. Teachers, paraprofessionals, and parents were involved  with children in the reading lab. Working with their children, parents became aware of reading methods and materials which could be utilized both at home and at school. Tested reading growth revealed 76 percent of the children had gained 1 month beyond their predicted posttest calculations; 22 percent had gained 6 months; and 4 percent had gained 11 months. The home program was designed to &quot;reach out&quot; to parents and children in their home environment; it involved weekly home visits and activities, a newsletter, and a weekly program evaluation.

This block afforded such resources as urban renewal, vacant lots, a public school, small stores, a nursing home, a subway entrance, and buildings of varied dates, construction, and  architectural design--all of which may be generalized to other urban settings. Suggested activities, not meant to be comprehensive, are presented as specific examples from which other urban schools might pattern their curriculums.

Questionnaires were mailed to 5,019 servicemen who had: (1) been inductees or enlistees in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps; (2) left active duty in the first 6 months of 1972; (3) a Reserve military obligation; and (4) a Spanish surname according to one or more procedures. Procedures determining whether a name was Spanish were all computerized. All but one depended on sorting the names alphabetically and comparing each with lists of Spanish surnames. The remaining procedure, developed by Buechley, depended on letter combinations and surname endings. The lists used were: (1) census surnames, (2)&quot;broad&quot; Spanish surnames, (3) &quot;narrow&quot; Spanish surnames, and (4) Morton's Spanish surnames. Although a determination was made via computer as to whether each person had a &quot;narrow&quot; Spanish first name, this fact was used only in the analysis. Some findings were: (1) outside certain areas Spanish surname recognition included a high proportion of persons who did not meet other criteria indicating Latin American birth or ancestry; and (2) within five Southwestern states, increasing proportions of persons who could not be classified as Spanish at increasing education and aptitude levels were included.

Every 10 days, a new group of children (primarily black) arrived from Baltimore's geographic core. The 24 camp counselors, male and female, ages 18-23, came largely from white suburban communities; only 1 counselor was black. Preceding the arrival of each group, the counselors attended an orientation day, which dealt with the inner-city children and the camp experiences. Four seminars provided a format for professional stock-taking and decision-making regarding counselor-camp relationships and staff planning. At the seminars, the counselors were asked two key questions: (1) What have you learned about  these youngsters as a result of this experience? (2) What have you learned about yourself as a result of this experience? Responses suggested that the primitive camp experience was a valuable one, particularly for those preparing to work with youngsters in a professional urban setting. It was recommended that camp counseling be encouraged, primitive and not so primitive, as a component of undergraduate, preprofessional curriculums leading to service professions working with children and youth.

Focus was on their aspirations and expectations for status attainment in occupation, education, income, and type of place of residence. In each area, four elements of status projections were examined: aspiration level, expectation level, certainty of expectation, and intensity of aspiration. A small-scale investigation of the observations made in the initial study was later conducted with 11 respondents from a school where the interview situation had been far from ideal. This study evaluated observation reliability, in terms of consistency of responses, through a \"test-retest\" procedure over a 2-week time lapse. Data were collected via the same group-administered  questionnaire used in the initial study. Among the findings were: (1) variation in response, in terms of initial coded measurements, was relatively high across all status areas, except for status object of aspirations; and (2) generally, indicators for all elements of educational status projections were more stable than those of other status areas. The general intent of this study was to produce some reasonable hypotheses for additional and broader research since the limited sample does not allow for generalizations. (NQ)",

        "description":"The changes in residence projections (statements of behavior, attitudes, or beliefs about future residence status) of rural East Texas high school sophomores between 1966 and 1972 were examined. Focus was on general trends over the time span as well as those specific to race, sex, and respondent's residence. The analysis involved an age-education-level cohort in order to estimate changes due to factors originating in the individual's environment rather than those associated with individual development over a given time span. Types of residence projections examined were: aspirations, expectations, anticipatory deflection, aspiration intensity, and expectation certainty. Respondents (473 sophomores in 1966 and 461 in 1972) were from 3 low income rural counties in East Texas  (Burleson, Leon, and San Jacinto) which had high proportions of blacks. The same group-administered questionnaire and administration procedures were used both years. Some findings were: (1) the youth had shifted to some extent away from urban and toward rural residences in their aspirations and expectations; (2) the shift was greater for white than for black youth and greater for males than females; and (3) black females were less certain in 1972 than 1966 of attaining their residence expectation.

        "description":"Rural demographic characteristics, regional distribution, and their respective trends should constitute significant policy information for the nation, but the U.S. Population Census offers little aid to the researcher studying population on a minor civil division (MCD) basis. When some census data are based on a 15 percent sample, some on a 5 percent sample, the task of intelligent research and planning becomes &quot;hazardous&quot;. For example, comparison of 1960 with 1970 census data on the Rio Grande Basin proved impossible, due to changes in size and scope of MCD's and changes in MCD population age groupings. Urban bias in the use of &quot;metropolitan&quot; and &quot;non-metropolitan&quot;, terms to which the words urban and rural are often applied, creates misunderstanding as exemplified in a report  titled &quot;Back to the Boonies--Small Towns Thrive as Urban Migration Reverses&quot;. This title does not reflect the fact that people moving out of urban areas are not necessarily moving into rural areas (a phenomenon which is neither rural farm or even rural nonfarm). The Census Bureau, then, should firm up MCD boundaries, because man-made barriers (reservoirs, interstate highways, old and new resource sites, etc.) require new delineation for MCD's so that demographic data can be made available for planning and research.

The relationship between drug use and delinquency, various background factors, and alcohol use was examined. A self-report questionnaire was administered to 456 male and 391 female students in the 9th and 12th grades at Lander Valley High School and Wind River High School in May 1972. Part 3 presents data on the similarities and differences in drug use and attitudes toward drug use of American Indian and Anglo youth living in the Wind  River Indian Reservation area. Data were obtained from 120 Indian and 391 Anglo 9th through 12th grade students from the Wyoming Indian High School, Lander Valley High School, Riverton High School, and Wind River High School. Some findings presented in Parts 2 and 3 were: Indian students had more favorable attitudes toward drug use; and those who had used drugs tended to have poorer relationships with their parents and the schools and a strong tendency to be involved in other delinquent acts.

Its purpose was to obtain data relative to the progress of bilingual bicultural education programs since implementation of the original Title VII legislation in 1969. Since the institute was concerned with Bilingual Bicultural Education as it affects the Mexican American child, those projects with a heavy concentration of Mexican American students were selected. Fifty-eight projects were sent survey questionnaires; 30 responded. The questionnaire was divided into: Basic Program Information; Instructional Component; Impact of Program; and Parent and Community  Involvement. Project directors were asked to make recommendations for: national legislation, state legislation, U.S. Office of Education, State Departments of Education, school boards, teacher training institutions, and Chicano communities and parents. Among the findings were: the pupil/teacher ratio varied noticeably from project to project; 87 percent indicated having a language maintenance program; and 50 percent reported having influenced the development of bilingual programs in adjacent districts.

        "description":"Experience with the 1970 Chenango Development Project (CDP), a rural anti-poverty project initiated by the New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell, led to concern with development and testing of purposive social change models, the role of action oriented social scientists, and the involvement of social science departments, colleges, and universities, and Cooperative Extension in social change programs. The central questions are who designs action-research programs (the implementors, the researchers and the people to be served, or local elites and college administrators) and what are the available options for program design. Program levels (national to individual) and program approaches (economic growth, income maintenance, specific goods or services, etc.) vary  considerably. In attacking poverty, it is necessary to attack on all levels, and no one approach will solve all problems. Therefore, CDP strategies have been altered as the need arose. For example, the legal services corporation was developed because it was needed. An adaptive approach based on the idea of strategy flexibility, as exemplified in a modified CDP model, should serve as a guide to strategy selection, since specific needs demand specific strategies which must be acceptable to those being served.

A drug user was defined as any student who used marijuana or any other drug for pleasure or kicks during the preceding year. A self-report questionnaire was administered to 456 male and 391 female students at Lander Valley High School and Wind River High School. Some findings were: (1) 79.8 percent of the males and 81.1 percent of the females had used neither marijuana nor other drugs during the past year; (2) 1.1 percent of the males and 2.3 percent of the females had used other drugs but not marijuana; (3) 12.5 percent of the males and 7.7 percent of the females had used marijuana but not other drugs; and (4) 6.6  percent of the males and 9.0 percent of the females had used both marijuana and other drugs. This data book consists of 87 tables of data giving the responses to questionnaire items by drug and sex. Levels of significance are indicated below the tables when the differences existing in the response distribution have a probability of less than 5 in 100 of being attributable to chance. (NQ)",

Among the topics discussed are the health effects of environmental pollution, noise, water pollution, solid wastes, air pollution and its chronic effects, odors, pesticides, radiation, carcinogens, teratogens, and mutagens. The decade of the 70's is showing that a new environmental ethic does exist in the hearts and minds of the American people and it is the matchless opportunity of this generation to begin the restoration of environmental quality  and the protection of health.

This manual provides instructions for teachers who wish to obtain resource units from the computer center; units are in the form of a computer print-out. Steps for planning and completing the necessary forms are discussed. The possible units, including Population, Natural Resources, Pollution, Wetlands, and  Primary Ecology, are briefly summarized. Specific objectives, mental age range, grade level, and instructional variables are included with each summary. The teacher may choose up to five objectives, which will be met in the unit she wishes to obtain. The objectives, mental age, and grade level, once identified are placed on the request form. The instructional variables, allowing the teacher to choose individual study areas for selected students, are also coded on the form. Forms are sent to the computer center. (Author/TK)",

Responses were received from 344 teachers in 55 secondary schools and 42 post-secondary institutions. Only 19.4 percent of the secondary teachers surveyed indicated that their students regularly use the metric system; they were health education teachers or training and industrial teachers. Approximately 60 percent of the secondary teachers responding reported that they tried to stimulate awareness of the metric system among their students. More than 70 percent expressed the need or desire to participate in workshops concerning the  metric system, but most reported that such workshops were unavailable, and that the primary stimuli for metric work in the classroom came from professional organizations. The data collected from post-secondary teachers supported these points of view. On the basis of these findings, it was recommended that the State Education Department develop hands-on inservice workshops concerned with the teaching of the metric system in occupational education courses and conduct such workshops throughout the state.

To test this analysis empirically, composite items were written for each level and administered to students in grades 3-6. Test results were analyzed by the Walbesser Technique and Pattern Analysis; the acceptance levels developed by Phillips and Kane were used as criteria. These analyses yielded ratios for consistency, adequacy, and completeness which were below the acceptance level. The hierarchy was then revised to maximize these ratios, and an index of agreement of .85 was obtained between the expected pattern of responses and the observed level. The investigators note that: (1) results may have been affected by the fact that very few students were able to answer  correctly items from the upper levels of the hierarchy; and (2) the study should be replicated using students with a broader range of abilities and ages.

The study was designed to answer questions pertinent to an assessment instrument designed and used with the Ball State University NSF institute programs. The reliability of the instrument, the extent of participant-perceived change in classroom emphasis given to 57 instructional topics included in the instrument, and whether a significant difference existed between the shift of emphasis of the 1972 institute participants and that of the 1973 participants were determined. All of the 1973 members took part in a pre-institute assessment and in two post-institute follow-ups. One  follow-up test was administered on the last day of the institute and one the following spring. Changes in instructional emphasis were evaluated by the sign test. Comparison of mean growth increments was accomplished using a t-test. Analyses showed that participant-perceived increases in the level of emphasis were significant. No significant differences were found between the mean growth increments of the two groups. Instrument reliability was established, using analysis of variance in a modified intraclass correlation formula, as .93 and .97 for the 1972 and 1973 groups, respectively. (Author/EB)",

Students in the treatment viewed a videotape model showing peer leaders engaging in the steps of an experiment and verbalizing their acts. The control students did not view the model. Subsequently, the students of both groups conducted the same experiment in class while trained raters observed their behavior. Although both groups of students received preliminary verbal instructions regarding how to conduct the experiment, those students who viewed the model after the directions produced significantly more positive behaviors (p less than  .05) and fewer negative behaviors (p less than .05) than the control group who did not view the model but had an equivalent time to practice the directions prior to, and during, the laboratory session.

        "description":"Observing that available standardized tests purporting to measure problem solving in mathematics do not validly reflect currently accepted definitions of problem solving, while more valid individualized measures are costly in terms of time, this researcher undertook (1) to construct a paper-and-pencil instrument which might better reflect problem-solving ability and (2) to validate this test by correlation with scores of subjects in taped and coded problem-solving interviews. Seventh-grade students with average and above-average mathematics achievement records were given two written tests in a group situation; later each was interviewed and given six problems to solve while talking aloud in a videotaping or audiotaping situation. Scores were assigned to performance in the  individual session according to a previously developed coding system. Test statistics were computed; differences in the rank ordering of subjects by the two measures and correlations among scores were analyzed; differences in performance and coding ease between videotaped and audiotaped subjects were investigated. Results and instruments used are reported in Part 2 of this report. (SD)",

(Rationale and design of the study are discussed in Part 1.) The principal feasibility criterion, correlation of at least .71 with scores on taped and coded individual &quot;thinking aloud&quot; problem-solving sessions, was not met; however, the obtained correlation (.68) for one test suggested to the researcher that more reliable tests might achieve the criterion. Rank ordering of subjects on the &quot;thinking aloud&quot; procedure and written tests were highly correlated. The use of the &quot;thinking aloud&quot; procedure to establish concurrent validity was evaluated and questions about the validity of this procedure with seventh-grade students were raised.  Investigations of the functional differences between audiotaped and videotaped interviews revealed no differences in subject performance, but supported the superiority of videotaping as a research tool.

Buckminster Fuller's World Game is a scientific means for discovering the expeditious ways of employing the world's resources to provide a higher standard of living for all humanity. The philosophy behind the game is the exploration of resources to do more with less, or to combine two or more actions to produce a result greater than the sum of the two. The goal is to give man the right to life instead of having to earn it. The goal, philosophy, and computer technology of the World Game can also be applied to world health planning. Health is an individual right and all humanity must have the opportunity to enjoy life to the fullest. In order to develop world health planning, the planner must take full advantage of computer simulation to test data and possible health care  strategies. For maximum efficiency, planning and research, agencies must be integrated. Politics will be the largest pragmatic obstacle to world planning since politicians are often slow-moving and evasive about dealing with death and disease. The primary philosophical obstacle is goal-defining. The World Game can help plan to get somewhere, but it can not tell us where we want to go. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"This paper argues for an educational orientation to American studies in high school that contributes toward individual growth and a sense of compassion toward humanity. According to the author, conventional schooling is a process of training youth to fit into out society by internalizing the accepted behavior and attitudinal norms. The student adjusts to a lock-step process in which he climbs in a predetermined fashion to a predetermined goal of social status and material success. Instead, education should encourage the development of personal growth and the interrelatedness of that growth with the growth of humanity; criticism of current societal values; and the development of values based upon compassion, creativity, and the uniqueness of the individual within his own culture.  A suggested course outline with this focus includes four main aspects. First, the course structure must organize the world in such a way as to give direction and clarity to the student's discovery of the values implicit in his culture. Secondly, the course must provide a structural basis for determining the relationships among cultural themes and the implications they have for living in that culture. Thirdly, the course must explain how the student's culture reflects and is involved in the human community. Fourthly, the course must deal with such instances of oppression as colonialism and racism to show that bias can destroy humanity. Also included is an analysis of the author's philosophical opposition to student grading. (Author/DE)",

In a schema of dominant orientations of social theory, the outstanding epistemological features of the three main schools of contemporary metascience are outlined. Three systems of doing scientific research--interpretive, empirical-analytical, and critical inquiry--are matched with some specific social theories. The practical significance of each theoretical interest mode of the three action systems is described in concrete and detailed terms. The schema permits explanation of the source of ideas for doing research and how these ideas animate the perceptions and formulations of the relevant problems in the theory and  practice of social studies curriculum. A current social studies project and study are examined for the implicit modes of knowing that they employ in the study of man and society. References are included. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"The relative effectiveness of including behavioral objectives, classified according to the major levels of cognition, in independent study materials for high school juniors is analyzed in this brief summary of the author's dissertation. The three major questions under consideration are whether: (1) the use of behavioral objectives has an effect upon learning and retention of social studies knowledge and concepts, (2) the effectiveness is the same for all levels of cognition, and (3) the use of behavioral objectives at the various levels of cognition affect both learning and retention in a similar manner. Bloom's \"Taxonomy of Education Objectives: Cognitive Domain\" served as a guide in the formulation and classification of the objectives and test questions. Ninety-three students  in four social studies classes were tested as control and experimental sample groups. The experimental group's instructions contained behavioral objectives for the six levels of cognition and the instructions of the control group did not. The results indicate that behavioral objectives by themselves are virtually useless and perhaps even deleterious unless some activity is provided to ensure that their purpose, value, and intent are made clear to the learner. The highest mean scores are at the comprehension level. Although the experimental group had higher mean scores for learning at the knowledge, comprehension, and synthesis levels, retention at the synthesis level by the control group was better. (DE)",

The rationale behind the criteria is that it makes social studies teachers a more professional group and provides for the highest caliber of teacher. Each teacher is screened for the selected criteria by peers and instructors. The Council recommends certification only after the criteria are met and the teacher undergoes a one year probationary teaching experience. The specific criteria are categorized according to skills, knowledge, experience, and personal factors. Items most often noted as important by committee members in the areas of skills, knowledge, experience, and personal factors respectively are as  follows: (1) performance during an internship and demonstration of certain capacities and skills including affective, diagnostic, expository, inquiry, analytical, and evaluative; (2) the knowledge developed from an internship and demonstrated knowledge of the methods and tools of the social sciences including analysis, inquiry, and evaluation; (3) an internship and experience in writing curricula, travel, publishing, work with other cultures, and with other work-related activities; and (4) self-improvement, self analysis of behavior in different situations, an attitude conducive to a learning atmosphere, and an ability to write a clear rationale for teaching social studies.

The major aim of the program is to develop a small school environment to foster the growth of the whole student. Objectives focus on helping students develop a positive attitude toward school, helping students and teachers develop improved interpersonal relations, and improving academic achievement. The school maintains 300 students and has its own staff and schedule. The staff adopts a &quot;head-on&quot; approach to problems, offering comprehensive testing programs which help teachers identify the academic needs of individual students. Seminars and simulations are used to deal with problems. Student centered curriculum  motivates students toward academic achievement, involves students in activities, and, moreover, offers some opportunities for decision making. The school curriculum, based on interdisciplinary studies developed by the staff, centers on three themes which were suggested by an initial survey of student needs and interests: A New Dimension, The Personal Side of Living, and The World of Work. After two years, teachers are pleased with the flexibility and general results of their curriculum; results of achievement tests, to date, have been inconclusive. Future plans for the school include more individualized instruction and an expansion of the human relations program. (Author/JH)",

Voluntary admission, screening by a student/staff committee, and parental approval precede the general agreement which details school attendance and work commitments. In addition to developing non-traditional learning programs, the staff members assume administrative tasks. Although the student is not confined to courses within the DLC, he must negotiate a contract with a teacher for each course. The contracts specify requirements for credit, allow for substitutions and renegotiation, and obligate the instructor to provide the necessary instruction and materials. Since contracts are written with passing  letter grades or credit, there are no failing grades, just uncompleted work. The DLC encourages personal growth and acceptance of responsibility in addition to academic progress as exemplified in the sample social studies contracts presented in this profile. Four general conditions prefacing all social studies contracts and other examples of contracts in political behavior, Georgia cultures, and psychology are provided. The DLC places those who are unable to cope with the program in other schools or jobs. Originally short term placements were envisioned, but most students remain at the DLC until graduation or vocational placement. (Author/EC)",

Public schools fail to deliver the promised indiscriminate availability of educational goods and services. Discussions of that failure frequently revolve around the school's educational agenda and questions of pedagogy and curriculum. It can also be understood as an historical disagreement over the political implications of the equal opportunity objective. Early leaders articulated the idea of education to prepare citizens to use political power intelligently and to transcend the accidents of birth and geography in acquiring economic powers. Those who followed through on the idea saw it as a means for homogenizing society and for imposing on it \"needed\"  education. At the root of these measures was a fear of the political implication of equal education. Although our schools today are not truly great, the idea, clouded with ambivalence, still has the potential of an uncompleted dream. (JH)",

The study represents an investigation funded by the Education Commission of the States and coordinated by a special Steering Committee working under the auspices of NCSS. Six tasks were identified by the committee to examine NAEP: methods and procedures; the validity of the exercise; interpretation of the findings; consistency of the exercises with NCSS Social Studies Curriculum Guidelines, desirability, and realistically satisfactory performance levels; the assessment model; and dissemination. Also included in this document is background  information on the NAEP, the purpose of which was to make available to those interested in education the attainments of students in citizenship and social studies. A major portion of this document focuses on NAEP decisions on a host of issues; for example, in considering objectives, who was to decide what was to be assessed in social studies and, moreover, what the basic criteria should be for the objectives. The latter portion of the document points out that the NAEP assessment in itself is neither an evaluation nor explanation, but is a collection of data provided in national percentages for performance of each exercise, by age, regions, sex, race, parental education, and size and type of community.

The purpose of Task 2 was to review independently the National Assessment of Educational Progress Social Studies and Citizenship exercises as to the extent to which confidence could be placed in them. The major criterion for this confidence was the degree to which the test exercises have content validity or the degree to which the exercises are a direct measure of the objectives developed for the assessment. Secondary criteria included whether the exercises could be utilized as models by teachers in developing their own evaluation instruments, cognitive and affective levels, age appropriateness, and appropriateness  of the situation in which the exercises were administered. The results indicated that of the 194 exercises prepared for social studies, 85 percent (164) were considered valid. The majority of exercises were of proper age and difficulty level, although a few were too difficult for 9-year-olds and too easy for upper age levels. Of the 152 exercises prepared for citizenship, 93 or 61 percent were considered valid. Only 55 percent of the exercises could be utilized as models by teachers while most valid exercises were of proper age and difficulty level.

One section of the exercises deals with the knowledge of structural elements of government institutions, while the second set deals with the knowledge of rights and duties within these institutions. The analysis involves the breakdown of data by ages 9, 13, 17, and adult; northeast, southeast, central, and west regions of the U.S.; two sexes; white and black races; four levels of parents' education; and seven size and type of community categories. The results indicate the lowest level of knowledge at age 9 and the  highest level of knowledge at age 17, and show that those persons in all age levels whose parents went to college, persons who live in relative affluence, persons who live in the northeast part of the country, males at age 17 and as adults, and whites at all ages are most able in all categories of assessment. Conversely, those persons whose parents never went beyond the eighth grade, persons who live in the inner city, persons who live in the southeast part of the country, females, and blacks do not score as well on the exercises as do persons in most other categories. One drawback of the assessment is that it provides only descriptive data and does not account for the differences in the results.

The seven basic components of the assessment model include objectives development, exercise development, sampling plan, administration of exercises, scoring and analysis, reporting and dissemination, and utilization of information. Maine, Connecticut, Texas, and Colorado have adopted the national model for use in state assessments of learning outcomes. To date three school districts--Lincoln, Nebraska, San Bernardino, California, and  Montgomery County, Maryland--are using an adaptation of the model at the district level. Thirteen characteristics for a good assessment program are suggested for developing an adaptation model. The reports on both science and citizenship have resulted in strong recommendations for curriculum changes. As data are gathered at the state level through the use of the model and its adaptations, specific suggestions for changes may be made. Based on the national model, adaptations are proposed which provide a basis for both teacher and program accountability.

It criticizes the assessment model and advocates three new approaches to evaluating social studies education: a comparative approach with direct international comparisons of programs and results; direct comparison of pupil performance in schools with radically different approaches to social studies; and a sociological approach where values of various age-groups and adults are studied through their communications and decision processes. Criticism of the current NAEP model includes the restriction of goals and test items to those socially acceptable by the states, educators, and lay citizens. Schools and states should  not be able to vote on the standards on which they are to be judged. The objectives and test items showed a lack of emphasis on ethics and their relation to the students' life situations. The interpretation of results was overoptomistic in view of the low scores achieved by the sample population. (DE) Primary type of information provided by report: Results (Interpretation).",

        "description":"This commissioned paper examines the National Assessment for Educational Progress model for citizenship and suggests an alternative model oriented more directly to educational and political goals. In the current model performances on the citizenship exercises can only be interpreted by the population characteristics of age, sex, parental education, race, region, size and type of community. The structural emphases of the model on population characteristics, rather than on the interactions of individuals with different environments, induces thinking in stereotypic terms. The basic question should be not who are good citizens, but what are the conditions that contribute to good citizenship. Data results in the age categories indicate a general tendency for the percentage of  acceptable responses to increase with age, which denies Bruner's concept that anything could be taught in some honest way at any age. At the same time the model must recognize the identities and priorities of different social and ethnic groups which might contribute to differences in cognitive and affective development. The current model also ignores the differences in school environment. An alternative model would compare schools, programs, classrooms and take into account person-environment interactions and social and ethnic group goals.

The rest of the document consists of the Task 6 report. Nine NCSS members rated the appropriateness of the social studies exercises for the 1970's. The panel rated the exercises according to the NCSS Curriculum Guidelines of knowledge, abilities, valuing, and social participation; the general desirability of the exercises based on the NCSS guidelines; and the realistic national level of performance that would satisfy  the panel's professional judgement. The results for guidelines indicate a small percentage of exercises dealing with social participation, about one-fifth dealing with valuing, and a majority of 46 percent dealing with knowledge. In the general desirability category less than 10 percent of the exercises have a rating of little or some value, while two-thirds of the exercises fall in the area of general desirability.

Students are asked to find the answer to a researchable question. For instance: one exercise involves determining China's place in the world by  counting references to China from sources such as newspapers and recording the information in comparison with that for other countries.

All three groups were exposed to identical content combining the stages of art criticism with several theories of art. Teaching strategies, drawn largely from studies in attitude and attitude change, were tested for effectiveness by comparing pretest and posttest responses to an assortment of art slides. The teaching strategy for groups 1 and 2 involved the evaluation of a work of art in class: members of group 1 discussed art which, previously, they had reacted negatively; group 2 discussed art works of their own choice. Although both approaches were expected to modify student  attitudes, group 1's posttest performance exceeded group 2's toward higher valued judgments and a greater command over the aesthetic qualities needed to support expressed attitudes. The control group which did not make class presentations failed to improve on the posttest. The results of the study suggest that student attitudes can be modified, if modification is a teaching objective, and that modification is necessary if students are to involve future pupils in critical experiences with art.

The criteria for selection of the content of inquiry projects include problem relevance or urgency, use of core concepts from the social sciences, use of core concepts from other domains of knowledge, and methods and processes basic to social science inquiry. Techniques to enrich and extend the content are discussed.

Some of the interviews focus on basic disciplinary areas, such as economics and political science; others  focus on the more applied areas of social science, such as teaching and learning or the school as a social setting. Data from the interviews are analyzed according to objectives, content, and teaching methodologies in a preface to the interviews.

Role playing, dramatic interpretation and case studies are presented in \"Historical Interpretations and Impersonations,\"\"American History: Reviewed, Revamped, and Revitalized,\" and \"Doing It With  Cases.\" Environmental and consumer education are discussed in \"You Are Your Own Environment,\" and \"Socio-Economic Aspects of Budgeting in the Family.\" Field participation in archeology and preparing students for the responsibilities of citizenship are discussed in \"Looking Forward to the Past\" and \"Project 18: A Case Study in Social Studies Curriculum Development.\" Independent study and student teacher preparation are examined in \"Student Oriented Learning: An Attempt to Use Independent Study Within the Constraints of a Discipline,\" and \"Student Teaching in an Innovative School.\" (DE)",

The guide's major objective is to help children develop certain skills, concepts, and understandings which will enable them to function effectively in the marketplace of our free enterprise system. Teaching techniques suggested include field trips, crossword puzzles, use of audio visuals and bulletin boards, games, role-playing, and classroom discussion. The guide lists skills that the activities will develop. The major portion of the publication contains 58 activities. Some of the  topics for activities include Buying Toys, Supermarket Economy, Family Grocery List, Stock Exchange, Economics of Shoplifting, Does TV Create Needs, What Does Education Cost, Paper Towel Test, and Solving the Sales Slips. Each activity is explained in detail and in many instances the materials which the teacher would use in the classroom are included.

One hundred and eight Atlanta elementary and secondary school teachers were pre and postested on nine attitudes. These include attitudes toward (1) teacher conduct in a situation leading to bodily harm of a student, (2) the resultant law suit from the student's injury, (3) legalization of marihuana, (4) corporal punishment, (5) capital punishment, (6) children's work in the home, (7) forced social integration, (8) guarantees given on consumer products, and (9) legal responsibilities of minors in business transactions. Results indicate that the attitude change strategy was not effective in changing workshop participant attitudes.  However, there was a marked decrease in the number of \"no response\" or \"not sure\" answers indicating a definite trend toward the firming of opinions. Elementary teachers consistently showed more liberal attitudes toward the legal-ethical opinions sampled than did secondary teachers. One inference regarding this finding is that the elementary teacher's attitude is more child centered, i.e., more sympathetic, and therefore less punitive than the secondary teacher's. (DE)",

        "description":"In order to identify how social studies teachers attempt to resolve values conflict situations, 82 \"disinterested\" teachers in southeast Ohio responded to a questionnaire. The term \"disinterested\" is used to describe teachers who did not belong to a professional social studies organization, nor attend conferences specifically geared for updating expertise. Each teacher described a conflict incident and ranked it according to categories of decision making, justice, dissent and equality. Results indicate that the sample teachers are more interested in individual rather than group problems and that these incidents involve antagonists fairly close to themselves rather than socially distant. It is assumed that involvement in conflicts with individual persons is less mature than  involvement with larger groups or institutions. Only three percent of the sample identified the antagonists as an institution. The teachers describe how they resolved the dilemma which is then categorized according to resolution by authority, argument, negotiation, capitulation, and avoidance. Forty-six percent of the teachers used authoritative means to solve problem situations while less than one-fourth used compromise as a solution. These results confirm those of Frankels (ED 092 445) whose research on \"interested\" teachers also indicates that teachers are unable to perceive a situation from another's viewpoint. (DE)",

The framework for evaluation consists of the cognitive and affective tradeoffs entailed by using a new experimental course as opposed to two more traditional courses. The experimental course is a freshman level course which emphasizes laboratory and computer programing to teach hypothesis testing and economics methodology. The other two courses, lecture and discussion, are more traditional in scope, although one of the courses emphasizes current economic problems. Results of the scores on the Test of Understanding College Economics indicate that students in the experimental courses had higher scores than one of the traditional courses. In  the skills of application of economic principles, the experimental course students score better than the two traditional courses, while scoring the same or less on recognition and understanding of economics principles. The affective goals are measured by course evaluations, change and final attitudes toward economics as a discipline, and changes in opinions toward economic issues. Results of the study indicate that the experimental course had the highest student rating in spite of the heaviest work load. Students found the experimental course more useful and relevant than the other two. The experimental course ranked second in its ability to change student attitudes about economic issues. (DE)",

Students were also asked to note their favorite school subject. Among all respondents governmental leaders predominated in both categories of contributing  persons. Science, however, was the area of human endeavor most often cited with education second -- except among students, where education was third and government second.

The program in both districts fosters practice in expressing standard grammar orally. Teachers in the TV Reading Program work from prepared scripts, giving students precise definitions for the vocabulary found in the scripts. Students dramatize the scripts, reciting responses in unison. Although the initial development of a concept is at an abstract level, the verbal input is supported by concrete experience when the video portion of the TV tape is switched on. When concepts are not represented visually, teachers lead students to perceive the parameters of the concept through  a questioning technique which requires students to affirm or negate the relationships of the new concept with familiar concepts. A pilot study of the impact of the program on the reading behavior of seventh graders encouraged the expansion of the program and the application for a federal grant to install an on-the-job training program for secondary teachers.

Although the sequence of the four phases in this study should be maintained, the time spent on each phase may last a semester, a year, or longer. The four phases are: \"Thoughts and Feelings,\" an exploration of the nature of feelings and how to distinguish between feeling and thought; \"Feelings about Literature,\" a study of the normal capacity for emotional response in the context of a literary stimulus; \"Deciding on Literary Importance,\" an examination of the relationship between intellectual judgment and emotional response; and \"Interpretation as a Communal Act,\" a study of the interest of  others in one's own responses and interpretations. The last section of this book contains suggestions for using the book in the classroom. (JM)",

Because only a small sample was surveyed, the states are grouped into seven regions. Measures of implementation based on the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses were tabulated. Questions were then grouped into topics for further evaluation. Standard significance testing procedures were used when districts were grouped according to sizes. For each question and topic, respectively, significant differences between regions, between districts having under and over 20,000 pupils, as well as a composite of all districts, were noted. Correlation between responses to questions for a given size and  region were analyzed. Conclusions were drawn regarding extent of implementations and dependence upon teachers' salaries, per capita income, and expenditures for education. (Author)",

It is possible that nonstandard speakers will view a teacher's attempt to correct their nonstandard written forms as a way of denying the validity of their culture. It is concluded that it is quite possible that a correlation exists between students' spoken dialect and their written language and that, as there is no single standard of English, it is antihumanistic to require all students to master one particular dialect.

One vivid example of this fact was seen in the recent arduous but successful attempt to include &quot;Beowul&quot; in a fourth-grade literature text which was being compiled. That a clear, simple retelling of &quot;Beowulf&quot; is an especially appropriate and significant experience for a nine year old was ignored by elementary education editors considering the selection. The editors instead preferred to focus on background information, violence in the tale, word choice, comprehension questions, and reading rules. Nine year olds may be reluctant to learn facts about a 1500-year-old major piece of Anglo-Saxon literature,  but they have difficulty in resisting the lure of the &quot;Beowulf&quot; monsters. (JM)",

The second section explains that French schools are not included in this survey because so few French schools replied to the survey. The third section charts the results from the survey of English schools. From an analysis of these figures, it is concluded that outside of Ontario 89 percent of the schools offered either no Canadian literature or only a minimal amount. Based on these same charts, however, it appears Canadian literature  will be taught to a greater extent in these secondary schools in the future.

Among these beneficial by-products of writing are self-identification, self-confidence, humanitarian concern, and aesthetic appreciation. Learning experiences in a tutorial system are most meaningful if confidential rapport is established between each student and the teacher. Every qualified tutor has to become a kind of unlicensed psychoanalyst who must realize that sincerity is the quality which makes a success of most student compositions. Many systems find the news media a good source of subject-matter for theme-writing. Four topics are suggested for possible use in the writing laboratory: An Open Letter to  the People of Northern Ireland; To the Parents of Jewish Athletes Slaughtered at the Olympic Games; Where (and Why) Blacks Constitute a Majority in This Country (in lines waiting at the welfare offices); and The New Emphasis on Athletics for Women.

Until recently, the literature included in these anthologies failed to achieve the objective stated almost 30 years ago by the National Council of Teachers of English that literature instruction should help to develop a keen sense of permanent social values and failed to reflect the multicultural and multiethnic society in which Americans live. An examination of six secondary school literature anthologies published during the 1960's reveals great variance ranging from token integration to a truly interracial view of humanity. Only two anthologies, whose magazine appearance makes them attractive to  reluctant readers, successfully project a black image in literature. Secondary school students must be provided with literature which enables them to mesh their social perceptions with their artistic understandings. (JM)",

After hearing three or five passages, subjects orally recalled passage content and answered simple factual questions about each passage. It was found that illustration facilitated prose learning only when children were given the correct pieces for their illustrations or had the illustrations done for them. When the children selected the pieces for each illustration out of a common pool of 20 to 30 cutouts, illustration activity had either  a negative effect or no effect. (Author/JM)",

In 1969, approximately 150 black students from urban ghettos in the North and rural communities in the South were admitted to the University of Wisconsin under a special scholarship program. Students were given several tests, including the Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency, and 12 of the lowest scorers volunteered for and were admitted into a special section of English 101 that used many of the methods developed for the Program in English for Foreign Students. Four initial curriculum accomplishments can be noted: classroom materials dealing with contrastive phonological features of black English and standard  English were developed; an extensive \"Bibliography of Black English\" was constructed; a reference file of the items listed in the bibliography was compiled; and a course syllabus for this special course was completed. The second part of the paper describes the applications and effects of the course. The initial hypothesis that these students did not know standard English grammar, syntactic patterns, and pronunciation was disproved. (TS)",

In order to integrate black literature into courses, it will be necessary to eliminate some of the selections previously included. However, the benefits would be many: predominately white classes would be exposed to black literature, counteracting the sense of vacuum attendant on study in a specialized ethnic course; the themes of white writers would become less removed from everyday life when counterpointed by a new, vital, and less academic literature; classes would study the most  American of all writing; and students' assumptions that the melting pot mystique is still viable would be dislodged.

The second section describes a program which used a sentence-combining method as an activity-based experience for language development. A six-month study involved all fourth graders at Powell School in Mountain View, California. The students were enrolled in two classes, one taught in a traditional manner and the other taught in an open-classroom manner. The students were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups within their classes. In the experimental group, student writing was stimulated by silent cartoons and movies, by topic paragraphs, and by experiential presentations. Student writing was analyzed for quantitative features of syntactic development,  and writing quality was evaluated by three teacher-writers. The results indicated that students in the experimental group made significant gains in five out of six analytic factors and the control group made significant gains in two out of six factors. The paper concludes that a grammar-free program of sentence-combining lessons, backed by games, activities, and experiential exercises, can encourage synthetic growth in the writing of fourth grade children.

A good example of black English as a dialect with a structure and origin of its own may be seen in Gullah, a language spoken by isolate blacks in the Carolina sea islands. The accusation that black dialect is a sloppy, careless speech must be refuted, but speakers of black dialect should be taught to be bidialectal in order to be prepared to function effectively in  middle American society.

First, students are divided into pairs and pass a single sheet of paper back and forth between themselves, writing spontaneous dialog in a short period of time. The students are then given more time and encouraged to make more complex statements responding to their partners' statements. Several topics are then suggested for writing a logical, subtle, complex, full length dialog. The final stage is the writing of an expository essay, combining appropriate formality with the rhythm and flow  of oral language. (TS)",

Verification is defined as the phase dependent on reasoning and judgment and involving the expansion of the illumination in order to ensure its communication.

The course meets two days a week in a writing laboratory, two days in a reading laboratory, and one day in a speech  laboratory. Minimal standards for the reading and writing sections of the course are determined, and any student who fails to meet the standards for either of the disciplines must repeat the course. (TS)",

        "description":"This paper (1) discusses the SQ3R formula for reading: survey, question, read, recite, and review; and (2) proposes a similar formula for remedial composition; R3SW, which means, read, search, select, study, and write. An example of this formula is given, using imperative sentences as the understood subject. In using the composition formula during a class, the teacher demonstrates on the chalkboard a number of examples of imperatively sentences which the students read and analyze. As part of the homework assignment, the students are instructed to search for imperative sentences and select five of them to bring to class. The idea of this exercise is to get the students to discover examples of imperative sentences from sources outside the classroom so they can relate them to  nonacademic life. Finally, the students study the features of the imperative sentence, and then write their own. (TS)",

Based on this assumption, several objectives are offered for developing composition courses for students with learning and language difficulties: students must learn to generate chaos, as the composing process requires choice and chaos is the source of alternatives; after this, students must learn how to emerge from chaos through the ordering process; and students must question and examine their processes of perception in order to differentiate, compare, and classify. It is these processes of definition and formation which encourage the use of language  as a speculative instrument and make learning possible. (TS)",

Multicultural literature can be used by preservice and inservice teachers of English to develop in themselves and in their students an awareness of both the universal characteristics and the differences among peoples.

An examination of the composition of the plays reveals that they all more or less share certain topics and plot structure, have a veneer of topicality, and are supported by gags, jokes, and absurd behavior. Variations on the themes of unobtainable vain fantasies are played out; the plays all end in the marriage bed, however devious and deceitful the way has been. The vagaries of sex and guilt, inadequacy and machismo are all circumscribed and made manageable. It is concluded that Simon's plays are technically unsatisfying because he uses a  disjointed tragicomic story line with an enormous number of realistic and cliche details and gags to distract from the disjointed story. His exploitation of the familiar prevents exploration of the serious or the comic. And, for the same reasons, the plays are thematically unsatisfying as well. (TS)",

Anglo treatment of Mexican American women in literature has varied from blatant prejudice or vague mystical eroticism in early portrayals to more realistic views of the Chicano in modern writing. The current identity crisis of Mexican Americans is reflected in the way Chicano writers portray Mexican American women. A good example of this may be seen in the three different generations of women in the novel \"Chicano.\" Alicia, of the oldest generation, plays the traditional role of subservient wife and mother; Angelina, Alicia's daughter, defies tradition enough to leave home for a job, but later becomes subject to her Mexican American husband; and Mariana, representing the third  generation, completely breaks with tradition by engaging in premarital sex with an Anglo. Perhaps the identity crisis of Chicano writers is an attempt to find identity apart from Anglos without destroying the minority culture. (JM)",

Emphasis in these exercises is on economy of words, letting the organization of the topic organize the writing, and theory and experiment. Two important aspects of the course are the large amount of linguistics covered and the kinds of writing other than scientific writing which the students do, such as biography and speculative prose. Throughout the course, the student becomes aware of the ways in which writing can be useful for a scientist. (JM)",

Before then, adolescent novels were oriented toward a white, middle-class audience, with settings in small towns and characters who were teenage Anglo-Saxons. Novels in the 1950s were, for the most part, unrealistic in their portrayals of racial problems, recommending accommodation by Negroes. During the 1960s, however, novels appeared which dealt more directly with racial problems. And in the 1970s, adolescent novels have treated the black ethnic experience itself. Hopefully, the problem of racial strife may be better understood through both the creation of adolescent novels free from generalizations and stereotypes and the reading of as wide a range of books as possible,  especially by white adolescents.

This situation should be corrected so that students achieve a truer view of what the literary experience can be. In order to do this, teachers need to develop a method of literary inquiry directed to the reader's subjective experience with the work as well as to the work itself. And, in doing this, such abstract criteria as adequate theme, lively plot, memorable characters, and distinctive style would be set aside in  favor of restoring reader response as a determining factor in the worth of a literary work.

The underlying impetus behind the institution of multicultural education is the emphasis of cultural pluralism and of working toward a society where all people can live harmoniously in an atmosphere of mutual respect. This cannot be accomplished if minority students are the only ones receiving multicultural education or if multicultural education is separated from the study of English. Theorists such as Gagne and Bloom, who have developed hierarchies of learning, can provide useful models for structuring multicultural material into sequences which facilitate congitive learning and help students develop  their own identity. The work of Erikson, Ausubel, Rogers, Rath, Torrance and Bruner can also be helpful in establishing methods of teaching multicultural education in English classes. (TS)",

One hundred seventy-two undergraduates enrolled in an introductory psychology course served as subjects for the experiment. All subjects listened to a lecture while engaging in study strategies consisting of combinations of note taking and review. Performance was measured immediately and/or one week later by free recall and by verbatim and paraphrase completion tests. Results showed that taking and reviewing notes yeilded maximum retention, while listening only, without review, resulted in poorest performance. The benefit of note taking appears to be derived from having a subsequent opportunity to review notes, and not from the act of note taking  itself. Encoding differences as a function of note taking appear to be minimal, while the external storage function is of primary importance. (Author/TS)",

Hence, university courses in linguistics are often shunned by teachers fond of literature. Yet insights derived from an objective study of language can help teachers clear the way to students' understanding and enjoyment of literature. Passages from literature and other advanced reading materials are considered from the classroom teacher's point of view. The paper suggests how teachers can make use of certain concepts familiar to linguists (e.g., function words and content words as related to sentence rhythm; the effects of typography upon students' perception of sentence parts; the concepts of deletion and recoverability). Special attention is directed to problems of reading  comprehension which result from a writer's rhetorical ventriloguism. (Author)",

Each Boston newspaper publisher's total printing volume was analyzed, his competitive position was related to that of nonnewspaper publishers, and other sources of printers' incomes were determined. Several key relationships were examined: the direction (Patriot/Loyalist) of political content of the publisher's newspaper; the amount of political versus religious content; the relationship between the newspaper's printing volume from  government sources and the direction of the editorial opinion of the newspaper; and the relationship between changes in a newspaper's political printing volume and changes in the direction of political content in the newspaper.

The third experiment was undertaken to estimate the information of sounds and diagrams which might lead to an estimate of the redundancy ascribed to the phonetic structure of words. A total of 1549 words of one syllable and 2151 of two syllables were transcribed phonetically using 41 phonetic symbols. From this experiment it was concluded that the intelligibility of a word is most closely associated with the intelligibility of the initial sounds of a word. The fourth experiment was undertaken with contextual material and short phrases from two sources: flight patter and newspapers. The fifth experiment was related to  letter prediction. The sixth experiment used single words in different contexts. The seventh experiment was concerned with the nature of the distribution of responses. (TS)",

Half of the subjects were told that the speaker was communicating in a stimulated interview for a teaching position and the other half were told that the speaker was communicating with another student in an informal classroom exercise. The results indicated that there is no evidence of interaction between situational formality and message elaboration. The restricted version produced more negative ratings. The second study  further explored the determinants of the main effects for elaboration and restriction. The communication situation was constant for all subjects and the situation was described as formal. The results indicated that lexically restricted message versions were judged more negatively than lexically diverse ones. The restricted version produced more positive ratings of the attitudinally neutral concept. (WR)",

Observer bias, experimenter expectancy, and Pygmalion effects are sometimes called &quot;artifactual effects&quot; or &quot;experimental artifacts.&quot; A tentative model of potentially artifactual outcomes in  communication assessment is offered.

Although there is some disagreement, medical specialists generally contend that the condition is triggered by a highly emotional experience. Despite the absence of a physical growth to account for the sensation, the condition is nevertheless serious because it feeds upon fear. In most cases, an explanation by the doctor of the psychological elements involved and the relation of the condition to the traumatic experience which gave rise to it are enough to clear up the symptom. The psychologist and the speech pathologist, as well as the medical specialist, need to be aware of the prevalence of this condition. When the symptom occurs after an emotional shock and  in the absence of voice changes or dysphagia, an awareness on the part of the consultant of the globus hystericus syndrome can relieve much of the patient's fear.

Another original play, a Latin/rock musical titled \"A Donde Vas?\" with a theme loosely adapted from \"Everyman,\" is to be performed in 1975.

Furthermore, the essay translates this theory from the context of the small group into the context of the larger collectivity. In the process, several communicative demands and requirements are suggested. The manner in which communication strategies can fulfill  these demands is articulated, and potential methods for validating this explanation are offered. (Author)",

The problems and issues of existing RESA units are analyzed, and strategies for overcoming the problems are discussed. Empirical research and personal judgments conclude that RESAs can provide local districts with supplemental and support services and can facilitate the development of required programs and services. RESAs can contribute to the equalization of educational opportunities; the interface between urban,  suburban, and rural interests; the application of cost benefit/cost effective principles; the development of statewide research and evaluation; and the development of educational change.

        "description":"Two methods for aiding workers to realize success in their job search process were investigated in the present study. These approaches involved the use of computerized systems for matching workers and employers for interviews that supposedly were mutually satisfying. The two approaches are identified as first generation and second generation computerized systems and differ in their level of sophistication for identifying &quot;best&quot; vs. &quot;acceptable&quot; interview pairings of workers and jobs, with the latter system incorporating the features of the former system plus additional inputs and outputs for evaluating interview quality. The subjects were persons seeking professional employment in the public schools. It appeared that for the procedure followed in this study, the second generation  system, did not substantially improve the results obtained from the first generation system. Several issues associated with this finding are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper describes an investigation of the effects of group interaction and consensus on information processing behavior when information is received sequentially or simultaneously by the information processing unit. Responses were compared to the Bayesian norm and further analyzed to determine the extent to which groups differed from individuals in processing information and how information processing behavior was affected by the mode of message transmission. Findings of the study showed that groups processed information more conservatively than \"statistical\" groups or individuals. Moreover, group conservatism was partially an artifact of the consensus process. In the aggregate, information received sequentially was also processed more conservatively than information received  simultaneously. Neither risk attitudes of the information processing units nor perceived data credibility were related to information processing behavior. A number of statistical tables and graphs summarize various findings of the study. (Author/JG)",

After consideration of what is meant by &quot;better planning,&quot; the author concludes that this claim for planning by objectives is not valid since an objective can neither be a source for deducing instructional activities nor a criterion for selecting the best learning activities. Furthermore, planning by objectives limits instructional planning by, at the outset, narrowing a planner's attention to a detailed consideration of means in a narrow and immediate context. A planning strategy that mutually refines objectives and learning experiences might be more trustworthy. (Author/JG)",

The collaborative decisionmaking experiment began in 1970 with an organization development (OD) intervention intended to train the school faculty in communication skills, group processes, problemsolving, and decisionmaking. The author served as the intervener for the project while pursuing graduate studies at the University of Oregon. The author describes the collaborative decisionmaking structure developed at the school as a result of the OD intervention and discusses some of the advantages and disadvantages of the new arrangement. Results of a 1974 staff survey showing showing widespread understanding and support of the  collaborative structure are contrasted with the results of a similar survey from 1970, before the OD intervention. In a brief addendum, the author summarizes significant developments at the school during the first half of the 1974-75 school year and discusses the addition of student representatives to two of the school's decisionmaking bodies.

This paper examines some of these efforts with a view to identifying their merits and defects, especially in the absence of a permanent structure for curriculum development activities. The paper also suggests guidelines for future curriculum development processes, including proposals for the establishment of curriculum development centers in the country. The structure, organization, and functioning of these centers, as well as their financial implications, are examined. (Author)",

The objectives of the symposium were to define the concept of policy and its interrelationship to power; provide a framework in which policy is affected by perceptions and demonstrate how status roles and perceptions alter the nature of policy; and provide a basis for administrators and researchers to integrate the previously vague and unintegrated concepts of policy, power, perception, and status into a model. In this paper Carter discusses the relationship that has developed between education and politics and notes that it is clear that political activity is one way to increase school resources and, therefore, improve the instructional program. The  school principal, if he possesses certain qualities in his personality, his attitudes, and his abilities, can use his influence to fashion needed coalitions in order to acquire the needed resources and achieve the adoption of the values and programs that he believes can better the school's educational program.

Drawing on the Educational Governance Project information and interviews, a gubernatorial involvement index was developed. The findings indicate that governors have a varied involvement in educational policymaking; that the nature of the involvement varies; and that some governors work through staff aides, but others involve themselves directly. Gubernatorial involvement was found to be crucial in school finance and tax reform measures; however, the governmental structure is only one facet of gubernatorial involvement. A correlational analysis shows  that selected fiscal variables of State tax burden, educational effort, and educational expenditures are most strongly associated with gubernatorial involvement. Based on this research, governors have clearly activated their potential and have become involved in State policymaking for the public schools. (Author/DW)",

This paper contends that inherent in the scientific-technical perspective is a commitment to social control that defines control in an exploitive sense, as a means of protecting the interests of the few over and above those of the majority of society. It is this notion of social control that has historically dominated American curriculum theory. Another notion of social control, one that defines control in a constructive sense, as a means of protecting the  interests of all segments of society, is to be found in the work of George Herbert Mead. An examination of Mead's thought can counter the prevailing orientation of the curriculum field. (Author)",

Linear regression was used to identify high and low productive units by measuring the relationship between statistically selected input factors and a measure of student achievement. Discriminant analysis was employed to determine which of several input variables were significantly associated with the classification. The design represents a refinement of efforts to determine the relative importance of factors subject to administrative control in effecting high student achievement. From their analysis, the authors concluded that, of those conditions subject to control by local school district administrators, teacher-related variables constitute the most  important group of factors associated with educational achievement.

The varied perceptions of Project Advance by school personnel, parents, and students at the participating schools are discussed in light of whether they encouraged or hindered adoption of the program. Perceptions of five characteristics were considered especially important--the &quot;relative advantage&quot; of adopting the program, its compatibility with existing social values and organizational structures, its complexity, its  trialability, and its observability. Results of the study show that Project Advance does not possess all five characteristics to an equal degree.

To build a more viable home-school partnership, we must systematically redefine the roles and functions of our schools. If the neighborhood elementary school is going to help get parents involved and committed to education, we should conceive of the school as a source for delivery of many services to the home. The parents of preschool children ought to be taught the fundamentals of home-based incidental teaching. We must persuade and even, in a friendly way, coerce parents to get  involved in education.

The change was accomplished with some variations in the three-scale grading system and with the high school using both systems. The second stage was to focus on the grading controversy on a districtwide basis by involving the San Juan Teachers Association to negotiate with the Board of Education for a district task force to study the grading practice at all grade levels throughout the district. The results of the study provided the  rationale for a recommendation to change the present grading policy. A new policy was adopted by the Board of Education in March 1975. (Author)",

        "description":"The model for internships in school administration came from other professional fields, particularly medicine. Internship programs for master's degree candidates have generally focused on middle-management positions, such as school principal. Often such programs have been offered by local and county school districts, independently of teacher-training institutions. On the other hand, university-based internships have usually been doctoral degree programs focused on top-level administrative assignments. There is a need to reflect systematically on the concept of internships as they relate to apparent changing patterns of leadership development and training. As leadership programs change in response to the varying needs of the systems of education, the function and structure of  internships also will change. Careful chronicling of that change and subsequent review of resulting modifications in internships would be helpful in establishing a foundation on which to build a more precise description of alternative internship structures, of how they work, and of what their impact might be.

Variations in State laws and in SEA role responsibilities created research problems. The results indicate that SEAs most frequently assume an informational role, but that they also have some involvement in policy development and in advising. Only a few SEAs perform regulatory or administrative roles. SEA involvement increases as the State laws become more complex. The study concludes that SEAs are significant actors in teacher collective negotiations and that they play a role even when another State agency has specific authority to administer the negotiations laws.

Employee motivation data were gathered from a sample of 297 teachers in nine school districts, using a modified Work Components Study. Data gathered from central office staff and school district records were used to calculate the degree of bureaucracy in each district.  Analysis of the data revealed no significant relationship between the degree of school district bureaucracy and teachers' scores on intrinsic motivational factors, risk propensity factors, and extrinsic motivational factors.

A questionnaire designed to obtain categorized information about the extent and scope of violence, vandalism, and dropouts for the school years 1970-71, 1971-72, and 1972-73, was sent to the superintendents of 757 school districts with an enrollment of 10,000 or more pupils ranging from grades K-12. In addition, the subcommittee corresponded with 50 school security directors requesting any available information they desired to contribute. This report discusses the information  obtained from these sources, together with various additional studies of school violence and vandalism. The first section of the report is a general overview of some of the trends and causes of school violence and vandalism throughout the country. The second section is a regional breakdown of the findings. The third and fourth sections deal with federal and state legislation in this area, and the final section details the subcommittee's future goals. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"A broad range of data and data sources useful in educational planning are identified along with some of the problems in collecting and using that data, and several systematic approaches for analyzing groups of community data are described. The place of a community profile as a data-collection, information-generating process in a comprehensive planning model is defined. The roles played by the profiling team--citizens, consultants, and school administrators--in the process are outlined, and the collection and analysis activities within a master planning context are defined. Specific data elements relevant to educational planning are detailed and assigned to categories of community resources, community concern, land use, and population. In each of the four subsections, data sources  and collection and analysis approaches are provided. A population/enrollment simulation model developed for use in both increasing and decreasing enrollment areas is described in terms of its required input that originates from a community profiling effort. A number of publications useful in understanding and executing a community profile are provided in the bibliography. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"This study investigates two problems related to federal support of elementary and secondary education in Canada: dynamic imbalances between the spending responsibilities and taxing powers of the federal and provincial governments, and the inability of different provinces to achieve comparable educational services at similar levels of financial effort. The redistribution of educational funds is explored in relation to four measures of fiscal capacity: personal income, declared income above a &quot;poverty line,&quot; taxable income, and the average yield of a representative provincial tax system. Each measure is used to evaluate the impact of three alternative allotment plans for 1960, 1965, and 1970. These allotment alternatives are applied to data for the 10 provinces to assess the impact  of federal direct spending and general fiscal transfers on provincial school systems. Analysis of the data shows that direct and indirect federal contributions to education alleviate extreme interprovincial differences in spending per pupil. However, because of the small federal share of total educational expenditures, interprovincial differences in school spending remain substantial. (Author/JG)",

The package consists of a coordinator handbook and units on setting goals, analyzing problems and deriving objectives. Each unit is composed of four-to-six modules that provide training on a limited number of instructional objectives. A typical module contains reading material, individual or small-group activities in which the trainees practice the skills, and feedback for the practice activities. Evaluation information was collected in three areas: (1) attitudes toward the units and attainment of their instructional objectives by persons who are trained with the units, (2) use of the units in both  schools and universities, and (3) evaluation of the units by knowledgeable reviewers.

        "description":"The term &quot;school finance&quot; refers to the levying of taxes to obtain revenue for our public elementary and secondary schools. For most people it brings to mind the local property tax, teacher salaries, and, perhaps, some personal memories of their own experiences in the schools. For state legislators school finance brings to mind the complex formula through which considerable amounts of tax dollars are distributed to school districts. It is apparent that school finance represents the bringing together of two of our major institutions--politics and education. This brief overview of finance reform has been written for legislators. It is intended to point to one very obvious fact--that when it comes to school finance reform, the building of adequate and equitable finance systems, the  spotlight is on the state legislature even though the federal government and the courts play large roles.

Innovations have occurred in curriculum development where secondary education received more flexibility, a broader subject-matter base, fewer exams, and increased extra-curricular activities. An unplanned, unsystematic teacher education program was structured into a planned curriculum with behavioral objectives to develop professional competence. Innovation in the integration policy brought two languages into one common curriculum. Other areas of innovation include the development of educational technology, expansion of  secondary technical training, and the development of educational research. The characteristics of change in Singapore are seen in purposefulness, connectedness, and pragmatism progressing through four stages of initiation, interpretation, implementation, and correction.

        "description":"Loyal policy support depends not only on an employee's knowledge of the form and structure of the institution, but also on his ability to influence its operations and goals. If there is ample opportunity for an employee to present his ideas and these ideas are put into action, he is more apt to feel like an integral participant in the district. Conversely, if constructive thought and action are thwarted, informal groups may arise within the district who are opposed to its stated goals. There are many theories of internal communication. One of the most useful is designed to keep employee informed about the structure of the district while at the same time emphasizing the importance of group cohesiveness. This theory considers six aspects of communication--source, message, channels,  receivers, effect, and feedback. Ultimately, the responsibility for internal communication rests with the superintendent. (Author)",

A further purpose was to determine if significant differences existed in the perception of student articulation problems by high school counselors, junior college admission officers, college and university admission officers, and college freshmen. Data gathered from 994 students at various Texas colleges, universities, and junior colleges showed that high school counselors are often unavailable to advise students, but that most students benefitted from what assistance they did receive. Many students reported nonbeneficial experiences with college representatives in the areas of &quot;preparation to enter college&quot; and&quot;selection of college courses,&quot; but most students reported beneficial contact in all other areas. Perceptions of the relative importance of ten student articulation problems by college freshmen differed significantly from high school counselors' perceptions on six of ten items and from the perceptions of junior college and college admission officers on two of the ten items. There were no significant differences between the perceptions of high school counselors, junior college admission officers, and college and university admission officers. (Author/JG)",

A brief review of each of these policy areas is presented. (Author)",

Therefore, administrators must speak for good education, learn well the bargaining skills, and emphasize give and take in bargaining. Teacher associations may be expected to justify their existence, assume privileges to be their rights, ask for more money for less work, and develop group cohesiveness. Because collective bargaining does not reduce conflict or strikes, administrators must not fear strikes, but preserve strong management rights. A glossary of bargaining terms is included. (DW)",

The benefits are improved instruction for students, changes in practitioner behavior, enhanced commitment and communication.&quot; Performance appraisal is based on objective data rather than on  personality and other factors.

Areas of consideration include identifying objectives, determining program costs, measuring learning outcomes, determining the contributions of the school and the program to learning outcomes, the effects of the beliefs of personnel on the success of PPBS, and the political implications of PPBS. Major points are as follows: 1) identifying objectives that accurately reflect the goals of the organization is a time-consuming process, 2) the effective determination of the costs of programs depends on the cooperation and commitment of personnel at the school level, 3) current analysis practices are inadequate to determine the contributions of the various components of the  learning environment to learning outcomes, 4) high risk and high-cost programs are desirable if PPBS is to help identify ways of doing things better or faster, and 5) better decisions are not likely to result from PPBS unless the policy-makers maintain a stable policy position.

At the same time, it is not immediately clear what combination of tax instruments should be used to replace the revenue that would be lost if reliance on the property tax were significantly reduced.

Discussed are the relationships between cognitive structure and intelligence and advocated is the substitution of a cognitive structure index for the standard IQ measure. The relationship between cognitive structure and learning is said to be demonstrated by the  need for a teacher to match the instructional material's structural complexity to the complexity level of the learner's cognitive structure.

Ss were given vocabulary instruction under one of three instructional conditions: Relational (relational elaborations and thematic summary), Non-Relational (non-relational elaborations and non-relational summary), and Mixed (non-relational elaborations and thematic summary). Analyses of data related to vocabulary development and the utilization of instructional strategies indicated that all conditions demonstrated increases in &quot;specific&quot; vocabulary development and that the utilization of instructional strategies  varied with the conditions. Evaluation of the three instructional conditions revealed that those receiving thematic summaries (the Relational and Mixed conditions) resulted in generally better performances. Results led to several suggestions for the development of elaboration-based vocabulary instruction for retarded children such as that concrete vocabulary words are easier to develop than are more abstract words.

The author points out the high proportion of minority and poor children in special education classes and stresses the need to change educational practice so that students with equal potential have an equal chance to grow regardless of racial differences. The root of the problem is defined as a prevalence of monolingual and monocultural educators in a multilingual and multicultural environment. Sample problems stemming from misassessment, inappropriate labeling, and inadequate teaching skills are explored, and learning patterns of Black people (such as a preference for inferential reasoning)  which are not taken into account in conventional curriculum are listed. Recommendations for change include the need for mainstream professionals to consult literature on the minority perspective, and the need for leader-administrators to enlist the help of minority professionals.

Papers address the following topics: developments in the education of the handicapped (such as early childhood education), reflections on training in emotional disturbance, legal aspects of the educational rights of children, learning resource centers, multi-media use in teacher training, and basic concerns regarding divorced mothers and their children. Research reports deal with topics such as: children with behavioral problems in a regular classroom setting, modularized and traditional teaching methods used in preservice teacher training, and evaluation of a non-categorical competency-based special education methods course, and behavioral  characteristics of children with specific learning disabilities. Other research papers concern: the effects of delaying consequences on the learning of emotionally disturbed children, the effects of teachers' styles on child behavior, teacher-pupil behavior in classes for the emotionally disturbed, the effect of ecological strategies on the ability of adolescents to maintain their behavior after being discharged from a state hospital, and the development of social interactions in a preschool for handicapped children. Two final papers described alternatives to intitutionalization in Texas and Indiana. (LS)",

The program included summer workshops and released-time training during the school year in indepth contingency management techniques for students, parent counseling, and communication skills. Data on the effects of the inservice teacher training on student classroom behavior were gathered by 18 specially trained observers at the beginning and the end of the 1973-74 school year, the effectiveness (as reflected in the reduced occurrence of inappropriate student behavior) of teachers who received training in contingency management techniques was  compared with the effectiveness of teachers who had not received contingency management training, and the results of standardized achievement tests were analyzed to assess the effect of student behavior change on academic achievement. It was found that desired changes in student behavior (such as a lessening of student emotional conflict) resulted from application of the special teacher training, but no significant difference was found in students' academic achievement.

Results indicated an increase in illicit drug (primarily marijuana) use, while the incidence of other kinds of delinquency declined among boys and remained stable among girls. The marked increase in drug use form 1967 to 1972 appeared to be a function of variables such as greater autonomy granted to adolescents by their parents, growing parental tolerance of marijuana use, and perceptions among teenagers of drug use as a more normal peer activity.

Studies investigating the social interaction between physical disabilities and retardation are not abundant.

Considered are the types of human rights that are most frequently in need of protection within a research setting (such as the right to privacy); the most common threats to these rights that are posed by research (such as when deception is used for experimental purposes); and the criteria for determining when a subject is 'at risk'. Seven actions the experimenter can take to minimize risks to the subject are proposed (such as maintaining the confidentiality of data), and conditions and procedures for the acceptance of risk by both a subject and an experimenter are outlined (including  the mechanism of voluntary informed consent).

Described in part one are project activities and reproduced in part two are training materials to explain the proposed strategies. Reviewed are such project aspects as components (including education and social services) of annual state plans and models of programing-planning-budgeting systems. A discussion of project methodology and results centers on findings from state workshops and surveys regarding such major responsibilities as assessing state needs and monitoring on-going programs and  projects. Summarized is the project's progress and outlined are second year activities. Instructional materials presented include the script of a slide-tape show illustrating a planning and evaluation strategy for state developmental disabilities councils, and procedures and exercises for workshops on defining goals and priorities and evaluating goal achievement by state and local councils. Two appendixes present such information as a list of 11 expanded problem statements adopted by the Oregon State Council for use in the state plan. (CL)",

It is noted that the Stanford-Binet appears to be the best single identification instrument currently available, that identification of the disadvantaged gifted requires special emphasis, and that an absolute criterion for denoting giftedness is not only legitimate but necessary to identify those so advanced that they require special attention beyond the usual school provisions. Given are a definition of giftedness and a rationale for identification which includes group screening and individual  identification and case study. Advantages and limitations of the following screening measures are described: teacher nomination, group intelligence and achievement tests, nomination by others, nomination by peers, parent nomination, pupil products, student expressions of values and ideals, the autobiography, multiple screening measures and abbreviated tests, creativity tests, and judgments of creativity by experts. Considered separately are steps for successful identification of the gifted and talented among the disadvantaged population. A successful procedure within the total population is seen to include early identification, continuing search, and use of multiple resource materials. (DB)",

Discussed are the importance of identifying the gifted and typical characteristics such as exceptional academic achievement, a wide range of interests, and independence of thought. Statistics on fiscal support and personnel needs are given to support the contention that the gifted are educationally neglected. Causes of this neglect are thought to include failing to identify the gifted and negative attitudes resulting in underachievement, self-doubt, and conformity by many gifted children. Results of a questionnaire sent to 100 parents of gifted children are reported to show that gifted children  have many out of school interests and have some satisfying school experiences but many school related problems. Brief answers are provided for typical questions asked by parents such as \"What can you do about underachievers?\" and \"Will a special class create competition and bad feelings?\" A final chapter on the role of parents gives suggestions at the preschool and school age levels including such things as flexible school attendance to allow the child to participate in out of school educational activities.

Described is an individualized approach to working with parents which focuses on helping mothers to acquire attitudes and techniques for fostering their child's learning and development through parent group support and through discussions of topics such as discipline, basic routines of sleeping and eating, and the etiology and treatment of childhood schizophrenia and autism. Stressed is the need for professionals to help the mother deal with her anxieties and develop realistic expectations for her child rather than blaming her for the child's pathology.  Toilet training is viewed as a complex process of learned behavior which can be taught through clear directions, special procedures (such as getting the child's attention and regularly scheduled intervals), and positive reinforcement techniques. Step-by-step guidelines are presented for preparing and initiating the toilet training program. (LH)",

In addition, the following points are summarized: (1) One cannot translate anything perfectly from one language to another, due to the various implications mentioned above; (2) Everyone has his own idiolect, but everyone is also multilingual in that different  linguistic rules are used in different social contexts; (3) Although every language is arbitrary, everyone feels that his native language is not. People can have strong emotional reactions to the slightest deviation from what is expected from other speakers in particular situations; and (4) At some phenomenological level, people seem to feel, erroneously, that language is absolute and unchanging.

It is then suggested that the relations which may appropriately underlie nominal compounds of the type Noun + Noun can best be defined negatively, i.e. by listing those relations between two nouns which cannot underlie compounds rather than those which can. It is further argued that in order for compound formation to take place the relation between the nouns in question must be \"appropriately classificatory.\" A brief examination of abstract compounds in English and German leads to the conclusion that there are probably fewer systematic restrictions valid across languages on the formation of abstract than of concrete nominal compounds. The appendix to the paper contains a  brief examination of English nominal compounds with a primary + tertiary stress pattern (e.g., bookstore) and nominal phrases with a secondary + primary stress pattern (e.g., morning coffee).

Mean number of morphemes per utterance was used to determine linguistic level. The two groups were matched according to five linguistic levels previously established and grammars were written for the language sample of each child. Five aspects of syntactic development were chosen as the basis of comparison between the two groups: phrase structure rules, transformations, construction (or sentence) types, inflectional morphology, and minor lexical categories. While few significant differences were found for the more general aspects of syntax, such as phrase structure rules, frequently occurring  transformations, inflectional morphology, and the development of minor lexical categories, significant differences were found for the less general aspects of syntax. For example, significant differences were found between the two groups for infrequently occurring transformations and the number of major syntactic categories per construction type. In addition, the deviant group also showed a marked delay in the onset and acquisition time for learning base syntax. These results are discussed according to translational and cognitive developmental theory. (Author/JSHR)",

The issue of student motivation is involved with the form of language used--standard or nonstandard--and educators may adopt the linguistic view that all forms of language have value and their use depends on the occasion. The mechanics of reading and writing involve skills of recognizing and reproducing letters; linguists' work in the area of phoneme-grapheme correspondence can be useful here. Reading comprehension involves ability to understand sentences and texts through the disciplines of semantics (including grammatical and lexical meaning), textual analysis, and syntax. Vocabulary building, while often over emphasized as an indicator of  educational level, is an important language skill; words and lexical units may be categorized according to subculture and taxonomy as they best relate to the students. Oral and written expression and composition must be concerned with syntax, stylistics, textual analysis, and standard language theory, all fields in which linguistic findings can be part of the educational process.

        "description":"This paper asks whether the imprecision and complexity of natural language, as opposed to the language of science or logic, represent flaws or essential functional properties. It is argued that ambiguity can be manipulated by the speaker through environmentally derived characteristics. A discussion follows on the study of the functions of language as conceived by the Prague school, and the effect of functional linguistics on American sociolinguistics. While both schools agree on a definition of the term \"functions of language,\" the central problem is a disagreement in the approach to the study of language functions. The Prague school postulates a specific number of functions on the basis of a particular theoretical understanding of the speech act, while the American school  believes that language functions should be discovered rather than postulated. As only extensive further research can lead to a definitive theory of language functions, it is hoped that the significance of the functions of language will be recognized, and that the study of functional linguistics will benefit structural linguistics as well.

        "description":"This paper proposes a broader and more rigorous approach to the analysis of errors produced by second language learners. As a supplement to longitudinal studies, a procedure called &quot;lateralisation&quot; is advocated as a way of providing the researcher with more data than is normally available through examination of learner text alone. In this procedure a preliminary analysis of learner texts is used to draw preliminary hypotheses, which can then be tested by giving the learner reconstructed errors for his approval or rejection. From this, an abstract characterization of errors can be made. The elicitation of linguistic and metalinguistic statements from the learner on his errors is the stage that should considerably increase the amount of specific data the researcher can obtain.  However, since the learner's language is in a state of flux, it is important to use the elicitation techniques very soon after the initial learner texts have been developed. Although this work is limited to linguistic analysis, the help of social psychology is also indicated as important. Several examples of elicitation are given, including a case study that illustrates the use of elicitation in error analysis. (AM)",

The program is based on the premise that realistic language instruction begins with an assessment of each student's oral proficiency in both languages. The teacher should then develop this proficiency, before reading instruction begins, to bridge the gap between the informal spoken language of the child's home and the formal language of school. To do this, teachers must understand the process of language learning, the differences between oral and written language, and language varieties and functions. The \"Gloria and David Oral Language Assessment: Spanish/English Version\" was administered to determine oral language dominance and  to profile each student's language skills for use as a basis for individualized instruction. The report includes statistics on program enrollment; language assessment materials and data; outlines of inservice workshops; an evaluation of the program to date; and recommendations for instruction, development of objectives, relative emphasis on the first and second languages, community involvement, program coordination, and staff needs.

It is argued that structuralist and generative treatments of vowel sandhi, which are characterized by generalizations about vowel &quot;shortening&quot; and dropping and glide formation, are inadequate because they focus exclusively on segmental phenomena. These analyses ignore the interplay between suprasegmental and segmental phenomena. Generative analyses are also forced to a rule-ordering strategy that, it is argued, is inappropriate for the level of the derivation where the rules apply. The analysis offered here, supported by phonetic evidence, accounts for syllable timing and syllable sequence type, thereby allowing one general statement about the segmental changes  that contiguous vowels undergo in sandhi. This eliminates the need for a rule-ordering strategy. The present analysis shows vowel sandhi to be a consequence of suprasegmental timing and syllable sequence type imposed over a two-syllable domain. (Author/KM)",

A contributing factor is that until recently, linguists and foreign language educators have concentrated on the student's acquisition of language (phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon), and have not concerned themselves with language usage. The purpose of this paper is to focus attention on the need to teach language students not only what to say, but how to say it and when. A brief theoretical discussion provides a linguistic background for the presentation of data collected in three foreign countries and the United States. An analysis of the data shows that language students are frequently forced to cope with social situations for which they are not fully  equipped. A sample lesson illustrates how sociolinguistic theory can be applied to the development of teaching materials. And finally, specific recommendations are offered for increasing the sociolinguistic proficiency of our students. (Author)",

(2) Would the computer program help individualize language instruction? Conclusions were positive on both counts. The computer-assisted instructional (CAI) program overcame some of the common objections of students to standard individualized materials. The computer component freed class sessions for greater use of the target language. Computer-supplemented language instruction helped both the  instructor and the students recognize their roles in language teaching and learning. The use of dedicated telephone lines for CAI would make the positive benefits of this tool available to language teachers everywhere at acceptable costs to administrators. (Author/PMP)",

        "description":"In an effort to find a greater source of motivation and incentive in an activity in which the students would go beyond the textbook to use their foreign language skills, a total immersion German-speaking weekend camping excursion was undertaken at the Mexico Academy and Central School in Mexico, N.Y. The activity was organized by one language teacher and easily accomodated 25 students of all levels; therefore, the program is suitable for schools of all sizes and may be expanded or minimized to meet the needs and aspirations of interested teachers. The main purposes of the weekend were to provide a new impetus for German language learning (and teaching) and to encourage the students to speak as fluently and as often as possible in German. Complete descriptions of location,  expenses, grouping, native (or near-native) supervision, guests, activities schedule, menu, post-questionnaires, and conclusions are included here. An adaptation of the Mary Dufort Student Attitude Scale (1962) was developed. The scale determined that the weekend excursion had improved student attitudes toward language and language learning and that student interest and motivation had increased as a direct result of the total immersion experience.

        "description":"This survey attempts to bring together as much information as possible on the current study and teaching of North American Indian languages in the United States and Canada. The primary source of data for this survey was a questionnaire distributed in the spring of 1973 to 61 universities and colleges in the U.S. and Canada. Other sources were publications, conferences, and correspondence with individuals working with these languages. An overview of the study of North American Indian languages is presented first, outlining the contributions of several generations of linguists and leading up to a discussion of the present situation. Some current trends are identified through discussion of a representative group of recently instituted programs. Three appendices present the collected  data. Appendix A lists American Indian language courses and other types of programs of 101 universities and colleges in the U.S. and Canada. In Appendix B, materials useful for the study of Amerindian languages are cited. Appendix C indicates persons who are making significant contributions to the study of American Indian languages. Also included are statistics relating to the present number of speakers in the major language groups and the recommendations of the Conference on Priorities in American Indian Language Work, held in Eugene, Oregon, in August 1973.

The survey attempted a critical assessment of various aspects of the English program.

Part two deals with a study of the relationships among such factors as age, educational level, sex, and the use of English. The final two chapters present a critical analysis of the program and a summary of recommendations. It is believed that both the data and the methodology of the survey will be of interest to researchers and educational planners not only in Jordan but  in other countries as well.

        "description":"This dissertation examines the principles of two current theories of first language acquisition and from them synthesizes a second language methodology. As a background to the problem of second language methodology, it is stated that the basing of second language methodologies on first language learning is currently being questioned and that the difficulty is compounded by varying theories of the nature of first language acquisition. The nativist position is examined, and a foreign language methodology developed on the basis of that position is then criticized in terms of the concerns of second language teachers. Following this, a compromise position between nativism and empiricism is examined and used as a basis for a second methodology. This second methodology is then  criticized according to the above-mentioned criteria. The paper concludes that the nativist approach to first language acquisition is not a good basis for second language methodology, whereas some principles of the nativist-empiricist approach are. The major question remains whether such a methodology can be made effective. A further question is whether children learn a foreign language more quickly or more effectively than do adults.

The hierarchy refers to the Ss' ranking of the descriptive items according to their importance. The Ss consisted of 36 males and 36 females from a Vanderbilt University Introductory Psychology class. A comparison of the feature listing and the hierarchy ranking revealed that many male-female differences found in the feature listing were eliminated or diminished in the hierarchy analysis.

(2) More experts who may not possess the usual academic credentials be added to graduate school faculties. (3) More intensified efforts be made to recruit able minority-group representatives and women to the faculties. (4) Often rigid institutional requirements, such as residency and  fellowship policies, should become more flexible to meet the needs of new groups of students, for example, part-time women students.

Most are large or medium-size corporations that regularly recruit college men and women. A total of 31 percent of these companies plan to contact fewer colleges in 1975, but 29 percent will contact more schools. The companies expect to hire almost exactly the number of men with bachelor's degrees they hired from 1974 classes. No decrease is indicated. Also, they expect to hire 7 percent more women graduates. In greatest demand are men in engineering, accounting, business administration, and sales, and women in accounting, general business, data processing, and engineering. Almost all of these companies will raise starting salaries. Predicted averages  for 1975 indicate that bachelor's degree graduates in engineering will be offered about $1,062 per month, accountants about $990, graduates in business administration about $814, and liberal arts graduates about $776 per month. Almost all of the companies that reported starting salaries for both men and women indicated they were the same. Although there has been a somewhat restricted job market for college graduates in recent years, the responding companies report that from 23-33 percent of the men employed three years ago have left.

        "description":"The equitable distribution of aid funds is viewed in this paper as a problem in taxation according to ability to pay or economic well-being. This approach is emphasized because it is fruitful to consider the various financial need analysis models as systems of taxation that result in the parents' expected contribution to the postsecondary education of their dependents. However, this study deals with only the first step in the development of an equitable tax system, the construction and evaluation of an objective index of ability to pay or economic well-being. Accordingly, a simple two-step model is suggested for evaluating alternative measures of economic well-being. The first step is a comparison of the theoretical implications of competing measures. The second step is a  comparison of the implications of each measure for the perceived distribution of economic well-being among aid applicant families. It is concluded that received economic theory can be useful in analyzing the implications of measuring economic well-being in alternative ways. However, a theoretical investigation raises as many questions as it answers. The choice of a measure of economic well-being involves many arbitrary assumptions and value judgments. Received theory is valuable primarily in identifying the truly normative aspects of models used to assess economic well-being and in pinpointing the consequences of assumptions and value judgments.

        "description":"This study analyzed the 1974-75 freshmen academic scholarship recipients at Arkansas State University with respect to their academic potential (ACT scores and rank in high school senior class) and the size of high school from which they graduated. A further purpose was to determine the grade-point average that these students earned during the fall semester, 1975. The results of the study indicated: (1) The 1974 scholarship recipients had an average for all freshmen. (2) Of the two award criteria, rank in class was significantly more predictive of academic performance than the ACT composite score. (3) Those scholarship recipients who maintained a 3.00 average tended to come from larger high schools, ranked higher in the high school senior class, and had higher ACT composite  scores. (4) The multiple correlation and regression analysis produced a statistically significant equation; however, the standard error of estimate was large enough to restrict the practical application of the equation. Only rank in class was significantly related to academic performance. (5) Multiple discriminant analysis uncovered a statistically significant differential between the above 3.00 grade-point average group and the below 3.00 grade-point average group. (MJM)",

Perhaps the most important question posed by such legislation is \"Who is the employer for the state, university, college, or community college?\" If this question goes unanswered, the legislature often permits a state agent outside the university to be the employer. This paper is intended to offer one set of suggestions for shaping legislation that would be beneficial to trustees and others interested in the integrity and ability of institutions to govern themselves. These suggestions are based on a decision that the chief executive officer be designated as the  employer representing the government, with the board of governors acting as the administrative board for purposes of collective bargaining and in other educational matters. Included in the pamphlet are sections covering: statement of policy, definitions, public employees' relations board, determination of representation status, resolution of disputes, elections, unions, management rights, and student rights.

        "description":"On May 12, 1972, the University of Delaware Chapter of the American Association of University Professors was elected as the exclusive bargaining agent for all regular members of the voting faculty. There had been no threats of a cutback in faculty positions by the administration. No bills had been introduced in the state legislature to eliminate tenure, increase workloads, or curtail fiscal autonomy of the university. Undoubtedly, the professors had been affected by news of these occurrences at other institutions. The deteriorating conditions of the academic job market presented an even more direct threat to these professors. By May 1972, many of the faculty had begun to realize that they no longer had the mobility, bargaining power, or job security that was formerly taken for  granted. Individious comparison with unionized workers in the public sector, especially secondary school and junior college teachers, could have been one of the other factors that motivated the professors to unionize. This article examines the certification campaign and attempts to explain exactly what factors motivated the professors to make a break with tradition. (Author/PG)",

The major purpose of this study is to learn what is happening to recent business education graduates in terms of such variables as: types of entry level positions graduates are holding: how these positions were found; length of time to locate positions and plans for graduate studies. Necessary data was obtained through questionnaires sent each year to the graduates of the 1970-71, 1971-72, and 1972-73 academic years soon after they  graduated. Some findings are: (1) approximately 90 percent of the graduates of the Business Education and Administrative Services Department found employment either in teaching or business and industry during the three-Year period under study; (2) unemployment among the 1970-73 graduates is lower than the Michigan labor force population; (3) slightly more than one-third to almost one-half of the graduates found their positions by applying directly on their own.

A few of the areas in which it has been employed are identifying educational goals and objectives, curriculum and campus planning, studies of cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis, evaluation procedures, and studies of resource allocation. While most Delphi studies obtain convergence of opinion after two or more rounds, none of the studies investigated the permanency of the opinion convergence. To investigate this question, 26 faculty who had participated in an earlier Delphi study of goals, were given the identical questionnaire one year later. This questionnaire asked their perceptions of the importance given to different goals by their institution as well as what  degree of importance they think should be attached to each goal. In both analyses it was found that ratings of the second questionnaire were similar to the initial Delphi questionnaire. In addition, there was a significant interaction between these different scores and the goal areas. While this study does not provide any definite answer to the original question of the permanency or response changes as a result of the Delphi technique, it does indicate that this is likely to be a fertile area for additional research.

(3) No new academic program duplication should be permitted among the institutions in the region. (4) Full-time enrollment ceilings should be imposed on the 4-year public institutions in the region. (5) Morgan State College should be deveolped into a state university. (6) The state should provide access for qualified students of all races to doctoral degree programs available in the state.

The findings indicate that there has been an increase in the number of individuals with full-time affirmative action responsibility at both the four-year colleges  and agricultural and technical schools. However, there was no increase among the community colleges. Individuals assigned affirmative action duties on a collateral basis continue to have job titles that cover a range of positions. There was a substantial turnover rate among affirmative action officers from 1973 to 1974. More than 50 percent of the institutions surveyed report that their affirmative action plans are \"in preparation.\" (Author)",

However, they were undecided whether the university was aware of their needs as student veterans.

The focus at this college has been taken from the teacher and placed on the student, giving the student the primary voice in what he is to study and how. Toward this end learning tools developed by the college are printed booklets called modules, written around a specific body of knowledge, area of inquiry, or problem. The first of these modules to reach the presses was entitled An Introduction to Women's Studies and was a consciousness-raising piece. And as typical of all modules it used history, sociology, literature, mythology, and some  psychoanalytical theory to approach the problem. The second module was entitled Women in the 17th Century. This module was designed for students who wanted to investigate the history of women in America, but it is also used by students interested in colonial and/or social history. Other modules related to Women in the 17th Century are the Myth of Courty Love and Witchcraft in America. The author then continues to discuss the women's studies program at Empire State College and the college's innovative learning environment. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"This study analyzes the enrollment patterns and academic achievement of 2,615 undergraduate students entering the University of Washington Educational Opportunity Program between fall quarter 1969 and summer quarter 1973. Categories chosen for data summarization were: ethnic composition, sex, admissions eligibility, and average quarterly credits. Findings of the study indicate: (1) Enrollment increased rapidly over the four-years under study. (2) Black students, the largest group, experienced a rapid early buildup in number enrolled followed by an equally rapid leveling off. (3) Interms of admissibility, students entering directly from high school had the lowest percentage of those regularly admissible. (4) A majority of the Asian American students enrolled as regularly  admissible students. (5) EOP students achieved an average UW cumulative grade point average of 2.2 and completed 10.3 credits per quarter on the average for a four-year period. (6) There were startling differences in academic performance across EOP students as a whole over the course of the four years. More than 400 students enrolled on the average for 12 credits per quarter but completed only 2.3 credits per quarter with a UW cumulative GPA of 1.0. (Author/MJM)",

This study answers that question by studying opinions and contracts at six representative community college campuses in upstate New York. Findings of the study indicate that collective bargaining helped to produce changes in grievance procedures, faculty participation in the decision-making process, and in policies relative to academic freedom. Changes were also noted as to opinions about tenure and promotion policies. A high percentage of faculty and administrators indicated that formal tenure policies had been established on their campuses prior to collective bargaining. A large proportion reported that after the introduction of collective bargaining a formal written policy on tenure had been  established. (Author/MJM)",

What are the major administrative activities and functions associated with such responsibilities? What relationships do these have with an ability to delegate, to control one's time for planning and self-initiated activities, or personal sense of productivity, enjoyment, and stress? This paper attempts to address these questions in the form of a time management case study, drawing on data from a staff development project for administrators in a college at a major American university. Through the use of a new sampling technique and traditional descriptive and parametric statistics, it is possible to identify, rapidly and with precision, a large number of variables that describe the work  process as it relates to the above questions. The findings indicate that there is considerable commonality across individuals and that it is possible to deal with such issues as time management, job stress, and enjoyment on an organizational level.

        "description":"This report describes the Hofstra freshmen accepted for the fall 1973 semester, and focuses on those students who graduated at the top of their high school class. Approximately 28 percent (901) of the 3,210 applicants paid a $100 fee (shows), and it is likely that a majority of the &quot;no shows&quot; decided to attend other schools. The variation in accepted rates (the number of accepted applicants as a percentage of the total number accepted), percent shows (the number of shows as a percentage of the total number accepted), were cross-tabulated by high school decile, geographic origin, major, and financial aid status to provide information useful in recruitment. Applicants graduating near the top of their school class made up the bulk of those accepted, but they were less likely to show  at Hofstra. Acceptance rates reflect the college emphasis on quality, but show rates tend to favor the poorer students. Nassau applicants were the most likely to attend Hofstra. The bulk of all who were accepted (46 percent) and all who showed (60 percent) were from Nassau. Smaller numbers of applicants came from Suffolk, but they were second most likely to attend. Applicants from any area but Long Island were less likely to show, those from New York State areas other than New York City or Long Island were the least likely. Although there were unequal distributions of applicants in the different majors, there was little variation in show rates. Those who were undecided about their major were a little more likely to attend, but differences were small. (Author)",

Interview data for applicants to a medical school for two recent consecutive years were examined. For the first year, 573 applicants were interviewed; for the second year, 675 were interviewed. Twenty-six physicians were interviewed in the first year, and 38 interviewed in the second year, with 20 interviewed both years. In the first year, 146 pairs of interviewers interviewed the same candidates. In year 2, 73 of the 238 pairs were retained. Results indicated that most interviewers were both reliable and \"correct\" or valid. Interviewers who were identified as candidates for unreliability were inspected to see if these  interviewers gave ranking incongruents with the admissions committee, thus providing ready identification of those interviewers who are reliable, and whose judgments are in accord with validity criteria.

The instrument was designed to give members' respondents to a wide variety of contemporary issues in higher education. Items to which well over 1,000 respondents answered affirmatively were: (1) Institutions of higher education should provide prospective students with accurate information regarding employment in their chosen fields. (2) Most students would benefit from an extended period of time away from formal schooling. (3) Students today are generally more sophisticated about an institution's relevance to their economy, current student aid policies make it harder for the middle class to go to college than either the very rich or the  very poor. (5) As admissions standards are lowered, academic standards are likely to become lower too. (6) Female students should not be excluded from the military academies because of their sex. (7) Of the potential useful research conducted in higher edication, very little is ever applied. Additional findings indicating both positive and negative issues and a copy of the survey showing total responses to each item are included. (MJM)",

        "description":"American higher education in this century has been almost schizophrenic in its development. As money and knowledge began to spread more distributively across the population, the population began to demand for its children a more equitable access into the world of the more privileged. Education and privilege were highly correlated. Greater access is forcing higher education to be honest about liberal and career emphases in recruitment and curricula. It is not enough for administration and a few faculty to become actively concerned with learned-centered reform. The learner must be the center of his universe. The learner must be able to seek out persons and programs that respond to his or her perceived needs. The higher education institutions must perceive and appreciate the\"universe\" of need and opportunity if our universities are to be related to and supported by the whole people. Distributive rather than hierarchical quality is necessary in higher education if we are to share in the creation of a world of distributive justice. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"There is no clear consensus of the term \"learner-centered reform.\" Learner-centered reform has become by implication either the cause or the consequence of inflated grades, lowered admission requirements, affirmative action, elimination of language and other requirements, student evaluation of teaching, abandonment of research, and many other ills that afflict the contemporary academy. It is fair to assume that most students attending truly nontraditional institutions probably would not be enrolled at all if only the traditional options existed. Some valid cause for concern about learner-centered reform stems from the consumer protection movement. There is growing concern in this area for external and nontraditional degree programs. There is also growing concern about  accreditation. There is a threat posed by learner-centered reform to scholars and teachers of the traditional mold. If the influence of the learner in shaping the curriculum and evaluating his performance expands, it must be at the expense of the instructor. One positive step would be to integrate nontraditional programs more fully into the total fabric of the institution. The potential for consortia and other interinstitutional arrangements for facilitating nontraditional study has barely been tapped. Consortia could also serve to distribute, and thus minimize, the costs of responding to new student demands and interests. (Author/PG)",

The economic insecurity of a good section of the professoriate, especially the younger members, must be kept in mind. More than one half of faculty who teach in higher education have no opportunity to earn extra income, and nearly one-third of the teachers in higher education are earning an income below the national average family income. While the faculty must be accountable for its actions, that accountability cannot be achieved by increasing faculty insecurity. Another threat to faculty is in the area of academic freedom. This threat comes not so much from  outside the academic community but from a timidity and acquiescence within the ranks. The most important function of higher education is to stimulate a perception of values that will enable the citizenry to shape the processes of economic development rather than be shaped by them.

Through the adoption of the Basic Grant Program and a program of institutional aid following the student, the federal government has said that it will no longer put the emphasis on the dispensers of education. This has been strengthened by the cutbacks in institutional aid flowing from research grants. What Congress opted for was a consumer-oriented program that puts its faith in the students. Another major change in the 1972 amendments was the enlargement of the scope of federal assistance to postsecondary training outside colleges and universities. Congress is seeking to insure that every dollar spent has a result that is measureable. The higher education community must  continue to work to insure that the Federal Government is supportive of programs that will make the nation's education offerings not only available to as many as possible, but also of a quality that is desirable.

Sixteen research questions were designed and answered concentrating on: number, flow, and categories of grievance appeals; establishment of management and employee rights; rationale for review decisions; personnel and technical relationships; governance issues; and management and union interviews. Results indicated that: (1) The grievance review officers, in accordance with contract provisions, considered procedural matters as the only acceptable basis for grievance.  (2) Grievants and/or the union continued to appeal grievances for which precedents had already been established in previous reviews. (3) The power of the reviewing officers and arbitrators was substantially limited by the contract, the policies of the SUNY trustees, the rules and regulations of other state agencies, and by state law.

Of the 495 questionnaires mailed, 375 were returned. The results of this survey indicate that a majority of the chosen institutions now have some form of mechanism and that this mechanism is being used in institutional decision making. However, it is not at all clear whether the political clout of the office doing the evaluation is such that people listen to the recommendations of the evaluation specialist. The fact that the data is being used in decision making does not necessarily mean that the decisions being made are good ones. It was also noted that the sample of institutions, carefully selected  on a number of criteria that would lead one to believe that they were innovative, have still not moved as consistently as expected toward a rigorous and analytical evaluation scheme.

The major reasons that no-shows did not attend UMCP were that it was not their first choice school (49 percent) and they did not have enough money to enroll (14 percent). The main reasons no-shows chose another school were smaller size, and  more personal atmosphere (20 percent), and better school academically (16 percent). When asked what they liked most about UMCP, the no-shows said good course offerings (25 percent) and close to home (16 percent). When asked what they liked least about UMCP they said size (50 percent) and poor on-campus housing (2 percent). Specific suggestions to counter the negative reactions in recruiting students were made and discussed. (Author)",

A general systems conceptualization called the open systems university is presented. Comprehensive and generic in character, it is hoped that the theory of the open university will be viable enough to fill the lacuna in organizational theory literature on the university. The university can be likened to open systems of the natural types (biological, chemical, or physical systems). All open systems are self-regulating systems. The university is an open system of high complexity, high statistical improbability and order. Its subsystem units are: (1) decision-making bodies, and (2) operational departments. The university is a  self-regulating, goal-seeking, open system, which translated into human affairs means freedom and responsibility. The hope is that this open system view of the university will have substantive meaning and be a contribution to the organizational theory about the university; and it is hoped that this view provides useful pragmatic insight for those who lead lives of the university today, wherever the institution is found.

The instrument used to obtain was the Social Work Practice Problems Inventory, which consists of 26 statements of problem situations similar to those often encountered by social workers. The analysis of data revealed that the students, irrespective of amount of formal social work education, were in general agreement about the degree of appropriateness of problem solutions but that  there was substantial disagreement between the students and the practitioners. The statistically significant differences between the two groups were largely attributable to the students' tendency to rate the solutions as less appropriate than did the practitioners. Reasons suggested to account for the differences between two groups include inexperience on the part of students in dealing with similar problems, a tendency for students to be critical of less than ideal solutions, and a lack of formal educational experiences designed to improve the students' problem-solving skills.

The conclusions drawn from the various studies indicate: (1) There are many kinds of dropouts; each group should be defined operationally, as clearly as possible. (2) Although techniques for data analysis have become more consistent, it has become apparent that each individual college has a unique attrition problem. It is of prime importance to have on-going data collection and analyses to evaluate the problems and progress of an institution. (3) Precollege indicators such as socioeconomic data, commitment to get a degree, financial need, academic background, and commitment to Hofstra can help identify potential withdrawers. (4) Of these precollege variables, academic aptitude and  past academic performance have been the most important indicators of college attrition in the past. (5) There are certain college characteristics, such as majors offered and location of school, that make students more or less satisfied with their school. (6) Some of these characteristics are changeable and important to the kind of student who is educationally committed and has a good academic background. (7) The attrition problem is multicausal and not fully explainable. (8) There are no comprehensive models from the literature that have produced a substantial decrease in attrition rates. In summary, the literature on retention indicates that intervention techniques appear to be the most researched and potentially positive of the tools for increasing retention. (MJM)",

        "description":"This descriptive study is an attempt to ascertain whether minorities in higher education are aware of the procedures and techniques needed in order to earn promotion and tenure. Specifically, the study was an attempt to find if the participants felt that the informal methods (friends, social gatherings, parties, etc.) were more effective in learning the procedure than the formal (explained by the employer) method; were written copies of the procedures given to them; and for the participants to list some suggestions that could assist newly employed faculty members in higher education. The findings showed that the participants believed that the informal method of acquiring information concerning tenure and promotion was more effective than the formal method. Consequently, minority  faculty members were less informed than majority faculty because they were not invited to or did not attend as many social activities. In addition, the data revealed that about one-half of the participants were given policies concerning tenure and promotion. The third finding was that minorities must become assertive and seek answers to questions concerning promotion and tenure. (Author)",

        "description":"Most of the people who are involved in higher education recognize that corporate interest in developing significant, job-related educational opportunities is growing. The motivation to provide corporate educational programs ranges from the need to improve skills to an interest in responding to legal and social responsibilities by expanding employment opportunities for women and minorities. It may be useful to view this corporate interest in human resources development in light of the increased sensitivity of institutions of higher education to outreach efforts and to speculate about a number of alternative ways in which productive and mutually rewarding relationships between the two sectors may develop. These include areas such as \"preparation-for-retirement\" courses for  employees and their spouses, career development seminars for women and minority employees, and the sharing of corporate educational resources to address social and institutional needs. In an era of stabilizing or declining enrollments, the prospect of additional, fully reimbursable programs for industrial clients may be an attractive prospect as severe financial problems are requiring institutions to make more efficient use of underutilized staff, as well as develop new sources of income. In addition, the building of bridges with the corporate sector may serve as an effective intitial outreach effort to bring adults to the campus for other programs. (Author/PG)",

In the process of the experiment, it was hoped that the Small College would develop programs that could be of value to other colleges. The Small College opened in the academic year 1972-73, with the support of the Carnegie Corporation and the Office of New Program Development and Evaluation of the California State University and College System. As of fall 1974, the Small College had an enrollment of 285 students and a faculty of 15. The Small College faculty, in this document, seeks to communicate to the higher education community what the program has accomplished to date. Specific  examples are given to convey a detailed sense of what is happening within the program and to illustrate its general purposes. Chapters cover: new approaches to curriculum; an alternative to freshman composition; interdisciplinary courses; less time, more options: (intensity week, variable unit courses, student-taught courses, peer tutoring, self-pacing); and the conclusions covering mentors and focusing on the student. Appendixes include examples of general education courses, areas of concentration, examples of individually taught interdisciplinary courses, examples of team-taught interdisciplinary courses, results of the student questionnaire, and some statistics about Small College students.

The admissions office must, of course, assume principal responsibility for the  enrollment objectives pertaining to freshmen, transfers, and special students. To be most effective in achieving its enrollment objectives, an institution must develop and execute carefully considered and coordinating programs for recruiting, admissions, financial aid, and registration.

Recommendations suggest: (1) A single, need-based, general state scholarship program be established; (2) No target funds for special critical areas of study be established, but that sufficient funding to meet the financial needs of all students should  be appropriated; (3) The new general state scholarship program should be appropriated at $4,668,160; (4) The Maryland Council for Higher Education should be charged with the responsibility of conducting a study of the financial aid need gap that exists in Maryland and of making recommendations for correcting this need gap to the next general assembly; (5) The amount of aid be made available and the income levels considered eligible for aid should be adjusted annually for the changes in the cost of living; and (6) The promising of student aid should be made well in advance of a student's college selection. Other recommendations and statistical data are included. (MJM)",

This handbook is the final result of that class and its exploratory surveys. This handbook attempts to show the current situation for women at Irving: the present status of female employees and students, the academic and support services available to them, and existing vehicles for further action. Through pointing out problems, disseminating information, and suggesting goals, this handbook hopes to provoke questions and actions to improve the status of women on the  campus. Discussed in the handbook is the present status of women on the Irving campus (student surveys, statistical delineation); women's studies at the University of California-Irvine (historical and present status, classes offered in 1975); new directions (affirmative action, groups and services); and the appendix that includes the questionnaire, responsbilities of an affirmative action officer, federal laws of concern to affirmative action and equal employment for women.

It is an experiment with an innovation in field teaching that addresses itself to three major problems that have been identified by social work educators. These are (1) integrating classroom and field work instruction; (2) providing an equal opportunity for basic field learning for all students; (3) promoting increased independence for the student in learning. The systems approach was implemented in this investigation by developing and evaluating a self-contained unit of instruction for field supervisors and their students. In this manner, field work was conceptualized as a course for which behavioral objectives could be defined, content selected, learning opportunities planned, and student learning  assessed. The results of this study are that a modern systems approach to social work field instruction is (1) extremely effective in augmenting student learning and (2) a valuable tool for alleviating educational problems inherent in field instruction. These findings suggest that graduate social work education would be more effective if modern educational principles and methods were utilized in teaching students in agency placement. The module evaluation and a self-instructional unit are included in the appendix. (Author/PG)",

Alternatively, it could be argued that a college could have met such challenges by broadening its focus and expanding its boundaries beyond insular denominational concerns. This latter course was the one taken by Harvard; but the choice was not easy, nor did it come quickly. This paper demonstrates Harvard's reaction to its students was as much a part of that decision process as was its reaction to the Revolution or the state constitutional convention. (Author/MJM)",

The response appears to be a transition between prejudice against older students and a future realization that part-time adult students are an important part of the mission of higher education. This review of the literature on adult residential programs has five elements: (1) a summary of some characteristics of adult learners who participate in residential education; (2) an identification of some of the major characteristics of adult residential programs; (3) a  review of research on the effectiveness of such programs; (4) an analysis of the conclusions, methodology, and questions of research in adult residential education; and (5) a review of some of the operational models of adult residential education.

It is centered on the current research activities of professors and graduate students in the field of higher education as listed in the 1973 Association of Professors of Higher Education (APHE) Directory. The central purpose of all these various attempts to inventory postsecondary education has been to disseminate information about current or recently completed research in higher education to bridge the information gap between the  initiation of a research project and the publication of a report on the project in the literature of the field. It was hoped that such efforts would decrease the unnecessary duplication of effort and increase cooperation and collaboration among researchers.

        "description":"Academic research funds increased more rapidly than enrollments between 1950 and 1970 but little analysis has been made of the educational effects of the change. In part this is due to an assumption that benefits to education flow automatically from funding for university-based research. As a result most studies of graduate study report only dollar outcomes in terms of student support, facilities, or service. Recent work in the sociology of science has identified the importance of networks of communication, recognition, and visibility for the active scholars. The concept of awareness is adapted here to the assessment of student perceptions of the research activity around them. The notion is operationalized in two ways, by recognition and by association. It is concluded that  awareness is a discrete and useful concept in this application, that it reveals about twice the level of involvement with research established by other methods, and that departmental policy plays a larger role than the characteristics of the field of knowledge in determining the educational consequences of research activity.

Full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment is also shown. For fall 1974, two different FTE enrollments are shown. The first is comparable to the previous years, the second FTE figure reflects the new method for equating part-time students to full-time students on the basis of student credit hours generated. Both FTE figures are shown so that the difference created by a new methodology may be noted. From fall 1973 to fall 1974, headcount enrollment increased by 2 percent. Part-time enrollment increased by 1 percent and full-time enrollment by 1.5 percent. FTE enrollment, using a similar method both years, increased by  2.4 percent. Regular day-time enrollment increased by 5.3 percent (headcount) while continuing education enrollment declined by 5 percent. (Author/PG)",

Results of the survey based on the 40 returned responses indicate that admissions officers in balck colleges are adequately trained to fulfill their professional obligations. Admissions officers are being treated increasingly as professionals, important cogs in the wheels of academic governance at black colleges, and they are receiving faculty rank and tenure. These administrators are chairing important committees and serving  on committees that affect the basic policies and operations of their institutions.

The focus of education must therefore shift toward assisting them to learn how to learn, how to be independent, and how to equip themselves to cope with an ever changing environment. One of the nine papers presented describes a method by which teachers can facilitate learning. Another urges that teachers should give up their traditional role as purveyors of information and instead help students to define the objective of each learning experience and identify the methods of learning they must adopt. Teachers must also appraise each student's progress toward the educational goals set, and this raises the question of examinations, which is dealt with in another paper. There is  also a discussion of the appraisal of the teachers themselves in the light of how they are perceived by the students, of the process of teaching, and of the end products of that teaching process. Other subjects covered included the teaching of large groups, the dynamics of learning groups, and an assessment of what has been achieved by educational science in a specific university medical school.

Beyond this, the proposed audience will affect the choice of story. When very young children are concerned, brevity is best with an emphasis on visual aids and action. The storyteller can enhance his own and the audience's experience if he likes his stories, creates an imaginative and friendly atmosphere, and practices voice and dramatic techniques which will facilitate his performance.

The purpose of the program was to train inmates from nearby Bordentown and Yardville reformatories as library and audiovisual technicians in order to provide them with a viable alternative to the way of life which put them in jail in the past, and improve the 80 percent recidivism rate. Conclusions are that 1) it is advantageous to combine library and audiovisual technology in sub-professional training programs, 2) it is futile to involve corrections-related participants in terminal paraprofessional library/audiovisual training  although training them as professionals offers promise, 3) a college based rehabilitation program for corrections-related participants has a reasonable chance of success if it has an open choice of curriculum, adequate financial assistance, and a strong counseling component, preferably by an ex-offender.

Even now, students are frequently excluded from direct laboratory experiences for many reasons. However, computer simulation can open up these experiences, providing a powerful teaching tool for individuals, for small and large groups, for laboratory experiments, for independent enrichment activity, or for classroom use. To be effective, classroom use requires a display of the computer output which can be viewed by the entire class through the use of video converters, cathode ray tube terminals, opaque projectors, or overhead projectors. As computers become easier for teachers to acquire and use, the potential of computer simulation can be realized.

The workshop included presentations by data base suppliers, and very brief descriptions of the following files are included: Chemical Abstracts Condensates, Compendex, ERIC, Inspec, NAL/CAIN, Pandex/Transdex, Predicasts, Psychological Abstracts, and NTIS. Roger Summit, Manager of Lockheed Information Systems, summarized the history and background of DIALOG, described the most recent developments and those planned for the near future, and then led a discussion with the users. One-hour workshop  sessions gave participants the opportunity to meet personally with representatives from eight data bases. Out of these sessions grew suggestions and questions for Lockheed's DIALOG. (KKC)",

The Joint University Libraries (JUL) of Vanderbilt University, George Peabody College for Teachers, and Scarrit College served as an example of manual reclassification. The JUL project processed 260,703 volumes, less then half of the total collection, in six years. Automated reclassification was studied at Western Kentucky University. In that project, a computer was used to maintain a master file and to print working lists, author-title book catalogs, labels, pockets, and circulation cards. An automated circulation system was developed as a by-product of the reclassification project. The project was finished in two  years, having processed 390,000 volumes. Comparative cost data was not available for study. Nine suggestions from JUL for manual reclassification projects are included. (PF)",

SEL has made significant thrusts toward the integration of its media and print collections and is making consistent effort towards collection development. The library's goal should be convenient and quick access to local and remote audiovisual materials for independent and remedial work. It should also act as a catalyst in the production of locally originated instructional materials. To meet these objectives, it is recommended that the Radio-Frequency Distribution System  (RF) be adopted to provide access to AV materials. The RF system leaves open the option of accessing an automatic gear at a later time, and the film chain, one of the most costly components of RF, can also be used in local productions. Flowcharts and equipment lists are appended to this report. (Author/SL)",

The physical facilities were improved, new high in interest/low vocabulary books purchased, and, for the first time, audiovisual hard and software were acquired.

The 3/4-inch videocassette resembled a book; the library was a traditional repository for reference material; thus the title &quot;Have You Watched a Book Today?&quot; or WATCHABOOK. The experiment was to be center in the Monroe (Indiana) County Public Library where 141 videocassettes were selected, but interest grew so rapidly that within two months the experiment had expanded to three additional libraries. Some of the conclusions of the experiment were that the technical reliability and versatility of the videocassette medium is a natural for use in a one-to-one  environment in a service oriented organization; the videocassette concept is valuable in introducing library patrons to new library audiovisual services and is particularly helpful in capturing the attention of young patrons; single programs, those in color and of half-hour length with strong local identification, are the most valuable; the videocassette concept is helpful in attracting new minority patrons to a library; and the experiment was a rewarding success for all involved.

The study entailed two major collection phases: a detailed search of existing literature for statistics and other related information, and personal interviews. Among the conclusions of the study were that employment in school libraries is expected to grow slowly, with most of the growth occurring after 1980, with the reverse being true for the academic librarian for whom it is expected that employment  growth will come to a virtual halt after 1980; and that in contrast to the anticipated tight job market for beginning librarians, demand is expected to remain strong for black and other minority librarians, community outreach libarians, media/audiovisual specialist, library automation specialists, and experienced library administrators and supervisory librarians.

        "description":"NLS-SCHOLAR is a prototype system that uses artificial intelligence techniques to teach computer-naive people how to use a powerful and complex editor. It represents a new kind of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system that integrates systematic teaching with actual practice, i.e., one which can keep the user under tutorial supervision while allowing him to try out what he learns on the system he is learning about. NLS-SCHOLAR can also be used as an on-line help system outside the tutorial environment, in the course of a user's actual work. This capability of combining on-line assistance with training is an extension of the traditional notion of CAI. The techniques used in NLS-SCHOLAR are general and can be applied to a wide variety of computer related activities. Examples of  the system's capabilities are provided. (Author/DGC)",

After an extensive review of the literature on student library use, the library circulation slips for a seven and a half week period were collected. The declared academic major, academic class, sex, and grade point averages of full-time, undergraduate students using the library during that period were tabulated. It was found that a large percentage of the students made no use of the library, and only a small minority made appreciable use of the library. Students of certain academic disciplines tended to make heavier use of the library than others, but the use of the library had almost no influence on the semester grade point average of students. It  was concluded that use of the college library is not a necessary part of the educational experience of most students at Kearney State College. (Author/PF)",

Twelve of the 19 CSUC campuses were involved in the study--four in northern California and eight in southern California, the latter already experimenting with telefacsimile interlibrary loan equipment. Each person involved in ILL transactions filled out pre-printed time sheets which described every activity associated with ILL. Sheets were coded for campus, week of study, employee class code and salary. In addition, the study coordinator at each campus was responsible for tallying production units, including number of ILL requests received, number filled, and amount of photocopy. Labor costs were computed to derive unit costs and  production unit costs. For each campus, an activity breakdown in dollars and hours was calculated by type of personnel involved. Another aspect of the study was an analysis of the ILL transactions themselves: type of material involved, user types, and transaction times. Of the 3,490 transactions analyzed, the mean labor cost per transaction was $4.73; $5.94 when telefacsimile transmission was used. There was no significant difference in transaction time between traditional and telefacsimile transmission methods. (SL)",

MARC serial record creation was scheduled to begin with the publication of the 1975 issues of &quot;Canadiana.&quot; For libraries that could not afford to create full MARC records, Mini-MARC, a subset of Canadian MARC containing the minimum  acceptable amount of data to uniquely identify a record, was developed.

The National Library develops the standards necessary for successful cooperative use of bibliographic machine-readable records. The Canadian National Science Library concentrates on information retrieval services utilizing available data bases. At the regional or provincial level, a number of other automation projects are taking place or being planned.  The central provinces of Ontario and Quebec are most advanced in planning bibliographic systems for various types of libraries.

Libraries in the United States are characterized as independent agencies supported from governmental and private sources and serving a local clientele. Steadily rising costs of operation associated with population growth, increased publishing rates, higher wages, and other factors have led to reduced quality of services. Efforts to share costs through interlibrary loan and other cooperative arrangements have only partially alleviated the financial problems and have done little to improve the quality of services. The ultimate solution is seen as a more systematic national approach designed to optimize  available resources in order to achieve more rationally defined goals. There remain a number of unresolved questions concerning the configuration of national resource collections, bibliographic organization and access, communation and delivery methods, and coordinating mechanisms. A strong leadership role by the Federal Government seems mandatory for establishing and maintaing a comprehensive, higher quality information service. (Author/PF)",

This document demonstrates that the conceptual framework for such discernment exists in the theory of Educational Sciences, created by Dr. Joseph E. Hill of Oakland Community College in Michigan. The seven Educational Sciences provide a common structure for the applied field of knowledge called input education. All seven fields are discussed and the system of discovering a student's learning style is reviewed. Thirty-three freshman developmental students at Central Piedmont Community College (North Carolina) were given an interest inventory to discover their preferred learning styles relative to three of the  Educational Sciences: symbolic orientation (to various theoretical and qualitative symbols), cultural determinants (individual, family, and/or associate), and modalities of inference (magnitude, difference, relationship, appraisal, deductive reasoning, or a combination of these). These 33 students evidenced 12 theoretical symbolic orientation groupings, 33 qualitative symbolic orientation groupings, eight different patterns of cultural determinants, and 14 different modality of inference patterns. On the basis of these findings, recommendations for the provision of varied kinds of learning experiences are made. (DC)",

        "description":"An &quot;in-progress&quot; grade concept was added to the grading policy of Harrisburg Area Community College (Pennsylvania) in November 1971. The &quot;in-progress&quot; grade, or Y grade as it is designated, signifies that a student has not successfully passed a course, but that with the agreement of the instructor he/she will repeat the course and, if successful, obtain a passing grade. The Y grade carries no credit and does not count in the student's grade point average. If the student fails to repeat the course in the subsequent semester, the Y grade becomes an F. This study is a review of the use of the Y grade in the three and one-half years since its inception. It inquires to what extent has the Y grade been used, whether students repeated the courses for which Y grades were issued, and  whether students passed the course in the subsequent semester. Results indicate that through the use of Y grade many students have subsequently passed the course they were failing on first attempt, and the college has a moderately successful, non-punitive grading device.

The characteristics of technical program students, their employment opportunities, and the general characteristics of community college technological programs in Florida are described. Reference is made to the similarity of engineering and engineering technician programs and the emerging controversy between the two disciplinines. Of the 223 respondents, 136 (58 percent) indicated plans to earn the Associate of Science degree. Students' future plans show 39 percent  seeking employment only, 34 percent seeking part-time employment while they continue college, and 27 percent planning to attend college full-time. Twenty-eight percent indicated an interest in attending Florida Technical University (FTU) and obtaining the Bachelor of Engineering Technology (BET) degree. As a result of the study, a junior year BET fore curriculum was established at the FTU Residence Center located on the BCC Cocoa Campus, with plans being formulated for senior year curriculum as well. Additional recommendations are also made. (Author/AH)",

Responses were received from 6 regents, 10 administrators, and 10 faculty. Response data is given for the overall group, as well as for each of the three response groups. The overall data shows that the consensus favors negotiation between administrators and faculty in the following areas: assignment of faculty contact hours; faculty assignment for summer school and evening division; appointment, promotion, termination, and retrenchment of faculty; and criteria for faculty evaluation. A shared authority structure in which faculty and administration  have equal voting status was recommended for divisional curriculum committees, peer judgment, accountability for faculty and administrators, general educational goals, criteria for evaluating deans and department chairmen, and community service. The administration should retain final authority (but with faculty advice) in the selection of deans and department chairmen, faculty scheduling, the school calendar, departmental budgets, public relations, recruiting of students, and changes to the physical plant. Regents should continue to control long-range institutional planning and the building of new facilities but faculty and administration should be consulted in both areas. (Author/AH)",

An articulation workshop for people from different educational levels within the same program area is suggested as the easiest and most productive means to encourage better interactive and communicative relationships. Guidelines are presented for the workshop's preparation, program, objectives, summary, follow-up, and leadership. Suggestions are made for improving each of the  three principal aspects of the articulation program: the information dimension, the communication dimension, and the interaction dimension.

In spring 1973, an inventory of personal characteristics was sent to the presidents of 112 institutions; 92 (83 percent) of those sampled responded. The survey form asked respondents to provide descriptive background data and to place a value of zero (not important) to 50 (very important) on 27 listed personal characteristics. Summaries of the background data indicated that only three respondents were female, 57.6 percent had less than seven years experience as a community college president, 44.5 percent were between 41 and 50 years old, 77.2 percent held a Ph.D., and 71.8 percent served at institutions with less than 2500 FTE students. Respondents indicated that the  four most important characteristics of community college presidents are: integrity (honesty), ability to work with people, objectivity (fairness), and leadership with the Board. The four least important characteristics are: charisma, professional training, humility, and a sense of humor. Younger respondents tended to value integrity (honesty) and decisiveness less than did those over 40. Those at smaller institutions placed more importance on ability to work with people, persuasiveness, and charisma, than did those at larger colleges. The survey instrument is appended. (DC)",

Assembly members focused their attention on how community colleges can overcome restraints and barriers inhibiting the development and provision of performance-oriented community-based postsecondary education. In this report, Hans Spiegel presents an analytical framework for community needs assessment; Benjamin Wygal analyzes where community colleges are now and suggests how they can translate community perceptions into their objectives; and James Farmer and Tallman Trask describe the current uses of outcomes measurement by community colleges, discuss the  three major forces affecting institutional funding in the future, and present a series of short survey questionnaires which can be used to measure student attitudes, characteristics, and motivations. Following these reports, William Shannon reviews the problems highlighted by the Assembly and presents the policy recommendations they made. These problems and policies are concerned with mission-commitment, college-community relations, new delivery systems, students-clients-learners, staff-instruction, special programs, financial aid-support, problem identification, assessment-evaluation, flexibility-adaptability, relationships with other agencies, and the role of the AACJC.

(1) Finance and Control: the centralization caused by state and federal financing and control conflicts with the colleges' current commitment to serving local needs; furthermore, decreasing public enthusiasm for higher education as a priority has led to a financial crisis. (2) Faculty Unionism: although collective bargaining has sometimes led to increased local funding, it has also caused the disappearance of collegiality, the inability to foster an open administration, the stifling of innovation, and a decreased sensitivity to the needs of students and the community. (3) Trends in Administration Management: the community college president's role has shifted from that  of an educational planner and leader to that of a manager and mediator. (4) Missions, Goals, and Functions: community colleges have recently adopted many noneducational roles under the aegis of community services; presidents and boards are questioning the propriety, and even the legality, of diverting educational tax dollars to other social purposes, no matter how laudable those purposes may be. (5) Career Education: students continue to choose transfer programs even though they will find no jobs; community colleges must encourage a new image for occupational programs. (DC)",

Since its conception in 1957, the Florida community college master plan has been a national model for  long-range planning and for the orderly development of a statewide system of community colleges. It has also received national recognition because of its unusual balance of local control with state coordination and support.

Results supported the first hypothesis, but failed to support the second; the relationship between perceived teaching effectiveness and  role-orientation was strongly influenced by the student's expected course grade. Furthermore, faculty in the humanities, fine arts, and in education were seen to be more effective than faculty in other areas, whereas faculty in the social and behavioral sciences were seen to be less effective. Female teachers were perceived more effective than their male counterparts.

Relevance in community college education depends upon the successful identification of individual and social needs and the implementation of responsive programs. As a basis for conducting a community needs assessment, the goals of the college, as well as the principles and assumptions on which these goals rest must be identified; this necessitates the formulation of an operational philosophy of education. Once an operational philosophy of education is established, data from the community must be collected and analyzed. The process of data analysis must compare community concerns with present policies, with large discrepancies indicating validated needs.  The second step of the community needs assessment is converting needs into viable programs. Critical factors which influence successful implementation are the extent of community involvement in the needs assessment, way the college is governed and administered. (Author/AH)",

        "description":"Traditionally, postsecondary education is based on a selective model in which students are uniformly expected to benefit from the methods of instructors and their concepts of appropriate curriculum and educational goals. Under this system, 30 to 70 percent of all community college students become part of an attrition statistic. In order to adapt education to the student, the entire college environment must be analyzed, both for the factors that cause student attrition and for the various resources that might be utilized to meet student needs and to counteract these factors. This paper presents an adaptive education model, which operates on a causal stratum and a decision stratum. The causal stratum involves the identification of the reasons why students do not attain their  educational goals in the particular institution. The decision stratum involves the construction of a methodology for eliminating causal factors, including problems in curriculum, evaluation of student performance, counseling services, and roles of counselors and instructors. The model utilizes a \"systems-dynamic\" approach, which realizes that the data elements of both strata are constantly changing. If predictors of student success in the present institution are poor, this model should be able to point out specific changes which in turn can prevent the projected results. (DC)",

Interviews were conducted with a variety of administrators, faculty, and students at each college. Interview questions were intended to focus on the place of community services in the institution, the institution's priorities, and how decisions are made and by whom. For additional  information, resource materials were gathered at each school to gain background on institutional goals, history, finances, community relations, long-range planning, and student body. Separate descriptions for all 15 institutions are presented, each providing a brief overview of the institution: its size, history, curriculum, and physical plant. Community service programs are described in detail. The interview instrument and a community educational needs questionnaire is appended. (Author/AH)",

Existing urban community colleges do not provide alternative services because they are limited in flexibility by state statutes and by the traditions of academia. Thus, a non-traditional college must be established as a separate entity to supplement and complement the offerings of existing institutions. Non-traditional education involves altering curriculum to meet non-traditional student needs and providing these services in environments other than those of a large campus plant. The specific elements of a conceptual framework for a non-traditional college include: (1) the new student  constituency; (2) the changing social structure which has produced changing attitudes toward college; (3) an evolving interpretation of education and instruction. In a non-traditional college, curriculum and instruction must emphasize precise learning objectives and accurate measurement techniques, the concepts of space and time must allow for individualized programmed learning, learning resources centers, TV instruction, open lab hours, experimental scheduling, and short term classes, and the organizational structure must consider student goals as more important than institutional goals.

This system is not yet wholly operative, but many of its components have been developed. This report presents the findings of several computer-based analyses of student performance. Grades awarded in credit classes from fall 1971 to summer 1974 are compared for groups of students classified by curriculum, admission status (open admission or other), attendance pattern (full-time or part-time), date of admission, and number of credits accrued. Data revealing grade distributions as a function of date of award, time of year, and awarding division are also  presented. The findings show a marked differentiation in performance associated with admission status, credit-accrual, and curriculum classifications. Factors which may account for the obtained heterogeneity of student performance are suggested and discussed. Data are presented which show that LGCC awards a higher proportion of non-passing grades than any other community college in the City University of New York (CUNY) system; it is suggested that this is a result of the college's lack of a true failing grade.

        "description":"Because little effort has been made to establish general guidelines for health services in Florida's community college system, the services provided by the 28 autonomous community colleges are dissimilar. A recent survey showed that only 10 of the 28 colleges had a nurse available. There was an exceptional need for coordination and cooperation among the institutions. Two years ago, a seven-member statewide committee was established to explore the problem of providing health services with the resources at hand and to develop funding sources. This report presents the results of their work: a statement of the purpose of community college health programs; recommendations for a minimal health services program at all Florida community colleges; and suggestions for the implementation of  each recommendation. According to the committee, a two-year college health program must include emergency care, health education, evaluation of individual health problems, and heart risk factor clinics, aw well as other activities of a public health nature. The health program should be an integral part of the college's teaching-learning process. (Author/DC)",

        "description":"Because today's college administrators must find an acceptable balance between educational desirability, economic feasibility, political expediency, social relevancy, and philosophical defensibility, many have turned to Management by Objectives (MBO), which coordinates management activities with institutional goals. MBO is concerned with the identification of institutional goals, the definition of administrative staff role responsibilities, the establishment of the objectives or necessary conditions for achieving these role responsibilities and institutional goals, and the use of these objectives in operating a college and in measuring each administrator's effectiveness and efficiency. In order for MBO to conform to existing organizational structure and institutional philosophy,  a hierarchical approach must be applied, in which objectives are arranged from very broad purpose statements to extremely specific procedural or process objectives. This report analyzes selected aspects of MBO, presents a scheme for implementing a management strategy based on MBO, provides a guide for writing acceptable objectives, and cites some cautions and issues which must be considered in its adoption. Although addressed to community colleges in particular, the concepts discussed here have applicability for higher education in general. (Author/DC)",

        "description":"Student characteristics and educational destinations of all the reverse transfer students from five state universities who were admitted to five community colleges during one calendar year (N=459) were studied to re-assess and define the \"retread function\" of community colleges. A group of 245 native community college students were randomly selected for comparison purposes. The reverse transfer students were found to be very much like the native community college students in most characteristics. They did have slightly higher high school grade point averages and slightly higher scores on college entrance examinations. However, no larger percentage of them remained in college to complete an educational program, fewer of them enrolled in two-year occupational programs, and about  the same number returned to the four-year college as entered for the first time from a community college. Recommendations are made for dealing with the unique problems of the reverse transfer student in the areas of re-admission procedures, counseling, academic reinforcement, and inter-school communications. It is the author's view that the community colleges have failed to effectively perform their \"retread function;\" in fact there is some doubt whether community colleges recognize the \"retread function\" as part of their institutional mission.

The sample consisted of the 1973-74 freshman class at the College of Basic Studies (CBS) at Boston University; CBS is a two-year college designed for educationally marginal students. The predictor variables included: (1) personality measures from the Test of Effective Academic Motivation (TEAM); (2) overall measures of fluency, flexibility, and originality from selected items of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking; (3) verbal and numerical SAT scores; (4) high school GPA; and (5) sex. The criterion variable was overall freshman GPA based on five CBS &quot;core&quot; courses.  The TEAM test was administered to all freshman students upon college entrance. The Torrance Tests were given to all freshman students who were present at a required psychology lecture class during the first part of the fall semester; 54 percent of the freshman class was present. Results confirmed that SAT and GPA factors were strong and stable predictors of freshman GPA while Creativity was a stable, but very weak, third predictor. TEAM factors were poor and unstable predictors. (Author/DC)",

Survey procedures are incorporated into overall institutional planning activities throughout the process--from the examination of institutional philosophies and goals to the use of survey results in long-range planning. The market research procedures involved in developing and administering the  survey, which include defining the population, developing the questionnaire, selecting the sample, and administration techniques, are described. A case study of the use of the survey at Haywood Technical Institute in North Carolina is presented.

Almost twice as many women as men were sampled. Career-innovators were defined as women who had selected careers in which zero to 40 percent women are presently employed. Non-innovators were defined as women who planned to enter careers in which 70 to 100 percent of those employed are women. Approximately 20 percent of the women sampled were career-innovative. Compared to non-innovators, role innovative  women had significantly higher college grades, had made their career choices more recently, aspired to higher educational degrees, were less apt to plan to marry before completing their education, planned to have fewer children, planned a wider range of careers, were less likely to cite closeness to home as a reason for choosing their college, and reported more problems with their colleges. Innovators and non-innovators reported similar appraisals of counseling services. Implications for counseling are noted, pertinent literature is reviewed, and tabulated data is presented.

Several prominent authorities' views of community-based education are noted; the idea of the college and the community as partners in the educational endeavor is the common emphasis of all their views. Extrapolating from other definitions, the author defines community-based education as an educational system which uses the community as its base--its organizational center, its creative source, its chief constituent, its underlying  concept, and its supporting foundation. The community-based college must look outward toward the learner and the community as it develops goals and objectives, hence there must be room for innovation, flexibility in governance, and a faculty with a commitment to serving the community. Since the ability to analyze the community and its needs are central to this entire concept, several different approaches to needs assessment are noted. A checklist is provided to determine to what extent a particular college or program is community-based. (Author/AH)",

Stevenson reviews school district representation; who is allowed to vote; principal, faculty, and student participation; budget and educational priorities; and labor  relations. Gary Dohla, President of the Mount Royal College Students Association in Calgary, discusses his view of institutional representation in college governance, with an emphasis on the positive input provided by faculty and students. A president's perspective on community college governance is presented by George Wootton of Douglas College in New Westminster.

        "description":"The governance of community colleges in western Canada is increasingly influenced by the activities of federal and regional agencies, provincial legislatures, professional and trade associations, and advisory committees. Decision-making is increasingly centralized so that programs are standardized, procedures are routinized, and colleges lack distinctiveness and professional autonomy. Each provincial legislature has established government departments to direct the operation of post-secondary education. With input from province-wide advisory committees, the civil servants in these departments specify standards of performance, review and approve (or deny) program and budget proposals, and develop policies and programs for administrative services, student services, research, and  planning. Boards of trustees hold legal responsibility for the operation of college programs; they formulate policy concerning organization, administration, and course offerings. There are also advisory boards at the institutional level. Not all community colleges have boards of trustees. Technical institutes are operated directly by the governmental departments. In two of the provinces, all board members are government appointees. The growth of collective bargaining may be seen as a coping strategy of the faculty in the face of external pressures to standardize procedures and policies. (DC)",

        "description":"This paper presents a conceptual framework for conducting followup studies as an integral part of an institutional evaluation program. Data obtained from followup studies should become part of an overall information system designed to provide data for institutional decision-making. Such data should be conveniently stored and readily available for a wide range of evaluative studies conducted over time. Followup studies have three dimensions: (1) who or what is evaluated; (2) how the evaluation is done; and (3) who uses the findings. Most followup studies seek to evaluate student performance and/or opinions about the institution; data about students and evaluative feedback from students should be collected on a systematic basis from the day they first contact the institution. There  are two methods of data evaluation: the congruence mode, in which actual data is compared to desired performance; and the contingency mode, in which data is used to identify new needs and directions. Findings may be used by any one of the three functional subsystems of the college: the institutional subsystem, which determines societal needs and sets institutional goals; the managerial subsystem, which facilitates the achievement of these goals; or the technical subsystem, which takes particular action to fulfill specific goals.

        "description":"This report analyzes the failure of a small rural community college's plan to deliver non-traditional educational services to non-traditional students by reorganizing its administrative structure; it also discusses the successful programs that finally emerged from this failure. The plan involved elevating the dean of community services to a position equal to that of the dean of instruction and devoting 20 percent of the college's total resources, including faculty workload and support services, to community services. Because the plan was vague as to the authority of each dean, a power struggle between the deans evolved. Also, because faculty members did not participate in the development of the plan, they resented their non-traditional assignments. Faculty members, as well as  department chairmen, support services personnel, and even the president, retained their traditional working relationship with the dean of instruction and largely ignored the new dean. In less than one year, the plan was discarded and the dean of community services resigned. However, the dean of instruction adopted the values and programs previously advocated by the dean of community services, and, when the traditional administrative structure was reestablished, the number of community services programs increased and gained the support of the institution as a whole.

The ground floor was to be devoted to the Behavioral Science Department. Using the results of a previously-completed departmental self-study which surveyed departmental purposes, the present status of each course, teaching methods, grade distributions within the department, personal characteristics of faculty members, the quality of library holdings, the suitability of present physical facilities, and faculty attitudes toward departmental policies, and which provided ten year projections of the numbers of students and instructors, the researcher developed detailed plans for the interior of the ground floor of this new building. Keeping the general considerations of  the philosophy, organization, and teaching needs of the department in mind, the most efficient method of utilizing the 6,400 square feet available was ascertained. Final plans include 11 offices, four flexible classrooms, four seminar rooms, and an educational laboratory equipped with study carrels for individualized instruction and a computer terminal. The author recommends that faculty and students participate in facility planning and that these plans be submitted to them for review and suggestions.

Chapter 1 reviews past definitions of cooperative education and presents the following definitional framework for the concept: \"Cooperative Education is a postsecondary work experience program designed to produce academic, career and/or personal enrichment opportunities for a student while he or she is fully enrolled and registered at the institution. The work experience involves a definitive period or periods of employment supplementing full or part-time study on campus. Evaluation of the experience is performed by all participants (student, employer, and institution) based on pre-determined learning objectives dependent upon the work experience itself. The  student's participation is considered an integral part of the educational process for that individual.\" Chapter 2 looks at the historical evolution of formal work experience programs from social, educational, and chronological events. Chapters 3 and 4 summarize the reports of privately supported study groups and task forces, and governmental groups in order to determine the past and present attitudes and roles of such groups. Chapter 5 places cooperative education in its total social context and provides predictions for the future. (Author/DC)",

The survey was mailed to the presidents of 307 colleges in September 1974, with results tabulated in November 1974 based on responses from 726 practitioners from 120 colleges in 19 states. A brief review of the literature points out some of the virtues and drawbacks of individualized instruction. The survey focuses on the characteristics of the institutions where individualized instruction is used as well as on the characteristics of the practitioners. Overall, the usual descriptors of practitioners (sex, age, academic attainment) tend not to vary significantly from expectations with respect to type, location, age  or enrollment of the institution. Distribution of individualized instruction by subject area is depicted in tabular form. Practitioners tend to be similar with respect to selection of format, pace, and achievement measures; unfortunately, relatively few have attempted to systematically evaluate their instructional techniques. One conclusion that was generated by the study is that most instructors who use individualized instruction work more hours than the average instructor and spend an inordinate amount of time with students.

The control class was taught by a teacher who was assigned the class in order to complete his teaching load; this class was taught in the traditional manner--lecture, demonstration, homework, frequent testing, and standard grading distributions. The experimental class was taught by a teacher who volunteered for the assignment and who expressed a desire to work with the remedial student; only two tests (midterms and finals) were administered and midterm grading was liberalized to provide the maximum amount of positive reinforcement and to discourage dropouts. Text material for both classes  was the same, but the teacher of the experimental class also used enrichment materials suited to the abilities of the class. The results of pre- and post-tests showed that the experimental group achieved at a significantly higher level than did the control group. The results of three administrations of the Osgood Semantic Differential show that the experimental group viewed itself more positively in all three areas studied: ability in math, success in math, and feeling about math. Withdrawal rates for both classes were the same. The Osgood test is appended. (Author/DC)",

This study was conducted to determine the need for such a program. The overriding hypothesis was that there was no significant difference between male veterans and non-veterans during their first quarter at Napa College with regard to grade point average (GPA), attrition rate (the rate at which units were dropped during the progress of one quarter), and persistence rate (the rate at which students returned to the college for the following quarter). Random samples of 30 veterans and 30 non-veterans were drawn from the total male population of the college. Only males between the ages of 20 and 25 who had enrolled  in Napa College for the first time in Fall 1972 were sampled. Graphic presentation of the data includes histograms of the Fall 1972 GPA's of the two samples, and circle graphs displaying differences in attrition and persistence rates. Results indicate that there were no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the three characteristics studied. Because Napa is a small rural community, results should be applied to veteran populations at other institutions only with great care. (Author/DC)",

She also met with State and District Junior College Boards in several states. Most of the information was obtained through visits and interviews. Program descriptions are categorized by state, and provide a very brief overview of the training curricula at particular institutions. There appears to be a strong movement towards emphasis on professional training for community college teachers. Direct community college experience is also encouraged as opposed to the past practice of hiring community college faculty from the ranks of high school  teachers. The master's degree was seen to be the minimum requriement for community college teaching, and the ability to teach one or two related fields was determined to be highly desirable. Recommendations are made for courses that would be beneficial to the aspiring community college instructor as well as useful as guidelines for a community college teacher-training program.

A questionnaire was administered to a sample of students who do not participate in student government and to a sample of students who are members of student government; only full-time day students were sampled. Compared to student government members, non-participatory students were less likely to see their needs as coinciding with the activities of student government, were significantly more unaware of their opportunities for college governance, were more likely to feel that their participation would make no real difference, and were more likely to feel that  institutional decision-making was not the responsibility of students. Both groups of students believed that student participation ought to make a difference in college governance. Recommendations to increase student participation in a college governance are: (1) steps should be taken to acquaint all students with the activities of student government; (2) there should be a study of what student needs can be served by student organizations; and (3) student government should be reorganized so that it has specific jurisdictions and parallel authority.

Eighty-four questionnaires were returned. The major finding was that the present system was ineffective in that the teaching characteristics of those evaluated did not change and in that it did not improve the quality of instruction. Teachers and counselors agreed that when teachers evaluate one another, they tend to be lenient and not truly honest. All three groups agreed that teacher evaluation is necessary, but that some other method should be employed. Administrators believed that student evaluation of teachers is much more honest and meaningful than is peer evaluation. Teachers and counselors felt  that administrators should also be evaluated. According to the author: (1) the evaluation form now used by the district should be discarded and a new form should be devised which allows a greater variety of choices (not just &quot;Competent&quot; and &quot;Needs to Improve&quot;); (2) district subsidized inservice training for all faculty should be required every three or four years; (3) teacher evaluation should be conducted by students, administrators, outside specialists, and department chairmen, as well as by peers; and (4) the evaluation process should be based on student achievement of learning objectives, and should include means by which to improve teaching quality.

Results showed that: (1) 87.2 percent were 18-24 years old; (2) 57.2 percent were White; (3) 77.8 percent were single; (4) over 60 percent needed information on careers, graduation requirements, and work experiences available at FCC; (5) 64.8 percent had yearly incomes of less than $3,000; (6) only 33.8 percent planned to transfer to a four-year college after graduation; (7) 72.5 percent were unemployed; (8) 22.6 percent were mothers; (9) 10.5 percent were mothers of preschool children; (10) 78.6 percent of the mothers of preschoolers would use an on-campus child care facility if one existed; (11) 64.3 percent of the mothers  were single, widowed, divorced, or separated; (12) 50 percent of the mothers had yearly incomes under $3,000; and (13) 64.4 percent of the mothers were non-White. Results of a practice questionnaire given to welfare recipients are also noted. The author recommends the establishment of a child care center at FCC, discusses the steps being taken locally and nationally to improve the status of women, reviews literature on the functions of the community college and on existing re-entry programs for women, and makes recommendations for expanding and improving the present services of the FCC Women's Center, and for implementing special services to facilitate the re-entry of female students.

The results of several distinct tests administered to various groups of students enrolled at the Clearwater Campus of St. Petersburg Junior College in 1973-74 indicated that: (1) there was no significant difference in student learning in  traditional or individualized situations; (2) there was no significant difference between student attitudes toward either mode of instruction; (3) age was not a factor in determining potential success in individualized situations, but educational level was an important factor--freshmen do not perform as well in these situations as sophomores and those holding undergraduate or graduate degrees; and (4) there was no correlation of autonomy or endurance with success in individualized study, but success did correlate with both GPA and achievement.

The purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of follow-up studies in measuring attainment of educational goals stated in community college catalogs and literature. This evaluation was made by studying the research emphases, motivations, and procedures for the studies. In winter 1973, a 12-item questionnaire was sent to all 720 public comprehensive two-year colleges which began offering occupational-technical programs prior to September 1970; 520 (72.5 percent) responded. This questionnaire requested information on research motivations and frequency, and asked for copies of recent studies. The content of the 85 most sophisticated follow-up  studies submitted was analyzed using a three-part 66-item coding instrument. A 44-item goals inventory for occupational-technical education was prepared in order to measure the educational goal emphases of the studies. Findings are reported and recommendations for improving follow-up studies are made. The appendix includes a list of the 42 community college catalogs and a bibliography of the literature consulted in determining educational goals, a list of the 85 colleges submitting sophisticated follow-up studies, the questionnaire and accompanying letters, and the content coding form and procedures for its use.

The proportion varied by campus from 15 percent at Kapiolani to 31 percent at Leeward and Kauai. Veterans differ from the student body as a whole in terms of credit load carried and educational objectives; this may be a result of the conditions upon which veteran benefits are granted: veterans must have definite educational goals and receive stipends depending upon the credit loads carried. Sixty-seven percent of the veterans, compared to 56 percent of all students, were full-time. While veteran part-time students carried heavier credit loads (7.3 compared to 6.3), full-time veteran students carried slightly lighter credit loads (13.5 compared to 14.1).

        "description":"This is a report of a research project designed to determine the educational and public service needs of the service area of KOCE, a noncommercial public educational television station owned and operated by the Coast Community College District. During its first year of broadcasting (1972-73), KOCE received over 600 unsolicited postcards, letters, and telephone calls; 549 of those who contacted KOCE provided their home addresses. In fall 1973, a questionnaire designed to elicit information regarding the viewer's source of information about KOCE, the amount of time he spent watching KOCE, his source of local news, his program preferences, his attitudes toward televised college courses, his household characteristics, and his perception regarding the role of KOCE, was sent to those  549 persons; 202 (37 percent) of the questionnaires were returned. This study was repeated in fall 1974. In the 12 months since the first study, 3,000 persons had contacted KOCE. A revised questionnaire, asking for the same information as the first, plus information regarding actual household television viewing habits, was sent to 2,950 persons; 500 (17 percent) of these questionnaires were returned. This report details the results of the 1974 survey and compares them with the results of the 1973 study. Both questionnaires, summaries of findings, and other pertinent data are appended. (DC)",

        "description":"Because the nursing department at Delaware Technical and Community College receives applications from more potential students than it can accommodate, it can no longer accept all applicants. The class which began in September 1975 was selected by a random selection process; this gave rise to numerous objections from rejected students, parents, employers, legislators, and other influential groups. This study was designed to examine this process in terms of its adherence to the college's &quot;open door&quot; philosophy, to review the admission procedures used by other &quot;open door&quot; colleges, and to recommend a process to be adopted by DTCC for admission to the nursing program and to any other program with more applicants than can be accommodated. A questionnaire seeking information about  admission policies and public reaction to them was sent to 30 public &quot;open door&quot; colleges offering nursing programs; 22 (73 percent) responded. All possible options for admission methodology were outlined and the pros and cons of each were clearly delineated. The author recommends that DTCC (1) adopt a system of random selection with increased opportunities for reapplicants and an automatic acceptance at a specific point, and (2) begin a dynamic public relations activity to inform the public of the system selected and the rationale upon which it was chosen. Pertinent literature is reviewed and the questionnaire is appended. (Author/DC)",

Because it was financially impossible to create separate libraries to service all these areas, a decentralized library system was needed. The Holbrook Center, which houses the administrative offices, will house the main reference collection. Basic reference collections will also be set up at each center and in the mobile learning resources unit, which will travel to the extension classes and mini-centers. A conventional card catalog will be maintained in the Holbrook Center. In other centers, and in the mobile unit, ROM II microfilm card catalogs will be installed. The ROM II catalogs will reflect  the holdings of Yavapai College, Mohave Community College, and NPC. The three colleges involved in the ROM II project will cooperate in buying and borrowing library materials. In addition to a complete description of the proposed library system, this report contains a bibliography of materials pertinent to decentralized education. The proposal for federal assistance for the creation of ROM II card catalogs at branch campuses of the three colleges, and for the installation of teletype terminals at each main college library, is appended.

An altered version of the questionnaire was sent to local two- and four-year college faculty members in order to determine their opinions of what a community college English program should emphasize. Results indicate that: (1) like the graduates and the high school students, present C/D students consider themselves to be of average ability in their use of language skills; (2) over half of the C/D students  want to improve their writing style, grammar, public speaking, and report writing skills; (3) few C/D students want to improve spelling, logic, or literary analysis skills; (4) the three student groups have similar literary interests; (5) faculty consider some things essential to the curriculum which students express no interest in; and (6) graduates indicate more confidence in their skills than do C/D students.

Head Start children formerly in the HSPV program were tested when they entered selected Follow Through schools and throughout their early school years until they completed Follow Through at the end of the third grade. The study design is reviewed and tests and measures used during the 1970-71 evaluation period are briefly described. Problems in designing assessment instruments for this age group in both cognitive and &quot;non-cognitive&quot; areas are identified. A consideration of the general methodological implications of these design problems is followed by a summary of  conclusions on the three main effect questions: (1) overall effects of the Head Start experience; (2) differences between Planned Variation and conventional Head Start programs; and (3) differential effects of the eleven Planned Variation Models (brief descriptions of these are included). Also considered is the question of whether the effects of the various preschool curricula are sensitive to differences in child characteristics. Conclusions address the problem of making curricular evaluations attend more to goals than to psychometric characteristics. (ED)",

An effort was made to determine whether different preschool programs have different cognitive effects on different types of children. Seven hypotheses for the analysis of the data were generated from the results of the HSPV 1969-70 study; these hypotheses, which were tested on the 1970-71 data, involved the variables of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sex, age, initial achievement, prior preschool experience, the response style variables of passivity and competence, and the dimension of program &quot;directiveness&quot;. General findings are presented for each of the hypotheses. The concluding discussion focuses on three areas: (1) the relative importance of  interactions of model with different variables; (2) the usefulness of various model groupings in predicting and interpreting interactions; and (3) the overall importance of the interactions of child characteristics and model in explaining cognitive outcomes. Due to limitations in the HSPV experimental design, the conclusions are presented as guidelines to profitable areas of inquiry rather than study findings. (SDH)",

Specific recommendations for implementing public kindergartens are suggested: (1) passage of enabling legislation, (2) appropriation of funds for a selected number of kindergarten programs, (3) designation of responsibility for selection of initial kindergarten programs to  the State Department of Education, and (4) appointment of a Supervisor of Early Childhood Education to act as kindergarten consultant to school districts.

        "description":"This guide has been developed to assist administrators, providers of dental care, and others involved in carrying out the dental care provisions of the EPSDT program (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment Program). It is intended to assist in the development of programs concerned with the unique characteristics of dental diseases and with the dental care delivery system. The methods of &quot;screening&quot; appropriate for dental diseases are considered and a distinction is made between screening and the professional diagnosis of disease which leads to the provision of treatment. Suggestions are made as to what should be included in an adequate program for the maintenance of oral health. Methods of monitoring the operation of the program are also outlined, including  methods of evaluating the appropriateness and adequacy of dental treatment being received by the Medicaid-eligible recipients. A number of successful health care delivery systems are analyzed through case studies, and some of the administrative mechanisms reviewed include the involvement of organized professional groups and lay people in the development and administration of the program. The appendices contain supporting documents which provide detailed information about selected aspects of a dental program under EPSDT. (Author/CS)",

A Parent Involvement Program was developed in the Mesa, Arizona Title I schools to help raise the consistently low reading readiness scores of the kindergarteners in these schools. A random proportional stratified sample was selected from 14 kindergarten classrooms in five of these schools: 40 students whose parents did not participate in the program and 40 students whose parents did participate. Parents received instruction twice a week in working effectively with their children, making reading games, and teaching in the kindergarten classroom one day a week. The Murphy-Durrell Reading Readiness Analysis Test on  letter names was administered as a pre- and post-test (the Murphy-Durrell Reading Readiness Analysis Test on phonemes was also administered as a post-test). Results showed that all children who were taught by the parents mastered the beginning skill of letter recognition, regardless of whether their own parents attended the Parent Involvement Program. However, in the more difficult task of learning phonemes, the children whose own parents attended the program learned more letter sounds than children whose own parents did not attend. (CS)",

        "description":"The importance of parenting roles and home environments on the young child's learning is given support through an examination of current child development research and contemporary sociological theory. Some methods that can be employed by the child care professional to facilitate parent involvement and awareness include: (1) interaction groups between child care professionals and parents concerning perception and understanding of parenting roles, (2) guided observation of young children in group settings based upon developmental theory, and (3) facilitation of open communication within the emerging triad of parent/child/child care professional. A key ingredient of successful parent-professional groups has been the creation of group support systems, where the parenting role can be  examined in detail, children can be observed in a variety of situations, and parents can be helped to better understand the demands of children's developmental patterns. A simple set of guidelines is suggested that might be developed, explained, and shared with parents before they observe a group of children. As parents and child care workers begin to share ideas and communicate about the needs of the child, the child care worker will be better able to develop approaches to facilitate parent's greater awareness and involvement in their child's growth at home and at school.

Specifically, five premises about child development are outlined: (1) the notion that the I. Q. is flexible; (2) the child can be taught if his present level of functioning is determined and the appropriate procedures are utilized; (3) development occurs through constant interaction with the environment: environment influences not only what development takes place, but when it takes place; (4) self-concept is extremely important; and (5) parent influence on child development can be utilized to enhance child growth and educational performance. Each of  these premises is then discussed within theoretical and practical frameworks. Some of the innovative elementary school activities derived from these perspectives are described. It is surmised that increased use of such assumptions about child growth will lead again to the \"discovery\" of the benefits of education for the child at the earliest ages, not as an aid for the disadvantaged, but rather as an alternative in the life style of the family.

Recorded were social initiations (verbal and/or nonverbal behaviors directed toward another person or persons) and social interactions (initiations followed by response of another person or persons toward whom the initiation was  directed). The activities in which the children were engaged were recorded as one of 11 mutually exclusive and exhaustive classes--Role Play, Blocks, Climbing/Running/Tumbling, or Transportation (associated with social behaviors involving peers); Creative Activity, Science and Routines, Books and Records, Table Games and Other (associated with higher rates of social behavior with adults); and Sand or Water Play and Non-Participation.

Evaluation of the 1973-74 Prekindergarten program year consisted of a subjective assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the program as perceived by the participating teachers as well as an objective assessment of program effects of the participating children as measured by standardized tests. The Cognitively Oriented Urban Prekindergarten demonstrate its overall strength and effectiveness by forestalling any intellectual, social and emotional regression of those significant gains attained by the children in two previous years with the PRIDE Project and by continuing the high achievement and motivational levels of the children.

        "description":"This paper examines the potential impact of parent involvement in the formal education of their children and suggests ways that teacher education can be restructured to prepare teachers to work with parents. This paper attempts to answer five questions: (1) Why should parents be involved in the formal education of their children? (2) Why should teachers be trained to involve parents? (3) What competencies do teachers need for working with parents? (4) How can teachers be helped to achieve these competencies? and (5) What can be done to enable schools of education to meet the challenge of preparing teachers for parent involvement? Schools of education need to broaden the concept of what teachers do and change the existing conception of \"professional status\". The paper concludes  that it is essential that teachers who work with parents have a value orientation which is non-elitest and which accepts and respects the parents and community of the children they teach.

The first paper presents a brief description of the experimental design and the evaluation measures used in the Houston PCDC model program, followed by a listing of some initial results based on a preliminary analysis of the data. The second paper discusses which participants benefited most from the parent education program by examining the relationships between a set  of baseline or demographic variables (predictor variables) and a set of evaluative measures (outcome variables). In the third study, four sets of data are presented: first, the stability of mother and child measures over 1-year periods; second, the concurrent and longitudinal relationships within the set of child variables over one or two years; third, concurrent and longitudinal relationships within the set of mother variables over one or two years; and finally, the concurrent and longitudinal relationships between child and mother variables.

PS involves a period of brief starvation in early infancy, unrelated to socioeconomic conditions and is surgically correctable. The major questions posed by this study were: Does a defined period of starvation occuring within the first 3 months after birth have an effect on subsequent learning abilities and general adjustment? (2) If so, which specific abilities are most affected? All learning abilities measured were significantly correlated with the degree of starvation severity in infancy. Starvation causing a reduction of over 10 percent of the expected body weight in  infancy was associated with poorer learning abilities, especially those involving short term memory and attention.

Subjects are selected from families referred by hospital prenatal clinics and other community agencies, and rated according to an experimental &quot;High-Risk Index.&quot; Infants are assigned to experimental and control groups, and given family support social work services, nutritional supplements,  medical care, transportation, and payment for participation. The experimental group takes part in a planned curriculum (administered throughout the day) consisting of a series of learning activities developed (and evaluated) for children from birth to 36 months.

Pupil Achievement Characteristics: &quot;Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT)&quot;, Spring, 1973; 2. Continuance and Transience Among Teachers and Pupils 1968-1973; 3. The Parental Component in Follow Through; and 4. Supportive Services in Follow Through. Achievement data from a cross-sectional viewpoint indicate that total Follow Through performance in the spring of 1973 is better than non-Follow Through performance in kindergarten and first grade, and that the Bank Street and Behavior Analysis models show consistently higher performance at all grade levels. Quasilongitudinal analyses indicate a positive effect of combined maximum exposure and Head Start or equivalent experience,  particularly in the Behavior Analysis and Bank Street models. Pupil and teacher retention rates continue to be relatively high (60-70 percent for pupils; slightly more than 60 percent for teachers), and the parent involvement component continues to be a priority area. Supportive services data indicate that medical services are most uniformly provided for; psychological services the least so. However, in almost all cases services extend well beyond those provided by the school district. (Author/CS)",

It is suggested that Piaget's research has often been used by education to determine the sequence in which concepts should be presented to children rather than to determine the nature of the classroom experience children should have. Educators are encouraged to become more concerned with &quot;how&quot; children are taught rather than &quot;what&quot; they are taught; the &quot;how&quot; being derived from an understanding of the factors involved in the child's transitions from the sensorimotor period of infancy to the concrete-operational thinking of childhood and to the formal operations that characterize the thinking of the mature adult. Pedagogical implications of Piaget's process of  equilibration or self-regulation for classroom teachers are suggested: (1) teachers should listen more than tell, framing questions designed to promote reflection and further inquiries by the child; (2) teachers should promote the child's interaction with other children; and (3) teachers should gain a perspective on education as essentially a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; process, in which the teacher's role is primarily to facilitate learning.

The data include two sets of antecedent variables: maternal adaptation to pregnancy as reported in prenatal interviews and measured describing the conditions of labor and delivery (including duration, administration of analgesic and anesthetic medications, infant birth weight, and Apgar scores). The results indicate that both sets of antecedent variables show some relationships to infant behavior. The two perinatal variables which were found to correlate significantly with baby behaviors involve the analgesia and anesthesia administered during labor and delivery. Several explanations are offered for the drug  effects. It was also found that the woman who reports a satisfying pregnancy, has no marked symptoms of anxiety, and is confident about mothering is more likely to have a motorically mature, attentive baby. Further analyses of the possible relationships between the two sets of antecedent variables indicate that the correlations between maternal adaptation to pregnancy and maternal medication during childbirth are not impressive.

Two hypotheses were investigated: (1) certain infant behaviors might be distinguished by the mothers and these characteristics might selectively contribute to the mother's self-image; and (2) an infant effect on maternal self-image might be measurable long before an infant effect on overt maternal caretaking behavior. Subjects were 15 mothers and their infants who were participating in an ongoing longitudinal study of parent-infant interaction. Brazelton examinations of the infants' behaviors were performed at 48-72 hours postpartum. Maternal self-image was assessed by a rating scale based on an interview at four weeks  postpartum. Three aspects of mother's self-image were explored: self-image in a maternal role, self-image of her ability to function in adult relationships, and self-insight. Analysis of the data strongly suggest that alert neonates with a heightened capacity to respond to visual and auditory stimuli influence their mother's self-image favorably. The implications of maternal self-image for the later development of mother-infant interaction are discussed. (SDH)",

The research design, as outlined in this report, intends to examine programs and look for identifiable factors in funding, organization, and instructional methods which explain success. Data is reported under three general topic areas common to all federal education programs: (1) research on programs for students in need of compensatory education, (2) research on the allocation of funds to support compensatory education programs, and (3) research on the operation of federal, state, and local agencies which deliver compensatory education programs. On the basis of the research to be provided by this  report, Congress intends to draw conclusions about the need for further legislation and programs in compensatory education, and to use the results in its deliberations in 1977 concerning reauthorization of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

Each book was carefully scanned and notations made on survey sheets. The story was checked to see if it was a boy or girl centered story, had an adult male or adult female character, male or female animal or inanimate object, and whether males and females were presented in stereotyped roles (females in aprons and in the house, males outside in traditional roles). The illustrations were very carefully scanned to see if there were more males, more females, or equal representation. The books were also evaluated to see if females or males were presented in unusual roles and whether the book gave equal treatment to both sexes and could be classified as  truly nonsexist. A second collection of 25 selections from several children's book clubs were also evaluated in the same way. The findings, tabulated in six tables, clearly show that there is indeed a disparity in the treatment of the sexes in children's picture books. (CS)",

The programs were tried out in six preschool groups of 18 to 20 6-year-old children, The &quot;insight programme&quot; was made up of suggestions and instructions concerning games, activities, reading, and conversation. The teachers were instructed to relate the content to the children's own experiences. Three main areas were involved: knowledge of self, knowledge of others, and experiences in the family. Children were interviewed before and after the program. The &quot;partnership programme&quot; offered suggestions and methodological instructions for the teacher to use in encouraging 3 or 4 children to role play with puppets in conflict  situations. The teacher induced the children to reflect on partnership activities and improve them through puppet drama. Systematic observations were made before and after the partnership exercises. Generally, the results showed that although the children increased their knowledge in all sectors, they gave more answers suggestive of greater insight into such questions as the motives, feelings, and causes of handicaps. A subsequent project has focused on the attitude structure and role apprehension of the preschool teacher. (CS)",

The Scale was composed of two categories of characteristics: Personal-Social, and Educational-Biographical-Working Relationships. In the present study, the category Reaction to Stress was added, and the original experiment was replicated with a different and smaller group of child workers and specialists similar to those used in the first study. Findings show that from both studies there are 20 scale items that each of the groups  agree on as being significant characteristics of paraprofessionals. The next step is to devise ways of measuring the identified characteristics and to develop instruments useful for persons interested in selection of child care workers.

With the exception of the Old Age and Survivor's Insurance Program, the majority of welfare measures perpetrate voluntarism emphasizing the concept of ownership security and sustaining the Puritan Ethic which maintains that ownership is the most virtuous protection against misfortune, old age, unemployment, physical handicap, and illness (presumably a larger welfare program suited to agriculture is not needed -- migration will take care of the failures). Present agricultural programs are also far too  liberally penetrated by voluntarism, for farm and ranch operators are permitted to vote whether they should or should not participate in a compulsory program, which in times of price and income depressing surpluses leads to over emphasis on voluntarism. It is also in the interest of urbanites to curb voluntarism, for they become the inheritors of the dispossessed migrants from rural areas. It is imperative, therefore, that rural communities begin to function as an interacting, coordinated whole and that they are supported in this by national policy action, Federal legislation, and finding.

In 1969, the Office for Civil Rights began a review of civil rights and educational literature pertaining to discrimination against national origin minority group children. The May 25 Memorandum, a departmental policy statement creating a set of operating principles which would adequately  protect these children's right to an equal educational opportunity, was developed. Also developed were: (1) a technique for investigating and a format for proving noncompliance with the memorandum's various sections which would meet legal requirements and could be presented to field staff for implementation; (2) an educational assistance capability in the department to assist the office in negotiating compliance with the memorandum's provisions; and (3) additional policies to particularize those discriminatory practices which resulted in noncompliance with the memorandum.

Respondents from the two most urban communities placed a higher value on life in line with work, material comfort, and recreation, while the smaller communities valued life in line with religion. The question which distinguished the five  smaller communities from the larger ones was one suggesting that &quot;the world is soon coming to an end&quot;, an indicator of sectarian tendencies. While a larger proportion of respondents from the smaller communities were church participants, participation patterns did not necessarily constitute belief patterns. Alienation was greater among respondents from the smaller communities, as they expressed a stronger desire to be like the outside world, were more bewildered and confused about modern society, and saw more problems and fewer solutions than respondents from the two more urban communities.

Of these funds, 75 percent was expended for instructional activities with reading receiving the largest amount. Although Federal funds received by Texas were not fully adequate to meet all diagnosed needs of educationally disadvantaged students, programs funded under ESEA Title I continued to have an impact on the instruction and achievement of those students served. This impact was revealed by the achievement gains of participating students. In the larger districts (those with an average daily attendance  (ADA) of 35,000 or more), 62 percent of the students in reading and 56 percent of those in mathematics programs showed gains equal to or greater than those expected of the general population. In the smaller districts (those with less than 35,000 ADA), 56 percent of the students in reading programs and 52 percent of those in mathematics programs showed gains equal to or greater than 1.0 month per month of instruction.

The forces of modernization, consolidation, and urbanization challenge the rural community to create a pragmatically viable alternative to the metropolitan way of life, because by adopting urban practices and curriculums, thereby encouraging outmigration of rural youth and ignoring immediate rural needs, today's rural schools are aiding, if not hastening, the process of decay in rural communities. A traditionally inadequate fiscal capacity has tended to perpetuate a cycle of poor facilities, teachers, and students; a high dropout rate; and inadequately prepared graduates, resulting in decreased employment opportunities, low income, and,  ultimately, fewer taxable resources. The enormity of education related problems in rural America becomes apparent when examined in terms of comparative statistics (urban vs rural) relative to achievement, motivation, and employment prospects; number of school necessary, therefore, that: (1) Federal aid be dramatically increased; (2) effective control be returned to the local citizenry; and (3) increased attention be paid to the qualitative/substantive issues in rural education.

The major health problem in rural areas is one of personnel. Although 30 percent of the U.S. population live in rural areas, there is only 1 doctor for every 1,400 persons. Rural communities have trouble attracting doctors for the following reasons: medical students are traditionally members of middle class families and have little interest in or connection with the rural poor; medical schools tend to promote specialization, pointing their students toward urban specialization centers and away from  rural general practices; local medical societies impede any non-fee-for-service health practices; the American Medical Association and the American Association of Medical Colleges oppose recent propositions for a compulsory program of equitable physician distribution; and increasingly Health, Education, and Welfare personnel are speaking in terms of the coming \"regionalization\" of rural health facilities, an indication of the demise of the small rural hospital and, perhaps, the small rural community as well.

Other rural health problems include farming injuries (the third most hazardous occupation) and inadequate or unsanitary water supply and disposal systems (according to a 1969-70 study, 30,000 rural communities need new or improved water systems). Recent legislative attempts to redress rural health problems have been less than successful (i.e., the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 which earmarked only 20 percent of its  funds for rural areas, even though slated for high priority).

The majority of nonmetro counties had greater retention of population in the 1960's. The peak of potential migration was reached and passed by the mid-1960's. Due to emerging conditions of American life which have diminished the comparative advantages of major urban areas, this rural-to-urban migration trend is now reversing. A population shift to rural and smaller urban communities has been underway since 1970. Influencing this reversal are such factors as the decentralization trend in U.S. manufacturing (especially in the South's upland parts); the growth of recreation and retirement activities; people's  attitudes; and the decline of the birth rate in the metro areas. According to the Census Bureau's annual county estimates, the highest rates of nonmetro growth are among retirement counties, counties adjacent to metro areas, and counties with senior State colleges. Geographical subregions which have had rapid growth since 1970 are the: Ozark-Ouachita area, Upper Great Lakes cutover area, Rocky Mountains, and Southern Appalachian coal fields. (NQ)",

The Farm Labor Service, Area Redevelopment Act of 1961, Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962, and Economic Opportunity Act have responded to the needs of rural areas. Today the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 (CETA) gives state and local officials decision making power over  manpower programs and allocates funds for all rural and urban communities on the basis of a formula in the law. However, present methods of measuring unemployment do not accurately measure \"real\" unemployment levels in rural areas. Consequently, this formula used for allocating CETA funds discriminates against rural areas. Other impediments to an equitable share of manpower funds are: lack of jobs, resources, facilities, and personnel in rural areas; dispersion of the rural population; greater cost of operating rural programs; and complex problems facing rural manpower planners.

Examination of \"Federal Aid to State and Local Governments\" (reported annually as part of Special Analysis of the Budget) and the series of reports titled \"Federal Outlays\" (distribution of all Federal outlays and of federally insured credit programs down to the county level and to towns of 10,000 or more population) reveals that in most categories of Federal outlays, nonmetropolitan areas get less than their  fair share, and where they get more, the effect frequently is to make things worse. For example, Federal outlay for highways in nonmetro areas has accelerated the demise of smaller communities, since highway development has helped enlarge the trading areas of larger towns. We need, therefore, to take a much closer look at what the budget impact is in terms of rural-urban balance, and geographic, racial, and economic equity, particularly in reference to income security, welfare, jobs, job training, education, retirement, social security, housing, farm programs, health, and medical assistance.

        "description":"The U.S. lacks a well defined Federal policy for rural education, as those in decision making positions traditionally have represented urban and suburban interests. Much of the blame lies with those of us who are concerned with rural education, for it is our responsibility to see that policy makers are aware of and interested in the unique problems of rural education. Perhaps the greatest problem facing rural education is that of coordinating policies from different factions. For example, when attempting to educate a migrant child, there is need for coordination of educational, agricultural, and migrant worker policies. Likewise, those engaged in the development of rural schools are hampered if they work exclusively on schools and disregard the total rural society. Federal and  State Governments must be made to understand that the problems of rural education demands better mechanisms of policy input. Furthermore, it is extremely important that any National policy for rural education should support and, in turn, be supported by policy for total rural development. The U.S. Office of Education's Task Force recommendations of 1969 constitute a viable rural educational policy, but such policy is worthless until implemented; it is essential, therefore, that people at the local level insist via their elected representatives that such policy be implemented.

        "description":"Historical change in occupational and educational status projections of Texas rural Mexican American teenage boys and girls between 1967 and 1973 were examined. The study determined the nature and extent of historical change patterns occurring among these youth in reference to the following dimensions of occupational and educational status projections: aspiration level and intensity; expectation level and certainty; and occurrence of anticipatory goal deflection. Two sets of comparable data, collected in the Spring of 1967 and 1973, were analyzed. The 4 South Texas counties (Dimmit, Maverick, Starr, and Zapata) used were located in rural nonmetropolitan areas and had high frequencies of family poverty and proportionately high concentrations of Mexican Americans. Identical  questionnaires were administered to 341 Mexican American high school sophomores in 1967 and 379 in 1973. Since the youths' status projections could be influenced by the patterns of historical change in their communities, schools, and families, the degree of historical change in these social contexts was also evaluated. Findings indicated that Mexican American teenagers in the nonmetropolitan areas of South Texas had not experienced much change between 1967 and 1973 but had maintained a relatively high level of mobility aspirations and expectations and a strong intensity of desire for achieved status goals.

Systematically selected, 10 married men and 10 married women were respondents in the initial &quot;ideal&quot; interview. Areas of domain querried were subsistence farming; cash crops; livestock; ownership and disposal of money; property in the form of houses and furniture; and the baptism, schooling, clothing, and discipline of children. The respondents' consensus supported prevalent Kikuyu descriptions  of family structure and indicated a clear division between sex roles and areas of control, women being clearly subordinate, making few decisions, and controlling no major source of cash income. However, 4 months later when 58 married women were interviewed in the &quot;real&quot; interview and asked &quot;The last time X was done in your household, who did it?&quot;, the male domain decreased significantly with women living in nuclear families exercising more control than those living in extended families.

Data were obtained from research reviews, census figures, and city, county, and State sources. Characteristics of the internal colonial explanation discussed were electoral and administrative exclusion of Chicanos, a lack of any meaningful self-government in the barrios, an historical policy of official containment of the barrio population and a current private perpetuation of that containment, and consistently inequitable city policies whose effects are experienced by ethnically and linguistically distinct peoples residentially segregated. The  paper also argues that the: (1) internal colonial explanation(s) merits further substantiating research and investigation in light of the tentative municipal service research findings, and (2) institutions and processes of domination are subtle, pervasive, and inextricably intertwined between the public and private sectors.

Teacher behavior and classroom organization were examined to determine how they expressed work norms and in what ways they conflicted with the Spanish American culture. Behavioral measures were developed for those values which were most clearly related to success in the modern world of work--time, responsibility, work, and academic achievement. The sample consisted of 4th grade teachers and students in 2 Albuquerque (New Mexico) schools located in the: (1) South Valley, a predominantly Spanish American neighborhood with an almost rural small-town atmosphere, and (2) Southeast &quot;Heights&quot;, a predominantly Anglo middle class neighborhood.  Data were obtained from: observations of teachers and students over a 9-month period; a 28-item, true-false questionnaire asking whether the teacher's behavior expressed the 4 values; and interviews with 12 pupils from each classroom indicating how this behavior was expressed. Some findings were: (1) teacher behavior fell into 2 major categories--the management core and the discretionary area; (2) areas of conflict were in following rules and expectations enunciated by the teacher, keeping quiet and overtly passive, keeping busy, and dividing up available time.

It is argued that if education with a rural bias is to be acceptable to parents and to children, it must not come as part of a drive to keep people on the land against their will; rather, it should be a gentle innovative but coordinated effort at comprehensive rural development which utilizes rural teachers, trainers, and extension workers as key factors in a total rural development program aimed at an industrialized and modernized cash economy. Citing the input of new knowledge as the most productive of  all investments to be made in an agricultural economy, this booklet addresses an imagined 'norm' in an underdeveloped country and presents general rural education principles which are illustrated via a multidisciplinary approach and examples in general, vocational, extension, and adult education and teacher training.

        "description":"Bilingual education programs are usually evaluated by means of educational testing instruments whose validity and reliability is such that conclusive findings are unlikely. in reference to Navajo bilingual education evaluation, it is particularly important that consideration be given to the economic, sociological, political, cultural, and psychological context in which the program is developed, as the Navajo Nation is experiencing social change. For example, if the Navajo Division of Education meets its goal of producing 1,000 Navajo teachers in 5 years, the socioeconomic impact of teachers coming back to the reservation from mainstream society may well alter reservation communities. The bilingual Navajo teacher may serve as a change agent or &quot;cultural broker&quot;, for he will  undoubtedly bring some mainstream values back to the reservation which could influence the sociological, socioeconomic aspect of reservation life and ultimately the development of bilingual programs. It is important, therefore, that key social factors affecting bilingual programs be identified. A more concrete goal would be to construct matching typologies--types of communities which give rise to types of sociolinguistic situations leading in turn to types of bilingual programs. (JC)",

This study proposed a viable mechanism for meeting the challenge of accountability for both the social scientist and the architect. A process model was developed by a sociologist and an architect which allowed them to cooperate as a &quot;design team&quot;. The model consisted of 6 phases: initiation, research, planning (design), implementation, evaluation, and post-evaluation data. This model was tested and implemented at the San Juan Homes, a low-income, predominantly Mexican American public housing project located in southwest San Antonio. User-input data were obtained by interviewing 77 families with a 54-item questionnaire designed to elicit  demographic characteristics, evaluation of existing facilities, physical and social conditions, police and safety, resident needs and wants, work patterns and contingencies, neighboring patterns, locus of control measures, duration of residence, residence projections, and attitudes toward living in the project. The model was found to be both practicable and productive. Positive returns indicated an increasing accountability for both the social scientists and the architect. This report follows the model through phase 3; phases 4, 5, and 6 will be explored during and following construction. (NQ)",

Counties were grouped into three environmental regions. In each community, relatively homogeneous, geographically bound neighborhoods were mapped; within each neighborhood, approximately 100 households were selected. Each of these environments consisted of a residential ecosystem, or an intact residential environment in which common social and technological relationships existed between the residents and their surrounding neighborhood environment. The survey instrument used to conduct  the 2,000 interviews was the Neighborhood Environmental Evaluation Decision System, designed to yield data dealing with such problems as migration, medical services, births-deaths, mental health, housing, sewage disposal, city services, and neighborhood environmental pollution. Some findings were: residents of lower income neighborhoods had a much greater incidence of health problems and received considerably fewer health services; and there was a strong tendency for both urban and rural low income neighborhood residents to report dissatisfaction and concern with numerous human services.

Complete response consists of 3 specific factors: (1) sample mortality (the loss of respondents from the initial sample); (2) item nonresponse; and (3) detail given to open-ended items. Responses to the personal interview among Mexican American migrants were evaluated to determine whether high quality data can be obtained through personal interviews within the migrant culture. Mexican American migrants were interviewed during a migrant educational recruitment program conducted in northeast Indiana during the summer of 1974. Migrants were enumerated and then selectively interviewed at the harvesting site. Respondents included 95 parents and 71 children who completed 2 different interview  schedules. The overall amount of nonresponse was considered by the respondent's age and sex and by the item content (whether demographic or perceptual). Among the findings were: (1) sample mortality was less of a problem than expected; (2) item nonresponse varied with the respondent's characteristics and the nature of the item; (3) numerous significant differences in nonresponse occurred for both groups, and were comparatively consistent, when the personal interview was used; and (4) due to lack of heavy probing, detail given to open-ended items was minimal for both groups.

Emphasis was on school-community relations and community response to bilingual education. Using an informal approach, the study sought to sharpen an understanding of the problems likely to be encountered by school administrators as they seek to formulate and implement a bilingual education program. Extensive use was made of published sources, especially newspaper articles. The various applications, reports, and materials relating to the development and implementation of bilingual education programs were examined. Several visits were made to each school district for non-structured interviews with school board members,  administrators, teachers, and community members. It was found that the greatest threat posed to bilingual education was misunderstanding and fear on the part of both the Mexican American and Anglo communities. Bilingual education, if it is to be successfully implemented, depends not only on the development of a bilingual-bicultural school curriculum, but on educating the community on what bilingual education is and what it can offer the Mexican American and Anglo children.

In a workshop situation teachers initially identified 3 to 6 major affective objectives; these, then, were subdivided into sub-goals, which created a large list. Employing successive approximation the list was first tested via actual course work during the summer of 1973. Testing was accomplished via a checklist system wherein individual behavior was recorded by a student, instructor, or senior instructor. Data were then summarized and evaluated statistically for purposes of measuring course effectiveness and establishing trends. Though  different objectives were and are projected for different courses, it is hoped that ultimately various objectives and programs will be tied together in a common hierarchy. In other words, Outward Bound is evolving its objectives in a series of empirically checked steps. It is estimated that it will take two more years to develop basic checklists that fairly and effectively measure affective behavior change in a field setting which will involve both field tests where the checklist items are evaluated and workshops where the items are revised on the basis of field experience.

Initially, half of a 20 percent randomly selected sample were personally interviewed to ascertain perceptions and expectations relative to the new clinic. One year later a follow-up study, utilizing the entire sample of 104 households, was conducted to determine patterns of correlates of acceptance and utilization. Concurrently, all clinic records were compiled, tabulated, and analyzed in terms of patient diagnosis, treatment,  consultation, age, sex, and fee charged and in terms of clinic costs and revenues. It was concluded that the satellite model was medically feasible. Utilization patterns fell within the expectations of a primary care clinic; patient acceptance was highly favorable; and the physician's assistant operated in the appropriate dependency relationship with his physician employer. However, economic feasibility was not deemed secure under present Federal/State regulations governing physician's assistants. (JC)",

Seven basic types of assimilation were studied--cultural, structural, marital, identificational, attitudinal, behavioral, and civic assimilation. A questionnaire was administered to 8th grade students in 9 public and 9 parochial schools in San Antonio, Texas. In each school system, 3 schools were classified as middle class, 3 as working class, and 3 as lower class according to the parents' occupation. The final sample consisted of 383 students (168 in public schools and 215 in parochial) who indicated that their mother and/or father were of Mexican American descent. Therefore, parentage rather than surname was the basis for ethnic determination. In order to  provide some control over those variables related to residential location, both public and parochial schools which were in close physical proximity were selected. Some findings were: (1) Mexican Americans in parochial schools showed greater overall assimilation and scored higher in cultural, structural, (tendency toward) marital, attitudinal, and civic assimilation; (2) those in public schools demonstrated greater identificational assimilation; and (3) there was virtually no difference between the groups in behavioral assimilation.

        "description":"Family-physician relationships were examined in terms of solo vs group physician practices in two rural southern counties of different socioeconomic status. Comparatively speaking, County B was poorer, had a much higher representation of blacks, had lost considerable population during 1960-70, depended to a much lesser degree on manufacturing, and had a lower educational level than County A. However, County B relied primarily on solo physician practices. Utilizing a six item questionnaire, 378 households from both counties were surveyed to determine the physician-patient relationship; resulting met and unmet needs were determined via an eight symptom checklist. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) the more group-like a physician practice organization, the weaker the family-physician  relationship; (2) the weaker the family-physician relationship, the greater the unmet need; and (3) the more group-like a physician practice organization, the greater the unmet need (of families which rely on that organization for primary care). Results revealed that family-physician relationships were stronger among solo-practice patients than among group practice patients and that the strength of family-physician relationships influenced the health level of the household.

        "description":"Part of a larger investigation of cross-age interaction in one-room schools, this study focused on the extent and characteristics of peer tutoring in contemporary one-room schools. Since Nebraska had more one-teacher schools (626 in 1971-72) than any other state, all one-teacher schools with an enrollment of 10 or more students in grades 1-6 or 8 were selected. A questionnaire was administered in April and May 1973 to 110 teachers and 1,405 students in 110 one-teacher schools located throughout the State. The 53-item student questionnaire was administered by the teachers. Teacher questionnaires consisted of 46 items. Data were not obtained from kindergarten children, severely handicapped students, or absent students. Among the findings were: (1) approximately 34 of the 110  schools had students tutoring other students on a regular basis; (2) there was considerable overlap between students who were tutors and those who were tutees; (3) tutors preferred having more than one tutee and tutees preferred having 3 or more tutors; and (4) both tutors and tutees expressed greatest satisfaction when working with students of both sexes, less satisfaction when working with those of the same sex, and least satisfaction when working with students of the opposite sex.

During July 1972, 62 Nunivak Island Eskimos of various ages were interviewed regarding their relationships with selected aspects of traditional arts. Subjects were divided into four age groups: 6-13, 14-25, 26-49, and 50 and over. Interviews were conducted in Cux (the Nunivak dialect of Yu'pik Eskimo) and in English. Responses were broken down into 72 items for analysis. Relationships between age groups and selected responses were examined. Questions dealing  with comparisons of different Nunivak crafts were analyzed by the respondent's sex since some craft items were made mainly by members of one sex, and male and female respondents' outlook might differ regarding the crafts. Some findings were: (1) the older the respondent the more likely he was to recognize traditional art work and to have knowledge of its traditional use; and (2) members of each sex tended to place the most value on the crafts made primarily by members of that sex.

        "description":"Changes between 1960 and 1966 in the labor force characteristics of women in low-income rural areas of Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee were examined. Within a rural milieu, characterized by low income and high out-migration, the study determined the: (1) scope, social characteristics, and nature of mobility and its effects on the residual female labor force of the initial sample loss from 1960 to 1966; and (2) changes in the patterns of labor force participation, occupational distribution, and mobility of women, and their relation to such variables as age, education, marital status, and stages of the family life cycle. Three to six counties were selected within each state, based primarily on their rurality and low income. Data were obtained from 1,295  households interviewed in 1960 and 838 households in 1966. Among the findings were: (1) one of the most important influences on a woman's employment was her position in the family; (2) for those women who worked, educational attainment and race had more bearing on occupational choice than did family position; and (3) the difference between the labor force participation rate of farm wives and other women decreased considerably between 1960 and 1966.

        "description":"The 1867 British North America Act consigned responsibility for the education of Canadian Indians and Inuit to the Federal Government, but churches ran the schools until the post-World War II period. Government policy from 1948 until 1969 encouraged the integration of Native children into provincial educational systems. In 1969 the Government proposed that all services for Native people be provided through the same agencies serving the majority of citizens. Native people rejected this proposal and in 1972 demanded control of their educational system in order to preserve their cultural identity. The Federal Government accepted the principle of Indian control of Indian education. Canadian acceptance of cultural pluralism is reflected in official support for developmental studies of  indigenous languages. Language programs were developed to enable initial literacy in indigenous languages, with English or French becoming the language of instruction by grade 4. Where parents request, the native language may continue to be taught thereafter. Qualified staff shortages are being tackled through various innovative training programs for Native teachers and paraprofessionals. Efforts are underway to encourage the inclusion of Native languages in provincial curricula and to develop instructional materials and strategies by consulting Native parents and organizations.

As a step toward understanding specializing in environmental problems, this study compared environmental psychology researchers with interpersonal attraction researchers and with psychologists in general on measures of current career and educational background. Both groups of researchers are more oriented than other psychologists to scientific aspects of psychology and less oriented to people-related aspects. Fewer differences were obtained between the two research groups, although the environmental psychologists seem somewhat more biologically and quantitatively oriented, perhaps a  reflection of an ecological perspective. The clearest trend appears to be that a more heterogeneous area like environmental psychology will attract a more diverse group of researchers. Tables and references are included in the study.

        "description":"Many countries today recognize the need to initiate a population education program within the school curriculum at all levels. In developing countries, many changes have been brought about by population increases. Enormous needs have been created for housing, schools, medical care, food, and employment. These needs, however, are not being met adequately because the population increase is too rapid. Population education expands the family planning approach beyond mere sex education and includes concern for population growth and natural resources, pollution, good health, and nutrition. It is aimed at educating the reproductive population to the need for a quality life and the means to obtain it. The content of the program, as proposed by the author of these three papers, will  include varied fields of study such as anthropology, agriculture, demography, economics, geography, medicine, psychology, science, sociology, and technology. Personnel in these fields act as resource persons for college students and pre-service and in-service teachers. From here, the program is extended into the school programs, including adult and continuing education programs. The author feels the need for this type of program, especially in developing Asian countries. (MA)",

Group A received experimental population curriculum materials and formal instruction; group B received only the curriculum materials; and group C received neither. Based on pretest and posttest results, students in group A scored the highest. Also recorded were significant attitudinal changes in groups A and B, but no significant changes in group C. This information, plus that received from a questionnaire-checklist, provided data for the refinement of the curriculum materials. In the second paper, the author discusses the  sequence of events in developing a population education program. These include the formation of goals and objectives, the formulation of a knowledge base for curriculum development, the selection of content, the incorporation of population education in the school curriculum, the education of teachers, and the preparation of instructional materials. These are done with respect to the programs of the individual nations. (MA)",

The chapter on  environmental status and trends provides information on status and trends in environmental quality--whether particular facets of environmental quality are improving or deteriorating and what current conditions are. Four major aspects of the environment are covered: air pollution, water pollution, land use, and population. The final chapter, The Citizen's Role in Environmental Improvement, describes the environmental movement as it is constituted today--the variety of environmental organizations, their interests and activities, their resources and their problems.

Effects of interaction between curriculum and such variables as teachers' bias, type of school, sex of student, and specific subject matter taught as related to achievement were sought. Schools included city academic, rural-kibbutz, and agricultural. Students were divided into groups designated by the curriculum used. Of these, 408 were in the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) curriculum, using the Israeli-adapted Yellow Version. The second group of 581 students was the non-BSCS group. Fifty different teachers were involved and divided into two groups, the BSCS supporters and the non-supporters, based on response scores from the  Blankenship Attitude Inventory. A multiple choice test, with KR = 0.79, was used to measure achievement. Statistical analyses included means, standard deviations, one-, two-, and three-way analyses of variance and t-tests. Considerable significant differences were found in school type, with achievement in agricultural schools much lower. Males outscored females in total results. Substantial and significant differences, all in favor of the BSCS students, were identified. (EB)",

        "description":"This study concerns determining whether three types of advance organizers (visual, audio, or written) had any effect upon learning a biological concept as measured by a constructed achievement test and whether advance organizers are more effective across learner variables of I.Q., abstract reasoning and sex. One hundred twenty randomly selected seventh-grade students were stratified on the basis of I.Q. scores and assigned to one of four treatment groups which included an audio advance organizer group, a visual organizer group, a written organizer group and a control. The constructed testing instrument was a 30-item multiple choice test and ANOVA was used to analyze the results. The results indicated that the use of advance organizers did not significantly affect the learning of  the biological concept and that no interactive effects of I.Q., abstract reasoning or sex differences had any effect upon treatment. Subjective data obtained in interviews indicated that advance organizers presumably facilitate the learning of the biological concepts. (Author/BR)",

The temporary exhibition evolved as a result for the need of repeated visitation. The temporary exhibition, set up for a period of one to six months, introduces fresh material to the visitor and stimulates his interest. Moreover, it frequently causes him to revisit the permanent exhibition which contains the museum's main assets. This manual, consisting of seven chapters, deals with the temporary exhibit and traveling exhibit. Part I, the Temporary Exhibit, includes three chapters: The Temporary Exhibit in Science Museums, which deals with designing, staff planning, lighting, sound, etc.; Temporary Exhibits  in Art Museums, which considers methods, visitors, catalogues, guides, and talks; and Exhibits in the Technically Underdeveloped Countries, which discusses program types. Part II, Traveling Exhibitions, contains the following four chapters: Chapter IV deals with the origin, sources, costs, supervision, assembly, display, and other topics related to traveling exhibits; Chapter V discusses principles of packing; followed by Chapter VI, transportation. Chapter VII, the final chapter, considers insurance policies. An introduction, bibliography and three appendices are also included. (Author/TK)",

Another objective of this study was to consider changes in the evaluations when the first performance of student teachers was compared with their second performance. The study considered lessons taught by 58 student teachers in 4 different semesters. A nine-item questionnaire was specially prepared for this study. A total of 2,399 questionnaires was completed by students receiving instruction, while the total number of questionnaires completed by the peers was 314. A sample of thirteen student teachers did two lessons, both of which were evaluated. The time between performances was four to  six weeks. The t-tests indicated highly significant differences between the evaluations done by the peers and those by the students, in the totals and in seven of the nine categories at the 0.001 level. In all categories, the students rated the performances of the student teachers as poorer than did peers. There were no significant differences between the ratings given by the students for the first performance compared with the second performance. Student teachers should recognize these significant differences between student and peer evaluations when they attempt to interpret evaluations from microteaching. (Author/BR)",

Each group contained 10 male and 10 female students. After specific instructions, students were asked to solve several concept identification problems. A 2 x 2 x 8 repeated measure analysis of variance was performed with the variables of sex, cognitive style and blocks of study. Analyses were performed on the trials to solution, focusing strategy scores, and duplicate hypotheses. Results showed the effect of cognitive  style was significant at the .01 level, favoring analytic style. Analyses of the effect of blocks was significant at the .01 level. There was a greater tendency for the analytic group to use a focusing strategy. Analysis of the mean number of duplicate hypotheses indicated that the cognitive style was significant at the .01 level. Analytic students had a mean of .10, the global students mean was .19.

A 16-item questionnaire to assess status with respect to these areas was developed and sent to state supervisors of science and mathematics. Responses were received from 46 states, the District of Columbia, and 4 territories. Data were analyzed and used to estimate the extent to which states were able to meet four objectives: comprehensive planning, effort for legislation, provision of curricular materials and inservice training, and budgetary support. It was concluded that states exhibited these  abilities only slightly. The authors recommend that objectives for full metric education be developed, and that communication channels among states be established to aid in the development of materials. They also advise that metric consultants be identified, that efforts to pass legislation be intensified and that the approach to metric education be an interdisciplinary one. The questionnaire used and data collected are appended to this report. (SD)",

Concrete information is presented in the progress or decline of knowledge in science. It is reported that knowledge of fundamental scientific facts and principles has declined among American students. Data reported are based on an estimate of the percentage of individuals in a given age population who responded acceptably to a given question. To assess the growth or decline in attainment on a given question, the difference between performance in 1969-70 and 1972-73 was obtained. National results by age level are reported. Also presented is how groups of  individuals responded to certain exercises. The groups are characterized by age, sex, race, region of the country, level of parental education, and size and type of community. A brief section includes putting the data into perspective.

Representatives of organizations in five countries (United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and Canada) which had recently converted to the metric system were surveyed. The survey instrument was designed to cover 15 key areas related to influences for and resistance to conversion, scheduling, teaching strategies, development of materials and programs, and suggestions for the United States. Concurrently with the survey the investigators developed an overseas data collection network and a complex information storage system, and conducted an intensive literature review. Findings are  related to: (1) the identification of groups exerting influence for metrication; (2) strategies, materials and special problems of metric instruction; (3) teacher training; and (4) changes respondents would make in their country's approaches. Nine implications and recommendations are posed by the investigators. This report includes discussions of the programs in each of the five countries and an extensive bibliography. (SD)",

        "description":"In an attempt to make basic social science education more responsive to the needs of students in a rapidly changing society, the authors developed and conducted an experimental course entitled \"Economics and Politics in a Changing Society\" (EPICS). The goals of this course include improvement in thinking ability and creativeness, progress in communicativeness, expansion of knowledge, and the cultivation of feelings. The course attempts to reach these goals through self-directed learning and social problem solving. This paper explains in-depth reasons for suggesting an alternative to the traditional introductory curriculum, reasons related to the changing character of contemporary society and changing orientations toward the learning process. The reason a course such as EPICS is  inconsistent with the traditional value structure of the university and the social sciences is examined. Lastly, it is suggested that EPICS as education for liberation might provide a model for the radical reconstruction of social science education at the university level. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The survey reported in this document was undertaken by ERIC/ChESS in the fall of 1973 to see how social studies fits into state accountability activities. The information obtained from the nationwide survey of state departments of education revealed social studies activity in accountability to be quite limited; therefore, general accountability activities are also discussed in the document. The basic data gathered in the survey are briefly condensed in a summary preceding the report. The report begins with a general introduction to the accountability movement, followed by an accountability model which the authors suggest as a framework for analyzing state activities. The model for a general educational accountability can be applied to social studies by incorporating social  studies goals and objectives. The purposes and methodology of the study are described in section three of the document. Section four presents the study results in detail. Charts and tables illustrate the findings throughout the document. Four appendices conclude the report: (1) a list of individuals who supplied information as well as the survey questionnaire forms; (2) two background papers on accountability; (3) the basic data, in tabular form by states; and (4) an annotated bibliography of documents related to accountability, published by 37 states.

        "description":"After four years of using simulation in the study of international relations, the authors have found it to be a potentially powerful research and teaching device. In this report they examine advantages, such as the ability it gives the researcher to manipulate experimental variables, and disadvantages associated specifically with the use of simulation in political science. They contend that the use of simulation is often prematurely rejected when refinement on the basis of legitimate criticism is what is needed. Among the research strategies available for testing and revising simulation models is face validity evaluation which the authors use in their revision of the Inter-National Simulation (INS) to exemplify such refinement. In INS greater realism and sophistication results  when a military advisor is included in the national decision making organization, when geographic dimensions and historical background are increased, and when internal revolution is introduced. A number of practical considerations associated with simulation in conducting a research project are also included in the paper--all in the hope of promoting the use of simulation as a research technique in political science.

        "description":"In 1973, in the Fairfax County Public Schools, a series of one-session courses was created in which teachers with special skills or interests would share their knowledge and curriculum ideas with other teachers. The program, called Mini-Versity, operated on the assumption that teachers learning from other teachers was the best way to learn. Through this inservice training program, teachers were provided with a wide range of ideas and experiences instead of an in-depth study of one idea. Minisessions varied in subject matter, format, and procedure. Some topics used in this program included career education, an archaeological dig, innovative teaching activities, anthropology, and a look at futurism. Any K-12 social studies teacher in Fairfax County was eligible to take any session,  regardless of its designated grade level or subject area. Teachers evaluating the program viewed it as a highly practical way to share curriculum ideas and materials. Graduate credit in the nearby university was provided as added incentive for teacher participation, as well as noncredit work toward the renewal of teaching certificates. (Author/JR)",

The educational system in Tunisia is based on both the nation's own rich cultural background and also on the linguistic and pedagogical heritage obtained from France during the French Protectorate (1880-1956). Tunisia's leaders are committed to attaining universal primary education, providing educational opportunity to all levels of society, and eradicating illiteracy. Today the system is organized into a 6-year primary cycle and a secondary cycle that includes academic, technical, and vocational programs of varying lengths. The structure, control, language of  instruction, grading system, academic calendar, legal basis, administration, and financing of the system are discussed.

        "description":"Moral development theory, based on the work of Kohlberg and others, offers an approach to growth and stage change which may be applied to the everyday schooling process. Although there are now four general ways in which theory of developmental change is currently being applied, this paper proposes an alternative application of the stage transition aspects of moral development theory. In the major portion of the document, the author presents a proposal for a &quot;Developmental Atmospheres&quot; approach, viewing the elementary classroom as a total social environment where a student's moral development occurs. This plan for movement from theory to program reality for the stage-transition aspect of moral development theory defines the nature of a socially stimulating environment through  theoretical definition of how stage change occurs. Further, the plan explains how the connection between theory and practice can be made through four phases of a model: (1) description of essentials of the theoretical explanations of stage change; (2) description of conditions for change evident in this theoretical explanation -- interaction, conflict, +1 reasoning, and restructuring; (3) translation of the four general conditions into classroom process objectives which can be used for observation -- categorizing them by general classroom procedures, children's work activities, the nature of class discussion, and teacher's action; and (4) validation of the observation instrument by data collection, analysis of data, and discussion.

Piaget has defined certain core mental structures that develop in all humans in the same order. Both Piaget and Kohlberg have done work on the process of developmental change and the conditions necessary for optimal growth of the reasoning structure. From this work several objectives -- the determining of developmental stages, the facilitating of developmental growth, and the use of this information to enhance educational process -- are proposed for a cognitive-developmental evaluation system. Steps proposed include the specification of outcome objectives, the measurement of student performance based on developmental levels, and the observation and measurement of  process objectives, that is, objectives that provide the opportunity for natural development to take place in the classroom. In an appendix sample tasks on conservation and logical relations are provided to typify the first steps and 81 process objectives with directions for using them in the classroom are provided for the last. Next, fitting other educational objectives in this cognitive developmental system and use of the evaluation by educators are discussed. Areas of needed research and of research under way are suggested as well a specific plan to test the measurement steps. (JH)",

Schools at all levels may be public, semipublic, or private. Iran's educational system is currently undergoing reform as part of the government plans for the country's modernization and development. Under these plans, the government is not only revising the school system's structure and curriculum, but is also striving to meet the mass educational needs and correct the educational deficiencies of both children and adults,  particularly in rural areas where literacy training programs are emphasized.

The basic system involves a 1-year kindergarten program and 8 years of elementary education, which are free and compulsory. Secondary education, usually extending over a period of 4 years, is neither free nor compulsory. Changes in the traditional structural pattern of Israeli elementary-secondary education, which have recently been initiated and are gradually being implemented, are discussed. Higher education programs--varying in the number of years of study depending on the institution, the field of study, and the diploma or degree program undertaken--are financed through tuition fees, grants, and government subsidies.

        "description":"Traditional models for curriculum theory describe human development as a sum of its parts, organized in a hierarchy leading to operational competencies. The reconceptualist Currere model, originated by William Penar, develops horizontally with energy and learning moving outward and inward rather than upward in a linear trajectory. Educational experience based on this reform requires autobiography, a review of the subject's educational experience; phenomenological description of the subject's present situation, his historical, social, physical life world; and a record of the subject's response, associations and intellections, to a literature work. The theory base for the Currere model is drawn from humanistic philosophy, phenomenology's emphasis on reciprocity of subjectivity and  objectivity in the constitution of human knowledge, and existentialism's emphasis on the dialectical relationship of man to his situation. The Currere model returns to the experience of the individual: its idiosyncratic history, its preconceptual foundation, its contextual dependency, and its innate freedom expressed in choice and self-direction. It reconstructs a pathway to the present choice by digging back to identify the encounters that led to it. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"A student flow model in linear programming format, designed to plan the movement of students into secondary and university programs in Tunisia, is described. The purpose of the plan is to determine a sufficient number of graduating students that would flow back into the system as teachers or move into the labor market to meet fixed manpower targets. The problem is to simultaneously consider a large number of programs and levels in the education system as well as to represent the production of teachers over a number of planning years. A linear programming model was chosen because of the wide availability of codes designed specifically for the optimization of linear problems. The modeling process illustrates the conceptual distinction between predictive and prescriptive planning.  Predictive planning assumes externally controlled variables while prescriptive planning assumes that the government or planning body controls all the important variables. This model demonstrates that linear programming is suitable for both types of planning and that the ultimate determinants of the model are the manpower needs of the country. The structure of the model, its bounds and constraints with respect to pupil and teacher flow and graduation targets, and diagrams of the structure presented in the paper. (Author/JH)",

Analysis of data available from various statistical sources, such as the United Nations Statistical Yearbook, is accomplished with a regression formula to compute national income elasticity values and with the Pearson produce-moment correlation coefficient to examine the relationship between national income and government expenditures. Results of the study show that coefficients of national income elasticity for education are higher than other categories of governmental expenditures, indicating a  favorable recognition of education; higher income countries tend to allocate more for education than low income ones, implying the need for international aid to those countries as a means for closing the gap between high and low incomes; and low income countries have a greater income elasticity for education, indicating that they attach greater importance to education than high income countries where a greater capacity for spending exists.

        "description":"This survey compares mobility and outlets of secondary students in Hong Kong by the type of schools within the educational system. Student mobility is defined as transfer to other local schools, transfer to overseas schools, and dropping out. The six types of schools within the system include three Anglo-Chinese instructed schools -- government, partially aided government, and private -- and three Chinese instructed schools -- also government, partially aided government, and private. As a rule, fully funded government schools have the greatest operational budgets, best facilities, and most competent teaching staffs while private schools have the worst. Results indicate that for 39 secondary schools in the sample, student transfer and dropout rate was lower in government schools  which used English as the medium for instruction and correspondingly higher in private Chinese schools. It is postulated that schools using English have greater social prestige which retards student mobility. Students in the better government schools had a greater chance to transfer to other Hong Kong schools while those students eliminated from less prestigious schools either studied abroad or joined the working ranks. It is recommended that the government devise a method for bringing about equity of subsidies to schools to reduce student overseas transfer and dropout rate from the less well financed schools.

Wirt (1907-1938), were the most written about, analyzed, and praised of any &quot;progressive&quot; school system in the 1920's. Although the system was criticized in a survey made by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1918, Gary, Indiana, schools continued in their progressive mold during the 1920's. Wirt always tried new schemes to broaden the schools' influence in and control over the community. The basic structure of the Gary system included a design to mold the individual's character as well as provide training in cognitive and manual skills. Innovations in the system included elaborate school facilities; extensive playground space; diverse curricular and extracurricular activities; vocational and recreational  equipment; Saturday, summer, and night activities; vocational education; &quot;individualized&quot; instruction; ability grouping; and letter grading. Yet the concept of educational opportunities for all was not a reality even in the progressive Gary system. The majority of black students were in separate, physically inferior schools and were channeled into vocational careers. Even with the many innovations, the economically disadvantaged or culturally different usually came out at the bottom. (Author/DE)",

Information gathered by participant observation, formal and informal interviews, and various measures of ethnicity and cognitive perception documents the process of change due to passage of time and school orientation. Findings about value orientation, normative activities, evaluation of  ethnic membership, religious orthodoxy, self-esteem, social networks, learning potential, and personality types are presented in the report. The impact of the Mennonite school on student attitudes is found to be most influential in the areas of normative, preferred or accepted, activities.

Antiestablishment geographers believe that geography should be concerned with the human condition and include among its purposes the enlightment of the public and of policy makers. This new base for the discipline would consider equity in resource distribution, the responsiveness of various  institutions to human needs, community development, and the harmony of man in his total environment. The argument for a humanistic rather than mechanistic science is posited against a view of a geographical establishment which exists to perpetuate itself. Only the instruction is available in this document. The remainder of the two semester course, including an abundance of copyrighted material, proceeds from the vantage point of the introduction to cover four \"issues,\" beginning with imperialism and four \"landscapes,\" studies of Sweden, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China.

        "description":"Findings in industrialized countries, such as those of Jencks and Coleman, indicate that socioeconomic status has a strong influence on academic achievement and that school effects are of lesser importance. This study of socioeconomic influences and school influences on the performance of 23,615 Ugandan children taking the Primary Leaving Examination (PLE) tests the validity of these findings for Uganda, a less developed nation. Participants representing socioeconomic cross sections of Uganda provided information about their parent's education, occupation, and types of personal possessions. Schools effects were gauged by teacher characteristics, by the ratio of books per child, and by the presence of various physical facilities in the schools. Findings were correlated with the  PLE exam scores and compared with those for science education from the study by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). No correlation between PLE achievement and socioeconomic factors was discovered. The effect of school, teacher, and book variables explain 30-50 percent of the &quot;accounted for&quot; variance. Results with respect to socioeconomic influences are not inconsistent with the results among the less industrialized countries in the IEA study. These findings in Uganda caution the use of the Coleman and Jencks data for decision making in less developed societies. (JH)",

        "description":"In the late 1960's the Executive Branch of the Venezuelan government launched a massive reform of its mechanism of public administration in order to make it more supportive of the development needs of the country. This paper is an effort to analyze the process of organizational change as it takes place within one segment of the public administration mechanism in Venezuela--The Ministry of Education. The thrust of the reform calls for a reallocation of power in the Ministry with the intended purpose of establishing a regionalized education system supported by a decentralized decision-making process. The primary resistance factors identified during the first 4-year experience of the reform (referred to as the &quot;start up&quot; phase) were out of power political parties, informal vested  interest groups, and individuals who would clearly lose a measure of their influence through the reallocation process. Even though the resistance to change has been formidable, a measure of progress has been recorded which suggests that a modest but genuine transition is taking place. (Author)",

        "description":"In this presentation the author paints a conceptual portrait of his evolving relationships to his formal studies and thereby describes a method by which educators can reconceptualize the meaning of curriculum. By taking oneself and one's existential experience as a data source and using the psychoanalytical technique of free association, one can build not only a linear but a multidimensional biography based on conceptual and preconceptual experiences. The method consists of four steps. the regressive, progressive, analytical, and synthetical. In the regressive step, one postulates and records one's educational experiences in the future. In the analytical stage, one describes one's present educational experience and then seeks the individuality and interrelationships of the three  descriptions. In the synthetical stage, one attempts to extract the existential meaning of the present and integrate the three forms of intellectualization into a comprehensive whole that includes the physical self. The method reduces the distance between the researcher and subject by making the researcher the subject and allows for deeper and clearer understanding of the present by outlining the past, present, and future.

        "description":"The platoon school plan, originally developed in Gary, Indiana, appealed to Progressives in the 1920's for both its administrative efficiency and achievement of a creative humanistic, and democratic education. Students were divided into two sections, and while one section filled all the classrooms and studied academic subjects during the morning hours, the second utilized the rest of the school facility in more specialized activities such as art, music, dancing, dramatics, scientific experiments, athletics, workshops, and library work. In the afternoon the two groups switched. In the 1920's Alice Barrows, in her position at the U. S. Office of Education, moved to the forefront as the most aggressive national publicist for the platoon school plan. Barrows supported the plan not  because of its efficiency, but because it humanized instruction, permitted the child to be treated naturally as a human being, and developed the child's individuality. In the late 20's and 30's Barrows' ideological position on the platoon system shifted from moderate reform to the extreme left, as she focused on the plan as a means for egalitarian social change.

Discovery learning and independent research are the focus of course method. At the start of the course, students are given nine hypotheses relating to American history which they are required to either prove or disprove throughout the course of the year. An example of such an hupothesis is &quot;The majority of the presidents of the United States have been elected on the basis of personal appeal rather than political philosophy.&quot; Students then develop an understanding of the nature of hypothesis formation and learn to work independently, budget their time, evaluate  information, draw conclusions, define positions both orally and in written form, and assume group leadership. Because of these high expectations, only students from the top 11 percent of their class are eligible. Students gather data through independent research and present their conclusions in a final report. Teacher and library assistance is available throughout each research project for gathering appropriate data and finding resources. As a result of this program, two spin-off courses have been developed for other social studies classes. Each of these three innovative programs involves extensive teacher cooperation and team effort.

The nine-week unit explores identification of ideals, analysis of sex roles, investigation of sex stereotyping, investigation of the historical development of women, and examination of social issues relating to women. The focus of the course is on personal development and increased student awareness, and is not a feminist indoctrination program. The course centers on teacher neutrality, allowing students to develop their own views based on input from a variety of sources and activities. Teaching activities include keeping a journal and providing an opportunity for students to reflect on the personal meaning of being a female. Role playing and mock  trials of Susan B. Anthony and Salem witches are course activities to show the historical development of women. Rewritten fairy tales with reversed roles, self-defense demonstrations, and guest speakers add dimensions to student's understanding of what it means to be a female in the world today. (Author/JB)",

The first part of the document gives an overview of the original curriculum product as developed by EDC, including its content focus, objectives, and teaching strategies. The second section illustrates how the curriculum is adapted for use in a New Jersey school. An interdisciplinary approach of social studies and language arts through a team teaching situation is used. The content of People and Technology provides a good vehicle for teaching language arts skills; inturn, the language arts activities help to reinforce social studies concepts.  One major adaptation of the program is the addition of four study units which the teachers feel are necessary to incorporate concepts not included in the basic curriculum. The key to the success of the curriculum adaptation is continual revision, providing a better curriculum suited to the needs of individual students, and a fresh classroom experience each year for teachers.

Other goals of the project include the construction of a comprehensive K-12 curriculum by creating new materials, adapting those already available, and evaluating, then  revising, the resulting curriculum. The units available as SO 008 271 through SO 008 300 are part of the results of the project. A final report of the project is available as ED 070 693. The K-2 unit in this document deals with discovery of self and of groups. Its objectives are categorized as knowledge, skill, attitude, and behavior objectives and are concerned with learning about and accepting self and others -- physically, mentally, and emotionally -- and with exploring and working individually or in groups. The unit contains initiatory activities with songs, working individually or in groups. The unit contains initiatory activities with songs, mirrors, and cameras; information retrieval activities that ask children to think, draw, tell about, and experience their senses and emotions,  their ability to learn, and their understanding of their group; and resources keyed to the activities.

        "description":"As part of the second grade curriculum of introductory economics, this unit of the Focus on Inner City Social Studies (FICSS) series (See SO 008 271) explores housing and communities. The unit is an active study in which children explore and probe into community conditions. They experiment with methods of improving their own environment and develop self esteem in belonging to groups working to raise community standards. One activity urges students to call or write the health department to learn how to get rid of rats and pests and, then, to talk to adults to see what can be done to reduce health hazards that may exist in a neighborhood. The unit also explores why people live where they do; responsibilities of tenants and owners; and what effects urban renewal has on housing. The  format of the unit includes an introduction, essential source materials for teaching the unit; knowledge, skill, and behavioral objectives; learning activities; and teacher and student resources.

The theoretical section examines the fundamentals of the political and economic systems; the practical examines the extent to which the theory is realized in practice. It is intended that pupils will ask questions concerning the what, how much, and for whom of production; who makes and enforces the rules; and how rules may be modified. From the learning activities, students become aware of the money system, the involvement of politics in capitalism, and specific  areas of economics such as commodities, competition, Gross National Product, and government spending.

The other group formed the control group, with which the experimental teachers and their students were compared. The research objectives were to provide insights and conclusions into specific goals set by veteran teachers, administrators, and the first-year teachers themselves. The methods for gathering data to ascertain the degree to which the objectives of the program were achieved included standardized tests,  nonstandardized tests, assistance reports, and interviews. The report concluded that a more positive relationship existed between student attitude and teacher competency in the experimental group than in the control group. (Author/JS)",

Each subject prepared and microtaught a lesson to three elementary students. The microteaching session was audiorecorded and the audiorecordings were later rated for types and frequencies of teacher questions and student responses. Both modeling treatments were superior to the control in producing the appropriate  responses.

The report focused on the questions (a) Do concerns of prospective teachers tend toward universality? and (b) What are the programmatic implications? Subjects for this study were education majors whose experience ranged from no education courses to certification. The survey results confirmed the Fuller findings, though between-group differences in terms of three concern levels were not statistically significant, and most majors tended to be at lower maturity levels. The implication is that education programs may well require revision to reflect student concerns.

When completed, the framework being developed should be able to organize information about the KPU system and its governance, which is expressed in four different modes. These modes are: (a) typological--using a classificatory system for policies, agents, resources, and goal-specified activities in KPU; (b) graphical--organizational charts, time-based flowcharts, and other types of KPU systems maps; (c) numerical--time-series and other types of quantitative or statistical information about KPU; and (d) textual--nonquantitative descriptions about the  KPU system in education. In subsequent applications of the approach, the framework could be used to describe and analyze the ways in which existing configurations of policies, agents, and resources interact and coact across time in various KPU activities, thereby providing a better understanding of acutal KPU system operation and how it might be improved.

The need for specifying what, for whom, how long, and what else, in terms of the application of validity specifications, are recognized in the Georgia project. The type of achievement measures selected and data obtained to meet this need call for an analysis which recognizes the influence of multiple measures simultaneously. In the Georgia project, data analysis will therefore be by multiple  regression and, where adequate degrees of freedom are available, by multivariate analysis. The project will attempt to minimize the problem of inconsistency by replicating results over several years, sharpening hypotheses, and refining measurement procedures. Although past work in measuring teacher behavior and relating it to measures of pupil growth has not produced extensive agreement on findings, the improvements in methodology which are needed have become clearer. More rapid progress may now be possible where past progress has been slow and uncertain, and the Georgia project will be in a position to profit from these advances. (PB)",

The conceptual model of individualization is hierarchical in form on two axes; one representing the degree of student choice behavior, and the other the degree of external instructional control. This control is conceived as applying to three areas; pace, strategy, and objectives. At one extreme of the model's hierarchy is traditional education. In this situation undifferentiated  pace, strategy, and objectives are predetermined by the instructor. The next level differs only in that each student proceeds at his/her own pace. This level is referred to as mastery learning. At the next level both pace and strategy can be manipulated by an instructor to meet student needs. Attitude treatment interaction is an example. The next level is contract negotiation. At this level objectives, pace, and strategy can all be manipulated by the instructor in accordance with each student's needs. At the last level students can initiate independent behavior. (A content analysis of four classroom survey methods was done to examine the utility of the model.) (PB)",

Teachers were observed for a total of 27.8 hours, and each activity observed was noted in one of several categories listed under physical or verbal behavior. While the data do not permit a direct assessment of the teacher center's effects, they do disclose the nature and quality of opportunity available, and the ways teachers generally take advantage of those opportunities. The center seems to function most prominently as a curriculum workshop and resource area, with greater emphasis on the making of materials rather than on their use. It is a supportive environment with a strong emphasis on individuality. The center seems to support personal  exploration and experimentation with materials, tools, and ideas. While firsthand experience is essential to the process of internalizing new concepts and beliefs, it is not sufficient in itself. The center could more fully exploit its potential to change teachers by encouraging more discussion among teachers about what they are doing in the center and in the classroom and why.

This conceptualization is contrasted with the approach which views educational psychology as a comprehensive content area emphasizing information rather than skills. A basic distinction between behaviorists and nonbehaviorists can be traced back to the question of whether the role of education and teachers is to instruct and teach skills (behaviorist view), or to be concerned with the development of interpersonal relationships and positive self-concepts (nonbehaviorist view). Much criticism voiced against the behaviorist approach is based on misinformation. Some misconceptions are: (a) that behaviorist approaches are designed for dealing only  with deviant behavior; (b) that we cannot discover specific types of teacher behaviors that will lead to certain student outcomes; and (c) that behaviorists teach only Skinnerian and operant procedures. Misconceptions also exist concerning educational psychology courses. Such courses should avoid subject areas which will not aid in facilitating behavioral change. Rather than trying to cover everything, teachers should concentrate on teaching skills students will need later as teachers. (PB)",

Data presented in the study supported the specific hypothesis relating to attitudes toward courses, and partially supported the hypothesis concerning beliefs about the educative process.

According to the report, incidents that may lead to employment dissatisfaction are: (a) inadequate preparation for the daily routine of being a gym teacher, (b) lack of inservice training until internship, and (c) the discovery that only a small segment of time is devoted to instruction. The author then describes, through  impressions of one observer, how physical education teachers feel about their work. The difficulties faced by teachers include (a) large classes, (b) diversity in students, (c) the nature of the subject matter, (d) time constraints, (e) lack of direct rewards of teaching, (f) psychological isolation from adults, and (g) bordeom with routine.

The assumptions are that: (a) basic competencies for physical education teachers have been specified; (b) competency-evaluation techniques are available; (c) research literature will show which teacher competencies are causally related to student learning in the psychomotor domain; (d) the question of how to teach physical education teachers can be  resolved; and (e) developing a CBTE program will not cost any more than traditional teacher education programs. The study examines the assumption that the teacher education system must produce teachers unsuited to the present system before the teaching of physical education can be changed.

        "description":"In performance- or competency-based teacher education, the training objectives are behavior skills a teacher may use to produce or enhance learning. One technique used to improve skill development is modeling. The trainee is shown either a live, taped, or written model and then attempts to emulate the example. The student receives immediate feedback including positive reinforcement when behaviors are achieved, or information regarding the nature of the performance and ways that it can be improved. Finally, time is given for supervised and unsupervised practice sessions varying from regular classroom to microteaching situations. The components of a training and supervision model should allow trainees opportunity to (a) acquire the behavior, (b) perform the behavior, (c) practice  old and new skills, and (d) transfer new skills to new situations and contexts. Teacher centers have been found beneficial in pre- and inservice training and are ideal for modeling situations. When the faculty and staff of school districts collaborate in the training of teachers, they can provide information regarding teaching skills and materials that require training efforts, and master teachers can be recruited from the schools to act as &quot;models&quot; for training, as well as to supervise training. (Figures indicating a sample inservice teacher performance profile, the individualizing mechanisms in performance-based supervision, and the ideal relationship of teacher behavior to student learning are included.

This study tested the hypothesis that students give higher ratings and find more strengths and fewer weaknesses in a study they think was conducted by a high-prestige source than one conducted by a low-prestige source. Thirty-nine Boston University graduate students read nearly identical forms of a research article. The only difference between the two forms was the title page. The high-prestige form gave the author as having a higher degree, professional rank, and more eminent school affiliation than the  low-prestige form.

The Teacher Behavior Research Group and the Intern Teaching Program, both in the process of developing a CBTE compenent, collaborated in a research program focused on these areas. The two groups jointly created a paradigm which allowed causal inferences to be drawn about (a) the effectiveness of training procedures, and (b) observed relationships between criterion teacher behaviors and student  achievement. Results of the study indicated several inherent problems in measuring microteaching studies of teacher behavior when student achievement was the dependent variable. These problems are: (a) lesson content must be unfamiliar yet interesting to students, and it must incorporate intended teacher behaviors; (b) objectives must be limited in scope, and clearly and precisely defined: and (c) teacher behaviors must be manipulated systematically in order to obtain accurate experimental data.

Nearly half the adults in the United States do not exercise at all, and of those that do, many indulge in their favorite sport only once or twice a month. Although America seems to be a sports-conscious nation, the majority of the population are spectators rather than active participants. A demand for equal time for health, physical education, and recreation needs to be made. However, there should first be a change in attitude concerning sports. Why should the national favorites continue to be football, baseball, and soccer when they have been found to not be conducive to physical fitness and health? Besides being poor body builders, competitive sports have recently been  considered drains on the spirit because competition makes more losers than winners. There is now a growing movement in American physical education which emphasizes lifetime sports rather than the usual team sports learned in school. This movement is exemplified by the increasing number of local recreational athletes, creation of new family games, booming interest in dance, Eastern martial arts, and other disciplines. With a change in attitude, people can have both sound bodies and sound minds. (JS)",

        "description":"Findings of educational research offer little indication of a relationship between teacher performance and pupil achievement. A review of reported studies suggest that the difficulty may be methodological. Most investigations are either correlational studies or comparative studies using control group designs. Most correlational research is characterized by a lack of theoretical guidance or explicit rationale, and results are often not replicable. Group comparison studies are impeded by difficulty in establishing preexperimental sampling equivalence of groups, inadequacy of traditional data analysis techniques, and within-group variance. Two alternative methodologies which may be useful for educational research are the time-series and multiple baseline designs. The former is an  example of a design where a discontinuity in a series of measurements that occurs coincidentally with the introduction of the treatment variable suggests a possible relationship. The multiple time-series design introduces a nonequivalent control situation in order to rule out the possibility that other potential influences on the dependent variable were responsible for the observed changes. The multiple baseline design is an extension of the time-series model in which the researcher attempts to replicate the effect of a treatment variable across a number of behaviors. Baseline behaviors are established, treatments applied successively, and behavior changes recorded. (HMD)",

In 1965 the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission was established. Since then, the commission has carried out research and influenced the development of various aspects of teacher education, certification, and related matters. In 1966 the Northwest Regional Education Laboratory undertook the Comfield Project, which developed a model program for improving knowledge, skills, and competencies in prospective elementary teachers. The program's definition of competency was &quot;the demonstrated ability to bring about the expected outcomes of a role or function included in a job definition.&quot; This definition has had an impact on major documents which have  resulted from current reform movements in Oregon teacher education and certification. The education profession and the commission are aware of difficulties in implementing competency-based education programs. Many demands for research will be made by the profession in years to come. Generally, they will deal with (a) licensing regulations for teachers as expressed through certification rules, (b) accreditation standards applied to teacher education programs designed to meet those rules, and (c) the nature of public schools in which teachers practice after they have completed basic certification programs.

By sharing responsibility for instruction, each teacher can function primarily in areas of strength and expertise. It thus becomes more possible to achieve the goal of individualized instruction, although not necessarily on a one-to-one basis. Team teaching offers several options--large or small group instruction, independent study--which can be chosen for the purposes each can best fulfill. For a team teaching venture to produce the best results, it is necessary for teachers to understand the philosophy underlying practice. They must then establish educational objectives for their students and  determine the means necessary to best accomplish these objectives. Planning must include provision for adequate record keeping so teachers can fulfill their responsibilities for reporting to parents and the school administration. The concept of team teaching has potential for meeting the current demand for educational effectiveness in the classroom because of its philosophy, formulation of objectives, organizational factors, interpersonal and professional considerations, and numerous benefits for students.

The hypothesis was tested that teachers who are ambivalent toward team teaching and teachers who experience frustration in attempting to implement team teaching would report more negative attitudes toward this innovation. It was anticipated that these factors would interact. It was also anticipated that a) high ambivalence combined with high frustration would result in the most negative attitudes toward the innovation, and b) the combination of low ambivalence and low frustration would result in the most positive attitudes. The study's hypothesized relationship between the  nature of the problem teachers experience and attitudes toward team teaching was only partially confirmed.

The summary of the project report covers the goals, objectives, procedures, accomplishments, evaluation, conclusions, and recommendations. Goals and objectives are enumerated for grades 5-7. The description of the general project design and procedures covers elementary, junior high, and secondary schools. Forty-eight procedures for the program are included describing the procedure or specifying its purpose, student population, instructional staff, methods/techniques, materials, instruments, and a procedural update. This section comprises the main portion of the  document. Common procedures for the three levels were: establishment of criteria for staff selection, orientation meetings for staffs, consultant assistance, and community contacts. The results and accomplishments for the project are itemized by each year and by educational level. The evaluation includes three areas: of project management, of components of three levels, and by a third party evaluator. The conclusions and recommendations discuss securing community and staff support to ensure success, curriculum development, and publicity. An 11-item selected bibliography completes the documents.

The three goals for elementary, junior high, and secondary education were: awareness, orientation and exploration, and job training and placement. In chapter 2, the evaluation of the elementary program (which included only fifth and sixth graders) utilized pre- and post-tests revealing an improvement in awareness and information. Teacher evaluation of the project was also employed. In chapter 3, the evaluation of the junior high program (grades 7-9), utilizing an attitude test, indicated students did not make positive attitude gains. Chapter 4 presents the evaluation of the senior high school programs aimed at the general student population, dropouts, potential dropouts,  and under-achievers. Pre- and post-tests results concerning employability and career information revealed positive gains. Tables present the data from all the evaluation tests and ratings. An examination of the programs for under-achievers is provided. In chapter 5, a discussion of the project administration and staff presents the data from teacher ratings that record positive attitudes regarding administrative coordination. Chapter 6 outlines implications and recommendations that call for further evaluation, curriculum revision, teacher support, and expansion of the program. (JB)",

Studies by Lamb (Mary Lou), Lanham (Frank W.), and Perkins (Edward A.) were used by the workshop participants to identify job tasks for selected entry-level office occupations. Job performance tasks indicated in the research were the basis for the selection of the following job classifications: stenographer, secretary, receptionist, general office clerk, clerk typist, mail clerk, transcribing machine operator, office machine operator, and file clerk. Three sets of tables were  prepared. Tables 1-9 list the percent of respondents performing tasks, arranged in descending order, for nine subject matter areas. Tables 9-18 list the percent of respondents performing tasks, arranged in descending order, according to subject matter and the above listed job classifications; tables 19-27 provide additional coverage of subject matter area and job classifications using a matrix format. Since lower percents did not appear significant in curriculum development for office occupations, the percent of respondents performing tasks below 30% was eliminated.

The results indicated that: teachers viewed career education as having two basic components (teacher/classroom and school/community); high school vocational education and industrial arts teachers and junior high school vocational teachers held the  most positive opinions; both teachers who had participated in career education seminars and workshops and teachers with some years of nonteaching work experience held more positive opinions than did others; all teacher specialist groups believed that their school should be (but was not, and generally could not be) utilizing community resources.

Part 1 contains annotations of 62 theses, conducted between 1912 and 1970, listed alphabetically by author, conducted mainly in the humanities and social sciences (anthropology, education, English, geography, history, library science, planning, political science, psychology, public administration, social work, and sociology) but considered relevant to adult education. Access to the theses in Part 1 is by way of an author index and a critical concepts index. Theses in Part 2 are not annotated but are  listed alphabetically by author under three headings: theses conducted within adult education at the Department of Educational Theory for the period 1965 to 1970; theses conducted within the school of social work between 1948 and 1968; and theses conducted within other disciplines between 1900 and 1969.

A summary offers comments on a predicted increase in the number of programs and on a predicted increase in practicum opportunities on the graduate level. Also predicted are an expansion of programs to off-campus locations and less formally structured programs with more interrelationship among instruction, research, and development. The second half of the publication is devoted to listing and briefly describing the programs, with course titles and names  of persons to whom inquiries should be directed.

The survey instrument was a self-analysis questionnaire in which firemen and fire chiefs assessed their own competence in fire fighting in 12 major categories. From this data, the needs for a program were assessed. The proposed program of the new fire fighting academy notes three components: (1) a regular program of intensive basic and advanced firemanship courses, (2) an extensive program of specialized courses and seminars taught both at  the academy and at local fire departments, and (3) support programs for local training including curriculum planning and development, development and refinement of media and related support services, instructor training, and student records management. These three responsibilities and cost estimates are discussed and assessed. Tables present the questionnaire data and cost estimates. Appendixes contain resolutions, memorials, tables on the quality of firemen training and skills, and a description of proposed academy facilities. (Author/JB)",

A program of supervised experience in hospital, clinic, and nursing home environments should be an integral part of instruction. The paramount objective of instruction is graduate employability. The syllabus' introduction contains recommendations regarding selection of teachers and students, suggests ancillary studies, and explains the use of the syllabus in developing a locally effective course of study. Section 1 focuses on orientation to the world of work (overview and  health care industry). Section 2 concentrates on the foundations of nurse assisting (part of nursing team, patient's environment, and patient). Section 3 covers the development of the nurse's assistant skills (anatomy, physiology, and by systems). Section 4 examines preparation for employment (occupational experience and job application). Each section is divided into individual units of study describing content, objectives, and teaching suggestions.

In Clark County schools, the two-and-one-half-year program development will provide: awareness of the world of work through the elementary level social science curriculum (curriculum guides are being prepared), greater understanding of various occupations through specially prepared films for sixth and seventh grades, and  self-awareness and identification with various careers for eighth grade students through a series of eight special two-day sessions of films and classroom activities. Other plans include profile counseling for intermediate and high school students to aid decision making, work experience correlated with course work for high school, and career directional counseling for students leaving school. A 27-member career education advisory committee has been established for the county. (MDW)",

It was developed by a group of experienced ABE practitioners to improve testing efforts in adult education programs in New Jersey. Part One, \"Testing,\" offers three areas of basic information: (1) improving educational programs through the use of standardized tests; (2) designing an effective testing program; and (3) testing English as a Second Language (ESL) students. Part Two, \"Test Reviews,\" provides a condensation of pertinent information and suggests specific tests for identifiable purposes. Twenty specific tests of four types are reviewed:  sceeening, achievement, diagnostic, and ESL. The test review format is intended to provide a structure for examining and evaluating tests which may be published in the future. The narrative section of the book was also constructed to be of value in the future, with the expectation that testing may be constantly changing as better instruments are developed. (Author/AJ)",

The design and conduct of the study is reviewed. The entire package of 15 INFOE clusters was given to students at each grade level for a given period of time.  Teachers completed a 10-item questionnaire, and students were pretested and posttested with a career awareness test.

It suggests that Occupational Institutes be formed in existing vocational schools to provide programs and resources for occupational, adult, and cooperative education. It recommends that community colleges assume responsbility for post-secondary career programs, under regional planning committees chaired by community college presidents. The report recommends the formation of an institute of occupational education to develop  materials for both teacher education and occupational programs, and incorporate the most recent findings about teaching and learning into teacher education methods. It recommends that the State Department of Education administer and serve occupational programs in all schools at all levels K-14, articulate its efforts with other appropriate agencies, and annually report on State manpower needs. The report finally recommends that the State Board of Education define and enforce minimum opportunity standards for occupational education in all communities. James J.

        "author":["Bhola, H. S."],
        "description":"The organization and mobilization for literacy work consist of two overlapping parts: organizational design and institution building. Organizational design, which covers both the technical and the social system, can be seen to include the following processes: analysis of the institution; invention of roles; invention of rules relating the roles into a purposeful collectivity; and creation of resources. With respect to these processes literacy organizers should: understand the relationship between policy and organization: design fresh roles which illustrate role interdependence; create rules which are flexible and which minimize organizational hierarchies and maximize organizational intelligence and role cooperation; and develop a sharpened awareness of the human aspects of  resources and their management. Institution building is relevant since, unlike organizations, organizing campaigns cannot provide the sustained enthusiasm necessary in literacy work. Institution building consists of: enabling the organization to adjust with and gain support from existing institutions; developing linkages, both formal and informal, with persons in those institutions; coping with the environment according to whether it is supportive, inhibitive, or neutral; and obtaining and utilizing resources. By being aware of these factors and of the possibilities that each promises, the literacy worker can increase the probability of institutional success. (JR)",

        "description":"The study employs stepwise regression analysis to relate work and total job satisfaction with the following measures: job characteristics as reflected by job dimension scores and work quality dimensions, both being based on the Position Analysis Questionnaire; job-related interests expressed by job incumbents, as measured by the Job Activity Preference Questionnaire; the match between incumbents' job characteristics and their expressed job interests; and general affect, measured by a response disposition scale. Data were obtained from 407 workers in 29 jobs (nine management and 20 non-management) in two telephone companies. Results showed significant correlation between the above measures and both satisfaction criteria, with consistently better predictions of work satisfaction  than total satisfaction. Also, correlations were higher and predictions better for management jobs than for non-management jobs. When response disposition was partialled out from work satisfaction, predictions did not change significantly. The results support the hypothesis that work content, personal interests, and the match between worker interests and job characteristics have a significant relationship to job satisfaction. Twenty statistical tables are included, as are four appendixes, which include biographical and questionnaire data, the Job Activity Preference Questionnaire, the Job Description Index, and the Response Disposition Questionnaire.

The objective of the study is to determine if commercial sources would be cost and training effective alternatives for current and peak Navy skill training requirements. The study was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of engineering, educational, and operations research personnel working for a period of 10 months. A limited number of Navy \"hard skills\" were selected for analysis as potential candidates for commercial contract training. Representative elements of the Department of Defense, other governmental training agencies, industry, and non-federal post-secondary training institutions were investigated in detail. This  report provides a sampling of the various training programs, management systems, technological advances, instructional techniques, and curriculum and financial management practices potentially applicable to the Navy training system. Conclusions describe some of the characteristics and trends in civilian training programs and indicate a generally favorable reception to the concept of commercial contract training. (Author/MDW)",

A 20-page introductory chapter presents background information, a general description of target groups, and suggestions for further research in mid-life redirection of careers. Part one, Mid-Life Redirectors: Sources and Opportunities, contains chapters on aspiration and dissatisfaction among workers, training potential among older workers, and using manpower forecasts in career redirection planning, and suggest that as people grow older they tend to seek movement from data- and materials-oriented jobs to people-oriented jobs. Part two, Manpower and Educational Programs: The Experience, contains chapters on government programs, employer-sponsored programs, union-sponsored  retraining programs, foreign programs, and special redirection efforts, and suggests that existing education and manpower programs provide many of the components necessary for career redirection. Part three, Synthesis and Implications for Policy, (1) summarizes the lessons from the literature, concluding that the potential for mid-life career redirection in the American work force is virtually untapped; and (2) makes recommendations for policymakers, sketching a spectrum of experimental pilot programs of various scale and coverage, intended to meet the shortcomings of existing programs.

Three developmental tryouts among Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps students refined the test and the program. The first was conducted with three students who worked with the materials individually in a small observation room, and on the basis of this tryout revisions were made to control the amount of exposure to the task prior to  instruction. The second tryout of the program was conducted with 25 students who worked through the materials in a large classroom; on the basis of this tryout the program was revised to include additional practice items, and a pretest was developed to assess student improvement as a result of instruction. The final tryout was conducted among 32 students working in a large classroom, and both the pretest and the AIC test were found to be acceptable. (JR)",

The Mountain-Plains Education and Economic Development Program, Inc., is a non-profit corporation chartered by the State of Montana and funded through the National Institute of Education for a five-year cycle of research and development under the designation Career Education Model Four. The model was designed both for specific applicability to a disadvantaged population in a six State target area (Nebraska, the Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho) and for general applicability across the full spectrum of education. The document traces the physical and procedural structure of the model; the underlying premise is that family-oriented career education, offered in a  residential setting and implemented through a comprehensive family-human development approach, represents an effective method of improving the employability, standard of living, and life satisfaction of a disadvantaged population. The authors offer statistics indicating the nature and scope of the program's effects to date, and conclude that Montain-Plains could serve as a complete humanistic model for higher education delivery. Program elements seen as applicable to higher education are its family base, its individualizing of instruction, its criterion-referenced testing, its methods of positive reinforcement, and its roots in societal reality and in human development philosophy.

It was hypothesized that children in racially integrated schools would make relatively fewer sortings based on race than their counterparts in racially homogeneous schools. Of additional interest was whether sorting patterns by sex, across racial lines, varied if the subject himself was included in the pairings, as distinguished from his pairing of others across racial lines. Results showed that white children, whether they attended racially integrated schools or all-white schools, had similar sorting patterns. Race and sex membership of students generally, had no significant effects on  their sorting patterns. (Author/PC)",

Ninety students were randomly assigned to either a mastery learning strategy in which all students were helped to attain the 85 percent criterion level or to one of two control classes. All students learned a three-unit sequence of programmed material in matrix arithmetic. The results of the study indicated that time-on-task-to-criterion and elapsed time-to-criterion are alterable to the extent that the ratio of the necessary time-on-to-criterion for the  fastest student to the slowest student on the final unit was approximately one to one and two-fifths.

Also investigated was whether or not these conditioning procedures were equally effective regardless of the sex of Ss. A total of 37 Euro-American children were randomly selected from kindergarten classes and were randomly divided into four groups. The experimental groups were presented with pairings of the color black and neutral words. The color black has been found to be an emotionally charged stimulus and functionally related to attitudes toward Afro-Americans. The control group received no treatment. As hypothesized, extinction of anti Afro-American attitudes was found to occur following exposure to the conditioning procedures. Contrary  to what was hypothesized, however, was the finding that females--but not males--demonstrated significantly more favorable attitudes toward Afro-Americans after having experienced the conditioning procedures.

Twelve males and twelve females worked on math problems in dyads for eleven performance pay trials in each of the six reward structure treatments. Although the math performance of females varied directly with both differential group rewarding and differential rewarding within groups as predicted, the performance of males did not. As indicated by the absence of interaction effects for both sexes, none of the six reward structure treatments were differentially effective in  strengthening performance independent of the main effects of the differential rewarding manipulations. Reported satisfaction with the pay allocation varied inversely with the performance-pay inequities which occurred between subjects as a result of the differential rewarding within groups manipulations. Reported overall satisfaction, however, was apparently unaffected by the inequities. (Author)",

In Experiment I, subjects were given either convergent thinking tasks, brainstorming tasks, or a control task. In Experiment II, half of the subjects received difficult tasks intended to induce failure while the other half received success tasks, with feedback or no feedback appropriate to each subject's task, provided. Response latencies on the MFF post tests were increased by convergent training to a lesser extent by the failure tasks.

The college students, who were the study subjects, were required to perform the task of solving anagrams under various modes of conditioning moderated by their previous conditioning related to internal-external expectancies. Due to the relatively short conditioning period, it was predicted that the existing expectancy set of subjects would assume major importance in performance, with feedback acting to confirm or disconfirm that expectancy set. Results supported the moderator status of subject locus of control and sex in performance situations that were dependent upon previously acquired  skills and especially associated with past reinforcement. External locus of control subjects were seen as more conditionable but as valuing reinforcement to a lesser degree than internals. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"\"COM-MAND\" represents the application of behavior modification concepts to the study, management, and control of behavior within a more traditional group therapy context. The emphasis of this system is on behavior, and is predicated on the learning/educational model. The therapist functions merely as an instructor, conducting a variety of behavioral training exercises. The client is taught to observe his own behavior, its consequences, and its effect upon others through the use of various prompts and instructions by the therapist/instructor, and he is directly and immediately reinforced when he does so. The system is presently being studied through use with inmate/addicts in a federal correctional institution. Details of the techniques used and hardware required, as well as an  evaluation overview of the program are presented. (Author/PC)",

Race, socio-economic status and school environment were designated independent variables. Analysis of the data indicated that: (1) the socio-economic status of parents does not influence their attitudes toward public education; (2) of the three racial groups, Black parents are more likely to have a more positive attitude toward public education than Indians and Whites; and (3) Blacks and Whites are more favorably disposed toward desegregated school than are Indians. It is suggested that a  comparative study be conducted relative to both parental attitudes toward public education and student achievement, since the two are most probably related. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"There are limitations inherent in a competency-based approach to counselor education, beginning with the assumption that it is impossible to specify all the competencies that a counselor needs or should have for any given setting. It follows from these assumptions that the designing of instruction cannot deal operationally with more than a limited range of important counselor capabilities. The author proposes a hierarchy of learning outcomes for counselor education based on a learning model by Robert Gagne. From early to later development these learning outcomes included: (1) motor skills; (2) intellectual skills; (3) verbal information; (4) cognitive strategies; and (5) attitude learning. The major portion of the paper provides the detailed analysis of this hierarchy and its  relevance to competency-based program development. (Author/PC)",

Every feedback trial was followed by a blank trial, a procedure that provided separate measures of Ss' ability to use hypotheses and test hypotheses. A S was considered to be \"using\" when his hypothesis inferred from a blank trial was consistent with his choice on the next feedback trial. Given that a S was \"using\", he was considered to be \"testing\" when he correctly reevaluated his hypothesis following a feedback trial (win-stay, lose-switch). Young children did not use hypotheses as often as older children, and those who did use hypotheses tended to be less successful than older children in testing for validity. In particular, the youngest  children were more likely to retain an incorrect hypothesis in spite of repeated negative feedback. Although younger children were less successful in reaching solution, those who did solve were likely to solve as fast as older children who solved. The usual dimensional preferences were not found: Children from each age group solved equally often using color, number, and shape dimensions. Experience with all three dimensions on the training tasks may have removed initial biases. (Author)",

In one list the new items were conceptually related to the original learning contexts, whereas in the other list they were not. The results supported the hypothesis that high-imagers would recall more words than low-imagers during acquisition, and that this effect would be most apparent when the learning context was pictorial. In addition, high-imagers were superior to low-imagers in  transferring both verbal and pictorial contextual information to related and unrelated instances. These findings implied that imagery ability is a strong determinant of ability to learn and transfer contextual information presented in verbal or pictorial modalities. (Author)",

The purpose of this book is to make available evaluation reports on the use of the life skills course conducted by a variety of organizations. Each evaluation study was based on a different experimental design and in some cases the evaluation was done by the implementer. The evaluation report on the course conducted by Mental Health/Alberta represents one of the most thorough psychometric evaluations of a life skills course to date. The reports in this book indicate some of the variety of applications being made of the life skills course: mental health, probation and housing. Since the purpose of evaluation is to provide information to decision makers whether they be  potential adopters, adapters or developers, it is appropriate that this book on life skills evaluation should include a plan for re-developing the life course.

Generally, the author believes that young people are less likely to be intimidated by the bureaucratic environment if they have become familiar with it in a variety of educational forms prior to their full-time entry into the labor force. Ideally, they will have acquired a wide range of experiences at all levels of a number of different kinds of organizations. The author believes that the most effective way to improve socialization to adulthood is to establish a network of federally funded, specially designed, educational work experiences  for young people prior to their full time entry into the labor force.

Ss in the experimental group were trained to imagine a noxious scene, then to shift to the image of a ringing bell. During the test phase, the word \"bell\" was used to reinforce over- or under-estimations of the diameters of circles. Two control groups received differential treatment relevant to the purpose of the study. Results of the present study failed to replicate those of the original study.

As is frequently the case in new areas of endeavor, overenthusiastic claims have been made for covert conditioning procedures, often based on poorly controlled experiments or clinical observations. Despite these setbacks, however, there appears to be research support for the notion that covert responses can be altered by punishment and reinforcement, and that covert processes do exert an influence on overt behavior. The problems with such support however, is that most of it comes from examination of case studies. It thus becomes apparent that the crucial test of covert conditioning must ultimately come from comparative  group studies using clinical problems as dependent variables. (Author/PC)",

Instruments used were the IAR and the Career Development Responsibility Scale (CDR). Principal components analyses were computed separately for each instrument from the intercorrelation matrix of the items of the respective instruments. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional student group of ninth graders. The study provides evidence that instruments designed to measure locus of control in domains other than academic achievement serve to increase the number of dimensions. Intercorrelations of the factor score derived from the IAR and CDR are sufficiently low as to question whether or not they are, in fact, measuring the same construct.  Developers of locus of control instruments should be aware that the balance of situations and sources of control items will affect the scores obtained from the instrument, and thus the relationship with other similar instruments.

The major conclusions of the research are as follows: (1) present strategies are not likely to remain economically and politically viable; (2) the shift toward greater reliance on a pure income strategy through transfer payments via the Social Security System should be carefully evaluated; (3) a strategic monitoring and assessment  process should be established and maintained on a continuing basis; and (4) there is a need to develop an alternative strategy for aging Americans and begin the transition from the present strategy.

The principal focus is the new administrative role as it functions in this process. The context is the Experience-Based Career Education model (Academy for Career Education) designed and implemented by Research for Better Schools, Inc. (RBS). Experience-based career education exposes the student to a variety of content, methodologies and viewpoints relating the diversity of options and alternatives of the social-economic scene. More importantly, the program invites the student to confront these issues through self-study, observation and on-site experiences. The RBS model consists of three components: (1) basic skills; (2)  student-economic-sector interactions; and (3) guidance and counseling. Academic skills and proficiencies are promoted through explication of their relationship to, and utility in, the world of work. Implementation of the program requires that the school leadership recognize and accept the need for change. RBS has developed a technology related to the definition, design, implementation and dissemination of experience-based career education. This technology stresses collaboration among RBS-intermediate units and/or county units or public school districts. The three-year study is currently in the replication stage, having been implemented initially in the Philadelphia schools. (Author/CJ)",

The project was initiated with the goal of having students determine the specific behavior goals for a given semester. Student staff in the residence halls acted as resource personnel and contact persons for the students involved in the project. The evaluation of the project showed numerous anticipated and unanticipated benefits to both students and staff. The program forced the students to examine their goals and objectives, and make them aware of their personal strengths and weaknesses. Generally, it improved their self-understanding and, through their  self-determined goals, made them more responsible for their own learning. In regard to student-staff relations, the program greatly improved the staff member's understanding of the individual participants, and, therefore, greatly improved relations on the floor.

The authors examined, for the time span 1967 to 1971, the extent to which women left (or entered) occupations which society viewed as \"acceptable\" for them, as well as the relationship between type of occupation and selected socioeconomic variables. The second problem examined is the changing demand for child care facilities.

Properly funded, conceptualized, planned, coordinated and implemented occupational experience programs are one of the great \"untapped resources\" for making education relevant for many students. Some type of occupational experience program should be an integral part of every school system in the nation. (Author/PC)",

In this study, a rapprochement was attempted between two theoretical approaches using procedures recommended by Cronbach and Meehl (1955). First, a construct of creativity was formulated, then measures were explicated, and finally, a construct validation of these measures was attempted. Results indicated two possible construct reformulations, a one-factor versus a three factor interpretation. To resolve this dilemma, more universally accepted criterion measures appear to have the most promise for accurately identifying creative talent. (Author)",

        "description":"This study examines four hypotheses concerning the nature of fear of success (FOS). Data were gathered in two stages. First, respondents in a large sample survey of metropolitan Detroit area residents were asked to tell a Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) story. In the second stage, white currently-married females aged 18 to 56 whose households were included in the first sample were re-interviewed six months to a year later. Comparative results suggest that the presence of FOS was strongly related to story length. Further, the hostility in FOS stories may represent free-floating anger. The study concludes that parents who are traditional, and who regard competition as inappropriate for females, seem more likely to rear daughters who regard achievement as inappropriate or  threatening. FOS does not seem to be related to the inhibition of achievement activity but rather to high-achieving behavior, suggesting the need for further exploration of environment factors. (Author/BW)",

The counselor is a staff developer for the teachers, a community resource person, and an advocate for students in police court procedures. The psychologist is a staff developer for special techniques, a definer of individualized curricula for students, and an interpreter of test results. Community resources are an integral part of the school. Socially maladjusted youth are helped to build self-esteem, a sense of self-worth and of interdependence. Group counseling and group projects serve as the basis for the school curriculum. The paper also discusses financial support for the alternative school, job-training programs and various details related to  curriculum development. Students in the redefined setting proved increasingly more socially adjusted, and have finished high school and taken further training. The success of this alternative school structure is measured by a 90 percent attendance rating and by lack of major discipline problems within the school. (Author/BW)",

Q. One hundred and thirty-four seventh grade students served as subjects. The principal factors method of factor analysis was used. Resulting data supported the set of hypotheses under investigation. The results of this study suggest that examination and reporting of the Brookover Scale as  three subscales could serve to strengthen the interpretation of that variation in school achievement attributable to general academic seld-concept. To the extent that academic self-concept is an affective consequence of the teaching-learning process and is an inhibitor of school achievement, the implications for education concerning multiple factors in the ASC construct are numerous.

The procedure involved an initial 5-minute interview, a 20-30 minute instructional period and a final 5-minute interview. Comparative results revealed that each instructional procedure was equally effective in influencing the dependent variable from the pretest to posttest phases.

The person's ability to engage in sustained cooperative endeavors depends upon a series of competencies. Successful cooperation depends upon the person having an integrated and coherent identity, directionality, a clear preception of interdependence, trust, and ability to accept the perspective of others. Persons who are not socialized into these competencies are likely to engage in abusive drug use patterns and to be unable to solve interpersonal problems.

It suggests some possible implications for social planning and policy in response to the existence of these families. The single parent system, represented in the person of the single parent mother has many of the same social and psychological characteristics of two-parent families. Among these, the most common seems to focus on financial stress, emotional stress caused by role conflict, and problems caused by public opinion and attitudes. Virtually no literature was found in the general area of the single parent father. Based on a recent research study of 100 single parents, it was found that even in the most adaptive situations there may  still exist within the parent subtle feelings of guilt, rejection, and stress which may be communicated, no matter how subtly, to the child. The author suggests change in social policy which should include improvements in child care, work structure, research projects on the single parent, legislation, and crisis intervention.

For each model, subjects were then asked whether there was any individual he or she associated with that model, and if so, the strength of that association. The highly significant results provided strong support for the hypotheses that: (1) a positive correlation exists between evaluations of a stimulus person and another individual with whom he associates that person, (2) the magnitude of this correlation  increases with strength of association, and (3) evaluations of a stimulus person are more open to change when there is no associated other.

In many community colleges Student Development Specialists are offering group experiences for credit, usually in the Psychology discipline. In a \"tandem\" the Student Development Specialist teaching the group experience and another instructor teaching in another discipline build two interlocking courses. Both instructors teach in both; the same students are registered in both; the classes are taught in back-to-back time slots i.e. in tandem.  Thus, the connection between disciplines is made available for students to grasp, helping them to better integrate the totality of their educational experience. (Author)",

The two communication tasks were administered to all subjects twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of the semester. For the experimental group, one pre- and one post-counseling tape were rated with the accurate empathy scale. This group was also rated as to counseling performance with the Supervisory Rating Scale. The results indicated that the  inter-rater reliability of both communications tasks were quite high, suggesting that consistent, independent ratings can be obtained with the rating scale. The construct validity of adaptability was not established, as it did not strongly relate to a similar construct of empathy nor was it predictive of measures of counseling skill. (Author/PC)",

        "author":["Mezei, Louis L."],
        "description":"Thirteen groups of 11-19 year old boys, stratified by age, race, socio-economic class, and attendance of racially segregated or integrated schools served as subjects (N=185). Measures of the relative importance of the past, present, and future were derived from a story completion and story productions. Attitudes toward the three time divisions were measured by seven semantic differential scales, by the feeling tone of past and future events, and by time machine travel preferences. Measures of past and future extension were obtained by computing the time span of personal events. Only two developmental effects appeared. The personal past extended with increasing age, and a tendency to use all three time divisions on the importance measures appeared at or above the age of 14. All  groups, except a black college age group, were optimistic about the present and the future. There were no differences between the relative importance and extension measures, but blacks showed a tendency to evaluate the past as worse than whites. Comparisons of middle class whites with lower class blacks showed a greater use of past and future on the past by whites. Attendance of segregated or integrated schools did not appear to influence the time perspective variables. (Author)",

        "description":"Decision theoretic testing was used to explore whether junior high students could improve their tendencies to make realistic assessments of what they knew. In nine sessions over a period of three weeks, 49 seventh graders used computer terminals to record probability values in the form of logarithmic equivalents for each alternative in a randomized set of multiple-choice math problems. Students were assigned to three treatment groups. One worked individually, one worked individually with feedback from the computer, and the third group worked as teams with feedback from the computer. Analysis of the training sessions and posttests revealed differences in the stability of assessment behaviors but a common tendency to be overconfident, to be less realistic as problems become more  difficult, and to distort the value of one's knowledge when working as teams. Realism training was most effective when explicit feedback was provided and the achievement level was low. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"This study focused upon whether there was a difference in the perception by peers of the target child in a classroom discipline situation after approval-focused desists (e.g., \"June, I don't like children who talk without permission.\") and task-focused desists (e.g., \"Jane, You will not finish your reading if you continue to talk.\"). Thirty-two eighth-grade students were assigned to either an approval-focused or task-focused treatment group. Inferences were made about the personality traits of the target of the desists and the teacher administering the desists, when the amount of information available was severly limited. Both the target and the teacher of the approval-focused desists were rated as having less desirable personality traits than when task-focused desists were used.  These findings supported the discounting principle of attribution theory. The hypotheses that children hearing the approval-focused desists would be more confident of their ratings than those hearing the task-focused desists were not supported. The author discusses limitations of the study. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"Sixty kindergarten, 60 second-grade, and 60 fourth-grade students performed several memory tasks under one of six conditions. The conditions differed as to the method of presentation of information. The study was focused on developmental changes in children's use of verbal, nonverbal, and spatial-positional cues for memory. The results, in general, showed consistent trends suggestive of a developmental change in representational ability; such that younger children tend to rely on visual cues and older children tend to rely on verbal cues to retain information. Children in all grades performed better when both visual and verbal cues were available and demonstrated an ability to utilize spatial-positional cues for retention. (Author)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to estimate, empirically, the quality of published experimental research in the fields of counseling and counselor education and to determine whether there has been an improvement over time of that quality. The sample of 152 studies was randomly chosen from the experimental studies published from 1962 through 1973 in the three major counseling and counselor education journals. Assessment of the reporting and methodology of the studies was done using the Evaluation Instrument Methodology (EIEM). Results showed that the quality of reporting was quite adequate in the sample studies, while the quality of experimental methodology was barely mediocre. Despite the trend of increasing quality, the author warns that the research in these fields must be viewed  critically. The comment that poorly formulated research is not only worthless but deceptive should be heeded by counseling researchers, editors, and research consumers in an effort to upgrade the profession's research, protect future clients and trainees, and promote better counseling, service and training.

The study also analyzed the maternity leave requirements of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC), and sought to determine which variables were associated with compliance with the Supreme Court ruling and the EEOC regulations. Interviews and surveys of school district personnel in the nation's 11 largest school districts determined maternity leave policies in effect for the 1974-75 school year. This data indicated that all the school districts complied with those EEOC regulations which were supported by the Supreme Court. The ideal school district, in terms of Total Compliance, was found to be: (1)  affiliated with an NEA bargaining agent; (2) of low or medium teacher size; (3) Southern; and (4) with few racial minorities on the school board.
