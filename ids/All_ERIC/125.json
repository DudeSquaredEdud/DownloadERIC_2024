        "description":"In organizational settings, research has shown the relationship of task characteristics to attitudes and motivation. This study examines the external validity of the task characteristic-outcome relationship in an educational setting. Subjects were 206 undergraduate psychology students. They were given an inventory of seven task characteristics such as Task Identity, Skill Variety and Autonomy. Using a seven-point scale, they described the extent to which they experienced each one while in school. It was found that the chosen task characteristics are, in general, negatively related to absenteeism and physical and psychological stress. They are also positively related to satisfaction and the desire to stay in school while being completely unrelated to grade point average. According  to the canonical correlation analysis, the outcomes best predicted by this set of task characteristics are satisfaction and the desire to stay in school. Task Significance is the task characteristic which is most important to the prediction of these outcomes. (Author/BP)",

The data were collected by administering a questionnaire to Parents Without Partners chapters in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area and the Norfolk-Hampton, Virginia metropolitan area in the spring and summer of 1973. The completed sample of 277 contained middle class, female, and White biases. While not a prior hypothesis, it was found that females perceived themselves as experiencing greater stress than males. Other results from the hypotheses tested were: (1) Social participation - males participated socially more than females and experienced less stress, (2) Open or closed  mindedness - females' stress but not males' was lessened by being more open minded, (3) Sexual permissiveness - males were more sexually permissive than females, but for both groups, the higher the sexual permissiveness, the lower the stress, (4) Occupational status - males perceived less stress with higher occupational statuses, (5) Orientation to Change - females more tolerant of change in the larger society perceived much less stress; for males there was no relationship. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed and implications for future research explored. (Author)",

In discussing dynamic models, one thrust of our comments is to identify the sorts of process features about which assumptions must be made in order to convert a static theory about stage connections (the sort of specification commonly presented in life-span psychology) into a dynamic model. A second focus of our discussion concerns inverse problems; how to utilize a model formulation so that the stage linkage structure may be recovered from survey data of the kind  collected by developmental psychologists.

In one experiment, 45 male, female, or mixed-sex pairs of subjects discussed a legal case, each pair seated first five feet apart and then almost touching. All subjects reacted more negatively when crowded with males than with females. In a second experiment 15 male and 15 female subjects gave creative uses for objects while seated close to or far from a mixed-sex pair of confederates. Subjects shifted eye contact from male to female when close, again regardless of their own sex. Findings suggest that in crowding, sex of partner may be more important than sex of self. (Author)",

It is also designed for students in pre-service education programs who have had previous exposure to career development theories and to sources of educational-occupational information. The Module assumes that the participant is not familiar with the area of futurism (other than through exposure to the first Module in this series, \"Imaging Futuristic Career Guidance Goals,\" which is a pre-requisite for this Module) and, therefore, is designed to provide an orientation to the process of futurizing career guidance practices. This module emphasizes that futurizing need not require a total program change. It is possible to use futures  planning techniques and redesign these for individuals to use in the career planning process. Alternately, existing career guidance practices can be redesigned to make them more futuristic. In addition to these areas, the Module emphasizes developing skills in using futures planning techniques, and in using multiple sources of information to generate futuristic career guidance practices.

A six-stage model for change is presented, with each stage outlined in some detail. Both general and specific tactical advice are offered.

The programs use a diagnostic/prescriptive approach. This begins with diagnostic testing of all students, followed by the prescription of an individualized learning program for each student. To coordinate the extensive individual programs, an effective management system is necessary; each successful California Demonstration Program has a management system developed at the school site to meet the specific needs of the individual school population. Examples of some of the record keeping and management materials developed at the De Anza Junior High School Reading  Center are included. The role and responsibilities of the project director are also discussed. (AA)",

Results of the analyses suggested that the series provided a well-balanced selection of genres and facilitated the mechanics of teacher/pupil interaction within the specific skill lessons.

Positive approaches to poetry involve teaching poetry as a natural form of language, avoiding the forced analysis of poetry, selecting poetry which is meaningful for pupils, and avoiding testing pupils on poetry they have read. Additionally, an invaluable way to encourage the enjoyment of poetry is to teach pupils to write their own poems. Collaborative poems may be written  initially, as a means of overcoming pupil resistance to writing poetry; such poems may be typed and placed in a looseleaf notebook for pupils to read. Other types of poetry writing which appeal to pupils include the writing of blank verse, cinquains, haiku, couplets, and limericks. The poetry the children write can then become excellent reading material. (GW)",

Second, increase students' depth of comprehension by triggering discussion of materials they have read with questions which call for them to make inferences from--and evaluations of--that material. Third, provide planned exercises in listening over a sustained period of time. Fourth, provide cloze exercises and discuss with students who are low achievers the logic behind the choices of words that were made to fill in the blanks. Fifth, have students make mental images as they read. Sixth, provide planned instructional activities which  help students understand connectives and how they influence meaning. (MB)",

Among the results was the finding that children can and do act on incoming information in ways similar to adults.

Such procedures are consistent with the idea that there are functional competencies which change with the reading task. Adaptive assessment takes into account that a lack of communication between author and reader may result from the reader's lack of knowledge or strategies for reconstructing the message or from the author's use of a style that is unfamiliar to the reader. Through an analysis of miscues--oral reading responses that deviate from the expected responses--it is possible to examine a reader's ability to reconstruct an author's message. A good way to clarify the idea of functional competency is to  examine various types of reading materials encountered by high school students, including narrative writing, expository writing, and job-related reading materials. Job-related reading tasks have their own specific readability factors. To determine a student's ability to read in job-related situtations, a teacher may sample the person's reading of such materials as help-wanted advertisements, application forms, and typical business invoices.

In three separate open-house sessions, parents observed staff members using reading materials, worked with their own children under staff guidance, and made reading games and activities geared to the needs of their children. To provide parents with ideas for fostering reading at home, staff members prepared handbooks of simple reading games and activities which parents could make at home and use with their children.

Analyses confirmed that context-dependent words (past tense verbs, prepositions, functors), took longer to learn than did context-free words (nouns, adjectives). However, providing a sentence context did not make it easier to learn either word class. Unlike readers, prereaders had substantial difficulty learning the words, particularly context-dependent words, because prereaders failed to recognize these words as units in  their language.

In the pilot project for the program, 25 college students first met on campus for 18 hours of training in the techniques of programed tutoring, including rehearsal of all aspects of the tutoring. Each student was then assigned three first-grade and second-grade children who were having difficulty learning to read; the children were tutored in 15-minute sessions for the rest of the semester. Informal evaluation by the elementary school teachers and  principal indicated that the children's reading achievement was markedly accelerated. The college students found the course a valuable introduction to classroom teaching, and the university noted an increase in favorable public relations with the local schools and with the community. Popularity of the course with the college students and requests by elementary school personnel for more tutors have led to the expansion of the program.

Scores on the Sequential Tests of Educational Progress (STEP) at the end of the third grade were used as a criterion of final reading achievement. Among the results were the findings that class size is virtually nonpredictive of reading achievement; that only one of the 517 sampled students was enrolled in classes of 20 or fewer students for three consecutive years; and that, when \"small\" was defined as less than the median  class size for each of the three years, there was a slight trend toward lower STEP scores in the small classes, reflecting IQ differences associated with the effects of the special education programs in Madison.

This paper describes the results of the analysis, examines the programs' current designs, and recommends changes for improving instructional effectiveness. Program examination, focusing on reading skills and teaching techniques, consisted of an analysis of every lesson. Results of the analysis suggest that major reading programs fail to provide consistently for instructional effectiveness and seriously neglect some valued areas of reading skill, particularly, functional literacy skills in nonfiction prose. The paPer points out that abundant  research evidence indicates that the instructional variables included in the analysis do facilitate learning. Reasons for the programs' failure to provide materials and procedures that adequately use these techniques are explored in the paper, which concludes that the procedures used in this study, if used by school systems to analyze reading programs, could provide a rational basis for text selection and could reveal areas needing augmentation by teachers.

Three methods of instruction were tested: One group was instructed with an auditory method; the second group was instructed with an auditory-visual method; and the third group practiced the basic set of sound/letter associations but was given no formal instruction in blending. The results indicated that training with both the auditory-visual method and the auditory method was significantly more effective on children's ability to pronounce the list of synthetic words than was practice on sounds and letters. It also showed that there were no differences in children's ability to blend stop or continuant sounds at the beginnings or ends  of words. Several implications were discussed for teaching blending.

        "description":"Research related to methods for building competency in spelling has yielded information about three areas of teaching: word selection, generalizations to be taught, and application of spelling skills to writing. Research on word selection indicates that teachers should choose basic, high-frequency words for children to learn to spell, giving special attention to words which are persistently misspelled. The teaching of generalizations should be taught in conjunction with the use of whole-word techniques. Finally, research indicates that it is essential to teach spelling in conjunction with functional writing. Research related to methods for building handwriting skills deals with two major controversial areas: manuscript and cursive writing and the achievement of legibility.  Research indicates that, for some students, a shift from cursive writing back to manuscript writing should be encouraged beyond grade six. Although considerable research has been directed toward identifying factors affecting legibility of handwriting, researchers have failed to find agreement on such factors. The paper includes bibliographies of references on spelling and handwriting. (GW)",

It was found that, using a true-false recognition test, proportion correct was higher and reaction time shorter on inferred information than on information that was actually presented. This was the case for both linear orderings (e.g., &quot;A is better that B. B is better than C.&quot;) and set inclusion relations (e.g., &quot;All A are B. All B are C.&quot;) This strongly indicates that, when learning a paragraph describing either of these types of ordered information, subjects make and store inferences as an integral part of the reading process. Contrasted with these recognition results, recall of inferences was found to be very poor for both types of  relation. Training subjects in such a way as to lead them to expect a recall test did not improve their recall of inferences. This kind of difference between recall and recognition performance is often interpreted as an indication that, although the information in question is stored, it is not easily retrievable. Further research is necessary to determine if this is the case in the above experiments. (Author)",

Morality in testing involves observing the rights of those being tested, using valid tests, and using test findings in a positive and  sophisticated manner. A final maxim is that those in the testing field are in a state of disarray. Forty-four institutions in New York, when asked what diagnostic or prescriptive tests they used with educationally disadvantaged students, listed more than 30. The most frequently cited test was \"own\" test, a self-developed test, used by 17 of the 44 schools. Such disarray indicates a need for more information-sharing among those in the field of testing.

The percentage of adults in the United States reported to be literate varied widely from study to study. In the second section, the author explores various definitions of literacy. Literacy has been defined as the ability to respond appropriately to all possible reading tasks, as the presence of reading skills necessary to enable persons to function effectively in society, and as the level of achievement attained by the average child by the beginning of fourth grade. Some researchers have attempted to  define \"functional literacy,\" which connotes reading for a purpose related in some way to social utility. The author concludes that literacy is related to specific tasks and specific contexts and that there can be no universal definition of literacy. In the United States, the minimum level of reading ability required for full participation in the social and economic life of the nation appears to be around the eleventh grade level. (GW)",

One of these is the language of propositions (or the essayist technique), which has been discussed by Olson; the other is the language of poetry. These two forms differ in their implied relation to speech. Olson stresses the gulf between speech and the language of propositions; poetry, on the other hand, might be regarded as the apotheosis of speech, retaining as part of its formal organization the device of rhythm, along with other ways of  creating a patterned disposition of phonetic features that have no visual representation on the printed page. Still, the language of poetry is not that of speech; it requires the kind of attention to text that is not required in speech or in ordinary language. (AA)",

The paper explores the increased use of television--including cable television, videotape recorders, and computers--and also discusses drawbacks to the use of technological devices, such as the attempt to replace people by self-operated media, the difficulty of diagnosis for individual needs and of diagnosis of learning disabilities, faculty fears and reluctance, and cost.

A self-paced course which has proved successful at Georgia Institute of Technology consists of a sequence of seven units--the thesis, the pattern of an essay, the development of an argument, writing to a reader, evidence to support a thesis, the use of repetition, and building a conclusion. These units, focused on the reader's needs, contain a description of the concept being taught, explanations of its necessity and its relationship to previous units, an example of the  concept properly applied, and a self-test. In addition to completing the self-paced units, each student writes four essays of gradually increasing length, outside of class and upon completion of specific units.

Subjects were asked to record their reactions to the individual speakers with regard to their intelligence, friendliness, and desirability as friends. Data revealed that all groups rated the white standard English variation most  positively. Even the speakers of the other variations in question, black nonstandard English and Spanish-influenced English, expressed a negative evaluation of their own dialects. Findings suggest that language is, indeed, a function in the value system of adolescents. (KS)",

The author tells how she arranged to teach a short-story course in a local high school and how she organized the course around small-group and individual activities through the use of activity cards. Student earned points for each activity completed; course grades were based on the total number of points earned. The paper reports many of the classroom activities employed, including discussing short-story elements, writing stories based on pictures, enacting key scenes from stories, taping characters' dialogue, and presenting oral book reports. Films were used to supplement the short stories; a collection of adolescent novels was  provided to stimulate outside reading. Benefits which the author gained from the experience included increased credibility with her college students and with teachers in inservice programs, as well as a renewed realization of the importance of such aspects of teaching as variety, flexibility, and involvement of students in what goes on in the classroom. The author urges other college methods teachers to make a similar trip back to the secondary classroom. (GW)",

Students first visit a local business, store, or institution with which they are familiar and write an observation report of the visit; they then return to the place of observation and interview at least one person there. At this point, the students are ready to choose a subject for a research paper about some aspect of their observations. A series of assignments is used to help students gather and evaluate information from secondary sources, formulate a thesis, and organize, write, and evaluate their papers. Direct teaching is done in  response to felt needs. Before the teacher evaluates the papers, the class devises evaluation criteria, and students read and evaluate each other's papers and hold follow-up conferences. This method helps students realize that, in the alien academic world, their own eyes and ears can be capable research tools. (GW)",

Informal observations suggested that the drawings of the experimental group were &quot;more imaginative&quot; than those of the control and that the younger  children tended to focus on the tree, while the older children focused on a figure of a person.

        "description":"It is regularly claimed that the quality of writing done by college freshmen is declining. This study attempted, through the use of questionnaires and interviews, to determine what specific freshman writing problems English teaching assistants and English professors at the University of Texas viewed as most serious. Questionnaire results showed serious concern for the lack of precision and detail in student writing, for failure to proofread and revise, for failure to use transitions, and for failure to organize information effectively. In the interviews, professors stressed the importance of students using a personal voice in their writing and the importance of students writing for their peers. Professors also argued that a greater amount of writing should be done by high school  students even if all the writing were not graded by the teacher. (Author/AA)",

Must such humanistic aims be relinquished if the harsh realities in contemporary academe force us to take on such mundane chores as teaching business communications? This paper concludes that much teaching activity for any course is more journeywork than humanistic endeavor and that teaching any course can become mere journeywork. But it also concludes that humanism is more an approach to life than a selection of courses and that we can live and demonstrate humanistic values through teaching virtually any course in the curriculum if we are  sufficiently determined and imaginative.

The stage of writing a first draft involves unconscious, personal, irrational, intuitive writing which may be called &quot;writing for the left hand,&quot; since it involves the type of mental activity controlled by the right hemisphere of the brain. The stage of revising the first draft involves conscious, impersonal, rational, and intellectual writing, or &quot;writing for the right hand.&quot; The author notes that most of the writing that students in public schools engage in, as confirmed by recent research, is writing for the right hand, and that, although this is an important type of  writing, we should try to engage students in more expressive and poetic writing activities. The author urges teachers not to compare the work of one pupil with that of another; to give praise, not criticism; to stress the process of writing; and to encourage writing from the heart. The paper offers guidelines for getting students started writing and concludes with prewriting, writing, and rewriting activities for seven classroom assignments. (GW)",

Results showed that the only standardized figure acceptable for comparing newspapers of different size and publication frequency is that of per-subscriber net income; none of the other tested standardized measurements of income or expense is acceptable as a comparison figure. For the study on city editors' knowledge about their audiences, a questionnaire was sent to the city editors of 375 dailies. Responses were  received from 35% of the editors. Analysis showed that more than 90% of the responding editors felt that additional knowledge about readers would help their effectiveness as editors. Quesionnaire analysis also showed that the city editor most aware of reader characteristics worked on a paper of more than 50,000 circulation, was 35 years old or younger, had been city editor three years or less, and had a college degree in journalism.

        "description":"In this study, which involved 87 freshman English students at Brigham Young University, the variety of practice items and the strategy of Practice (convergent or divergent) were systematically varied, in order to assess their effects on a rule-finding task. The task was presented in an expository fashion, using both rules and practice, and in a discovery format, using practice only. Previous research indicates that the discovery mode facilitates transfer, but not retention, of knowledge. Conversely, it has been found that the expository mode facilitates retention but impedes transfer. Data collected in this study reveal that the amount and tyPe of rule divergence, not the mode of presentation, are the crucial factors in Producing transfer of learning. Thus, the expository mode of  presentation can be just as effective in producing transfer learning as is the discovery mode, if divergence in the Practice strategy is provided. Likewise, the performance levels attained with both modes of presentation are greatly reduced if the degree of practice-strategy divergence is restricted. (Author/KS)",

Yet such knowledge is invaluable for many reasons. Graduate students can become more accurate critics of their own writing, if they can make use of some of the tools of linguistic or rhetorical analysis. They can become more skillful literary critics and better teachers of both literature and writing. Furthermore, fully one-half of the teaching jobs currently available at the college level include the teaching of composition; therefore, at least one-half of the English doctoral students who plan to teach in four-year colleges and universities ought to have some  formal instruction in composition. The paper lists the aims of a graduate concentration in composition, both for M.A. and Ph.D. candidates, and makes a few general suggestions for curriculum requirements for a minor or major in composition. Finally, the paper examines ways in which staffing can be provided for such programs and discusses other resources which the programs might draw on. (GW)",

        "description":"The Talk-Write method of teaching college composition, developed by Robert Zoellner, can be adapted for use in secondary and upper elementary classrooms. The method, which focuses on the process of writing, involves teaming students in pairs. One student then talks out a composition, sentence by sentence, while the partner asks questions to draw out the talker/writer and to clarify confusing points of the narrative. The developing composition is written on the chalkboard or on a large piece of paper taped to the wall. When the composition is complete, the teammates exchange roles as talker/writer and questioner. During the process, students can walk around the room, viewing and commenting on each other's work. The effectiveness of the Talk-Write method is due to its employment of  the principles of operant conditioning: concentration is on the student, rather than on the paper; the behavior leading to the final desired result is constantly reinforced; the talking student freely supplies the initial material for the learning sequence; the writer gets immediate help and reinforcement; there is a high frequency of response; there are numerous intermediate steps leading to the final specification; and the assigned task is brief.

The results suggest that Jimmy Carter projected several images throughout the debates. The nervous Carter in debate one became the aggressive, but often gentle, Carter of debate two and, finally, the cautious and again  tense Carter of debate three. According to the analysis, Gerald Ford projected a steady and consistent, if somewhat slow and ponderous, image, an image of knowledge, competence, and strength, but hardly one of dynamism and warmth.

An analysis of the problems of communication research reveals that growth in the field is slow, due to such factors as lack of professionally trained researchers, absence of financial, human, and physical facilities to support research programs, and delayed recognition of the value of communication research, by public and private sectors and by the mass media themselves. Examination of three areas of research--media infrastructure studies, studies of communicators and receivers of messages, and developmental-type studies--indicates that too much emphasis has been placed on audience studies and that the developmental problem area has been neglected. Poor methodology, poorly  written reports, and poor dissemination of findings compound the problems in studies conducted. It is suggested that priorities be reorganized to focus future research on interdisciplinary work of both national and multinational scopes. In addition, it is recommended that attention be directed toward developmental problems, so that research findings can be used in accelerating the urbanization and modernization of the Asian region.

Subjects, 116 18- or 19-year-old students at Purdue University, completed semantic differential forms, before and after the debate, which rated the concepts of ideal president, Ford as president, Carter as president, Ford as a television performer, and Carter as a television performer. About half the subjects were assigned to watch the debate, while the other students were free to watch as much or as little as they wished. Findings show that the candidates' television-image ratings showed the most change; following the debate, Ford's ratings moved closer to the ideal and Carter's moved farther  away, and both candidates were rated as having much less warmth. The greatest differences between Ford and Carter on presidential image occurred on the wise, experienced, fair, calm, and liberal scales, with Carter perceived more negatively (except for liberal, which depended on the political views of the respondent for positive or negative weight).

The following topics are addressed: the definition of public business; the components of a free press; the relationship between open meetings, community expertise, and civic consciousness; and protection against wrongdoing, fraud, and misrepresentation. In addition, the conflict between the right to know and the right to privacy, secrecy and the public welfare, and governmental secrecy in general are discussed. Analysis of the Michigan law of 1976 includes treatment of the historical underpinnings of the law, as well as discussion of relevant case law and media response. It is concluded that the actual application of the Michigan  open-meetings law can bring about greater access to public deliberations. In the face of ever-changing case law, however, it is evident that the open-meetings law is not without exception. (KS)",

        "description":"Among the many philosophic insights offered by Richard M. Weaver, rhetorical scholars have perhaps been most intrigued by his establishment of circumstance and definition as morally dichotomous sources of argument. Challenging Weaver's assumption that the identification of a rhetor's fact or genus preferences supplies necessary insights into the speaker's philosophy, this essay proposes further tests for a value-based criticism of argument. Rhetorical critics should judge (1) the morality of the rhetor's terms, (2) the morality of his or her ordering of them, (3) the validity of their application, and (4) the underlying reasons which motivated their selection.

This discussion focuses on practices in and attitudes toward speech training in the advertising industry. Information was gleaned from interviews with the executives of the 25 largest advertising agencies in American--most of those questioned were directors of personnel. A majority of this group felt that the quality of speech and communication skills had deteriorated over the past ten years and cited reasons such as the failure of schools to provide adequate training, increased television viewing, and so on. Among the factors contributing to executives' heightened concern for communication competence were recession in business, the  rise of consumerism, the establishment of Affirmative Action hiring programs, and the electronic future. A number of training programs were used: periodic classes over a period of time, in-depth &quot;crash&quot; seminars which last two or three days, and commercial programs such as &quot;Communispond.&quot; A majority of the speech consultants involved in these programs also felt that change should be instituted in the teaching of speech in school.

This paper suggests diverse ways in which ethnocentrism and the desire to increase social distance may be realized on several linguistic levels. Specifically, it is suggested that different intensities of ethnocentrism and the extent to which one desires to increase social distance are realized by different types of variation in phonology, syntax, semantics, discourse structure, and idiomatic expression. The various types of linguistic diversity, as influenced by different degrees of ethoncentrism, are discussed in relation to three communicative distances:  indifference, avoidance, and disparagement.

Two features are central to the amendment: the student may inspect nearly every school record that concerns him or her, and the school is prohibited from divulging most aspects of a student's record to anyone without acquiring parental permission. Special attention is given to initial reaction to the law; to the problem caused by the amendment, concerning recommendation letters; and to interpretation of the wording of the bill. Student response to the legislation, regulations concerning the Buckley Amendment, and the outcome of public hearings are also examined. It is concluded that, although potential pitfalls surround the bill, it  still provides students with access that, only a few years before, would have been unthinkable. (KS)",

Secondly, if the connection between specific rewards and performance of various teaching tasks can be specified, the way that collective bargaining shifts emphases from task to task can be studied. Eight types of rewards are available to teachers, including: 1) wages, salaries, and fringe benefits; 2) stable and comfortable working conditions; 3) advancement possibilities; 4) recognition for one's work; 5) a sense of personal competence; 6) a sense of stimulation and personal growth; 7) satisfying interpersonal relationships in the work environment; 8) a sense that one's work is meaningful or important to society.  Only those rewards that are compensations for work performed are directly controlled by collective bargaining agreements. The four major functional tasks required of teachers are associated with the above rewards. These tasks include: 1) supervision of students at school; 2) socialization and accultration of students; 3) instruction of students in mental, physical, and social skills; and 4) certification of students' learning accomplishment or lack of accomplishment. Collective bargaining will most likely focus attention on the certification activities of teachers. (Author/JG)",

The study compared principals from unionized and nonunionized school districts in Illinois; its intent was to determine specific role changes and effects upon principals as a result of collective bargaining. Findings of the study indicated that there was no significant relationship between bargaining and the rules orientation, role ambiguity, or locus of factors controlling principals' behavior. Grounding educational research in the literature on bargaining in the private sector is faulty, because some of the most important effects of collective bargaining may be relatively insignificant in education. Therefore  principals would be expected to experience less impact than industrial foremen or supervisors. In addition to differences in the effects of collective bargaining, education and the private sector differ in their approach to bargaining. Although the role of principals may be more rigorously prescribed in districts with collective bargaining, this may merely represent the institutionalization of informal structures into formal ones.

Learner data tentatively revealed what characteristics of pictures affected the deployment of third-grade children's visual attention. Society data provided increased awareness of the structure and direction of a group of mothers' goals for their infants. Subject-matter data from an expert judge provided useful suggestions for the organization of content for a preschool motor curriculum. In each of these studies, polynomial conjoint scaling, a form of multidimensional scaling, reduced a complex matrix of data to a simple visual display that was useful to the  curriculum developer in his decision-making process.

Each of these approaches is illustrated with &quot;snapshot&quot; descriptions of promising practices from Colorado, Arizona, and Illinois. Projects described are 1) a Colorado Department of Education program to teach teachers how to plan interdisciplinary units of instruction; 2) a districtwide project in the Amphitheater District of Tucson, Arizona, to implement an innovative approach for accommodating a variety of learning styles; and 3) a project in Urbana, Illinois, in which a total faculty participated in reorganizing an elementary school in order to personalize learning and  improve the pupils' achievement. The Colorado concept of accountability, described as a &quot;school improvement process,&quot; is briefly contrasted with approaches in other states. The Colorado process stresses priority setting and teacher involvement in planning processes. (Author)",

This question is addressed through a cross-sectional analysis of the choice decisions made by 192 school districts in Kentucky. A conceptual model that evaluates the trade-off between educational service expenditure and local tax burden is developed and empirically tested. Results of the analysis suggest that in the long run, school districts in Kentucky tend to substitute state and federal efforts for local efforts. The estimated differences in the state and federal aid coefficients indicate that state aid is more efficient in achieving the desired objective of improving the distribution of educational support  programs. The results also suggest a price inelastic demand for educational service. (Author/JG)",

This paper identifies six phases of the control process: goal specification, information acquisition, prediction making, strategy selection, strategy implementation, and environmental testing. A number of subphases within these general phases are also hypothesized. The paper contrasts this model of competency to several other views of competency, arguing that substantial ambiguity in explanations of communication competency arises from a tendency to supplement the control orientation with various components of value orientations,  such as supportiveness, identity maintenance, empathy and perspective-taking, and self-disclosure.

Analysis of the data show that students' socioeconomic characteristics influence high school curriculum  placement almost totally through their effects on achievement, goals, and encouragement during junior high school. Also, curriculum placement has important effects on educational outcomes in the junior and senior years, even when preenrollment variables are controlled. (Author/JG)",

        "description":"This paper describes a joint venture between the Queensland Primary Education Division and the Department of Education at the University of Queensland that has attempted to improve teacher inservice education through the use of participative decision-making processes. First stage of the program involved the collection of data from a representative sample of Primary Education Division personnel and analysis of those data to produce 64 working statements that summarized respondents' statements on inservice education. Those working statements were then grouped into four categories and the statements in each category were ranked into hierarchies by ten working groups of Primary Education Division personnel. The resulting hierarchies were then used as one basis for the formulation of  policy guidelines on inservice education for the Primary Education Division. Following adoption of these guidelines by the Director of Primary Education, the planning and implementation of inservice education strategies for the division was begun. (JG)",

        "description":"An essential part of the school review process is self evaluation, which is fundamental to individual and organizational health and growth. Self evaluation is &quot;coming clean&quot; with ourselves--looking critically at what we are trying to do, how we are doing it, and to what extent it is being done. Self evaluation is important both as an exercise in professional growth for schools and individuals, but as an exercise in professional and public accountability. The decision to engage in self evaluation cannot be imposed. The principal must create the climate where his staff can see such activities as beneficial and professionally rewarding. Self evaluation shares the main elements of any evaluation program, including 1) identifying needs and objectives, 2) specifying achievements  criteria and performance standards, 3) measuring results against the predetermined criteria, 4) feeding back results to the participants, and 5) reappraising needs and objectives. Figures I-II summarize the self-evaluation process and present extracts from the evaluation criteria used by secondary schools in Victoria, Australia. (Author/JG)",

These provisions are also subjected to a linguistic analysis that examines in detail the wording used and formalizes certain key concepts that are realized in  the wording. The provisions of the \"Uniform Plumbing Code,\" a prescriptive code, are classified in terms of the physical entities addressed and the performance attributes that can be inferred (though they are not explicitly addressed). Guidelines for the expression of provisions in performance codes and specifications are presented.

The second investigates specific sources of stress (stressors) and lists the ten most stressful tasks for all administrators, as well as examining why some job assignments are particularly stressful to some administrator groups and not to others. Part three examines the relationship found between stress and the health of Oregon school administrators and lists some of the means of coping with stress named by the respondents. The researchers discovered that the administrators listed  complying with state, federal, and organizational rules and policies as the most frequent source of stress, followed by feeling that meetings take up too much time. The researchers call for new methods to teach administrators how to better cope with job-related stress. (Author/DS)",

Research procedures are reported as involving the assessment of handicapped adults' post-school adjustment, needs, and priorities using a survey questionnaire during personal interviews; assessment of interest, commitment, and available resources which exist among public and private county-based groups, agencies, and businesses; and assessment of existing adult programs throughout the state and out-of-state. Among findings (which are detailed in table form) are that the majority of the respondents are unemployed or employed through one of the two sheltered workshops; that  89.1% of the interviewees desire further training; and there is a need for increased recreational opportunities for handicapped adults. Also provided are findings of the community and out-of-county surveys. Implications of the study are noted to include the need to broaden the concept of vocational training and to disregard popular ideas about intelligence which have resulted in inappropriately low levels of expectation for the mentally handicapped. Appended are sample copies of the post-school followup survey, community survey, out-of-county survey, nurses' survey on adult handicapped needs, and Schelby Center Teachers' Survey. (SBH)",

The enrollments in these universities have increased in the past fifteen years, and French-language universities are expected to educate and train increasing numbers of qualified students to fill key positions in the Quebec economic structure. Problems in the Quebec work world which limit the accessibility of higher-level positions to academically qualified French Canadians have been met by programs of &quot;francophonisation&quot; (intended to make key positions available) and &quot;francisation&quot; (to encourage the use of the French language). Other problems involve apparent cultural differences between  French- and English-speaking Canadians. Educational planners have emphasized the goal of economic development while assuming the universities' role as agents of cultural access. They have avoided considering the possibility that the French Canadian national goals of cultural and economic development are incompatible in light of current French Canadian cultural orientations. Differences do exist, then, between the relationship of universities and development in any society, and the concepts and expectations of them as held by French-speaking Quebeckers. (Author/CLK)",

Thirteen percent of the population of the U.S. aged 4 and older in July 1975 lived in households in which languages other than English are spoken. There are over 25 million persons in these households. Spanish speakers constitute more than two-fifths of all speakers of other languages.

Speakers of Chinese, Greek, Japanese, Filipino languages, Portuguese, and Korean number between 100,000 and half a million each. There are 1.6 million persons in the U.S. aged 4 and older who do not speak English, three quarters of whom are adults.

The paper examines psychoanalytic discourse and presents evidence for the following hypotheses: (1) since participants can recognize deviation from expected communicative principles, there exists a system of rules of communicative competence; (2) some forms of deviation from this code are more acceptable than others, which suggests rule-governed behavior; and (3) by mutual consent, deviations from the communicative norm are employed and tolerated. The following hypotheses are formulated: (1) an adequate theory of communicative competence must cover both normal and  extraordinary forms of discourse; (2) psychoanalytic discourse can be learned because it follows normal rules of communicative competence; (3) differences between normal and psychoanalytic conversation occur by mutual consent of the participants, and are therefore tolerable; and (4) Freud's basic rule of analysis and the ordinary rules of communicative competence are not mutually compatible, but violation of the latter in the analytic setting provides the basis for the analyst's interpretations.

The overall response rate was 93 percent. According to the aggregated responses doctorate production will increase 59 percent over the rest of the decade, with a sharp rise in both private and public institutions. The largest numerical gain is anticipated for  public institutions, which currently account for nearly three-fourths of all biosciences doctorates awarded. Almost one-fourth of the doctorates in 1975-76 were awarded by the 20 institutions receiving the highest level of National Institutes of Health research support. Fields that accounted for the greatest numbers of doctorates were biology and biochemistry. Other findings are presented in narrated and tabular form. (MSE)",

        "description":"The primary data source for a study oF entry into postsecondary education was the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. From this data it was seen that almost one-third of high school seniors enter four-year colleges within two years of graduation, and nearly half are in either two- or four-year institutions at that time. Socioeconomic status (SES) is a strong influence, and while medium SES individuals, as against high SES, seem to predominate at the two-year level, low-ability, high-SES persons stand out somewhat at this level of schooling. More men than women seem to get to college, except that black women seem to be gaining in entry as compared to men of any race. The four-year college seems to be characterized by higher SES and ability students. At  the two-year level, high ability-low SES students do about as well as low ability-high SES students. But at the four-year level, in addition to more overall variability among students, women have the edge at both high and low ability levels. Blacks have higher entrance rates to four-year colleges than whites at each ability level while Hispanics seem to predominate at the two-year institutions. However, blacks seem to be concentrated in lower selectivity level postsecondary institutions when compared to whites. Whereas the American system is heading toward equality of postsecondary educational opportunity in terms of numbers and percentages of minorities entering school, it may have a long way to go in achieving a better match between minority individuals and the schools they attend.

It was found that the use of part-time staff was widespread, occurring in 79 percent of undergraduate institutions (for about 10,000 part-time employees); however, only one of every three institutions used part-time counselors. These institutions used students hired under the College Work-Study Program (CWSP) more than they used other students or nonstudents as part-time employees. Four-year colleges and universities are more likely than two-year colleges to use part-time personnel. Almost half of the institutions planned to  introduce or expand the use of part-time counselors, with the major increase planned for CWSP students. If current practices and plans are carried out, 60 percent of the institutions will be using part-time counselors. Part-time counselors' services were generally rated by their employers as adequate or very good, with nonstudents rated somewhat higher than students. The cost for salaries for nonstudents was reported as the greatest deterrent to their increased use; the greatest deterrent to the use of students was high turnover. (Authors/MSE)",

        "description":"The retrieval decision problem is considered from the viewpoint of a decision theory approach. A threshold rule based on earlier rules for indexing decisions is considered and analyzed for retrieval decisions as a measure of retrieval performance. The threshold rule is seen as a good descriptive design measure of what a reasonable retrieval system should be able to do. A retrieval mechanism of randomly drawing documents is analyzed to determine the relative strength of the threshold rule. The Neyman-Pearson rule is shown to be a better a priori decision rule for retrieval as it attempts to maximize precision subject to a fixed level of recall, instead of setting a lower limit upon precision, as does the threshold rule. The threshold rule is seen as a necessary, but sufficient,  condition for effective retrieval. Finally, a sufficient condition for the threshold rule illustrates the relationship between it and the Neyman-Pearson rule. (Author)",

This study was designed to generate survey-type data regarding the demographic and attitudinal characteristics of a wide spectrum of TV College students. The individuals who registered for one or more of the TV College courses offered in the spring semester of 1975 served as the subjects of the present study. The overall goal of the study is to provide useful information for the teachers and administrators of mediated courses. This paper summarizes information from 1031 questionnaires submitted from an enrollment of 1740 students. Categories of student data  compiled include: age; sex; geographical distribution; concurrent enrollment in conventional courses; previous college courses; grades; employment summary; completion rate by course; veterans vs. non-veterans; and student reactions, comments, and recommendations.

The report presents a five stage model of development: (1) planning, (2) production, (3) review, (4) validation and documentation, and (5) implementation. This model then serves as a basis for the discussion of various group structures which range from the independent developer to team members with special skills. Features of the PLATO system did affect the group productivity as well as quality of lesson material: these influences, both beneficial and detrimental, appear to be important factors to consider in the  organization and management of courseware development groups. A major objective of this study, beyond the description of methods for development, was to set forth those characteristics that might distinguish among groups and help in personnel selection. Therefore, the report includes lines of research on selecting and training developers. A summary of this study and extensive recommendations for further work conclude the paper. (Author)",

        "description":"This study of the computer/user interface investigated the role of the computer in performing information tasks that users now perform without computer assistance. Users' perceptual/cognitive processes are to be accelerated or augmented by the computer; a long term goal is to delegate information tasks entirely to the computer. Cybernetic and psychological theories help to identify twelve perceptual/cognitive processes that underlie information tasks: scanning, fixating, feature extracting, decoding, comparing, deciding, inducing, deducing, retrieving, selecting, transforming, and producing. Functions that the computer may perform to accelerate, augment, and delegate these processes are exemplified by displaying, analyzing, simulating, and editing. In the late 1970's, computer  research and development can increasingly shift from system-oriented problems to user-oriented problems. The communication functions shared by most users are displaying, commanding, inputting, editing, outputting, and transmitting. It is neither necessary nor desirable that totally new information systems be designed to accommodate these functions. Four types of existing systems (information storage and retrieval, teleconference, instruction, decision support) should be regarded as extendable with respect to new functions. Since existing systems permit low-cost evaluation of new functions, the sequel to this study should be a program of acceleration, augmentation and delegation experiments using existing systems.

        "description":"This paper is concerned with helping proactive people prepare for the future. The future society is considered, then the process of change, and finally, what all of this means to libraries. Several approaches to the future are reviewed, but the proactive approach, in which people help to shape the situation in which they find themselves by setting goals and moving toward them, is considered best able to deal with future change. Some assumptions about the future or alternative futures are made, and consequences of these assumptions are discussed. Changes in speed, growth of knowledge, urban living, and other societal factors are traced. Developments which impinge on future society such as lasers, machines, chemicals and nuclear power will also affect changes in libraries. Trends  in library development are described, including increased access to information for all people, greater diversity of information sources, increased cooperation among agencies, greater participation in planning and operating information services, and greater willingness to employ technology.

Questionnaires were sent to a sample of 400 freshman students; data are based on the 379 replies received. Stepwise discriminant analysis indicated that two factor dimensions, interest value and practical appeal, were rated more positively by students in systematically designed courses than by other students.

This loss of confidence constitutes a break with the most fundamental of American values, the belief in the path of upward mobility through education. Young people have been sold the idea that the value of higher education is principally an economic one. They need an explanation of the true values of the education experience: higher intellectual development, occupational and professional training, the development of research capability and objective  inquiry, and the cultivation of the questioning mind and a breadth of spirit. Educators cannot be complacent as confidence in universal education declines and access to higher education diminishes. They must retain and regenerate their beliefs in their own abilities as educators, and guard against weaknesses in the profession that give legitimate cause to questions about its professionalism.

Currently being tested at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, the system does the following: (1) maintains a file of student characteristics, aptitude scores, indexes of reading ability, educational background, and other selected data; (2) selects the best media mix for each student and presents the course material; (3) records student responses and maintains a running progress record; (4) develops and  administers lesson prescriptions, tests, and remedial diagnostic training; (5) predicts the student completion date; and (6) evaluates and revises the course materials. The effect of the AIS on the instructor is to change his role from lecturer/testor to training guidance counselor and advisor to students, a role demanding full cognizance of all areas covered by the training program and the technical capabilities required to produce high-quality revisions to the computer-managed training materials as course content changes due to improvements or technological advances.

State planning procedures fail to provide adequate information, since they tell little about the actual use of space. The formula derived by Bareither and Schillinger can evolve a space factor, using square feet per student station, hours per week the room is scheduled, and the percent of time each station is scheduled to calculate square feet per weekly student hours. In most community colleges, the number of students in each class, the size of rooms, and the number of stations in each room can be easily obtained and used to calculate the average station utilization rate and the room utilization by the following formulas: (1) Room Use = actual hours divided by possible hours x 100; (2)  Station Use = actual stations occupied divided by possible stations occupied x 100; and (3) Possible Stations = weekly hours x number of stations. This methodology can be used to justify new space in spite of declining enrollments and to reallocate space for better utilization of present facilities. (Author/RT)",

        "description":"This report describes a study investigating the extent to which 2- and 3-year-olds, as they acquire language, continue to use infant nonverbal sharing behaviors (pointing, holding up, giving and partner play) or begin to use language to share in new ways. A group of 2- and 3-year-olds (12 of each) were observed in a playroom setting of three adjoining rooms containing a few toys. Each child participated in a 15-minute session with the mother, who was instructed to remain seated in a large room facing the two smaller rooms, responding to but not directing the child's behavior. Sharing behavior was measured through observation of three types of mother-child &quot;participatory episodes,&quot; involving use of: (1) gestures, (2) words, and (3) smiling or nonverbal vocalization. The children  exhibited nonverbal sharing behaviors while sharing in new, verbal ways. The older subjects shared less frequently than the younger with the nonverbal behaviors that required proximity to the mother (giving, partner play). Unlike the younger subjects, they were more likely to hold up objects to the mother while at a distance from her, and they participated in dialogues more than the younger, their type of language inviting greater mother participation.

Chapter IV, \"Perspectives on Style: A Basic Foundation for an Alternative Approach to Assessment,\" covers  differences in behavioral and assessment approaches. The Atomistic-Objective behavioral style is contrasted with the Synthetic-Personal style; and two assessment approaches, one that asks \"Do you know what I know?\" and another that asks \"What do you know?\" are compared. Chapter V, \"Basic Behavioral Styles Illustrated,\" explores the expression of behavioral style in religion, music, and language. Chapter VI, \"The 'Who' and the 'O': Contextually Situated Vehicles for the Assessment of Pupil Potential,\" and Chapter VII, \"The Gifted Child and the School's Implications of Behavioral Styles,\" complete the volume.

        "description":"Two studies attempted to determine: (1) at what age children understand and apply the principle of equity; and (2) whether theory based instruction is effective in helping young children understand the principle of equity. Further, do children exposed to such instruction perform better on a behavioral test than children not exposed to such instruction? Subjects in Study I were 115 children, preschool through second grade, from middle or upper class homes. Children were administered a 10-item objective test that measured their cognitive understanding of the rule of equity, and a two-phase behavioral test that measured application of the rule. Data were analyzed by social class, grade and sex. Results indicated a significant difference for grade: first and second grade children  scored within the mastery zone showing they understood and could apply equity principles, kindergarten children scored only slightly below, and preschool children below, yet high enough to make them candidates for instruction. In Study II, 31 preschool children were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups by class and sex. Children in the experimental group received two lessons, each teaching two basic principles of equity. Lessons were taught using a question-answer format in which children answered questions concerning situations illustrated in pictures. An adult experimenter explained why each answer was right or wrong. Children were then administered the same two-part test used in Study I five to eight days after instruction. Results indicated that the experimental group  scored within the mastery level while children in the control group did not. Results are discussed. Approximately 100 pages of appendices include the tests and instructional program used. (SB)",

Data reported were collected as part of the Student Attribute Study, a 2-year investigation designed to identify student characteristics which are associated with certain teacher attitudes and expectations. Student subjects were children in grades 2 through 5 who had received consistent teacher rankings over a 2-year period on scales describing such characteristics as self control, happiness, achievement, maturity, and creativity. At the end of the second year, in a free-response situation, teachers and observers provided short adjective descriptions of the most salient characteristics of each child.  An analysis of adjective descriptions given for children who were ranked at the high, middle, and low positions for each scale showed that the scales had high face validity and that teachers had probably been considering appropriate characteristics when ranking students on each scale. However, certain adjectives (especially those describing intelligence) were significantly related to several scales, suggesting that they might comprise a cluster of attributes which produced a &quot;halo effect.&quot; Approximately 60 pages of data are included.

        "description":"This report describes two exploration studies which examined the development of infants' intermodal knowledge by examining infants' auditorily guided visual search for objects. Experiment 1 examined intermodal search for the mother and father by 9 infants at each of three age levels: 3, 5, and 7 months of age; the final sample was 23 infants. Experiment 2 examined the search by 36 four-month-old infants for their mothers and fathers or for their mothers and either a familiar or unfamiliar adult woman. All infants participated in both a tape-recorded and a live voice episode in which they sat with their two parents in view and heard each parent speaking in turn. In the tape-recorded voice episode, neither adult was seen to speak and neither was positioned in the apparent spatial  direction of the sound. In the live voice episode, the auditory and visual information for speech by each parent was collocated and temporally synchronous. The infants' visual search for the parents was observed in each condition. Results were interpreted as showing that older infants revealed intermodal knowledge of the mother and father through their visual search for the parent whose tape-recorded voice was played. Although the behavior of the 3-4-month-old infants was less consistent, it was concluded that they also appeared to engage in some auditorily guided looking. Results indicate that infants' exploration can be guided by the intermodal relationships they have come to know. (JMB)",

Data were analyzed for 77 educators who entered the same graduate teacher-training institution and who began their careers as classroom teachers. Forty of these women are currently teaching children and 37 work with adults in a wide range of leadership roles within the field of childhood education. Follow-up data were collected from 46 members of the original sample (20 teachers and 26 leaders) to determine whether the groups differ in their current views of themselves and their careers. Aspects of the  autobiographical data examined were: (1) characterizations of the childhood self as self-directing versus reliant on others and (2) characterizations of the self-as-young adult as confident, career-oriented versus unsure, self-oriented. Other variables examined included the number and type of major life crises, birth order, attitudes toward parents, identification with role models, academic standing in school, reasons for becoming a teacher, and preferred mode of communication. The results were interpreted as showing that the differences between the teachers and the leaders were consistent with the personality-related differences revealed in their autobiographies of 20 years ago. Results are discussed in detail and conclusions and implications are presented. (JMB)",

The agricultural and social data were treated as independent variables, while the Cooperative Extension information constituted the dependent variables. It was hypothesized that there is a positive relationship between the various Extension inputs and the agricultural and social needs at the county level. Three agricultural-social factors derived from an unpublished paper by D. MacCannell were employed to obtain correlations; these factors were: modern rational agriculture; rural isolation and poverty; and traditional family farming. Using the  PA2 option of the SPSS computer statistical package with varimax rotation, zero-order correlations, means, and standard deviations of the Cooperative Extension dependent variables were obtained. Results indicated that Cooperative Extension specializations, budgets, and manpower: correlated quite positively with the modern rational agriculture factor; showed almost no correlation with the traditional family farm factor; and had a strong negative correlation with the rural isolation and poverty factor. It was concluded there are sectors of California society which can be better served by this institution. (JC)",

A major finding in the first stage was that 70% of the 165 seniors (121 Whites, 44 Blacks) overaspired for their capability levels. In the follow-up in 1971, in which 126 responded (102 Whites, 24 Blacks), data revealed poor correspondence between occupational aspirations and actual achievement. Occupational attainment proved primarily to be a function of three variables: high school grade point average, residence outside Arkansas, and White racial identity. The study at both stages showed noticeable discrepancies between respondents' occupation plans  and labor distribution for Arkansas and the nation. Differences between 1965 plans and 1971 outcomes were mainly functions of self-perceived job ability, residence, and perceived opportunity for job advancement. The mismatch between aspirations and attainment showed the need for high schools, as important agents in rural development, to provide more effective occupational counseling so students could realistically evaluate potential jobs. High schools should also better educate students for employment needs. (RS)",

        "description":"The Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas consists of three counties: Cameron, Hidalgo, and Willacy. Poverty pervades in the Valley, especially in the colonias (&quot;a poor, rural unincorporated community with 20 or more dwelling units, where home ownership is the rule&quot;). Colonia residents are almost exclusively Mexican Americans. Contributing to the problems of colonia residents is the physical and legal isolation of the colonias. The colonias are physically isolated from urban areas where the residents might obtain health care, education, low-cost food, and other necessities. Since the colonias are not part of towns and cities, they cannot benefit from those governmental units' taxes, nor from the Federal and state programs administered by towns and cities. Colonias are also faced  with water-related problems, i.e., access to clean drinking water and sanitary sewage disposal. A 1975-76 Policy Research Project examined the water-related problems of the colonias. This report gives a brief overview of the demographic and economic characteristics of the Valley, presents an overview of the Valley's water resources, examines the current water supply and sewage disposal systems of the colonias, considers the cost estimates for provision of water and sewage systems of the colonias, explores the institutional alternatives for water and sewage treatment, and examines the current situation of land-use management in Texas and in the Valley. Appended is a discussion of the colonias as rural housing. (NQ)",

Derived from the population reports of the U.S. Census Bureau and the March 1973 Manpower Report of the President, the statistical data pertain to age, residence, marital status, heads of families and households, children in families and households headed by women, educational attainment, school enrollment, employment and unemployment, occupations of employed women, work experience of married women and women heads of families, working mothers, income of persons, family income, and low-income level. In March 1974, there were 5.5 million women of Spanish origin in the United States. Of these, 58% were of Mexican origin, 15.1% of Puerto Rican  origin, 6.6% of Cuban origin, 6.6% of Central and South American origin, and 13.7% of other Spanish origin. More than half of these women were between the ages of 18 and 64 years. Mexican women had the lowest median age (19.7 years); women of Cuban, Central or South American, and Spanish origin other than Mexican or Puerto Rican had the highest (24.3 years). Median age of Puerto Rican women was 20.4 years. Married women (husband present) accounted for 56% of the 3.6 million Spanish-origin women 14 years of age and over. Of the remaining women, 27% were single, 7% were married (husband absent), 6% were widowed, and 4% were divorced. About 51% of families headed by women had incomes below the low-income level in 1973.

Twelve to 15 children, ages 2-3, and their mothers, ages 20-40, are involved in the program which treats their culture and language as important factors. Each child's mother serves as a parent-teacher for 8 hours each week. Each mother develops her own written curriculum guides based on the selected curriculum objectives determined by the parent-teachers and the staff on a biweekly basis. Specific curriculum objectives are to: enhance Spanish and English skills in the audial and oral levels; enhance these skills via a Mexican American format; instill at this early age a level of &quot;cultural pride&quot;; develop social skills. The program is  evaluated through pre- and posttests administered to the children, observations of the amount of child participation during the daily teaching exercises, an analysis of Spanish-English occurrences in the classroom, and an assessment of the mothers' individual planning based on a comparison between present and previous daily curriculum guides. The program evaluation indicates: a high participation by children during instruction periods; attainment of bilingual-bicultural curriculum objectives; increased independence in planning/implementing the curriculum; an increased confidence in the mothers to provide educational assistance to their children; use of both Spanish and English as mediums of instruction.

These responses reflect: primary interest in college rather than vocational education; the successful dissemination of useful information; positive attitudes toward Native American conference speakers; and concerns regarding more variety in the fields of interest  presented in future workshops, smaller groups, and more explicit information on the available funding sources. Data derived from a 5-item questionnaire administered to student participants (N=751) at the second conference are analyzed in terms of: information benefit; speaker impact; information relevance; the physical set-up of the conference; and overall conference success. These responses indicate: the information presented was beneficial (49% of the students said it was very beneficial); the speakers were interesting (45% said the speakers were very interesting); the information was relevant (43% said it was very important); and the overall impact of the conference was positive (91% rated the conference from excellent to fair).

Data were obtained for: all students who had completed the 1975-76 school year and were expected to return; all 1975-76 seniors who had graduated; and all other students for whom pre- and post-test data were available (172 records were reviewed for Fort Sill and 206 records were reviewed for Chilocco). The characteristics examined were: sex distribution; state of residence; family structure; type of school previously attended; and age. Fort Sill results indicated: 54.7% of the students were over age-grade level; 82.6% had problems developed at other schools, primarily  non-BIA schools; 53.5% came from broken homes; and 29.7% came from tribes located outside the state of Oklahoma. Chilocco results indicated: a normal sex distribution for all but the 12th grade where only 39.7% were female; only 52.4% came from tribes in Oklahoma; 46.6% lived with both parents; 43.2% lived with l parent; and 10.2% lived with other than parents; 85.9% came from other than BIA schools; and 62.6% were over age-grade level. It was concluded that attitudinal, emotional, academic, familial, cultural, and environmental characteristics should be further analyzed in depth so that a total educational program might be developed to address the problems of these Indian students and that funding and facilities should be provided to help the boarding school alter the total behavior of  the student.

Results were analyzed in terms of linguistic-tribal affiliation, grades, sex, and self concept. The sample consisted of: 32 male and 37 female Navajo Athabascan speakers; 6 male and 5 female Apache Athabascan speakers; 7 male and 3 female Keres and Towa speakers; 3 male and 3 female Tiwa and  Tewa speakers; and 1 male and 2 female Zuni and Ute speakers. Indicating an interrelatedness between educational retardation, low self concept, and skill in the English language, the results showed lower than norm scores for all the tests used; tribal differences in favor of the Apache; sex differences in favor of the females' competence in the more technical aspects of English; grade differences in favor of the juniors (evidence of educational retardation); differences in self-concept test results, with the TSC indicating much lower self concept than the SIASS; and low scores on the ITED and TOEFL tests. It was concluded that any attempt to rectify this situation should consider language, culture, and self as inextricably interwoven. (JC)",

The design decisions are identified as follows: the object of attention is ambulatory care (because it: is the primary IHS mode; is appropriate for the study of patient education, primary education, screening, early diagnosis, treatment, and follow up; and is a fertile area for quality appraisal research); the dimension of quality measured is effectiveness; the content of the evaluation includes measures of process and  outcome for a group of representative health problems; the yardsticks employed to measure quality are explicit patient care criteria; the perspectives from which measurements are taken are both patient and provider-based; the methods of data analysis include aggregation of individual results and isolation of exceptional results. The methodological procedures are identified as follows: select a group of health problems representative of the major health problems in the community; develop process maps; list problem-specific criteria and translate into indicators; define criteria for each indicator; identify material to be audited; define the length of study period; and employ instruments (graphic algorithms and data collection forms for those tracers for which provider-based indicators are  used).

A set of seven health problems (tracers) was selected to represent major health problems, and clinical algorithms (process maps) were constructed for each health problem; criteria were then defined and translated into audit questions (population, provider, and health status indicators). The seven tracer conditions were analyzed in terms of care: provided by the system; received by the beneficiaries; and continuity. Results indicated four major methodological issues should be of concern in future quality assessment techniques re: ambulatory care: (1) examination of provider performance  alone does not necessarily reflect the adequacy of care received; (2) diagnostic and treatment processes should not be examined alone but rather in conjunction with care continuity; (3) additional developmental work is needed to clarify a concept of health outcome applicable to quality assessment techniques for ambulatory care; and (4) methodology based on the tracer approach assumes that information derived from examination of a tracer disease is similar to that obtained from other similar conditions and that adaptive processes directed at improving deficiencies in health care for a tracer will result in improvements in other similar conditions.

Comparison of the systems' performances were made for the following tracer conditions: prenatal care; infant care; streptococcal; urinary tract infection; lacerations of scalp and extremities; hypertension; and iron-deficiency anemia. Results indicated: no substantial and consistant difference in the performance of the providers of care; observable differences attributable to patient contact with the system of care or system recognition of  the need for service; IHS provided more widespread application of counseling and educational tasks and selected screening tasks, had higher patient contacts, and had lower recognition of the need for service than private practices or HMO's; private practices and HMO's had higher recognition of service need and higher follow-up rates than IHS; private practices had somewhat of a higher follow-up rate than the HMO's; HMO's had a somewhat higher application rate for counseling, education, and health surveillance tasks than private practices. Since the provider indicators did not reveal a particularly high level of performance, it was concluded that systems performance could be substantially improved if all practices capitalized upon existing patient visit patterns.

        "description":"The report presents advance data from the March 1977 Current Population Survey on selected demographic, social, and economic characteristics of persons of Spanish origin. Persons of Spanish origin are divided into the subcategories of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, and other Spanish origin. Data pertain to such population characteristics as age, sex, marital status, metropolitan-nonmetropolitan residence, educational attainment, employment and occupation, income, and poverty status. In March 1977, there were about 11.3 million persons of Spanish origin in the United States: 6.5 million of Mexican origin, l.7 million of Puerto Rican origin, 700,000 of Cuban origin, 900,000 of Central or South American origin, and 1.4 million of other Spanish origin. About  85% of the families lived in metropolitan areas. The median age was 22 years; 42% were under 18 years old. Only about 40% of those 25 years old and over had completed a high school education. About 57% of the employed men were working in blue-collar occupations, and about 23% were working in white-collar jobs. The median income of Spanish origin families in 1976 was $10,300 as compared with a median of $15,200 for families not of Spanish origin. In addition, 23% of the Spanish origin families had incomes below the poverty level as compared with 9% of the families not of Spanish origin. (NQ)",

The initial use of the system called for making judgments about small portions of teaching, arbitrarily determined from a transcript of the teaching in question. Recent work with the system to determine its validity resulted in a change in the scoring technique to permit coding a lesson directly or from a recording. The purpose of this manual is to describe this new coding procedure in detail. General directions for using the scoring sheet are given first. These are followed by detailed descriptions of how the classifications are to be interpreted for the Instrumentalist-Realist dimension. This is followed by  a brief guide to the use of the Intellectual Independence and Intellectual Dependence dimension. An annotated bibliography is provided which includes references to the Munby System and to works which are related to this approach. The Munby System itself is appended. (Author/MA)",

In addition, the paper reports new data concerning the role of voter-oriented ads in socializing children to the political environment. Part I characterizes political ads and presents findings and conclusions of three voter surveys recently published in \"Public Opinion Quarterly.\" The method used in the reported surveys was to conduct interviews with 835 representative voters in Wisconsin, Colorado, and Michigan gubernatorial and congressional campaigns. Findings indicated that significant cognitive changes occurred among voters who watched political TV ads, but that attitude changes were related to preexisting ideological orientations and to the degree of attention paid by the voter to  the ads. Relationships between voter attitudes, knowledge, exposure and attention to political ads, and voter turnout are discussed. Part II focuses on the relationship between campaign advertising and political socialization of children. It was hypothesized that children who view political commercials would know more about a candidate and like the candidate better than children who were less exposed to the messages. Findings from a survey of 120 elementary school students indicated moderate to strong relationships between viewing of political ads and knowledge about and positive attitudes toward the advertised candidate. It was concluded that campaign advertising directed at adult voters may play a significant role in socializing children to the political environment.  (Author/DB)",

A major objective of the study is to correct some of the misconceptions that Americans have about Japanese education. Chapter one examines how education can promote equalitarian social change. The history of Japanese education is discussed in chapters two and three. The importance of class and family and equalitarian education in the primary schools are dealt with in chapters four and five respectively. Chapter six discusses mastery learning in Japan. The impact that the Japanese  primary school has had on the moral orientations of youth is treated in chapter seven. Exam competition is examined in chapter eight. The difficulties that Japan's young people are experiencing in adjusting to the adult world are studied in chapter nine. Equal opportunity is the topic of chapter ten. Chapter eleven reviews a few of the educational problems which trouble contemporary Japan and speculates on the future of education in Japan. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"The convergence theory asserts that industrial nations are becoming increasingly alike due to their economic and technological development. Most interpretations of the convergence theory either state or imply that political factors are unimportant in shaping the common welfare state toward which all industrial nations are converging. Using data on 39 countries, the authors present evidence indicating that, contrary to expectation, egalitarian political movements (socialist parties and labor unions) have a substantial impact on a nation's social welfare effort. The effect of egalitarian political movements is, however, substantially less than that of economic development when the appropriate models are specified. The authors conclude that one way in which egalitarian political  movements affect a nation's social welfare effort is through their impact on the development of a social welfare bureaucracy. On the basis of this study, the authors propose that the relevance of political factors in the convergence theory be reconsidered. (Author/DRS)",

The sections on dissemination and implementation list activities carried out by participants following the workshop, including teacher workshops, student teacher seminars, and presentation of project materials to professional organizations. The sections summarizing participant feedback present generally positive reactions to the workshop and to professional growth as a result of workshop participation, and suggest areas for future development, including increased involvement by the federal government in social studies education and development of more student centered curriculum.

The purpose of the survey was to obtain a profile of schools offering psychology courses. The 1974 survey, a 40-item questionnaire, was mailed to 337 schools and gathered 227 responses. Data were collected on the number of schools offering psychology courses, of students enrolled, and of other courses schools were offering which included psychological content. Data were also obtained on the racial mixture and sex of the students enrolled in psychology classes; the popularity of psychology courses; the academic preparation of psychology teachers; the behavioristic-humanistic biases of psychology  teachers; and the methods used in the teaching psychology courses. Results revealed that psychology as a separate course of study was taught in 179 of the 227 secondary schools (78.9%). These results represent a slight increase in the total number of Florida secondary schools which offered separate course in psychology when compared with the previous surveys. Other findings show that psychology classes contain a racial mixture of approximately 80% white and 20% black students; the majority of students were females; generally, psychology teachers are satisfied with their academic preparation; few differences exist between behaviorist-oriented and humanists-oriented teachers; and most teachers use the lecture-discussion method.

A framework of ideas is divided into three functional categories: universe of energy, living systems and energy, and social systems and energy. The first two categories outline scientific concepts fundamental to an understanding of basic energy ideas and energy flow models of which human beings are a part. The third category sets forth basic concepts in social systems, including governmental, economic, and moral systems, the understanding of which is vital in making decisions affecting production, distribution, and consumption of energy resources. Sixteen  sample lessons are provided for grades 1-3 and 19 for grades 1-6. Activity ideas focus on topics such as the sun as a source of energy, fossil energy, and conservation of scarce resources. The majority of activities consists of scientific experiments; other activities include puzzles, drawing exercises, and cut and paste activities. The activities are suggestive, rather than prescriptive; teachers are encouraged to adapt and expand the activities. (DRS)",

This subject is addressed because presently little evidence exists to indicate that the schools' efforts have affected the quantity or quality of adult citizen participation. Separate chapters were written by invitation by persons who have been working on potentially productive elements of citizenship education. Chapter one raises questions and issues concerning the reconceptualization of citizenship education. Chapters two through four examine a radical critique of the purpose of citizenship education in a democratic society, reasons for and forms of social participation as a part  of schooling, and involvement of slow learners in controversial community problems. Chapter five returns to the subject of the importance and legitimacy of educators creating a rationale for citizenship education. The major objective of this chapter is to clarify the dimensions of the problem so that social studies programs will be more responsive to the needs of a democratic society and more beneficial to the young people who inhabit it.

Nine reading selections (1) describe glacial drift and how it reshapes the earth's surface; (2) identify the five regions of Wisconsin today and show how the differences in their physical geography reflect different degrees of glacial influences; (3) identify major rivers and lakes; and (4) explain how vegetation in the state's different regions is influenced by climate. A short story introduces students to the educational benefits of exploring  caves. Another section discusses French and Indian influence on names of towns and areas in Wisconsin. The document also includes a crossword puzzle, drawing and writing activities, and maps. (AV)",

Since World War II the concept of national security has acquired an overwhelmingly military character. The policy of continual preparedness has led to the militarization of the world economy, with military expenditures now accounting for six percent of the global product. Most countries spend more on national security than they do on educating their youth. The overwhelmingly military approach to national security is based on the assumption that the principal threat to security comes from other nations. But the threats to security may now arise less from the relationship of nation to  nation and more from the relationship of man to nature. Dwindling reserves of oil and the deterioration of the earth's biological systems now threaten the security of nations everywhere. (Author/RM)",

Polycultural education is defined as experiences provided by the school which enable students to appreciate their own and other people's ethnocultural dimensions. Polycultural education deals with broader cultural considerations than multicultural education and includes programs in religion, geographic residence, political views, racial characteristics, and socioeconomic status. Major objectives of the report are: (1) to point out the need for a polycultural education for every American student; (2) to stress the responsibility of American education for inculcating high levels of  international ethnocultural literacy; and (3) to suggest ways of developing and implementing polycultural programs. Chapter I presents major precepts of a polycultural curriculum. Chapter II outlines the organizational structure of a sample high-quality polycultural program. Chapter III explains how in-service education workshops can develop teachers' polycultural skills. Chapter IV deals with financing polycultural programs. Chapters V and VI discuss the involvement in and reaction of community groups, liberals, and intellectuals to polycultural programs. The final chapter examines ways in which polycultural education can help revitalize the racial, social, and cultural health of America. (Author/DB)",

The purposes of this paper are: (1) to argue that the teaching of values in school is unavoidable, (2) to suggest that current efforts in values education are insufficient, and (3) to offer suggestions for a more comprehensive approach. Values education must concern itself with intellectual development and emotional growth. Because schools currently are not clear on what \"values education\" means, they are not clear on an approach. A comprehensive program would be centered around value dilemmas. This student-centered approach would allow students to debate and offer alternatives to these dilemmas. Cognitive and affective skills and motivational objectives for  values education are outlined. (KC)",

        "description":"In light of changing statistics about women in the labor force since 1960, the author discusses possible trends related to working women in the future. In 1962 the labor force participation rate of all U. S. women was 36% and of mothers, 34%. By 1975 these rates increased to 43% and 47% respectively. Unfortunately, women still seem to be taking low-paid jobs in traditionally female-oriented fields. The author hopes that future trends will show a much wider distribution of working women throughout the labor force. This will involve making fundamental changes in the way counselors, parents, and employers regard career possibilities for young women. Also, women who do work at home should be recognized for their economic contribution to the family's income, including a guaranteed  fair share of Social Security and other benefits which normally come only with the husband's pay check. In addition, there should be more creative day care arrangements; training and certification for household workers; training and counseling for women criminal offenders; and work opportunities with support systems for welfare mothers.

Three questionnaires were sent to the centers over this period of time, and this report presents the results of the third questionnaire. Two basic questions, with several subquestions, were asked: (1) What is the  present state of the scene in Texas Teacher Centers? and (2) What is the extent of dissemination of School Based Teacher Educator concepts and products twenty months after initiation of the Project? Replies to the questionnaire are tabulated and evaluated. A sample of the questionnaire is appended. (JD)",

First, the teacher should realize the importance of diagnosing and understanding the different learning style of each pupil. Some children learn more readily by reading, others by hearing. Some learn faster when they can be physically involved in the process. Some children like to work for long periods on one topic without a break; others shift back and forth from one subject to another. Study habits differ in children, and these, too, should be considered by the teacher. Second, the value of learning by teaching is emphasized as a tool that should be used more extensively. Cross age teaching reinforces what has been learned by the student who is helping a  peer. The desirability of the teacher putting himself or herself into a co-learning position with pupils is also discussed. (JD)",

The project also sought to combine three elements into its degree process: academic, inservice, and community. The program  dealt with instruction in Generic Teaching Skills, Interactional Analysis, English Improvement, Mathematics Improvement, Social Studies Methods, Lesson Planning, Evaluation, and Community Education. This instruction, in conjunction with course work at the Community College of Micronesia, previous course work at other colleges, and documentation of previous work and life experiences, comprise the total degree plan of each intern. Upon completion the intern receives a Bachelor of Science Degree with special emphasis on teacher training. (MJB)",

        "description":"In this document the implications of rapid social change and the need for educators to prepare teachers and administrators for future educational innovation are discussed. Suggestions for change in schools of higher education are made in the following areas: (1) Anticipating problems. Educational change will inevitably be faced with criticism, and it is important that problems be anticipated so far as it is possible and preventive or remedial actions planned in advance. Major problems are most likely to be of six types: resistant individuals and groups, resource allocation, role expectations, availability of instructional materials, and provision of field-based experiences. (2) Change Strategy. To be prepared for change, a strategy must be developed. Five points are made on this  subject: (a) Identify basic assumptions and objectives, obtaining participation of all those who may be involved in developing and implementing the program. (b) Develop specific objectives to form the basis for program development. (c) Develop implementation procedures, including specific components of the system and group and individual functions. (d) Install the system, providing faculty time, encouragement, and incentive. (e) Provide for feedback regarding operation of the system, evaluate, and revise. (3) Organizational structure. The prime organizational ingredient is support from the highest administrative levels of the college and university and from the dean and/or department head. The change effort should be seen as central to the total teacher education effort. The suggestions  in this article are made to help future-centered teacher education to apply sound management techniques to program improvement efforts. (JD)",

This is due to a number of factors: (a) students in the same classroom, no matter how homogeneous, show great individual differences in their personal characteristics and in the kinds of interactions that they have with the teacher; (b) most teacher behavior directed at students is directed at individuals rather than at the whole class, and student individual differences affect such teacher behavior; (c) even teacher behavior directed at the whole class interacts with student individual differences to determine outcomes.

In general, accuracy seemed to be much more related to the degree to which the teacher behavior in question is stressed in teacher education programs than it was related to the degree to which a teacher was successful in producing student learning gains. That is, highly successful teachers were not much more accurate in reporting their classroom behavior than were less successful teachers. (Author)",

        "description":"To study the teaching-learning process in classrooms, a small sample of carefully selected teachers at the second- and fifth-grade levels were identified for one phase of the Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study. A unique characteristic of this sample was that it included twenty teachers identified as relatively more effective in influencing achievement gains in their classes and twenty teachers identified as relatively less effective in their ability to teach certain objectives. Procedures and data related to the identification of these two disparate groups of teachers from a larger sample are described in this report. The teachers in the larger sample taught two-week, experimental units in reading and mathematics, and students completed pre- and post-tests. The smaller sample was  selected based on information obtained from the student tests and classroom observation. (Authors)",

        "description":"This document is a final report of the West Virginia School Health Development and Education Project and consists of the results of five discrete studies and a summary of objectives and outcomes, findings and recommendations. The five studies, conducted over a period of sixteen months in grades 7-12, were: (1) Health Class Offering Study; (2) Health Education Assessment Survey; (3) Statewide Health Knowledge Assessment; (4) Comprehensive School Health Education Case Studies; and (5) Survey of Existing Data on Health Problems of School Age Children in West Virginia. Twelve findings were reported from analyses of the data collected, including: course enrollment and offerings are minimal; knowledge levels are below national norms; highest knowledge levels are in areas perceived by  teachers and administrators to be most important; students show interest in areas in which they have some knowledge, and little interest in areas in which they have little or no knowledge; they indicate interest in areas of immediate concern (e.g. family and mental health); career and consumer health are little emphasized; health problems are not restricted to the adult population; many areas of the public are willing to work toward improving school health programs. Based on these findings, the following recommendations, among others, were made: develop curriculum and learning experiences; expand the definition and understanding of health education beyond &quot;structure and function of the human body&quot;; increase instruction in career and consumer health; promote lifelong health studies; update  evaluation instruments of student behavior and teacher knowledge and behavior; expand assessment to include early childhood, elementary, and middle school levels; promote school assessment of health program offerings within each county. Appendices include instrumentation and raw data from the study. (MJB)",

        "description":"This document presents analyses of data obtained in an investigation of characteristics of students in preservice certification proqrams at a metropolitan urban university, as they enter a limited job market, and a comparison of these students to those who entered the job market in more opportune times. Forty-five juniors, seniors, and post-degree students seekinq certification in elementary or secondary education were administered the Minnesota Teachinq Attitude Inventory, the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, the Study of Values, a questionnaire and Self-Profile, and an opinionnaire. Analyses of the data received through these instruments resulted in the following conclusions: (1) the majority of the subjects have a supportive attitude towards children and schools; (2) a very high  percentage have positive feelings about themselves, have integrated personalities, and relate well to others; (3) the majority favor the aesthetic, social, and religious perspectives on life, and score below the mean in economic, theoretical, and political areas; (4) the majority want to teach to fulfill a need to be of service to youth or to society; (5) most feel very strongly about their career choice, are willing to wait for job openings, and willing to prove themselves through substitute teaching; (6) the group outperforms the norm group in attitude and self-concept, despite gloomy employment predictions. Recommendations developed from this data analysis are (1) more useful information may be gathered from a self-profile if lead questions were included to stimulate thinking; (2) the  Tennessee Self-Concept Scale provides useful screening for counseling purposes if administered at admission; and (3) a planned advisement program in career planning and career alternatives is needed.

        "description":"This document presents summary reports of six demonstration projects and one research project engaged in primary prevention of alcohol and drug abuse. The goals of these seven projects were the same, though each evolved and worked differently: (1) reinforcement of nonuse of alcohol and drugs; (2) discouragement of experimentation; and (3) prevention or early intervention in the destructive use of all substances. The programs focused very little on drug use and abuse, per se, but attempted to deal with causes rather than symptoms. The final aim of these projects was to find ways to humanize teacher education, to change prospective teachers who would create a humanistic environment in the schools so that students would no longer feel the need to seek external gratification through  drug abuse. The six demonstration projects are summarized in reports entitled: (1) Preservice Model Project (sponsored by Life Resources and Boston College); (2) Humanizing Environment and Educational Development (Mankato, Minnesota, State University); (3) HIP--An Alternative Program for the Preparation of Elementary Teachers (University of Missouri--Columbia); (4) A Competency-Based Affective Program for Preservice Teachers (University of Houston); (5) USOE Drug Abuse Prevention Demonstration Project (University of Northern Iowa); (6) The Drug Education Program (University of California at Santa Cruz). The Research project report is entitled \"Self- Knowledge Education as an Approach to Drug Abuse Education,\" and was conducted by the University of Massachusetts.

These two projects were initiated with the aim of increasing effective cooperation of public health personnel work with public schools in teaching health maintenance and prevention of disease. The Berkeley Project worked with students of grade three through grade seven. The Seattle Project worked with students from kindergarten through third grade. The unit approach to curriculum was used. Each unit studied dealt with specific aspects of the human body. Intensive preparation for the teaching of these units was given to the teachers involved. Team training with teachers from different schools, principals, school nurses, health educators, or curriculum specialists included workshops, visiting other  schools, and exchange of ideas. The emphasis was placed on the personal reaction and understandinq of each individual being trained for the project. Carefully selected materials were made available, including books, films, models, listening post, and audio-tape materials. To gain financial and administrative support, teams of two teachers at the same grade level introduced the health project into the ongoing school curriculum. The project has been evaluated as feasible, and the involvement of the American Lung Association is considered critically important. Included in this document are curriculum outlines for both the Seattle and Berkeley Projects. (JD)",

The legislation itself is preceded by an essay on the state's role in supporting continuing education of school personnel and the importance of continuing education at this time. The essay centers around teacher motives for continuing development and state concern in improving staff quality at a time of low teacher turnover. The model legislation is presented in two parts. Part A provides state support for continuing education programs in local schools or school districts, limited only by the target population, i.e., student contact  personnel in local schools, and by the intended purpose, i.e., the program must be designed to improve the job-related knowledge and skills of the target population. Part B is an experimental program designed to determine the benefits of extended school-site training for beginning teachers, a prescriptive-categorical program that will contribute to the determination of future policy related to the preparation of teachers. Both parts encourage cooperation in program planning and operation among school districts and institutions of higher education. Several alternate funding procedures are provided for each part due to the diversity of financial situations and desired scopes of activities among the various states. Commentary is included in order to clarify policy issues and various sections  of the legislation. Appendices include: (1) a glossary of terms and (2) an extensive bibliography of selected sources in the areas of continuing education, teacher education programs, research related to teacher effectiveness, and legal issues relating to the preparation, certification, and employment of teachers.

Two papers (Arnstein, Wiley and Gore) review current issues in accreditation and certification at the national, state, and interstate levels, and outline topics for future investigation. These papers were prepared for submission to the Phase One Conference devoted to the identification and articulation of policy issues. The Florio paper summarizes results of that conference, detailing the sub-issues in each of the major areas of concentration. Phase Two of the  Project involved the formation of three task forces to explore issues defined in Phase One and make policy recommendations concerning those issues to the Illinois State Board of Education, and other interested publics. Three papers (Bentz, Hazard, and Stiles) were commissioned for this phase, and they help to clarify for task force members the background information on accreditation/program aporoval, certification, and continuing education within the social, legal, and political policymaking arenas in which they exist. Phase Three of the Project consisted of a national dissemination conference coinciding with the final draft recommendations and reports of the three task forces. Comments at the Dissemination Conference prompted the commission of the Levin paper, which examines, in detail,  a variety of economic variables affecting accreditation certification and continuing education. In addition it describes procedures that can be taken to carry out the accreditation/program approval functions from a cost-utility analysis perspective. (MJB)",

The Concerns Based Adoption Model provided the theoretical basis for the instrument. According to this model, individuals are first concerned with themselves, later with the details of the task, and finally with the impact of their own efforts. Recent longitudinal studies have demonstrated the validity of the SoC Questionnaire; two such studies are described in this report. In one study, urban elementary school teachers attending a workshop completed the SoC Questionnaire which measured their concerns about a new diagnostic reading program. In the other study, the Southwest Educational Development Lab used a prototype SoC Questionnaire to measure concerns  about their preschool Thinking and Reasoning program. In both studies, the SoC Questionnaire indicated that persons having little experience with innovation had more awareness, informational and personal concerns than persons with greater experience. Those with greater exposure to innovation had more advanced levels of concerns about collaboration in use of the innovation, and about refocusing, or considering more effective alternatives. (MV)",

In summary, the task force believes that the major use of tests should be to improve instruction--to diagnose learning difficulties and to plan learning activities in response to learning needs. Tests must not be used in any way to label and classify students, to track students into homogeneous groups, to determine educational programs, to perpetuate an elitism, or to maintain some groups and individuals in their place near the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. In short, tests must not be used in ways that will deny any student full access to equal  educational opportunity. Furthermore, the task force encourages NEA to continue seeking appropriate ways of countering the widespread misuses and abuses of testing as they relate to evaluation of students and teachers, particularly those with different economic, cultural, or linguistic backgrounds. Important court decisions concerning testing are presented. Position papers developed by the task force are described, and a brief bibliography is appended. (Author/MV)",

(3) The adopted projects provided substantial improvement over previous practices, and  more effective utilization of existing resources. (4) Resource materials played an important role in supplying operational and instructional detail to implementing districts. (5) Personal assistance prior to project adoption, was critical to the success of project implementation and subsequent project adoptions.

This instrument was initially tested in two volunteer classrooms; later, it was administered to three additional classes. A total of two schools were involved. Since the intent of these tests was to eliminate major problems in the instrument and to develop analysis procedures, and since the changes in the instrument were minor, data from the five classrooms were analyzed together. A number of administrative revisions were  made, and several items were eliminated or altered following the first test.

Both tests were administered to over 700 college students in a general biology course. Using the same scoring method, adaptive testing was found to yield substantially more precise estimates of achievement level than the classroom test throughout the entire range of achievment, even in the range where the improved conventional test was designed to be optimal. Adaptive testing also made it possible to reduce the length of the test. An analysis of the effects of expanding an adaptive test item pool indicated that improved precision of measurement could result from the addition of only slightly more  discriminating items. A comparison of response pattern information values (observed information) with test information values (theoretical information) showed that the observed information consistently underestimated theoretical information, although the pattern of results from the two procedures was quite similar. It was concluded that the adaptive measurement of classroom achievement results in scores which are less likely to be confounded by errors of measurement and, therefore, are more likely to reflect the true level of achievement.

        "description":"In this paper a conceptualization of the structure of positional occupational inequality is presented. Examining the technical division of labor and the social relations of production, three components of positional inequality are derived. They are: inequality in occupational rewards, requirements and resources. The interrelationships among these three components provide an appropriate conceptual context from which to empirically examine social differentiation and inequality at the positional level of analysis. At the positional level of analysis, inequality in intrinsic and extrinsic occupational rewards is attributable to inequality in occupational task requirements and to inequality in the resources available to occupational groups. The viability of the conceptualization is  demonstrated with a preliminary analysis of the structure of occupational inequality in the contemporary United States. Where the empirical analysis is methodologically limited or otherwise incomplete, the conceptualization suggests a relatively well defined program for future research. Conceptualization and research at the positional level of analysis is not completely separable from that at the level of individual attainment. The manner in which the occupational structure underlies modes of individual attainment was noted. Some recent attempts to incorporate structural variables into those models are discussed.

The program uses various classroom techniques such as the problems, plans, and sharing classroom structure to foster student leadership and cooperation; using group roles, feedback, and processing; and being responsive to student concerns. In February, 1975, the program inaugurated, at two separate sites, a Program called School for All Ages. The program is designed to speak to the problems of age segregation and the negative aspects of competition. The Schools for All Ages is but one of several alternative structures sponsored and developed by this program. Others include an alternative high school and a parent education program. It is indicated that the methods used by the  Affective Education Program yield statistically significant results for students when measured on standardized reading tests at the elementary, middle, and senior high school levels. Three aspects of the program have been cited by Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as exemplary projects worthy of validation: the Communications Network, which focuses on improving listening, speaking, reading, and writing; the Teacher Expectation Project, which raises teachers' awareness of how low expectations influence their students' abilities to learn; and the School for All Ages.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential impact, on the distribution of labor income, of a policy that requires that in each firm minority workers: (1) receive the same wages as majority workers given the same job classifications and, (2) are employed in the same proportion as majority workers in all job classifications. This analysis is directed to the question of the maximum potential of affirmative action policies. Given that Affirmative Action Policies (AAP) have two principle provisions (equal pay for equal work, and mandatory hiring in each firm of minority workers to fill at least a specified fraction of skilled positions), the effects of the policy will depend on the size of the quota relative to the number of skilled minority workers in the economy, the  degree to which the minority groups suffer labor market discrimination, and the nature of the way firms react to the new environment. Three different situations are explained: what happens when the quotas are set just equal to the supply of skilled workers, when quotas are set at less than the supply of skilled workers. In the remainder of the paper the implications of AAP for a number of special cases are investigated. For each case, a numerical model of income differences between the races is used. In the last section a model of heterogeneous labor is employed to investigate the potential impact of AAP on the incentives for minority and majority labor to acquire skills. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This study attempts to clarify some of the issues involved in defining the effectiveness of compensatory education programs. It discusses the extent to which conclusions about the effectiveness of compensatory education programs are affected by two major components of an evaluation: the period of time on which the evaluation is based and the standard against which the program's effectiveness is judged. It is argued that the philosophy of compensatory education suggests that evaluations should measure program effectiveness over a period of time longer than the school year; in other words, that evaluations should assess the extent to which effects are sustained. Achievement gains for several programs, based on at least two periods of time, are calculated. The primary finding of  these analyses is that conclusions about program effectiveness, regardless of what standard is used, are greatly influenced by the period of time over which the program is judged. Specifically, it is shown that the inclusion of the summer months in the evaluation can substantially reduce estimates of achievement and often reverse positive judgements of program effectiveness. The data demonstrate that programs can show evidence of sustained effects. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This statement describes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title I's evaluation effort. Evaluation activities are mandated by Section 151 of the Act and are varied and complex. The evaluation efforts focus as a first priority on improving local and state evaluation activities. The efforts involve the development of evaluation models, the provision of technical assistance services, and the drafting of regulations. The work with models spans all aspects of Title I, and the assistance includes national workshops, handbooks, and free consulting services. Second in priority are the national studies. Their purpose is to provide information about the program's effects which is not obtainable through the local and state educational agencies (LEA's and SEA's) reporting system.  The current approach to evaluation is one which relies on data generated by two strategies: the reporting of comparable project data from LEA's through SEA's and the conduct of national studies. The former provide more current information while national reports are more in depth. The major portion of the evaluation effort involves activities to improve state and local evaluations. Briefly stated, these activities include the development of uniform valid models, the provision of technical assistance, and the drafting of regulations. Various evaluation models and how they were developed are given. Use of the models is increasing, and the current estimate is that about 40% of the nations' school districts are using them to evaluate their Title I projects for the school year. The paper  includes data from national studies about two aspects of Title I: the services being provided and the effects of those services. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Study of the world and its people have always been goals of the educated person. Until recently, the social studies curriculum has been the focal point for world study. Traditional curriculum plans usually have had world history as a major component, and, in some instances, electives in comparative economics, world culture, sociology, and other related areas were available for interested students. However, despite efforts by isolated educators, the study of the world and its people as a continuing component of the school curriculum has been an exception. Recently groups both within and outside of the formal educational system have begun to realize that we are living in an increasingly interdependent world. In order for mankind to continue to progress without threat of  catastrophic man-made disaster, the peoples of the world need to understand each other. This need can be met by global awareness, the process of becoming open, sensitive, positive toward other cultures as well as toward one's own. This report contains the edited proceedings of a conference on global awareness. Papers by professional educators cover a variety of topics in cross cultural education, particularly for elementary school students. (Author/GC)",

        "author":["Snyder, Mark"],
        "description":"This paper explores the cognitive and behavioral consequences of our impressions of other people in the context of social stereotypes. Social stereotypes are a special case of interpersonal perception. Though they are usually simple and overgeneralized, many social stereotypes concern highly visible and distinctive personal characteristics, such as sex and race. These pieces of information are usually the first to be noticed in social interaction and can gain high priority for channeling subsequent information processing and interaction. As such, social stereotypes may be used to consider the cognitive and behavioral consequences of person perception. These stereotypes may influence information processing that serves to bolster and strengthen them. Stereotype-based beliefs may  serve as grounds for predictions about the target's future behavior and may guide and influence the perceiver's interactions with the target. In this way, social stereotypes may create their own reality by channeling interaction in ways that cause the stereotyped individual to behaviorally confirm the perceiver's stereotype. The author describes an experiment designed to test this behavioral confirmation hypothesis. Because of the implications of the self-fulfilling effects of social stereotypes upon social interaction, the study of these stereotypes becomes important to social psychology. (Author/GC)",

(Job values refer to generalized concepts of desirable future outcomes anticipated from jobs and describe qualities of satisfactions desired as a result of job performance.) Job value rankings on job security and pay were gathered from a national sample of eleventh graders and studied in relationship to job satisfactions, number of job changes, and job value ratings all reported two years after high school. In a follow-up study conducted in 1976, 5,293 of these students were given a survey which included items on job experience, college training experience, military experience,  activities history, background, and plans. Complete data were available on job security rankings from 1,889 subjects and on pay rankings for 2,003 subjects. The findings indicated that approximately the same proportion of young workers were satisfied with the job security and pay in their present jobs regardless of whether they had ranked the respective value high or low in high school. Also job value rankings on job security did not predict frequency of job changes during early employment years. Finally, job value rankings for high school juniors were not consistent with their job value ratings three years later. No sex differences were observed for any of the comparisons. Apparently the use of job value rankings as predictors of future employment experiences (whether applied in  exploratory or decisionmaking career guidance activities) must be incorporated with other information in order to predict early employment experiences.

The specific products developed included a set of reporting/planning forms with appropriate instructions, a set of simulation materials for three types of planning districts (joint vocational schools, individual districts, and contracting districts),  and a brochure explaining the planning process, the need for such planning, and the concepts underlying the reporting/planning forms. A total of 300 local administrative personnel representing 108 planning districts attended one of the four regional meetings, and each district later submitted a five-year plan to the Ohio Division of Vocational Education as a result of the training. The impact of the project initiated a vast amount of local planning for vocational education which was consistent with the state plan format.

In phase I seven basic principles were written for agriculture and agribusiness education. These were reviewed by agricultural educators and validated by practitioners in the field. In phase II a forum was held to identify current and emerging trends in related disciplines that would influence the direction and content of agriculture and agribusiness programs in the future. Appropriate results were then incorporated into the statement of principles. Revised principles were reviewed by agricultural educators in Iowa and accepted for distribution. Phases III and IV were devoted to  development of curriculum and administrative guidelines for implementing the basic principles in public school systems. Program goals, curriculum and instructional level objectives, suggested subject matter, and learning activities were developed for each program function and each instructional level in the school. Materials were coordinated with learner needs. Administrative guidelines were developed for their use. Materials are currently being prepared for field testing in three Iowa school systems. Some project materials and the 175-page third-party evaluation are appended. The basic principles for agriculture and agribusiness education are included here and are also available as a separate document (CE 013 245).

(Available separately is the final report of the project in which the principles were developed through the involvement of educators at all levels and specialists in agricultural education, educational philosophy, and curriculum development--CE 013 244.)

        "description":"A study investigating differences between male and female sex role orientation and attitudes to changing sex roles tested two null hypotheses: (1) There will be no statistically significant difference between sex role orientation and sex role attitudes; and (2) regardless of sex role orientation, there will be no statistically significant difference between men's and women's sex role attitudes. Seven hundred thirty-nine vocational educators were contacted; 431 (58.32%) returned usable questionnaires. A subsample was selected and divided into a synergistic group (n=114) and a sex-typed group (n=110). Findings were that hypothesis 1 was partially rejected, as the two groups differed in their attitudes toward extrafamilial roles and male/female nature and behaviors. Hypothesis 2 was  rejected as data clearly indicated that women, regardless of sex role orientation level, were significantly more nontraditional in their sex role attitudes. Conclusions were that efforts on the part of women who hold nontraditional attitudes might be a key factor in eliminating sex stereotyping in vocation education, but regardless of sex, sex role orientation is a predictor of behavior and what is needed is a group to initiate change in that area. Samples of questionnaires and inventories used in the study, along with tables of score correlations, are appended. (BL)",

Students were pre- and posttested in the areas of career skills, life skills, and basic academic skills and a student demographic data questionnaire was administered. It was concluded that students did make changes in their career knowledge and attitudes toward learning environments and although they did not show any increased mastery in all career skills, life skills, and basic skills, neither did they show any decrease. Results of questionnaires administered to students, parents, site coordinators,  and teachers were generally favorable. Evaluation of grade patterns of EBCE students in English, science, and math showed that on a group basis grades remained generally the same for the year. Of significance was the result that the EBCE program had no detrimental effect on student grades even though they spent a considerable amount of time off campus in employer sites. (TA)",

The content is in seven chapters. Chapter 1 describes the data base and presents an overview of changes in the women's life patterns over the study period. Chapter 2 examines college attendance and the factors associated with desires and expectations for higher education and the quality of the institution a woman attends. Chapter 3 studies the labor force dynamics associated with withdrawal from and reentry into the labor force when a woman bears her first child. Chapter 4 explores the characteristics of young women that are associated with the choice of an atypical occupation.

The project resulted in the following outcomes: the development of a rationale and procedures for the design of the instruments, an entering instrument to diagnose auto mechanics skills, and an exiting  instrument to assess competence in food services skills. A large appendix accompanies this final report and includes the following materials: an example of synthesis procedures (auto mechanics); the auto mechanics synthesis; the food services synthesis; the auto mechanics entering skills instrument; the food services exiting skills instrument; and the rationale paper supporting the hands-on instrument project.

        "description":"Following an analysis of Vermont's present system of allocating state and federal vocational education funds, alternative formulas and methods for allocation are presented. The first chapter focuses on concerns raised with the present system, particularly the data used to allocate money and the focus on concern for distribution across institutions as opposed to specific programs and populations. Implications of changes in federal law (Title II of the Education Amendments of 1976--P.L. 94-482), which required Vermont to modify its formula for dispensing federal monies are examined in the second chapter. Focus in the third chapter is on data quality. Current allocation formulas and possible alternatives are examined in light of clerical accuracy, data definition, data measurement,  and data timing. After analyzing a variety of formula alternatives, the fourth chapter recommends a new formula consistent with new federal regulations. The final chapter covers additional revenue and expenditure issues, e.g., methods of counting district or institutional expenditures and the effect on allocation. Recommendations made include change to a variable matching grant-type formula. It is concluded that the use of expenditures (as opposed to pupils) as a base for a variable matching grant would generate a distribution more closely approximating the current one. Factors recommended for inclusion in the new formula include unemployment, number of low-income families relative to the total population of the area, and number of disadvantaged students in relationship to the total  enrollment.

The remaining sections of the handbook list questions on sex stereotyping for discussion; among them are questions about career planning that can be discussed with children. Questions are included about the operation of schools to guide analysis of the prevalence of sex stereotyping as a school practice. Activities for parents in the home and community are suggested.

A questionnaire was developed which included forty-five articulation activities and required that each activity be rated as to its importance in articulation and level of implementation. Utilizing this questionnaire, 222 Iowa secondary and 44 postsecondary agricultural educators attending a state conference were surveyed. The findings included the following: (1) that periodic revision of the agriculture curriculum to keep current with changing technology  should be a priority activity, (2) that postsecondary school instructors are more concerned than high school instructors about conducting activities which promote articulation, and (3) that postsecondary school instructors perceive that articulation activities are being conducted to a greater extent than the level of activity perceived by high school instructors, and that all forty-five activities were important but the greatest articulation needs concern activities relating to program entrance and exit, communication, and career guidance and counseling.

Major purposes of the conference were to stimulate communication among people involved in bicyclist safety education, to develop specific directions for future bicyclist safety education efforts, and to develop a national strategy for future safety education efforts. In this report, the first section outlines recommendations made by conference participants and suggests those individuals and groups who might be involved in the implementation of the recommendations. This is followed by bicycling actions now being  considered by sponsoring agencies to support bicycling and bicycling safety. The remainder of the report includes abbreviated versions of all speeches and presentations made at the conference. Titles of some of the presentations are \"How To Generate Community Support,\"\"Bicycle/Motor Vehicle Accident Types,\"\"Planning Model for Bicycle Safety Education,\" and \"Effective Traffic Safe Cycling.\" Where appropriate, explanations to supplement the texts of presentations have been added. The names and addresses of conference participants are listed to facilitate the exchange of information begun at the conference.

        "description":"A study of four unusually competent high school writers was undertaken to determine the reasons for varying durations of pause in writing. It was believed that a writer pauses during transcribing to rehearse, plan, and reformulate and to make a number of crucial decisions about syntax, semantics, and discourse. Each student spent a total of 12 sessions writing on topics which he or she had selected from 12 tasks in four different discourse types during the previous session. After the first three practice sessions, the final session was spent in handcopying a finished manuscript, writing in a room in which both the writer and the writing pad were videotaped. The signal from the camera on the writer was also passed through a time-date generator which recorded time in minutes,  seconds, and tenths of seconds. The videotapes were analyzed for time of pause and calculated to a tenth of a second. It was discovered that the time of pause varied according to the type of writing being attempted with significantly shorter pauses when the writer was merely copying. It can be concluded that pause is necessary in writing to help the writer organize his or her thoughts before committing them to paper. (JF)",

        "description":"True learning requires that students \"make meaning\" for themselves, but the patterns of verbal behavior that prevail in secondary classrooms tend to stifle rather than facilitate this process. Excerpts from tape recordings of lessons in three secondary classrooms show that, whereas the teachers display great autonomy and control over what they say, student speech is constantly being channeled and limited by the teachers, and that it is the teachers rather than the students who get practice in making meaning. Although teachers may assume that their own understandings will transfer to students, in fact students may be confused by attempting to understand preformed meanings that are presented to them; they need to make a subject meaningful for themselves by talking it through in  much the same way teachers do. One tape excerpt transcript reveals a teacher's attempt to permit students to develop their own meanings, as well as her anxiety about losing control of the lesson. Although it is not easy for teachers to achieve an affective and appropriate balance between personal and social speech in the classroom, it is important that they become more aware of the ways language is used in their classrooms.

The model assumes that the student approaches a piece of writing in a conventional manner and with certain expectations about its meaning. The teacher's task is to present the typical patterns of language and to apply strategies for mediation between such patterns and a unique language situation. In this process, students come to understand the author's individual mode of expression and at the same time develop confidence in their own unique identity. The paper compares the poem \"Ghosts,\" by Elisabeth  Jennings, with \"Treasure from the Sea,\" a report published by the United States Naval Oceanographic Office, showing that both writing samples present a conventional statement to be considered immediately, both limit the message selectively to serve the author's purpose, and both present material containing regularities, recurrences, and balanced equivalences.

Sixty children from grades four, six, and eight were presented with stimuli that ranged from concrete to abstract representation. The children participated in five tasks based on the stimuli dealing with knowledge, association, connotation, metalinguistics, and induction. Results indicated that abstract, complex, and unfamiliar stimuli are more effective in evoking  children's metaphoric oral language. Likewise, a descriptive task evoked from the children a greater quality and quantity of simile responses. Grade was not a significant factor. Although older children show superior ability over younger children in producing metaphoric language, they do not exercise this ability in spontaneous oral language. A need exists for language arts programs that stress oral metaphoric language. (MAI)",

Formal grammar is often advocated on the assumption that it will lead to the use of \"good\" grammar and perhaps improve students' ability to write. However, the results of research do not generally support either of these assumptions. Of the four \"types\" of grammar, it is intuitive grammar and effective grammar that are most basic to the language arts curriculum. Recognition and appreciation of children's intuitive understanding of sentence  structure and their ability to apply this understanding as they read can be gained through the use of miscue analysis and cloze procedures. A variety of sentence-combining activities can be used to help children become even more proficient in comprehending and using the syntactic resources of their language and ultimately become more effective writers.

Sixteen statements were drawn from the presidential platform of each party and each statement was evaluated by the respondent as self, as Carter, and as Ford on standard five-point agree/disagree scales. The following conclusions were made: (1) the notion that voters move their positions toward the position of the candidate of their choice and that presidential campaigns induce a substantial part of the voters to switch candidates was not supported; (2) for most voters, the fall presidential campaigns served a maintenance or reinforcing  function for previously made decisions; (3) the same campaign can serve both to reduce and to increase perceived polarity between candidates; and (4) families showing independent choices among the members are rare. In general, the family provided a firm reference for voting behavior and apparently was more forceful in influencing family members to change their preference than were the televised debates.

Because of rhetoric's reifying powers (that is, its ability to make abstractions concrete), it has been depended upon to make certain societal values come to life. In opposition to Jacques Ellul, an articulate exponent of the view that finds no existential value in public discourse, communication provides four important perceptions of people that could not otherwise exist: a sense of community, a sense of agreement, a sense of time, and a sense of faithfulness. When it succeeds in creating these senses, rhetoric gives to community, agreement, time, and faithfulness a kind of existential dignity which people have come to rely on greatly. Although rhetoric reifies, we must be careful not to  claim rhetoric to be as all-powerful as the determinist does, nor should we dismiss rhetoric as having little existential power as does the enervationist. To suggest that rhetoric is bereft of existential satisfaction is extreme; rhetoric reifies, thereby giving status to otherwise obscure ideas and feelings. (JF)",

This study explored the relationship between two of these patterns, individual (trait) and situational (state) conditions of supportive and defensive communication. Subjects were 120 university undergraduate students, selected according to scores on an A-B scale that rated them as either problem solving or dogmatic. A supportive-defensive instrument was then administered whereby pairs of students discussed perceptions of eight personality profiles. After the discussion, subjects rated their own perception of the situation on a supportive-defensive scale. Analysis of the data support the following conclusions: a supportive  or a defensive style can be attributed to certain characteristic modes of behavior; problem solving pairs tended to establish supportive climates while dogmatic pairs tended to establish defensive climates; and attempts to eliminate alternative options within the situation produced significant increases of defensive communication.

The paper first reports the results of opinion polls concerning the value of the 1976 debates and cites studies showing the types of information that people obtained from watching the debates. It then considers whether voters' learning gains affected the quality of their electoral decisions. Evidence is examined with regard to vote stability, party affiliation, image voting, other predispositional factors, and issue voting; it is concluded that, contrary to expectations based on the &quot;limited effects&quot; model (which stresses the tendency of mass political communication to strengthen already-made commitments), the debates made an important contribution to rational  issue-based voting. The paper then summarizes the usefulness of debates for some, though not all, types of election campaigns and argues for maintaining the concept of presidential debates as a possibility for future elections. The final section of the paper examines the validity of claims about the functions that debates can serve in benefiting enduring governmental and political institutions and in enabling the administration that wins an election to govern effectively.

        "description":"This paper discusses communication and physical-setting variables as a subset of organizational climate variables and attempts to provide a theoretical and methodological framework for organizational communication research. Attention is focused on the effects of immediate physical surroundings, the physical settings in which people work, and how these settings influence communication and organizational climate, along with perceptions of working conditions and their relationship to other organizational perceptions. The review of the literature dealing with communication and climate concludes that there has been a lack of theoretical and methodological work, although interest in these dimensions has been on the increase. Research on communication and climate requires a major effort  to devise and investigate theoretical models such as the proposed multiple criterion model based on that of L.R. James. Investigation of existing theory has been methodologically limited by the use of bivariate analysis that largely ignores level of analysis. Multivariate techniques should be used in investigating such models, with level of analysis included as a relevant variable. Diagrams of the communication models are included, along with references.

        "description":"Debate can provide a format for the development of communication skills to aid students in managing conflicts, because an understanding of rule-governed communication in conflict situations is invaluable in constructive conflict management. Since in debate procedural rules restrict discussion primarily to substantive and procedural topics, debate practice enables students to argue in a rule-bound context. An awareness of communication rules alerts the students to the expectations of appropriate behavior and equips him or her to deal with them. Approaching the argumentation and debate course in a learning laboratory orients students to the basic concept of debate as a rule-governed conflict in substantive and procedural areas. Debate skills need not be limited to the public forum,  but can be usefully adapted and applied to a range of interpersonal situations in which conflict is primarily in substantive and procedural areas. Laboratory situations range from informal dyads and groups (in which participants discuss, negotiate, and decide on the rules to be followed) to the formal debate (in which two or four people interact in role-assigned ways following the more formal rules of organized debate).

        "description":"Recently, communications scholars and theorists have begun formulating rules to describe the workings of language in various situations of everyday use. Theoretically, current rules approaches are in violation of the basic philosophy underlying communication theory--Whitehead's notion of process. The inconsistency is a function of the degree of generalization required to formulate a rule, the determining of relative importance of contextual differences of the situation under study, and the continuing reinterpretation of important and unimportant variables after the event. The recognition of two levels of rules eliminates the problem of exceptions. (1) Context-specific rules are unique to each specific occurrence of communication as process. (2) Meta-rules are heuristic and serve  to aid in the discovery of context-specific rules, but are not bound by the necessity of actual occurrence or by the qualification of exceptions. Such meta-rules continually point language research in the direction of discourse analysis of specific, real-world situations, emphasize the methodology of participant observation, and remove the monkey of process from the language-in-context theorist's back.

A questionnaire was constructed that included use and gratification items as well as items pertaining to opinion leadership, interest in national affairs and presidential elections, commitment to a candidate, and interest in a campaign issue. The questions were asked over the telephone to randomly chosen subjects two weeks after the 1976 presidential nominations and again two weeks prior to  the 1976 presidential elections. In addition, one half of the second group was called again after the election to determine whether or not they voted. The results provide valid, reliable scales that relate gratifications and avoidances to the three areas tested.

A review of the literature in management and administrative science revealed these criticisms to have merit, but it also showed that much of the difficulty has stemmed from the conceptualization typically applied to communication within the organizational domain; human communication is envisioned as isomorphic with electronic communication, as a mechanistic, linear process. While many organizational theorists recognize perceptual individuality of human beings, few recognize the importance of that individuality for communication within organizational settings. In  part, the reason for this in the past has been the lack of a systematic theoretical and methodological framework for examining diversity. However, it is suggested that research developments in the areas of cognitive-constructivism and coorientation now make it possible to coherently examine perceptual differences within organizational environments.

The results demonstrate a significantly higher percentage of newspaper copy from wire services than from local sources during each sampling period, which supports the contention that media abundance is being mistakenly labeled diversity of information. The data also suggest a trend toward using more wire service stories and fewer staff generated news stories, reflecting both the economic constraints on local newspapers and the tightening job market for journalism graduates. The fact that one  newspaper (the Hartford &quot;Times&quot;) generated 95% of the 1967 staff-written stories and had gone out of business before the 1976 sampling further emphasizes how consumers are forced to rely on fewer sources for more news.

There were significant differences between the responses of minority and nonminority students. A panel of speech communication experts hypothesized that minority students might have less specialized vocabulary knowledge, a lower tolerance for long materials perceived as boring, and less experience listening to the accents and speaking rates of white speakers. The results of the NAEP/SCA project suggest a  clear need for further development and research in this area. In addition, three guidelines were developed for researchers in the area of listening ability: (1) focus on skills that are unique and central to listening, (2) use short, interesting listening stimuli, and (3) consider extraneous factors which might contribute to item bias; these suggestions are intended to aid researchers rather than act as a definitive guide.

Currently there exist several models of male leadership in small groups, but no models of human leadership which represent the experiences of women in same sex and mixed sex groups. Key considerations for constructing such a model were identified, including the following: (1) because of social status women do not have equal access to small group leadership; (2) sex is a diffuse status characteristic which ordinarily results in higher incidence of male leadership in mixed groups and which dictates different strategies for assumption of female leadership; and (3) female verbal and nonverbal style is seen as emotional and deferential, but to adopt the male style is  regarded as aggressive and unfeminine. Task performance data indicated that the effects of gender status can be minimized if the woman is recognized as competent to lead and if her leadership behavior is seen as appropriate for her in the situation. In female groups, leadership appears to rotate rather than to become established hierarchically as in men's groups. Research is needed with all female groups and in contexts that minimize the impact of gender role expectations. (DF)",

The first weakness is in its logical structure and the second involves the limits that are set by known methods. Functional analysis has difficulties as a meaningful research perspective because the process of mass communication is unusually complex; it does not meet the rigorous assumption of linearity in causal relationships that is essential to establishing the rules in the functional model. Functional analysis, therefore, as it applies to the operation of the mass media as a social system, is useful in only a limited sense. It gives an explanation for the major components of a system, how the information flows within the system, and how influence within  and between components operates. The uses and gratifications approach can clarify some of the limitations of the functional approach, but some questions must still be answered before the utility of the uses and gratifications theory can be estimated. Functional aealysis and uses and gratifications theory have explained some of the effects that can occur, but little is known about the range of uses and gratifications that do occur. Although the sociology of communication has been essentially functionalist to date, it is time to look elsewhere. (JF)",

Recent research indicates, to the contrary, that when managers allow their subordinates greater influence in the organization, not only does the job satisfaction and morale of the subordinates increase, but the subordinates are more responsive to the managers' wishes and requests. The manager thus gains control by giving control away. Tests of these theories in the public schools have demonstrated their application to principals and teachers. In addition, the satisfaction of teachers with their principals has been shown to relate directly to the principals' managerial style. (Author/PGD)",

More specifically it aims to explore ten conceptual tools or models that appear to have utility in developing our understanding of these areas. This examination includes policy-making and policy processes in educational organizations and agencies and also policy-making for or with respect to education by legislatures, politicians, and central departments or agencies of government. The ten theories or models examined are the rational or classical, incremental, political interest group, bargaining, Lowi policy typology, political systems, democratic voting, organization, garbage can, and process. Research clearly demonstrates that adminstrators can  be involved to a major extent in all stages of the policy process. The role of the adminstrator in policy processes is many-sided. The role considered here is mediator. In a number of senses, the senior educational administrator acts as a mediator between various forces and groups impinging on the educational agency or organization from the outside and also operating within the agency or organization itself.

These sites are established to benefit areas in which at least one-third of the children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals under the state's family-size income standards.

        "description":"One of 52 theoretical papers on school crime and its relation to poverty, this chapter deals with the intrinsic motivation that the systemic structure of a school provides for opportunities for both prosocial and antisocial behavior. On the basis of previous research, the authors propose that the state of enjoyment occurs when a person is challenged at a level matched by his or her level of skills. According to the model, the experience of meetable challenges requires the perception of a constrained set of possible actions, clearly defined goals, and opportunities for unambiguous feedback. Ideally, learning should involve systemic involvement in sequences of challenges internalized by students. However, evidence indicates that such involvement is rare and is often subverted by  the school itself. In the absence of such opportunities, antisocial behavior provides an alternate framework of challenges for bored students. Disruption of classes, vandalism, and violence in schools are, in part, attempts of adolescents to obtain enjoyment in otherwise lifeless schools. Restructuring education in terms of intrinsic motivation would not only reduce school crime, but also accomplish the goal of teaching youth how to enjoy life in an affirmative way. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"In the first section a sketch of a tense logic is presented and a mechanism is suggested for including aspects of the tense logic into the Grammar (theory of language). Specifically, several grammatical structures are shown to incorporate temporal features. A semantic projection mechanism is utilized to amalgamate the temporal features in elements of the auxiliary, conjunctions, adverbials and, in addition, the inherent temporal features of nouns and verbs to yield an overall reading of temporal specification. The second section examines the psychological validity of a tense logic model. Two alternative hypotheses are considered to account for the encoding of structures of temporal specification. The first is a derivational theory of complexity of the sort proposed in recent  psycholinguistics. The other is a theory based on the structure of the tense logic model. It would appear that subjects are sensitive to the temporal information in conjunctions as well as the information expressed by the elements of the verbal auxiliary. This supports the hypothesis that the overall temporal specification is derived by the amalgamation (projection) of temporal features or properties of various linguistic structures, and that the encoded representation can be conceived of as a complex &quot;event space&quot; in which the temporal relations among all the events in an utterance or discourse are specified.

        "description":"The nature of linguistic variation is examined, particularly the ways in which phonology, morphology, syntax, and other aspects of language vary according to social and situational contexts. A distinction must be made between a difference in frequency of a linguistic variable that carries meaning, and a difference in frequency which carries no meaning but is the manifestation of the more or less frequent usage of a form in a situational context. Although the analysis of variation in phonology by defining phonological variables can be accepted as contributing to a better understanding of the kinds of information that differences in form may be conveying, the parallel extension of the notion of variable to non-phonological variation may in many cases be unrevealing. One difference  between phonological and non-phonological variables is that phonological variables with social and stylistic meaning need not have referential meaning, while non-phonological variables are defined so that all variants of this variable must have the same referential meaning. It is proposed that the notions of sociolinguistic variables and variable rules be restricted to the analysis of forms that communicate social and stylistic significance through their variation.

The approach to the question of error correction is sociocultural; the emphasis is on the motivation for the error correction. This paper explores the reason why some sorts of lexicalizations, ordering of sentences and &quot;false starts&quot; are viewed as errors. The thesis here is that the correction of errors is actually used strategically in talk, so the correction of errors in talk is not random but must be learned, like other aspects of language use. Errors in event structuring and descriptive structuring are examined first, then errors of evaluation are investigated. Examples of dialogue  and stories accompany the discussion. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"Research was conducted to examine the language acquisition of a Mexican-American child who has been brought up in a linguistic environment where code-switching between Spanish and English is the dominant style of speaking. In addition, the relation of code- switching to the acquisition of bilingualism is analyzed. The speech of the subject, a two-year-old boy in a middle class bilingual family, was recorded and analyzed for nine months. Observations concerning the child's speech habits and linguistic repertoire were also considered in the analysis. Documentation is provided on the structure and rules of code-switching. It is concluded that code-switching appears not to be detrimental to the development of bilingualism, but, on the contrary, seems to be one approach to the  simultaneous acquisition and maintenance of two languages.

        "description":"The role of the particle \"o.k.\" in service encounter dialogue is discussed. A service encounter is defined as a situation of interaction between a \"posted\" server and a second party (a customer) who invokes the server's participation as an operator of a \"serving post.\" It is suggested that approval or acceptance is often only part of what is being conveyed when the term \"o.k.\" is used. In particular, it is argued that this term is attuned to punctuating interactional units within the encounter. The server's use of the term seems to operate as an acknowledgement that it is the server's turn to take some verbal or non-verbal action. The customer's use of the term may indicate intention to release the server from further obligation to provide the requested commodity. It is concluded  that the term \"o.k.\" has at least two possible functions: (1) that of signifying approval, acceptance, confirmation; and (2) that of providing a bridge, a linking device between two stages or phases of the encounter.

This study sought to describe children's strategies for access into and withdrawal from peer interactive episodes in a nursery school. Data were collected from direct observations of two groups of children. One group attended morning sessions, the other afternoon sessions, and each group consisted of about 25 children. The first phase of data collection involved three weeks of unobtrusive monitoring, and was followed by two months of participant observation. Five months of video- taping peer interaction followed. Strategies were defined as being (1) episode access strategy; (2) episode withdrawal strategy; (3) access response; and (4) withdrawal response.  Findings indicate that children have more complex strategies for access than for withdrawal routines. It is further concluded that access routines are learned in everyday peer activities, but that withdrawal routines may be dependent on formal training by adults. (AM)",

Indices of attitude, motivation, intelligence and achievement were obtained from 223 grade 11 francophone students from Montreal. Results of a factor analysis of the data suggested that self-confidence with English develops through the individual's opportunity for contact with members of the second language community. Furthermore, fear of loss of ethnic identity as a result of speaking English was found to be negatively related to the integrative motive factor. A possible dynamic relationship between the integrative motive and self- confidence is suggested, and the implications of the antagonistic influence of threat to  ethnic identity on the integrative motive are discussed.

The variables under consideration are: (1) intelligence; (2) language aptitude; (3) motivation; and (4) anxiety. Specifically, this report focuses on the importace of attitudinal and motivational factors in achievement. Research is reviewed which supports the contention that the attitudinal/motivational dimension, or integrative motivation, bears an important relationship to achievement in the second language as well as to behavior in the language classroom. The importance of such a motivational component seems to derive from the fact that language courses make affective demands on students because they require acquisition of material characteristic of other cultures, demands  not made by other school subjects. It is suggested that educators concerned with communicative methodology consider the importance of attitudinal and motivational variables. (AM)",

Thirteen groups were identified whose attitudes and opinions concerning French programming were to be sampled. Each group received one of the five forms of the questionnaires developed to assess feelings concerning a variety of issues related to French studies. A total of more than 4,500 questionnaires were distributed, with return rates for the various groups ranging from 40 to 96 percent. This report summarizes the more than 250,000 responses resulting from the questionnaries, both through a series of statistical tables and through anecdotal evidence. The following are among the trends  revealed in the data: (1) in general, attitudes toward learning French are positive; (2) more emphasis is currently placed on reading and writing skills than on listening and speaking, and most parents, and students would like to see this change; and (3) there is a feeling among parents, students, and teachers that students need greater exposure to native-speaker French.

Results show that: 39 states provide student aid programs to students in both private and public institutions; 26 states provide specialized student aid programs to students in private and  public institutions; 18 states provide student support for medical, dental, health-related and veterinary education; 23 states provide student institutional support for one or more medical, dental, nursing and/or veterinary schools; 14 states provide direct institutional support; 17 states contract directly with independent institutions; 6 states fund specialized programs for the disadvantaged available to students in either public or private institutions; and 13 states provide authorities for tax-exempt bonding to private institutions.

Data to test the model were obtained through a 1976 survey of faculty and students at a four-year black college located in the south. It is concluded that attitudes and socialization experiences used in this study have practically no effect on teaching effectiveness that is not explained through instructional behavior. (Author)",

Preliminary tryout and review of this structure suggest that it has potential use in: stimulating people to realize the importance of having information about educational outcomes; stimulating people to think more systematically and concretely about what they are trying to accomplish in their institutions and programs (and for whom); helping institutional officials to identify educational needs, develop goals, translate goals into more concrete objectives, plan for outcomes,  elevate the institution and its program; and improving communications with clientele and concerned publics.

        "description":"In the &quot;Gradcost III&quot; study, relatively simple procedures have been developed for estimating the costs of graduate degree programs based on use of definitions and data generally available in U.S. graduate schools. Graduate degree program costs are taken to be the sum of three elements: departmental costs, allocated from departmental budgets; institutional support costs, apportioned from institutional expenditure reports; and graduate student appointment costs. Research program costs are approximated as the sum of unrestricted fund expenditures for departmental research, and restricted fund expenditure for sponsored research: the former is counted as a cost of both the departmental research and instruction programs, and the latter for the research program only. The developed  procedures are applied to data collected from 14 U.S. colleges and universities in the fields of biochemistry, cell biology, chemistry, economics, English, mathematics and psychology. Average, upper, and lower quartile graduate degree program costs per enrolled graduate student and per graduate degree awarded are estimated. Estimated departmental costs are correlated to some extent with certain characteristics of individual departments and institutions. The procedures and results are discussed, and certain recommendations are set forth. The supplement contains a summary of the parent report, a glossary of terms, institutional questionnaire and departmental questionnaire for chemistry, procedures for calculations, illustrative calculations, and correlations.

Most observers of contemporary postsecondary education agree that the challenge of the next decade will be to find mechanisms for coordination that can achieve public accountability of all institutions while protecting that degree of independence for them that is essential for continued vitality. Regionalism is defined as the view of a geographic subsection of a state or several adjoining states that considers all or a number of postsecondary educational components collectively and seeks to establish a coordinated relationship among their goals, programs, and/or resources. A study of the extent  and characteristics of regional efforts in the United States describes their development, goals and expectations, authority and legitimacy, interactive forces, interrelationships with other education levels, organization, functions, finances, impact on policy, leadership strategies, and future. Some states have acted as pathfinders in this trend: California, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Utah. (MSE)",

Significant findings indicated that libraries were able to shift a significant portion of costs (for functions studied) from personnel expenses to contracted computer-based services; the system was at least as effective as previous  systems employed by the libraries; the system supported an increase in production workrate and a decrease in processing calendar time requirements; no significant staff problems or obstacles were discovered in the use of the BALLOTS terminal; and in general, modification of a library's internal operating system to utilize BALLOTS did not present significant planning or management problems. System benefits and problems are identified and discussed. All data collected on computer use represents BALLOTS in LINE MODE operating at 30 characters per second.

This indirect process can increase printing speed by 40 times, with uses including dissemination and documentation in service industries; micropublishing for economical reasons; creation of library book catalogs, where catalog information is converted into a machine readable data base produced by a commercial vendor with such advantages as shared costs; ease of conversion from ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) to EBCDIC (Extended Binary  Coded Decimal Interchange Code) and interpretation of material; allowance in procedures and programs required to accommodate updating of records; and the capability of varied catalog formats. The advantages of COM, e.g., no filing errors, easy duplication and dissemination, and less required space, outweigh the disadvantages, e.g., the inability to withdraw a book record, time required to add new cataloging, the required use of two look up points, and the lack of cross references.

Surveys and site visits have been made to determine what factors are influencing the decline in humanities enrollments and what can be done to alter the trend. Humanities faculty surveys revealed a surprising lack of support of the humanities curriculum in general. As a whole humanities instructors do not read their professional literature, they do not write or attend professional meetings. One influencing factor may be the fear of being forced by declining enrollments to teach courses for which they are ill-prepared. Studies verified these enrollment declines and also investigated what courses were most affected, the number of faculty members in each discipline, the  average class size, the amount of class time spent on various activities, teacher expectations and grading practices. The site visits have revealed that a small number of concerned instructors can make a big difference. The strength of the humanities was found to be only marginally related to community characteristics. Recommendations to strengthen the humanities include a change from differential funding patterns; humanities requirements in vocational programs; and most importantly faculty involvement. (AYC)",

Approximately 750 faculty evaluation questionnaires on staff development, divided into three parts, were distributed to full- and part-time certificated personnel; of the 23% that responded, most were full-time faculty. About 75% of the respondents felt that the staff development program had been beneficial. Other parts of the questionnaire contained open-ended items soliciting comments on positive and negative aspects of the program, and compared actual attendance at staff development activities with previously expressed interest. In January 1978, 14 college administrators were  interviewed on their points of view relative to staff development and suggestions for improvement. In February 1978, the Calendar Committee reviewed survey results and the possibility of remaining on the flexible schedule. After weighing the advantages and disadvantages of several options, and noting that participation in staff development activities was lower than expressed interest and that a significant drop in student enrollment might have been related to the early start calendar, the committee voted to return to the traditional calendar and finalized a 1978-79 schedule eliminating the staff development period, feeling it productive for only a minority of faculty.

        "description":"To evaluate the long-term benefits of attendance at Moraine Valley Community College (MVCC), a three-year follow-up study was conducted of the 620 1974 graduates (324 transfer and 296 occupational students). Each graduate was sent a questionnaire collecting information on involvement with MVCC after graduation, present educational status, evaluations of MVCC programs and services, opinions of MVCC, whether they would recommend their college major to friends, most valuable educational experiences, present employment status and MVCC relevance to jobs, job mobility, usefulness of the MVCC degree in securing current jobs, suggestions for improvement of MVCC education or training, and training received beyond the MVCC degree. Questionnaire response rate was 43%. The majority of  respondents maintained some contact with MVCC. Ninety percent were working, 66% in the field or a field related to their MVCC studies; 25% were enrolled in educational institutions. Graduates rated MVCC programs and services helpful particularly in personal development, preparation for further education, increasing job skills and competencies, and interpersonal relations. Ninety-four percent indicated they would recommend their major program to friends; overall the college was rated above average. Employment and additional training data and course suggestions are also reported. (TR)",

        "description":"In keeping with its educational philosophy, to provide basic education (equated with livelihood and based on socialistic moral values) to all citizens, Burma has been reforming its educational system since 1962. The biggest policy change came in 1977 when 17 Regional Colleges were opened throughout the country to produce middle-rung technicians; to train students theoretically and practically for successful job-entry and eventual employment on supervisory levels; to engage students in production and give them experience working with their hands while studying; and to educate students so that those of high intellectual caliber may pursue university degrees. In addition to discussing the Regional Colleges' administrative structure, the paper considers examples of other institutions  providing technical and vocational education; the elimination of the first two years from universities and university-level professional institutes; the pilot project to introduce pre-vocational subjects in basic education, alternatives for administering the Regional Colleges through the various departments of education, the Educational Research Bureau, the Board of Examination, or the Burmese Language Commission; and recommendations for improving the system. Summaries of salient points of interviews, discussions, and visitations from early January through early March 1978 are appended. (TR)",

Information on educational goals, withdrawal from classes, hours employed while attending MVCC, financial aid, current and future educational activities, and current employment was collected, and non-persister enrollment patterns were analyzed. Of reasons for withdrawal \"present job responsibilities too great\" was generally considered the most important; students under 22 years old tended to rate \"coursework not challenging\" as important; students over 21 tended to rate \"family responsibilities interfere with  studies\" a more important reason. Females indicated finding employment was a major factor in not returning. Primary educational goals were improving or upgrading skills, degrees and certificates, and personal enrichment, in that order. The majority of respondents dropped out of MVCC by mid-term week. More than 30% had been employed while attending MVCC, one-third of these had worked 40 or more hours per week; 19% had received financial aid. Eight percent were currently attending other educational institutions, and 70% were employed. Thirty-six percent had returned to MVCC and were again unsuccessful in earning credits. (TR)",

A sample of 130 was randomly selected (from the 1,758 persons who applied in spring 1978 but did not register for classes) to participate in telephone interviews; 80% were successfully contacted. Interviewers assigned up to three reasons for non-registration per respondent. Results indicated that 22% failed to register because desired classes were closed; 20% reported classes of interest were not offered or offered at inconvenient times; 16.3% decided to attend  other schools; and 13.4% cited employment circumstances, such as changing jobs, as the reason for not registering. Non-registrants were generally older, had more college experience, and applied for admission earlier than registrants. Recommendations on how to lower the non-registration rate included opening additional sections of closed courses during registration and providing clearer registration information and assistance for applicants on late registration and class petitioning.

        "description":"Drawing heavily on the speeches and discussions that took place at a League for Innovation in the Community College conference held late in 1977 in North Carolina, this paper discusses the problem of increasing productivity in community colleges. Although escalating costs and decreasing revenues over the past decade have given the problem of productivity sudden urgency, a consensus exists that community colleges would be greatly mistaken in settling for cost reductions that harmed their ability to deliver high quality educational programs. Several examples or models for stimulating productiveness are available, directed toward improvement of administrative, faculty and student performance. Organizational models which promote communication, delineate responsibilities and emphasize  a common purpose in administrative structures are presented. Faculty productivity is shown to be augmented through differentiated staffing, staff development programs, and new instructional delivery systems. Grading systems, open-entry/open-exit systems, multimedia delivery systems and outreach centers are aimed at improved student learning. As there is overlap in these administration, faculty and student categories, the only single theme of all successful productivity programs is that cooperation and involvement are the prime ingredients. A list of institutions involved in these projects and a bibliography are appended. (TR)",

Fourteen supervisors enrolled in the initial course, Management of Human Resources, conducted in the Certain-Teed plant by a college faculty member. The instructor and the 13 students who completed the course were surveyed regarding their opinions on its success. The instructor felt it had increased both the validity and the visibility of the management program.

The project experience suggested a generalized model adaptable to the goals and resources of other institutions, which requires that planners recognize and meet their competition for enrollments in terms of cost, quality and timeliness; carefully evaluate resources, identify the customer, sell only what can be delivered, advertise flexibility and publicize successes.

Study results indicated occupational programs had significantly higher direct and full costs per FTE; disciplines with the lowest average section size, such as French, Spanish, and respiratory therapy generally had higher direct costs per credit hour; and more accurate allocation of full costs produced significantly lower full  costs per credit hour for fire science technology, liberal arts, and engineering and higher costs for clerical studies, nursing, and respiratory therapy. Significant increases in direct costs for occupational and general programs could have resulted from allocating student wages and capital costs, itemized separately in 1974/75 and 1975/76, to other categories in 1976/77. Total regular instruction direct cost per credit hour increased from 18.51 in 1975/76 to 22.42 in 1976/77. (Author/TR)",

Eighty-six percent of full- and 84% of part-time students were able to schedule the classes they needed. Students not specifying curriculum load generally had more difficulty obtaining courses. Full-time respondents preferred morning classes, while part-time respondents opted for  evening classes. The MVCC student body had 30% full- and 70% part-time students, and analysis of the 1978 spring schedule indicated 42% of classes were scheduled in the morning and 32% in the evening. Both student groups preferred that three credit-hour courses be offered twice weekly; the second preference of full-time students was three times and for part-time students once weekly. The 1978 schedule showed 31% of courses offered once, 44% twice, and 25% three times weekly. Common student requests were for more classes in the evening and more sections for popular courses; the most frequently suggested additional course was photography. (TR)",

        "description":"In an effort to promote personal growth in an increasingly de-personalized society, an interdisciplinary humanities course, focusing on the needs of career students, was developed at Hagerstown Junior College (Maryland). The course, &quot;The Arts: A Creative Synthesis&quot;, combines art, drama, and music with the intention of introducing students to a wide range of humanities through styles, techniques, philosophies, and media viewed from a modern perspective. Instructors come from one of the involved disciplines and attempt to synthesize the diverse disciplinary components into a common body of knowledge that students can internalize and draw upon. The course relies on a multimedia delivery system including films, guest lecturers, field trips, and student projects. The impact of the  course on college curriculum and student opinion of the course indicate course design and delivery system are acceptable. Nineteen students taking the course in spring 1978 responded to an attitudes and characteristics questionnaire. Demographic data were consistent with the overall college population. Students were allowed to give more than one reason for taking the course. Of respondents, 63% were required to take the course; 18% said counselors had suggested it; 18% had enrolled at friends' suggestions; 18% were attracted to the course title; and 18% indicated the course related to their majors.

There were well over 100 possible combinations. The scores of 400 students in 1975 and 376 students in 1976 were correlated for five variables: test score, high school grade point average (GPA), Otis Intelligence Quotient Score, college GPA, and grade in the current English course. The test score was found to be a less reliable indicator of course achievement than high school GPA for  students with a GPA over 2.25; knowledge and learning habits were found to be more contributory to achievement than fluid ability with language as measured by the test. However, the linquistics-based test was found to be a fast and accurate method for assessing the ability of students with a GPA under 2.25 to master basic English skills in remedial composition courses.

The first of two parts discusses legislation directly or indirectly affecting policies for financing postsecondary education in general and community colleges in particular. This legislation forecasts a period of financial stringency, which is a product of decreased state appropriation growth rates, restrictions on institutional growth, and increased outside control over expenditures. The second part discusses the changing policy frameworks and decision-making environment, which are characterized by a variety of different groups gaining a greater voice in internal institutional  affairs. This may affect the speed and manner in which community colleges can change, thus impairing their ability to develop validly needed programs and to use resources efficiently and effectively. The report concludes with a discussion of six issues: the relationship between educational policy control and financial support provisions; the protection of institutional flexibility; the tendency of state legislatures to be restrictive; the acquisition and use of information for coordination and planning; the proper role of the federal government in funding; and a growing sense of consumerism.

It begins by attempting to sort out the often confusing and overlapping use of these designations by community college educators; and then presents a picture of popular community college activities. The functions, activities, and services covered by the term \"community education\" may be offered as degree-college-credit, non-degree-college-credit, non-college-credit, and noncredit; and as individual nonclass events varying in length. The activities may be college- or community-sponsored or may be jointly sponsored by a college and a public agency or private group. In addition, they can be held on- or off-campus, in classrooms and through media.  Students and participants generally fall under the nontraditional student heading. Headcount enrollments in community education courses are usually far larger than enrollments in the degree-oriented occupational and transfer courses. The priority for state and local funding for community college courses, programs, and activities has been and will likely continue to be for credit, degree-oriented courses. Hence, there is a current trend toward making adult and continuing education, and community service activities self-supporting. (TR)",

Representatives from three vocational/technical schools, two comprehensive high schools, and the college participated in the workshop to develop a proposal for an integrated curriculum. Participants agreed upon and met seven objectives: examine each institution's course objectives and learning sequences; compare objectives  and learning experiences from all institutions; recommend changes to obtain uniformity; develop an articulation agreement; develop implementation procedures; provide for followup and evaluation procedures; and devise an articulation credit examination for articulated courses.

Of nine studies of attachment, only one found significant negative effects for day care children and two replications of the design of this study did not confirm its results. In the area of social interaction, day care children were found to be less interested in strange adults but more socially active with familiar peers than were the home reared children. Infant and toddler day care generally facilitated cognitive development especially for lower working class  children. In regard to the health of children, the consensus of physicians associated with day care programs is that there are no serious medical consequences of day care if the center maintains adequate space, sanitation, staff, and medical supervision. Research aimed at investigating the effects of day care has been global, directed primarily at the identification of differences between the two groups, and the children studied were attending primarily University-affiliated programs. It seems time to move on to more refined hypotheses which reflect the range of children, families, programs, and developmental phenomena available in day care settings. (JMB)",

The subject, an 11-month-old boy, was observed with his mother in a free play situation in weekly 30-minute sessions over 10 consecutive weeks at approximately 1, 2 and 3 years of age. Videotape recordings and checklists of six behavior categories (requesting, reporting, responding, imitative, manipulative, and explorative behaviors)  were subsequently analyzed for two of the ten sessions at each age level. Results indicated that (1) in mother-child interaction, physical interaction predominated over vocal interaction at age 1, while verbal communication predominated at ages 2 and 3; (2) observers relied on auditory information in interpreting the communicative intent associated with physical actions at ages 2 and 3; (3) pointing behavior occurred most frequently at age 2, and was interpreted to mean \"request\" at age 1, and \"report\" at ages 2 and 3; and (4) imitative behavior exhibited qualitative change over the 3 years, gradually shifting from immediate imitation to deferred imitation.

The paper focuses on the averaged visually evoked potentials (AVEP) in the central and occipital regions of the brain in eyes closed and eyes open conditions. Wave pattern, amplitude, and latency are examined. The first section of the paper reviews previous research on developmental changes in AVEP patterns. The second section of the paper presents a developmental and comparative study of the AVEPs of retarded and normal children in a closed eyes, diffuse white light flash condition. Results suggest that EEG patterns from the central region of the brain develop more slowly than those of the occipital region. Occipital patterns tend to be fairly similar for both retarded and normal  subjects. Central recordings, however, indicate striking differences in the long latency negative and positive waves of the retarded subjects. The third section of the paper examines the AVEP patterns of retarded and normal subjects during two eyes open conditions: light flash (Rest) and a choice reaction task (CRT). Results from this study suggest similar but developmentally retarded AVEP patterns for the retarded in comparison to the normal subjects in the occipital region for both Rest and CRT. Retarded-normal differences are found for negative wave patterns in the central brain region by comparing CRT to the Rest condition. Results are discussed in terms of arousal and attention deviations which may be indicated in the AVEP patterns of the retarded subjects. (BD)",

Staff use information is obtained through: (1) a day care center task survey, (2) a teacher task survey, and (3) a child care task survey. Quality of care is assessed by an analysis of: (1) the near environment of the child, (2) child-teacher interaction, and (3) exhibition of child curiosity. The instruments have been field tested and descriptions of the  tests are given. The emphasis is on functional assessment which can lead to program and administrative changes which are cost-effective without endangering quality of life for children.

Clear differences in play were apparent between 9- and 13-month-olds. Generalized motoric schemes declined, while exploration of physical and functional relations between objects increased. In addition, symbolic play appeared for most children at 13 months of age. Further developments in types of symbolic play were present at  18 months. Infants demonstrating an early head start in maturity of play at 9 months tended to maintain this advantage through 13 months. It is suggested that since children's actions identify newly emergent cognitive themes, observations of play can provide valuable insights into the course of cognitive growth. (Author/CM)",

A total of 95 second graders participated in six treatments of induced physical exertion during their regularly scheduled physical education classes. The six experimental treatments consisted of a pre-test and five post-tests. The pre-test and final post-test were used as controls in which the subjects performed the mental task with no prior induced physical exertion. The four induced physical exertion treatments lasted 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes. After each exertion session, the classroom teachers administered a mathematical mental test  consisting of 36 first grade level problems. Results indicated that the subjects performed significantly better on the math problems after 50 minutes of physical exertion than after no exertion. Testing also revealed no significant differences between male and female mean difference scores. (Author/JMB)",

        "description":"This study examined behavioral correlates of the rapid central nervous system changes occurring in the first 4 months of life. It was hypothesized that during the early months of infancy, visual preference would occur as a function of quantitative dimensions of the stimuli (size) which could be mediated at a subcortical level. It was further hypothesized that when primitive reflex measures showed a diminution, thus signifying integration between cortical and subcortical structures, visual preference should shift to qualitative stimulus dimensions (curved versus straight elements) mediated at a cortical level. Sixteen infants participated in the behavioral study, in which they were tested at home seven times: at 2, 5, 8, 11, 13, 15, and 17 weeks of age. One of these infants also  had his EEG measured seven times during the first 3 months of his life. Visual fixation of all infants was compared for five sizes of a bull's-eye pattern paired with an intermediate-sized horizontally striped pattern, and five sizes of the striped pattern paired with the intermediate-sized bull's-eye pattern. On the same day that visual behavior was assessed, the strength of seven reflexes was measured. Results showed that all of the primitive reflexes were present and normal or strong in the 2-week testing and weak or absent by the 17-week testing. Findings also showed that while young infants clearly had a preference for larger stimuli, their fixation preferences by 8 weeks of age seemed determined much less by the size of the stimuli, and they clearly showed a preference for curvature  by the time they were 11 weeks old.

These same children were then observed naturalistically (via systematic time sampling) in laboratory classrooms for 11 consecutive weeks. Among the data collected were frequency counts of peer and adult interactions entered into by each child while under observation. Following the final week of observation, the children were again assessed on the role-taking measures.

A brief examination of major analytic issues dealing with the problem of developmental effects of infant day care focuses on variations in program objectives, the problem of defining and measuring the effects of the day care experience on children, and interpretive problems concerning the relationship between particular day care experiences and specific outcomes in children and families. A review of major research findings in the context of the above issues comprises the largest section of the paper. The review  is organized around three primary categories which are affected by the day care experience: (a) intellectual or cognitive outcomes, (b) parent-child relationships, particularly maternal attachment, and (c) social relationships with other adults and peers. Final sections briefly summarize some of the principal research findings on the effects of infant/toddler day care and the implications of these findings for day care policy. Proposed are specific guidelines and policies to ensure quality day care which is supportive and facilitative of early child development and parent-child relationships. A concluding section discusses appropriate roles which could be played by the federal government in supporting early child care. (Author/CM)",

It is argued that the federal government must at least assure that the day care it subsidizes is not detrimental to children. Several revisions in the existing federal standards and the mechanisms for enforcing them are suggested. First, the Federal Interagency Day Care Requirements (FIDCR) should be made more explicit, operationally definable, enforceable, and economically realistic. Second, to assure accountability, fiscal and monitoring review responsibilities should be based in a federal agency specifically committed to children and families. Third, federal, state and local agencies involved with day care must have resources to facilitate  improvement and limit abuses. Finally, standards should allow for pluralism in providing day care in various settings, for various age groups, and by various types of providers. (Author/JMB)",

        "description":"A review of research on rural/small schools' problems, prospects, and possible alternatives indicates that these schools find themselves in a cycle of financial trouble, community disintegration, and dwindling population; they face problems such as low tax base, lack of financial support by state and federal government, inadequate facilities and instructional materials, inadequate overall funding, poor teacher quality, isolation, and lack of functional jobs. However, such schools have positive aspects in terms of potential for humanistic, personal, and community development. Major prospects for rural/small schools are found to focus on personal contact between teacher and students, opportunity for school and community to work together for rural development (specifically in the  area of human problems), use of individualized instruction, and potential for developing alternative educational programs. Changes in poor instruction, school-community situations, and underfinanced programs of instruction revolve around continued programs for teacher improvement, regional cooperatives, experimentation with unique classroom instructional approaches, community school concepts, and new modes of financial support. Rural/small schools can give students of all ages comprehensive educational and social programs through regional approaches. (RS)",

A 1975 survey of 41 leaders and 1976 citizen survey of 214 rural households showed differences in perception of priority problem areas great enough to warrant inclusion of citizens' surveys as a component in community decision making. Due to differences in survey methodology and time, rankings of specific items were not compared; however, industry and jobs, health care and medical facilities, and recreation were topics of concern on both surveys. To gauge attitudes and behavior relating to public  involvement, citizens were asked the extent of their involvement and attitude toward public expenditures. Data indicated a distinction between citizen involvement (few had been directly involved with solving identified problems by serving on committees, as leaders, or by openly supporting public officials) and participation (a somewhat larger proportion would pay additional taxes to have someone else solve problems). Educational programs are needed to clarify functions of citizen participation and appropriateness of various strategies, though periodic problem identification surveys were offered as essential components of citizen participation programs.

Variables examined were age and sex composition, household size, length of residency, income of household, education attainment, and major activity of head of household. The general finding was that there are differences according to growth status: declining areas have (1) relatively high dependency ratios, (2) relatively high proportion with less than 12 years of schooling, (3) relatively  lower incomes, and (4) wages, salaries, and self-employment earnings reported less frequently as income sources while retirement and transfer payment sources were more frequent.

In urban to rural migration, the key distinction is whether migrants want to be in rural areas. Those who do not may try to &quot;urbanize&quot; the area, with detrimental affects on education through consolidation and inappropriate urban-oriented curriculums. Schools, already information poor and technologically backward, may be left behind as information  providers as society faces revolutionary technological changes in communication through home computers, video-disc technology, laser-modulated fiber optics, and advanced satellites.

Students were grouped into 4 categories of 50 each: Indian students attending boarding schools; Indian students attending rural high schools; Indian students attending metropolitan high schools;  non-Indian students attending both rural and metropolitan high schools. The questionnaires were designed to measure the students' perceptions of their past or present counseling experiences and their attitudes toward helping persons and the helping process. Among the findings were that: students saw problems concerning their future and personal problems (i.e., money problems and a recognized attitude of not caring) as the most important concerns; while they were slightly more likely to talk to a counselor about their future, students usually talked to some significant other (usually a close friend or parent) about other concerns; being able to trust the helping person was considered the most important characteristic for a prospective helping person.

One of 4 regional centers set up by the 1972 Rural Development Act, SRDC coordinates cooperation between research and extension at 28 land-grant institutions in 13 states and Puerto Rico which have rural development/community resource development responsibilities. The center's task-oriented, immediate-impact activities emphasize people building, community facilities, economic development, and environmental improvement. During 1978, nine Functional Networks will work mainly on printing and promotion of bibliographies, synthesis papers, brochures, and workshops in areas of land use, citizen participation, small farm operations, industrial  development, health care, educational needs projection, governmental transfer payments, solid waste disposal, and housing. Further information dissemination is being carried out through a publications series of 24 titles and a quarterly magazine, &quot;Rural Development Research and Education.&quot; A center-developed Rural Development Training Packet, containing a basic manual, varied teacher's guides and learning aids for training local community leadership, will be available in March. A synopsis of each state's plan describes their objectives--most of which center on economic development. (RS)",

Both rural and urban participation and agricultural and nonagricultural agencies are included so that rural development users  may benefit from urban experience and research.

Additionally, a sample of 132 students from a white city/white boarding home, an Eskimo town/public boarding school, an Eskimo town/Eskimo boarding home, and an Eskimo village/mission boarding school were given the California Achievement Tests and Raven's Progressive Matrices to provide concrete data upon which the Rorschach results could be applied. The milieus of the various schools/communities were assessed via interviews. Results indicated: a substantial number of Eskimo  children, especially those more traditionally socialized, have difficulty expressing emotional and affectual impulses, tending to withdraw under stress and having difficulty with the integration of cognitive and emotional needs; these problems are compounded by the fact that high school programs away from home exacerbate previously existing conditions and precipitate severe social and emotional problems; and for most students, schooling in the community of origin and attention to the special emotional needs of such students via provision of warm and supportive, positive goal and value oriented educational environments are generally considered the most desirable educational alternatives.

Reliability and validity data were gathered on students in a college statistics course. Based on N = 135, coefficient alpha was .874. Factor analyses identified 3 interpretable factors: trustworthiness of calculators, usefulness, and educational value. Correlations between attitude scores and both course grades and age were significant and positive. There were no differences in attitudes based on sex or whether or not a student owned a calculator. However, females owned calculators more frequently than males. Also, calculator ownership was positively related to age. (Author/MN)",

The algorithm was either available during instruction and testing or during instruction only. Results indicate that, over time, algorithmized instruction significantly decreased time to solve problems, even after a week's delay, and that recourse to the algorithm reduced instructional time and results in faster learner performance.

Six teachers participated in the study, each having one class in the calculator treatment and one class in the non-calculator treatment. Students in both groups were given pretests in mathematics achievement and attitude. Both treatment groups were given units of instruction on estimation, computation, and problem solving using the four arithmetic operations on whole numbers. The calculator group used a classroom set of hand-held calculators in instruction. The non-calculator group used paper and pencil only. Posttests in mathematics achievement and attitude  were given to both groups. Half of each group took the achievement posttest with a hand-held calculator as an aid. The other half of each group took the achievement posttest using paper and pencil only. The resulting data were analyzed using analysis of covariance. Among the findings were that the use of calculator-based curriculum did not significantly affect student achievement in computation or student attitude toward mathematics but did have a positive effect on student achievement in problem solving.

One field researcher was assigned to each site and instructed to find out what was happening and what was felt important in science (including mathematics and social science) programs.  To confirm findings of the ethnographic case studies and to add special information, a national stratified-random-sample of about 4,000 teachers, principals, curriculum supervisors, superintendents, parents, and senior class students were surveyed.

The systems were tested with a pretest-posttest control group design utilizing students enrolled in an introductory-level graduate statistics course. The ANCOVA model included gender, entering algebra skill, and entering statistics knowledge as covariates. The Gagne system facilitated ANOVA and correlation concept learning better than either the Ausubel system or neither system. Neither the Ausubel nor the Gagne system promoted learning of problem-solving skills or transfer of learning. (Author/MN)",

The program conducted at the Tremond Environmental Center may change environmental attitudes, littering habits, and certain self-concept variables. The Environmental Preference Test, an instrument developed by the author and a panel of experts, appears to measure some environmental attitudes and attitude change in fourth- through sixth-grade students. Littering habits can be measured using  the Verification Frequency Simulation and can be changed by the environmental program. It was also determined that a relationship may exist between environmental attitudes and the age or ethnic origin of the children. (Author/BB)",

        "author":["Myers, Charles B."],
        "description":"Because social studies curriculum developers and diffusers are generally closer to materials than to practitioners, their efforts often fail to help teachers and school systems change in positive directions. Although the idea and process of diffusion is related to instructional change, the two terms are not synonomous. In fact, confusion of the two ideas and processes prevents many diffusion and instructional change efforts from succeeding. Reasons for the failure of diffusion efforts include that diffusion often: (1) is equated with a change agent; (2) focuses on materials rather than the teacher, instructional program, and school system; (3) is considered as an end in itself rather than as a means to an end; (4) is directed to specific rather than continuing change; (5) ignores  implementation and institutionalization; and (6) is handled by consultants who are directly connected with the materials. One approach that would avoid some of these problems centers on cooperative planning efforts by social studies teachers and supervisors, school system representatives, outside change agents, and diffusers. Case studies of successful instructional change efforts include the Speedier Project in Palmyra, Pennsylvania; the Peabody Center on Economics and Social Studies Education; and the Consortium for the Improvement of Instruction in Middle Tennessee.

        "description":"Demands for better diffusion of social studies instructional materials became widespread in the 1960s and early 1970s. These demands were largely in response to teachers' curiosity about the vast quantities of new social studies materials; to curriculum developers' desire that their materials be adapted; and to the public insistence on the best results for every educational dollar. A wide variety of models responded to this need for diffusion. Among these models, four are particularly important. The first, the Research, Development, and Diffusion model (R, D & D) is based upon a system of role specialization in which developers design and test innovations while diffusion specialists demonstrate and disseminate the innovation. R, D & D diffusion projects are conducted by  professionals, materials based, and often well financed. A second model, the Social Interaction model (S-I) emphasizes the informal social networks through which information flows--such as state social studies councils. A major advantage of this model is that it stresses face-to-face contact at the local level. A third model, the Problem Solver (P-S), focuses upon serving user needs. The client centered focus of the P-S model typically results in a high degree of local commitment to instructional change efforts. The fourth model, Linkage Process, emphasizes the process whereby users interact with resource systems. This model is characterized by a two-way flow of information and is, generally, the most adaptable to a wide range of situations. (Author/DB)",

The present module provides exercises to help teachers integrate consumer education concepts and generalizations into social studies, home economics, mathematics, science, language arts, and business education. The module also presents pretest exercises to assess knowledge about applications of consumer economics, and explains why consumer economics is a good topic for an interdisciplinary course. Activities involve the teachers in filling in  short-answer blanks, taking multiple-choice quizzes, classifying generalizations, drawing up budgets, selecting credit plans, balancing a checkbook, and identifying consumer education objectives. Upon completion of the exercises in this module, teachers should be able to select appropriate content; carry out instruction in consumer education for a particular grade level or academic discipline; and relate content of a discipline to particular consumer education topics.

The main objective of the program is to assist curriculum developers and elementary and secondary classroom teachers as they plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a multidisciplinary consumer education program. This module presents numerous exercises to help teachers evaluate student performance in consumer education programs and offers suggestions for evaluating consumer education programs. The module also presents pretest exercises to assess knowledge of evaluation techniques, a glossary of evaluation terms, and suggestions for follow-up activities such as analyzing poor test items and constructing valid test items. Activities  involve the teachers in matching and multiple choice exercises, taking true and false tests, writing essays, discussing evaluation techniques, giving examples of cognitive processes, recording observational data, and providing justification for various methods of evaluating student attainment. Background information is presented on norm referenced and criterion referenced tests, collecting and analyzing observational data, test data, measurement characteristics, and test validity. Upon completion of the exercises in this module, teachers are expected to be able to describe the end products, elements, and processes of evaluation; construct test items based upon a given content; and apply basic guidelines for writing objective test items.

        "description":"Governmental interference with academic freedom is illustrated by F.B.I. surveillance of and unauthorized distribution of information about progressive educators John Dewey, George Counts, and Harold Rugg. These three educators attracted the attention of governmental agencies and special interest groups during the 1930s and 1940s because they advocated educational reform and participated in liberal movements such as the ACLU and the NAACP. All three were suspected of communist leanings because they departed from traditional educational approaches and urged students and community members to become actively involved in social reconstruction. In their educational writings and in their courses at Columbia University and the University of Chicago, these educators introduced students  to controversial issues such as the depression, labor-management relations, the distribution of wealth, and lifestyles in socialist countries. By 1941, the F.B.I. had gathered nearly 400 pages of information on the three progressive educators in the form of reports by private and governmental agencies, letters, articles, and clippings. The F.B.I. method of accumulating data was to collect any type of readily available information about the men, put the information in a file, and add to the file in a random manner from time to time. This investigative process, apparently without clear objective, made use of much false, partially true, and unsubstantiated information. The conclusion is that the F.B.I. investigations into the activities and writings of Dewey, Rugg, and Counts were  capricious, unmethodical, unconfidential, and deleterious to freedom of speech.

        "description":"The infusion of technology into society has created social and environmental problems as well as benefits. Four concerns linked with technology are discussed in this paper: rising unemployment, growing social inequalities, dwindling oil and gas reserves, and potential long-term ecological problems. Indiscriminate transfer of modern labor-saving technology from industrial nations to developing nations uses up capital and energy resources, and overlooks the need for great numbers of people to be employed. Also, centralized technology creates urban migration which must be halted by creating productive employment in villages and fields. Domestic research and development ought to produce more appropriate alternatives to imported manufacturing technologies. Social inequities produced  by technology are illustrated in developing countries which open modern hospitals for the urban elite when the countries' most serious problems are illnesses associated with poverty. Unequal distribution of energy created by centralized power plants can be eliminated by developing local solar collectors, small-scale hydroelectric generators, and biogas plants. Technology which uses dwindling fossil fuel resources must be replaced by those which use renewable resources such as sunlight, running water, wind, and plant materials. Technologies which damage the earth's atmosphere must be altered. In order for technological development to be more compatible with human needs and the earth's resources, society must recognize that (1) some technologies are no longer appropriate in certain  countries, (2) developing nations must generate their own new technologies, and (3) technology cannot solve political and social problems.

The main part of the pamphlet relates the political and economic changes created during the Revolution in Georgia. Before the Revolution, Georgia had a flourishing economy with rice and indigo exports. Mercantile interests in London dominated Georgia's commerce and an extensive plantation economy developed in the coastal low country. Lumbering also increased. However, beginning with the Stamp Act in 1765, Georgia's export business was curtailed and ultimately prohibited except with loyal British  colonies. Problems were compounded by devaluation of continental currency, scarcity of imported foodstuffs and farm equipment, and the exodus of Tories and slaves who had managed and worked on the plantations. However, within a decade of the panic of 1786, Georgia began to acquire financial stability, increased trade, and attracted new settlers.

This illustrated white encroachment on Indian land. Efforts of specific American Indian commissioners prevented the Indians from waging war on the Colonials.

A teacher's guide is included. Georgia was the southernmost colony to rebel against British rule. Many Georgians were torn between supporting the Crown and joining the Whig (rebel) cause. When war broke out, Georgia was in a critical position because her northern regions were firm Whig supporters but her southern borders provided a haven for Tories. Early in the war, the Whigs attempted to capture St. Augustine in British-held Florida, but failed. In 1778, the British moved  against Georgia and captured Savannah and Augusta. Fighting took place in rural areas throughout the years 1778-1780, ending in Whig reoccupation of Augusta. Savannah was regained two years later, largely due to other Whig victories in northern colonies. When East Florida was ceded to Spain in 1783, Georgia was free of military threat from the southern colony.

One of a series of materials about the American Revolution in Georgia, it is designed for junior or senior high school students. A brief teacher's guide is included. Prior to the Revolution, the colony comprised coastal lands of large plantations, small farms along the Savannah river, and unsettled land to the north and west. Savannah was the administrative and commercial center. Products included rice, indigo, deerskins, and lumber. Merchants and planters provided the colony's leadership while artisans, shopkeepers, and small farmers comprised the bulk of the white population. There was a large  slave population. Beginning in 1763, efforts by Britain to raise revenue in the colonies initiated conflict between Britain and America. The Stamp Act, Sugar Act, and duties on imported goods prompted opposition to the colony's British governor, James Wright, and a boycott of British goods. During the next decade the colony's government branches disagreed over other issues, including voting rights. As other colonies to the north began to revolt against Britain, the Whig party in Georgia gained power and, in 1775, took control of local government. Georgia's signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 locked her into the Revolution. The teacher's guide presents ideas for informal activities to enhance understanding of the text.

The pamphlet can be used as supplementary reading or as a one-week unit for junior or senior high school students. A brief teacher's guide is included. Wright, a conservative, believed in a structured society, in the benefits of alliance with the British Empire to the colonies, and in slow orderly change. Throughout his governorhsip he endeavored to promote peace with the Indians and to attract increased population in order to grow more agricultural products and to defend the frontier. He engineered two successful land cessions from the Indians and strove to keep settlers from  encroaching on Indian-owned land. He himself invested in Georgia property and owned large plantations. Early in his term, he won colonists' respect by debating political issues in private conversation and through leading councilors rather than through public argument. However, when Britain began levying taxes upon the colonies, Wright upheld British authority and enforced the new laws. As opposition grew in the colonial representative government, Wright was forced to dissolve the rebelling political groups. However, as other colonies asserted rights for provincial congresses, Wright's authority in Georgia was overpowered. He ultimately retired in England and tried to obtain financial compensation for his losses. The teacher's guide presents activities, discussion questions, and a  crossword puzzle based on the text.

Designed for junior and senior high school students, it can be used as supplementary reading or a short unit. A teacher's guide is included. The Stamp Act was levied by Britain to force the colonies to help pay for Britain's losses in the French and Indian War. It required that almost everything formally written or printed in the colonies appear on specially stamped paper shipped from London. Colonists immediately petitioned for repeal, arguing that only colonial legislatures, not Parliament, could tax the colonies. They demanded no taxation without representation in the House of Commons in London. As Britain refused, the  colonies began boycotts of British goods and violent demonstrations. In Georgia, protest was not as strong because the colony was young, poor, and fairly respectful of the King. Also, Georgia Governor James Wright was well liked and trusted. However, he enforced the Stamp Act and thereby prompted small violent clashes. Wright was the only colonial governor who managed to sell some stamps before colonialists' protests became more forceful. After moving the supply of stamps several times to prevent their destruction, Wright learned that Britain had repealed the Act. However, it had prompted a split in political thinking which paved the way for the Revolution. The teacher's guide suggests behavioral objectives and activities based on the text. (Author/AV)",

Designed for junior and senior high school students, it can be used as supplementary reading or a one-week unit. A teacher's guide is included. Black life in the Revolutionary era, for both slaves and free blacks, was regulated by the same laws and customs prevailing in the pre-war period. Many colonies allowed slaves to join the military efforts of both the patriot and British causes, but Georgia's government refused to arm slaves for combat services and to grant freedom for such service. Black slaves were used in non-combat roles such as defending military storehouses and repairing roads. There are several recorded  instances of native free blacks serving for the patriots in Georgia and several hundred blacks from the Caribbean island of Santo Domingo served briefly at Savannah. Although the war ruined plantation life in many areas and reduced the slave population, fundamental tenets of the racial caste system remained largely intact for those blacks who stayed. The teacher's guide contains lists of behavioral objectives, discussion questions, and activities based on the text. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"The pamphlet discusses changes in the political leadership of Georgia during the Revolutionary War years. It is one of a series of documents about the American Revolution in Georgia. Designed for junior or senior high school students, it can serve as supplementary reading or a two-week unit. A teacher's guide is included. Political development in Georgia during the revolutionary and confederation periods was affected by many problems in the state: small population, wide extent of settlement, and rivalry between the coast and backcountry. Strong factional groups within the pathiot Party and brief restoration of a British provincial government divided the state and prevented regularization of government until after 1782. Georgia political history in this period is a study of party  and provincial congress leaders. They endeavored to promote population growth, build a new capital city, and create a state university. The coastal-upcountry struggle resulted in the emergence of upcountry leaders and the physical relocation of the capital. Savannah and the coast lost much political power. The teacher's guide presents discussion questions, activities, and a word game based on the text. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"The paper contrasts an affective education program with a traditional education program in a school district in Kentucky. Over 200 elementary students participated in affective activities in three 30-minute sessions per week during a 12-week pilot phase and a two-year study phase. For final data analysis, children were placed in groups labeled either traditional (having little or no exposure to the program) or affective. The children also were identified as belonging to one of six temperament groups created by combining characteristics such as \"energetic-active,\"\"socially outgoing,\"\"compliant-passive,\" and \"individually retiring.\" Results show that participation in the affective program had desirable effects upon overall self-competency and attitude toward school. Students in  the \"energetic,\"\"outgoing\" temperament groups made meaningful gains in the affective program, whereas students in the \"retiring\" temperament groups made meaningful gains in the traditional program. Findings indicate that different programs are beneficial for different types of students. Further research in this area should consider the effects of classroom management, regional differences, and temperaments across cultures and across socioeconomic groups. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"A national survey of state education agencies was undertaken in 1976 to ascertain policies and programs in the area of ethical-citizenship education (ECE). The objective of the survey was to investigate the relationship of national public opinion in favor of moral education to state education agency attempts to develop ECE programs. Forty-six states responded to the questionnaire. Questions centered on six areas: (1) state interest in ECE; (2) state goals in ECE; (3) current efforts in ECE at the state and local levels; (4) funding sources; (5) type of assistance planned for ECE by the state, if funding becomes available; and (6) name of person to contact for further information. Analysis of the ECE data revealed 13 policy areas shared by the majority of responding states. These  included that ethical/values education must be integrated with citizenship education; new developments in the behavioral sciences should be used in ECE curricula; and schools should teach the skills which enable students to think and act consistently with American civic ethics. Subject areas identified as being relevant to ECE objectives were values education, moral reasoning, personal development, prosocial education, law-related education, community education, school-community education, economic-political education, and consumer education.

One of the main purposes of reform was to lower the age by which a student completes secondary education from 18 to 16, and thus increase Bulgaria's available manpower. A short history of Bulgarian education is given first plus a summary of education administration, planning, financing, grading, and enrollment. Infants may be admitted to nursery schools at one year and remain there until the age of three, when they may attend kindergarten. They then attend intermediate and secondary schools until they graduate at 16 years of age. Four post-secondary school options are  available. Vocational schools train semiskilled and skilled workers, technical institutes train technicians, and semi-higher institutes train teachers, railroad, post office, telephone, and telegraph workers. The higher education institutes are either general universities or specialized institutes in areas such as agriculture, finance and economics, and music. A list of higher institutions is provided. The document gives some detail on teacher education, continuing education, special education, and extracurricular activities. A glossary and bibliography conclude the document. (BC)",

The purpose of the institute was to train elementary and secondary teachers to develop competency in religion studies. The Institute was developed to serve multiple purposes. First, the institute brought together practicing teachers who were interested in incorporating the religious dimension in their cultural studies. Second, the teachers were brought together to design and implement teaching resource units on religious dimensions of world culture. Thirdly, the structure of the institute itself was envisioned as a model for other colleges and universities to follow in constructing teacher education programs for public  education religion studies. In 1976 teachers participated in a five-week summer training session in academic religion studies and prepared resource units. Teachers then tested their resource units in their classes during the following year. In the subsequent four-week session in 1977, additional academic preparation in religion studies enabled teachers to re-evaluate and revise their resource units for more general usage by other teachers. Participants and references are listed. (Author/BC)",

Part III lists six cognitive and five affective goals and objectives. Part IV, the major part of the document, briefly describes 25 initiatory, developmental, and culminating activities.

Students are given some general ideas of the spread of Christianity and Islam into Africa and their relationships with indigenous religions. The unit emphasizes how these two religions entered Africa, what impact they had on the people they touched,  and what is happening to these religions today. Unit generalizations, concepts, and subject matter are briefly outlined.

A major objective is to help students understand and appreciate sacred times and sacred places within this cultural setting. They learn how beliefs and practices cause the people to manifest a certain behavior or life style. The unit traces the early development of Western civilization in the Middle East and describes how the geography, history, and religion of the area influence the Middle Eastern culture. Students examine the economic development in Saudi Arabia, Iraq Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Turkey, and Egypt. They study how economic security can be attained through the development of natural  resources, particularly oil, and the effect this has upon international power. Vocabulary, generalizations, and subject matter are outlined. Nine cognitive objectives each with several sub-points are given. For each objective there are corresponding suggestions for evaluation. Three affective objectives are listed, and references for both teacher and student are provided. (Author/BC)",

The unit can be incorporated into a larger unit on Russian literature, art, religion, or history. Four reasons for studying iconography are: 1) it is a splendid Russian art form; 2) it is the most significant Russian contribution to painting; 3) it gives insight into Russian religion and the Russian Orthodox Church; and, 4) it is a good example of religious influence upon art and artists. Generalizations, concepts, and vocabulary are briefly outlined. Thirteen cognitive objectives are identified, such as the student will be able to identify three general subjects of Russian icons. Eight affective objectives  are identified, such as students will express a desire to visit the Soviet Union. Several activities are suggested including the viewing of films and discussion groups. Four different forms of evaluation are provided. These include student evaluation of the unit and teacher. A list of reference books, films, and recordings concludes the paper. (Author/BC)",

The unit was developed as part of a series by the Public Education Religion Studies Center. The resource units serve the religious components of broader cultural studies of the USSR and Japan. Three statements of rationale underlie the unit: (1) Diverse cultures develop as people try to meet their needs and solve their problems; (2) Culture is affected by the natural environment; (3) The diverse responses to meeting human needs and problems contain elements of commonality. The course is designed to increase student awareness of the diversity and commonality within human society by providing conceptual tools with which to analyze cultures. Inclusion of the religious  dimension of culture is considered essential if the portrayal of the culture is to be accurate, since religion is the synthesis of world-view and life-style. The approach is interdisciplinary with the greatest cognitive emphasis on geography and cultural anthropology but including perspectives from sociology, history, and political science. Generalizations, concepts, subject matter, and vocabulary are presented. Both cognitive and affective objectives are stated, and initiatory, developmental, and culminating activities are described. The document concludes with evaluation suggestions and a thorough list of instructional materials. (Author/BC)",

A portion of the model, the relationship between teacher aptitudes and knowledge, teaching behavior, and pupil outcomes is focused upon. Aptitudes considered important included verbal and reasoning ability, memory, fluency, flexibility, and sensitivity. Forty two second grade and fifty five fifth grade teachers and the pupils to whom they taught mathematics and/or reading were studied. Classroom observation, tests of student cognitive, affective, achievement, and aptitude levels, and tests of teacher aptitude, affective, and cognitive style/content tests provided a data base for analysis. Relationships between the factors tested and instructional  behavior are examined. Only cognitive style and one attitude component (level of aspiration) were found consistently related over both grade levels and subject. In addition, interaction between specific teacher characteristics, especially aptitude and instructional behavior, are suggested by the data. The importance of further research to the improvement of instructional behavior, curricular change, and teacher retention is suggested. Statistical data is appended. (MJB)",

Undergraduate courses (freshman through senior levels) include laboratory experiences that require student client interaction commensurate with demonstrated knowledge and skill accrued through class lectures, discussion, role playing, and simulations. Studentclient interaction progresses from observer through semiindependent practitioner roles. In the senior year of training the student is  required to assume full responsibility for directly providing habilitative experiences for a caseload or class of exceptional individuals who exhibit problems corresponding to the student's area of specialization. The RSE program is structured so a student may continue after graduation to a master's degree and a doctorate.

In 1969, the American Association on Mental Deficiency sponsored the development of the Adaptive Behavior Scale to provide a comprehensive assessment of adaptive behavior. This scale was designed to be used in conjunction with intelligence tests for the diagnosis and placement of retarded school age children. The Public School Version of the scale was published in 1974. This report summarizes the research on the Public School Version which was conducted subsequent to its publication. This supplemental information includes reports of additional studies of the validity of the scale,  information on domain score reliabilities, and the relationship of IQ to domain scores. In order to assist users in the application of the scale to decision making and to the development of individual education plans, this supplement also provides information about the dimensionality of the scale and samples of Adaptive Behavior profiles which can be prepared to aid in interpreting the results. The author concludes that the scale, as part of a comprehensive case study, can provide invaluable information for improving adaptive behavior, and for assessing intellectual functioning.

        "description":"The contributions of school classification--regular or educable mentally retarded (EMR)--sex, and ethnic status to domain scores from the Public School Version of the Adaptive Behavior Scale were investigated. Part One measures the development of personal independence in daily living, while Part Two measures maladaptive behavior related to personality and behavior disorders. Data were collected from over 1,600 regular and EMR subjects approximately equally distributed between the sexes among white, black and Spanish-speaking subjects aged 7 to 13. Domain scores were valid for differentiating among children of different adaptive behavior levels as inferred from class placement. Ethnic status was not a unique contributor to Part One domain scores when the effects of classification  were accounted for. On the Part Two domains, ethnic status was a significant contributor to some domain scores, but not at all age levels. Sex made few unique contributions to domain scores on Part One of the scale, but was a significant factor on some domains of Part Two at some age levels. It was concluded that the scale was valid for differentiating among pupils assigned to regular and EMR classes from ages 7 to 12, and that there are common expectancies for personal independence and responsibility among boys and girls from different ethnic groups.

        "description":"This study determined whether or not there were significant differences between ratings of parents and teachers on the Adaptive Behavior Scale, Public School Version. Interviews with parents of approximately 150 white and Spanish-surnamed children from 7 to 12 years assigned to educable mentally retarded (EMR) classes were used in conjunction with data from the 1972 feasibility and standardization study of the scale. Sex, ethnic status, and rator (parent or teacher) were considered in the analysis of differences between parent and teacher ratings. The results demonstrated that parent and teacher ratings of white and Spanish-surnamed children assigned to EMR classes were not significantly different. Furthermore, sex and ethmic status of the children did not affect the ratings.  These results imply that pupils assigned to EMR classes function similarly at home and at school. (Author/BW)",

The results of the study are reported as means and standard deviations of the domain scores for Part One and Part Two, and as standard scores for each reference group. In response to concern about the difficulties in interpreting Part One and Part Two where raw scores are inversely correlated, the scale for Part Two was presented so that the higher the score on both parts, the better the level of adaptive behavior functioning.

        "description":"A representative sample of California school psychologists was surveyed to determine the extent of the use of the Adaptive Behavior Scale and the relationship between training in the use of the scale and perceptions of the efficacy of its measures. A large majority of psychologists had used the scale two or fewer times, though 30-45% had been introduced to the scale in assessment workshops, trained others, or particpated in special courses. In general, the more extensive the training, the more positive the judgment of the psychologists about the utility of the adaptive behavior assessment the scale provides. The outcomes of evaluations which used the Adaptive Behavior Scale, from a school district in which psychologists reported being trained, were analyzed. It was concluded that  the information from the Adaptive Behavior Scale contributed important diagnostic information to the evalution and placement process. It was also noted that the Spanish-surnamed children always had the lowest scores on the Physical Development domain, indicating the possibility of sensory and motor handicaps. (Author/BW)",

It is argued that, in America's Pacific possessions, the sole use of the systems analysis approach to evaluation fails to provide adequate information to questions of central importance for English as a second language program development. In this particular setting, the proposed models, although well researched and considerably refined in recent years, are often inappropriate and difficult to implement correctly, and due to the cost factor they may actually detract from program quality. Tests designed for use in the continental United States are generally inappropriate for islands where English  is a second language. Three models developed by the RMC Research Corporation for Title I evaluation are discussed: (1) the norm-referenced model; (2) the control group model; and (3) the special regression model. Two preferable evaluation models would be the use of standardized tests with local norms, and the development of cloze tests with local norms. (Author/CTM)",

        "description":"The Classroom Activity Files and Day Care and Home Learning Activities Files contain approximately 900 learning activites each, and were designed to promote competencies in children at different developmental ages. Twelve Head Start, kindergarten and preschool programs participated in a field study to evaluate the usability, content, and age-appropriateness of the files. The Developmental Profile was used to measure physical, self-help, social, academic and communication development in 788 three-, four-, and five-year olds enrolled in the programs. Pre- and post-tests and teacher evaluation forms were used. A secondary purpose of the study was to determine whether changes occurred in program practices as a result of the files and field test. Children in preschool programs in  which the files were a major source of curriculum made significant gains. The greatest gains were in the academic area, while the most effective utilization of files occured in classroom settings. Expected gains were not achieved by use of both sets of files in day care programs, nor from the use of home-based files in home settings. Staff interviews indicated that teachers became more oriented to the developmental needs of children and more conscious of the need for individual child assessment as a result of their field test participation.

After a discussion of traditional systems and non-graded systems and a summary of some relevant research, the report presents the experience of the Center with this grading system as indicated by the responses of students to a questionnaire. The conclusion was that the CR, CD, CW grading system would: (1) encourage student involvement in setting goals and standards in learning; (2) foster an emphasis on the process of evaluation characterized by ongoing mutual,  critical and supportive exchange among persons engaged in learning (3) encourage creative exploration of ideas with no discredit of learning through error; (4) not penalize a student for academic failure; and (5) establish an atmosphere of broader exchange and challenge between and among faculty and students. A brief report of the same grading system is included, as well as the questionnaire and responses from faculty at schools of education and employers of teachers. (Author/CTM)",

Each model requires the comparison of observed student performance with an estimate of what level of performance would have been achieved without the Title I project. The models differ in the way the non-participation estimate is made. Under Model A the estimate is based on test norms, assuming equal mean pretest and mean posttest percentile ranks. Model B requires the use of an experimental design including a control group. Model C is described as a regression-discontinuity analysis. Only Model A appears to be feasible for most Title I  programs. However, data are presented to challenge the plausibility of the assumption that non-participation would result in the percentile rank of the posttest mean being equal to the percentile rank of the pretest mean; and additional data are presented to challenge the assumption that the use of an equating test might ameliorate this problem. It is proposed that educational evaluation is too immature for fixation on a small set of models. Flexibility is needed. (Author/CTM)",

The instructional units were developed by the Project on Sex Stereotyping in Education in the areas of human growth and development, mathematics education, science education, language arts education, educational history, social studies education, and physical education. Each unit was reviewed by experts in sex stereotyping, subject area, and multi-cultural education. In embarrassment field tests, education students completed questionnaires identifying possible unit improvements. Multiple-choice cognitive tests incorporated alternatives to stereotyped behaviors and myths about males and females. An adaption of the  Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), in which subjects rate themselves on characteristics which are given masculinity, femininity, or androgyny scores, was used as an affective instrument for unit evaluations. The units and evaluation instruments were administered by teacher educators. Results indicated that the units significantly increased subjects' knowledge, but did little to affect scores on the BSRI. Inclusion of periodic revision points, and the incorporation of expert and user reviews are among the strengths of the evaluation design. Design weaknesses include the difficulty of obtaining affective measurement results which are both valid and reliable. (Author/JAC)",

This handbook was created to provide district test coordinatohs with information and assistance in dealing with the public and the press. A chapter on interpreting test results includes information about statistics, percentile ranks, satisfactory results, comparing pupil norms to school or district norms, and questions and answers concerning test results. Guidelines are Provided for reporting results to boards of education, which include  information on report preparation and organization of meetings. The section on use of results for program improvement discusses test reviews, identification of areas of high and low scores, determination of the reflection of test content in curriculum, and recommendations for change. Answers to common questions asked by reporters about test results and sample news releases offer assistance in dealing with the media.

In a comparison of California pupil performance and national student performance, California's second- and third-grade students were determined to be at the 55th and 56th percentile ranks, respectively, compared to the national average. Comparison with 1975-76 California scores showed a slight decline in sixth-grade reading achievement and gains in written expression and mathematics. The same comparison for grade twelve showed a  decline in all three achievement areas. Recommendations for instructional emphasis were included, as well as a subgroup analysis of achievement level by pupils, schools, and districts. Among the background factors considered were sex, English language fluency, occupation of family breadwinner, pupil mobility, entry level test scores, socioeconomic status, school size, type of district, and percent of pupils from families receiving aid for dependent children.

A distinction is made between prior learning, based on experiences that have not been planned with the faculty, and in-program learning, based on experiences that have been formally planned with and sponsored by the faculty. The definition of content must precede such experiences and must control the evaluation. Assessment procedures must be designed and performed by the faculty, but may take a wide variety of forms. They should not make requirements beyond those normally met in the  traditional setting. Assessment techniques include objective or essay examinations, product assessment, job descriptions, certificates, papers, real or simulated job performance, and interviews. Assessment is not complete until it is a part of the official record; it is important to plan record keeping procedures early in the program. (Author/CTM)",

        "description":"Synthetic estimation is a statistical technique that estimates small-area statistics by combining national estimates of the relevant characteristics with estimates of other known characteristics of the small geographic area. The advantages of the synthetic estimation approach to local estimation are its intuitive appeal, its simplicity, and its low cost. A major disadvantage is its possibile lack of sensitivity to certain local characteristics. Another method used for the same purpose is the &quot;nearly unbiased&quot; estimator. The mathematics of both methods are presented, including formulas for estimating mean square error and average mean square error. An evaluation of synthetic estimates is demonstrated by comparing the results of a 50-cell grid with the results from 2, 4, 8, and  16-cell grids. (Author/CTM)",

        "description":"The difficulties in evaluating bilingual education appear to have prevented success in all but a few evaluation attempts, but better and more meaningful evaluation is neccessary in order to identify the strengths and weaknesses of bilingual programs. Many bilingual programs are undergoing constant modification, adequate assessment instruments have been lacking, and political pressures have interfered with evaluation programs. Since it is hard to find individuals who are expert in both evaluation and bilingual education, evaluation teams are recommended rather than individual evaluators. Control groups are not normally available, so quasi-experimental designs must be used. The author recommends the Before-and-After and particularly the Time Series designs. Several precautions are  listed. Independent variables for an evaluation are listed and categorized as contextual variables, student variables, and treatment variables. Dependent variables must reflect the goals or objectives of the bilingual program and must be valid. Good comprehensive documentation is also essential, particularly in longitudinal research. (CTM)",

        "description":"Evaluation is an act of persuasion directed to a specific audience concerning the solution of a problem. The process of evaluation is prescribed by the nature of knowledge--which is generally complex, always uncertain (in varying degrees), and not always propositional--and by the nature of logic, which is always selective. In the process of persuasion one must ascertain who the audience is and find a basis of agreement on premises, both of facts and values, and on presumptions. Two criteria for evaluation are: the most efficient way to a given end, or the most effective use of available resources. Quantitative evaluation methods involve three stages: (1) substantive definition of the problem and its translation into a formal, mathematical model; (2) compilation of information in  terms of the formal model and its formal, logical analysis; and (3) translation of the formal conclusions back into substantive terms. Both formulation and interpretation require good intuitive judgment. The evaluator and the audience must employ their reasoning in a dialogue, and both must assume responsibility, since evaluation is never completely convincing nor entirely arbitrary. The logical arguments used in two works are discussed. The works--Gene V. Glass' review of Michael Scriven's instructional cassette lecture on &quot;Evaluation Skills;&quot; and Scriven's reply--are appended. (Author/CTM)",

The major questions raised by the courts concerning this use of tests are described. Current federal guidelines for performance appraisal systems, as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, are explained and traced to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The legal implications of prima facie discrimination and the assessment of adverse impact upon minorities is explained. The process of judicial validation of performance appraisal systems is discussed, including specific case examples and flow charts. In deciding whether the criteria used in personnel decisions are valid and nondiscriminatory, the courts have utilized predictive, concurrent and content validity  evaluations. The legal preferences and problems associated with each type of validity are described. The role of selection ratios, adverse impact, and business necessity in judicial validity decisions is discussed. The courts are concerned with the statistical correlation between test results and the criterion measures of job performance, and it is felt that the conflicting definitions of test validity and fairness provided by industrial psychologists have caused problems in the courts. The social controversy surrounding civil rights and employment testing is also discussed briefly. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"Minimal competency testing is the most recent evolution of the accountability movement and of the competency based education movement. It focuses on the basic academic skills of reading, writing, and arithemtic. It presumes the state will set educational objectives, and that the local school district will conduct its program so that the objectives will be achieved. It emphasizes minimal objectives for grade promotion or high school graduation. It supposes that a statewide test will determine whether the objectives are attained. It assumes that scientific management of the schools will not only provide equal distribution of opportunities and resources to all children but will also result in all children learning to read, write, and do arithmetic. Growing bureaucratization and  centralization in education are the result of efforts by policymakers to solve educational problems. The author concludes that: (1) higher levels of government should be concerned with promoting equality of educational opportunity; (2) the standards and operation of schools should be the responsibility of local boards of education; and (3) minimal competency testing will not solve the problem of the minority of teachers who fail to teach and the minority of students who fail to learn.

This paper tests the link made between these two by using a data set for selected school districts in California that links pupil enrollment data for public elementary schools to 1970 census data for the population resident in school attendance zones. The first analysis demonstrates a strong but imperfect association between residential segregation and school segregation among school districts that have not implemented extensive desegregation programs. The second analysis explores the complex question of the degree to which the level of ethnic residential segregation among school attendance zones reflects  differentials in socioeconomic measures. The third analysis identifies a pattern of Anglo avoidance of minority school children through both outmigration and use of private schooling. The results call for a broader conceptual and empirical analysis of urban demographic change and its relation to schooling. (Author/AM)",

The questions raised include: (1) All things except labor demand being equal, what are the chances of getting high versus low level jobs if one enters a realistic rather than a social job? (2) When the distribution of job opportunities does not match the distribution of aspirations of job seekers, how can the counselor encourage realism about job opportunities while at the same time helping  individual clients to pursue their aspirations? and (3) Where have women and blacks been most likely to find work in the past and where might opportunities be greatest in the near future? The composition of employment in the U.S. was examined using 1970 data for employed civilians, Holland's occupational typology, and a prestige scale. Results indicate areas where women and blacks are under and over represented. (Author/AM)",

Other objectives of the study included (1) assessing milk waste in schools and factors affecting this waste; (2) updating data from previous surveys on school, food, and milk service operations; and (3) determining the impact of the SMP on the demand for milk in schools. Survey data indicate that the free milk provision had a marked impact on the SMP. This provision changed the SMP from a simple subsidization program with a minimum of administrative burden to a complex and administratively difficult program. A number of schools dropped the program because of the free milk provision.  The impact of the SMP, in general, and the free milk provision, in particular, on the NSLP was negligible. Survey responses indicated that the availability of the SMP did not serve as a deterrent to a school's inaugurating either the NSLP or the Student Breakfast Program (SBP). Survey data showed that both programs increased levels of student milk consumption. Survey data also showed that 88% of all schools, enrolling 90% of the U.S. school population, participated in at least one of the USDA child nutrition programs in January of 1975. (Author/AM)",

The aspects of occupational life considered in this study are perceptions of job satisfaction, relations with colleagues, opportunities for advancement, and discrimination. The data were obtained through face to face interviews with 45 respondents from the five groups. Findings indicate that despite some variation among the groups, the Asian Americans are generally well educated, professionally skilled, employed in prestigious occupations, and have a great deal of job satisfaction. They do not see any overt and blatant work related discrimination against them by the majority population, despite occasional reports of discrimination  against individual Asian Americans. Beyond the work setting, there is little if any interaction between the Asian population and their colleagues and neighbors of the majority population. A major constraining feature of the Asian's work life is the existence of an invisible job ceiling which defines the heights Asian Americans may reach in any organizational or professional hierarchy, limiting them to non policy making positions. Traditional modesty, a feeling of gratefulness toward their host country, and some fear, might be seen as inhibiting forces against expression of any negative feelings about their work lives.

        "description":"The 1954 Brown Vs. Board of Education decision went beyond legal analysis to demonstrate the cruelty and immorality of discrimination against black children. It was asserted in the Brown decision that separate education cannot be equal education, and that segregation has a particularly detrimental effect upon black children. The negative impact of segregated schooling was found to be especially critical, given that education is one of the fundamental values in American society. In small cities and rural areas there has been definite progress made toward school integration. In large urban areas, however, the contrary is true. In addition to increasing disparities between racial composition of city and suburban schools, there is also the fact that within cities minority and non  minority students tend to be separated from each other in terms of school assignments. While the legal system plays an important role in any ultimate solution to the problem of racial segregation in the schools, the courts cannot provide complete and permanent relief. We as a society must be willing to make desegregation in public education a national priority. (Author/GC)",

Program emphasis continued to be on supplementary instruction in the basic skills from the preschool through the elementary and secondary levels. The most obvious trend in the Title I programs and their greatest strength over the past several years is that more monies are being budgeted for instructional personnel compared to other project expenses, thus bringing more individual direct services to target children. Most districts are requiring less assistance in planning and implementing successful programs because they have a better understanding of Title I purposes and because of additional experience in writing Title I projects. Program objectives are being more clearly written and  records are more carefully kept so that meaningful evaluations are being made. Village programs depend on the assistance of native aides. Their training remains one of the greatest needs of Title I programs in Alaska. Activities of the state education agency have included monitoring, workshops, and the construction of a handbook for district administrators. Tables and graphs in this document present enrollment figures, number of staff persons funded by Title I, and total Title I program outlays. Also included are a description and evaluation of three typical district projects: an urban district (Anchorage), a rural district (Kuspuk), and a small town (Cordova). (Author/AM)",

Educational equity involves reducing the predictive value of race, sex, and social class in determining educational achievement. There are three major problems in improving urban education: (1) lack of credibility of urban education researchers; (2) methodological weaknesses in educational research; and (3) the study of issues surrounding the identification and replication of successful school practices. It is noted by the Director of NIE that fortunately there is a growing trust between research organizations and urban school systems. In addition, a variety of research methodologies are increasingly being used to study urban education.  Finally, there is a growing awareness of the problems involved in replicating the characteristics present in successful urban schools to other schools. What can be done once these successful examples of urban schooling are identified remains a challenge for urban education researchers. (Author/AM)",

A review then follows of several surveys which provide data on the learning efforts of adults in varied populations. These surveys are grouped according to their focus under the following categories: geographical areas, older adults, occupational categories, educational level, and peer groups. The author also summarizes a few studies that  focused on motivation, the learner's planning tasks, and persons who help with the planning.

The original project, to improve the operating effectiveness of vocational education advisory committees throughout the state, involved (1) development of a guide to provide inservice education for vocational directors, teacher-educators, teachers, and advisory committee members, (2) a series of fifteen regional workshops to acquaint teachers and administrators with materials and techniques, and (3) utilization of second-party trainers as workshop leaders for a series of additional workshops. Analysis of data showed that 90% of the 900 participants received the Guide for Effective Utilization of  Advisory Committees; three-fourths felt it was useful; vocational administrators expressed a need for more information on the State Plan and ongoing vocational technical programs; many teacher-educators are not updated to developments in the field; advisory committee members are not knowledgeable in some areas of their involvement; and the second-party trainer approach was effective due to the person-to-person communication lines that developed between teachers, administrators, and second-party trainers. Recommendations include continuation of the second-party trainer approach for both inservice and for information dissemination.

Group learning centers were selected as an effective teaching/learning strategy for use in the mainstreamed classroom. Three model plans for using this strategy were developed, pilot-tested, and compared for significant differences between plans in cognitive achievement and in student attitudes. Teaching attitudes toward the teaching/learning strategies were also evaluated. Data revealed that cognitive growth occurred for both the typical and mildly mentally disabled students and that all attitudes toward the learning center strategy were generally positive.

Results of previous evaluation studies reveal several problems, among which were overly technical findings, reports arriving too early or too late, poorly designed evaluations, data requested only to bolster previous positions, etc. Characteristics for the new evaluations involve direct routes to Congress, considerable time allocation, and absence of constraints in the legislation on the design, measures, or analysis. Despite the improvements in the approach to evaluation,  several problems are still encountered: (1) Congress often indirectly affects the evaluation paradigm when committee memberships change, resulting in a lack of knowledge concerning the design of a project and its purpose; (2) although an agency chosen to handle mandated studies needs to be able to quickly hire and fire personnel to procure talent for short periods and to quickly contract work, staffs to manage projects must be accommodated within agency ceilings, job expenditures must be negotiated with Congress, and inhibiting civil service procedure must be followed; (3) difficulty is encountered by evaluation teams who must effect communication with diverse groups within an organization; and (4) mandated studies cannot conflict. Though there is little research on mandated studies, it  is concluded that evaluation cannot evolve quickly and adaptations must be made while the evaluation is in progress. (VB)",

Of the thirty-three states responding to the initial survey, eleven indicated they were working with competency based instruction at the state level. From information gathered from these respondents a competency catalog format was prepared. On May 22, 1978, a conference on curriculum planning for competency based instruction in industrial arts education was  held to assist individuals who had been appointed to advisory committees for the development of competency catalogs. Individuals were trained to work in small groups to advise the writers of catalogs for industrial arts education courses which are included in the Virginia Model Plan for Industrial Arts Education. All materials were reviewed by the Industrial Arts Education Service and will be used by future research groups in their catalog development tasks. It was concluded that competency based instruction is a viable means of improvement and accountability in industrial education for Virginia, and it was recommended that fifteen catalogs of criterion referenced tasks be developed for all approved industrial arts programs for the public schools of Virginia.

        "description":"Based on the National Longitudinal Surveys of over 10,000 men and women aged eighteen to twenty-seven who were interviewed annually from 1966 through 1971, this study investigates how the youth labor market operates and identifies its manpower problems that should be addressed by policymakers. A five-part recursive model is established for the youth labor market consisting of labor market status, wage determination, turnover, duration of subsequent unemployment, and wage growth. It is found that (1) the relationship between educational attainment and subsequent labor market success is striking; (2) education has a positive effect on wages; (3) job tenure is a deterrent to turnover, but job change represents a definite attempt to improve economic position; (4) the duration of  unemployment and wage growth are directly affected by aggregate economic conditions since any decline disproportionately falls on youth, increasing the duration and decreasing their earning potential; (5) workers generally do not remain in jobs below their capabilities; and (6) competitive forces rule the youth job market with productive capabilities being rewarded and workers who initially earn less than their potential increasing their wages over time. Comparisons are drawn between early market entrants and college-goers, the employed and unemployed, blacks and whites, men and women, married and unmarried workers, and particular occupations.

Several steps were followed in the development process, including the creation of a flow chart of the study activities, a literature review, and the identification and location of previous students and their employers. (Since tracking former students and employers is the most time consuming and expensive of these steps, a college wishing to conduct such a survey needs to have an easy-to-use and accurate data system.) A two-page survey form was produced, of which the first page covers general topics  and is applicable to any college program while the second page focuses on specific curriculum questions. Because of its design, it can be used by any community college occupational program (1) to acquire meaningful information from employers which can be applied to program review and planning, (2) to involve a technology advisory committee in the follow-up process, and (3) to satisfy both the instructional needs of the college program and the guidelines of the state and federal governments.

The data used is from published and unpublished government statistics, a survey of 5,000 1970 immigrants, and interviews with 254 of the 1970 cohort. The first three chapters provide the historical, demographic, and legislative background for the 400,000 immigrants that arrive on the average annually. Chapters 4 and 5 focus on the 1970 cohort of immigrants, discussing their earnings, personal characteristics, motivation for immigration, and labor market experiences. Whenever possible, comparisons are drawn between the 1970 immigrants and other groups of immigrants as well as between the general population and the  immigrants. It is reported that (1) although most immigrants come to the U.S. for economic reasons, the majority are admitted for familial, not labor-related, reasons; (2) their demographic profile closely resembles the general population in age mix, educational level, and marital status; (3) their earnings increase in the U.S., and they work fewer hours; (4) female immigrants quickly earn as much as their peers while the males more slowly approach equity; and (5) substantial occupational change occurs for the immigrants, much of which is downward. The report concludes with recommendations for legislation to aid immigrants in the labor market and to change U.S. immigration policies. (ELG)",

Their education/training divided them into three groups: (1) postsecondary vocational (PSV), (2) secondary vocational (SV), and (3) academic/general (AG). The focuses of the study were (1) graduates' perceptions of their training, (2) employers' perceptions of graduates' training, and (3) comparisons of graduates' perceptions of quality of life. Each of the three focuses was assigned variables  to accumulate data for comparative analyses, the data being collected through telephone interviews, employer surveys, and mailout questionnaires. The data analyses showed that PSV graduates more than SV or AG graduates were satisfied with their vocational training, possessed attitudinal qualities employers seek in their employees, had a tendency toward feelings of depression, etc. Both PSV graduates and SV graduates appeared characterized by low esteem for academic programs and attaining higher incomes than AGs during the first five years following graduation, whereas AGs had higher esteem for academic programs and had more reliance on internal control of self.

An analysis of need showed that according to 1976 population estimates youth between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one number 36,940 in the BOS area, that data is lacking on high school dropouts age fourteen to twenty-one and on the annual number dropping out from high schools, and that juveniles were arrested for 65% of the burglaries, 56% of larceny thefts, 65% of vandalism, and 52% of liquor law violations. Barriers to employment were seasonality of many jobs,  lack of fluency in English, inadequacy of transportation facilities in rural areas, alcoholism, personal problems, resistance to cultural change, employer prejudice, etc. (The five Alaskan target communities are analyzed separately according to needs resources and population; also, tables are included, after which goals and resultant objectives are listed [e.g., Goal: The student drop out, retention, and GED enrollment rates within the target areas will be affected significantly as a result of the YETP effort; Objective: At least 15% of the identified population will secure GED equivalency in the first nine months of program operation].)

Although the problem is widespread throughout the country, it is greatest in urban areas and affects blacks at a higher rate than whites. Youths suffer from such severe joblessness because (1) they are new entrants to the labor market and lack experience and seniority; (2) their proportion in the total population has risen since the late 1950's; (3) they lack adequate training and job skills; (4) they encounter discrimination  against their age and, if non-white, against their race as well; (5) the work they often can obtain is the lowest on the job scale; and (6) the increase in the minimum wage adversely affects their employment. To alleviate this situation, Congress enacted the Youth Employment and Training Act in 1977 as an amendment to the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). The role of vocational education was not considered in this legislative action and needs to be defined. (Statistical tables are included in both the text and appendix.) (ELG)",

        "description":"Using the National Longitudinal Survey of young women aged 14 to 24 in 1968 who were interviewed annually over a five-year period, a study was conducted to examine the relative importance of economic and noneconomic factors in determining the likelihood of marital disruption for young black and white women. A literature review showed that previous research lacked an interdisciplinary approach. The major economic factors examined consisted of the husband's earnings, improvements in financial position, debt accumulation, welfare accessibility, the woman's income, and number of hours worked per week. The demographic and social variables considered were the woman's education, age, duration of marriage, childbearing, growing up in a broken home, and urban/rural residence. Also the  ease with which one can obtain a divorce in the state of residence was analyzed. It was found that (1) direct economic factors are less important as determinants of marital breakdown than socioeconomic background and demographic factors; (2) educational attainment, coming from a broken home, age, and duration of marriage are the most influential determinants; (3) racial differences are not significant. Topics for future research on this subject are suggested. (ELG)",

By contrast, a program which derives from the mutual responsibility between a nation and its young people makes no class distinctions yet accomplishes both economic and sociological objectives.

Sexism refers to rigidly prescribed and therefore limiting roles for either sex. The American school, since its beginning, has been given the responsibility for teaching attitudes and values and for preparing young people for successful personal, occupational, and social adjustment. In preparing girls and boys for traditional sex roles, the school has been reflecting the society that maintains it. Feminists argue that schools must now take a more decisive role in shaping society in new and truly egalitarian directions that will guarantee full personhood for every child, male or female. This booklet discusses the pervasiveness of sex stereotypes, the roles of the  school and of parents in socialization, sexism in curricular materials, sexism in school organization, teacher training for change, and a direct teaching strategy focusing on women's studies.

In an alternate procedure called Differential Reinforcement of Other Responses (DRO), a reinforcing stimulus is delivered when a particular response is not emitted for a specific interval of time. This study compares the effectiveness of these two procedures in reducing four types of inappropriate behaviors. Subjects were eight residents of a state hospital's adolescent unit. Results show DRO as significantly more effective than response-cost procedures in reducing swearing. Moreover, one of the response-cost procedures utilized resulted in slight increases in the frequencies of two of the other three targeted behaviors. Based on these results the  authors recommend that treatment personnel explore the use of less aversive and possibly more effective positive contingencies. (Author)",

Participants  whose group member indicated that they were equally effective rather than less effective or more effective than the controlling bargainer more often reached an agreement. Results were interpreted as suggesting that persons resist control influence attempts as a way of asserting that they are independent, capable persons and that persons are more motivated to appear superior or to avoid appearing inferior when their relationship is competitive rather than cooperative.

Considerable research indicates that psychiatric prediction of dangerous behavior is rather inaccurate, the principal error being one of overprediction. Inaccuracy may result, in part, from the psychiatrist's role in the health care organization. The Mental Health Associate (MHA) role, not sharing some of these structural disadvantages, is hypothesized to yield more accurate predictions of patient \"dangerousness.\" However, a follow-up study of clients originally assessed on potential dangerousness indicated MHA predictions did not significantly differentiate between those actually manifesting dangerous behavior and those who did not. Further investigation  revealed that incidence of stress events was significantly associated with the occurrence of dangerous behavior during the follow-up period and influences the accuracy of MHA assessments. MHA predictions significantly differentiate those manifesting dangerous behavior and those who do not when stress is low during the follow-up period. Under high stress conditions, MHA predictions are less accurate. Implications for the process of attributing dangerousness for involuntary commitment are discussed. (Author)",

(2) Clients with limited social assets (education, jobs, attractiveness) might profit from attention to these areas first, before their intrapsychic problems are approached. (3) Therapy dependent on a lot of client talk is inappropriate for independent males and dependent females.

Two detailed questionnaires were completed by 361 women attending three Detroit area universities. Of the 361 respondents, 33 of them had not remained in school for more than three consecutive semesters since their return and were considered \"drop-outs.\"\"Successful\" students had either already graduated or were still in school. Hypotheses were proposed to identify variables that would distinguish drop-outs from successful students. It was anticipated that drop-outs (1) would experience more stress; (2) would receive less support from their husbands; and (3) would feel less positive about their marriages than would successful students. The chi  square test of significance was employed to test the differences between the two groups. Hypothesis I was upheld. Hypothesis II, testing husband support, yielded less clear-cut results. Responses involving the third hypothesis (attitude toward marriage) were also mixed. It was concluded that despite the problems and strains encountered in returning to school, the impact of education on these women has been profound and the benefits well worth the costs. (Author)",

        "description":"As interest in open education has increased, so have demands for systematic evaluative research on its effects. There now exists a fairly sizable body of work on academic and psychological effects of open classroom teaching. In 1975, the author reviewed the relevant literature and summarized it in a monograph published by the North Dakota Study Group on Evaluation. In late 1977, he searched the literature again and located nearly 100 additional studies which had either appeared in the intervening two years or been inadvertently overlooked in the previous review. This paper updates the review of the open classroom's effects with respect to academic achievement, self-concept, attitude toward school, creativity, independence and conformity, curiosity, locus of control, cooperation,  and several other variables. Evaluation research on open classroom teaching is difficult to summarize concisely because the findings are mixed. For most of the outcome variables assessed, more studies favored open than traditional classroom children. Evaluation research can continue to play both a formative role in improving quality of ongoing open classroom programs, and a summative role in documenting relative strengths and weaknesses of open and traditional approaches.

        "description":"The development of self-disclosure within an acquaintance exercise was examined. A sample of 80 subjects was assigned to same-sex or mixed-sex dyads. In half of the dyads, one member was asked, through a short statement in the written instructions, to encourage maximal disclosure in his/her partner. Dyad partners took turns discussing self-selected topics from a 72-item list of intimacy-rated choices. The resulting design allowed for testing the effects of sex-pairing, leader instructions, and subject sex on the intimacy of disclosure and the extent of reciprocity. Sex-pairing had no effect upon any measures. Leader instruction dyads showed significant linear and cubic trends in increasing intimacy over time, while the non-leader instruction dyads showed no temporal trends. Male  subjects tended to disclose at levels somewhat higher than females. Generally, subject reciprocity was found unrelated to experimental factors, although one significant interaction between subject sex and leader condition is discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that counseling students will be most inclined to develop and later use those skills which they perceive as being valuable. For example, if students consider display of warmth a characteristic which distinguishes effective from ineffective counselors, it is more likely that once graduated the students will display warmth to their clients, irrespective of how valid this perception of the effects of displaying warmth might be. Clearly then, counseling students' perceptions regarding characteristics of effective counselors should be of interest to counselor educators. To examine these perceptions, all students enrolled in counselor education at a large university were asked to rate the extent to which 35 adjectives were descriptive of each of  four counselor types. The ratings were analyzed using a principal components procedure. Differences in the student ratings were identified and discussed. Findings have implications for programs training students for the helping professions. (Author)",

Two time periods were selected for examination: 1959-1962 and 1974-1976. The first time period represents the \"heyday\" of parent-child relations research by child researchers. The second time period is representative of current research efforts by both professional groups, and  provides a sufficient time lapse from the earlier period to reflect the emerging trends in the two journals. Each journal had 17 articles randomly selected during each of the time periods.

The clients were five junior and senior high school students and one parent whose concerns lay in the areas of vocational and personal-social counseling. Mahl's Non-Ah Speech Disturbance Ratio was used to identify 10 points of high and low anxiety in each of 10 interviews. These points were then rated for level of offered empathy based on the Bergin-Solomon Revision of the Truax  Accurate Empathy Scale. ANOVAs revealed no significant anxiety level effects on empathy level or interrogation. The effects of anxiety level upon structuring behavior and &quot;activity not relevant to the task of counseling&quot; approached commonly accepted levels of statistical significance. Some counselor effects were significant. Implications for further research were discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"Empathy has been defined in a number of different ways. Some, such as Sarbin and Flavell, have emphasized the cognitive aspects of empathy by defining it as the ability to take-the-role-of-the-other. Others, such as Stewart, Borke, Iannotti, and Feshbach, have emphasized the affective processes involved in empathy. Although it is difficult, perhaps even impossible, totally to separate and distinguish cognitive and affective components as they interact in the actual expression of empathy, it may be that the significance and impact of these separate components of empathic ability will be found to vary under different conditions. Separation of the concept of empathy into components can serve to aid counselor trainees to apprehend and implement empathic behavior in their counseling.  Finally, recognition of the complex nature of these cognitive and affective components of the empathy concept should enhance the counselor's awareness of, and effective communication with, others whose skills in this area may differ from his own.

One current approach is the individualized reading program, in which children read trade books; such a program is built around individual conferences devoted to the accomplishment of individual objectives. A second approach, the Wisconsin Design for Reading Skill Development, provides individualized instruction by means of individualized skill assessment in six major reading areas. The Individually Prescribed Method of Instruction (IPI) is based on continuous progress, mastery of needed skills, achievement in subject matter, programmed instruction, systems analysis, and behavioral objectives. Traditional programs involve grouping children according to reading level  and using basal readers, teachers' manuals, workbooks, and supplementary materials; such programs have been found to have definite strengths. Inservice programs should be designed to help improve reading instruction, but their number is decreasing because of budgetary problems. Finally, one type of reading improvement program in existence is that offered in colleges to help students improve their reading and study skills. (GW)",

In experiment one, subjects in grades four, five, and six were assessed on their ability to recall polysemous words and identify their meanings after having read them in sentence contexts. When words were assigned their primary sense in the sentences, subjects remembered them and their meanings better than when they had been used in a secondary sense. There were reading ability effects but no grade differences. Experiments two and three confirmed the inability of third and fourth grade children to use context to identify secondary meanings of words. Experiment three showed, in addition, that children cannot assess accurately whether they have chosen a correct meaning for a word. The three  experiments indicate that children in elementary school frequently misremember the context when a secondary meaning of the word is referenced in a sentence and also fail to choose correct secondary meanings. It is apparent that the presence of polysemous words in text materials is one source of comprehension difficulty. (Author)",

After reading stories written in either chronological or flashback sequence, subjects made a decision about the underlying order of occurrence of two events. Responses were consistently faster and more accurate on chronological sequences under three conditions of testing: immediately after reading, after a ten-second unfilled interval, and after a ten-second filled interval. It was also shown that decisions about input order were easier than decisions about underlying order when the stories contained flashbacks. These data indicate that subjects based their responses on a memory representation which preserved the input sequence of events. An additional finding was that decisions were easier when  the events in the story had a logical progression rather than an arbitrary ordering, demonstrating an influence of prior knowledge.

The major problem in the study of reading is that the reading model on which pedagogy is based is inconsistent with this view of persons. The view that reading is a skills-determined, linear process in which readers decode, process, and retrieve information is based on a computer model and implies that skills teaching should be preeminent. Reading is not a linear process, however, but a cyclical and synergistic activity, an interaction between the reader, content, and strategies; this model is more promising as a teaching model than is the linear model. The teaching of reading must consider the relation of the text to the readers' understandings and attitudes as well as strategies; these  strategies do not develop in isolation from their use. Specific recommendations from this theory include the following: select texts that are meaningful to the reader; recognize that learning to read is a lifelong process; affect the reader's knowledge, feelings, and inclinations about the reading task; encourage students to see the relationship between text and previous knowledge, suggest and model strategies that are appropriate to the text; provide much reading opportunity in school; use content area readings; and recognize that comprehension may not be testable by standard measures.

        "description":"Since 1974 the Appalachian Education Satellite Program, which is described in this report, has delivered graduate level teacher training courses in diagnostic and prescriptive reading and in career education to elementary and secondary teachers in remote areas of Appalachia. Evaluation of the courses has focused on determining how they affected participants' learning and attitudes, the effectiveness of the learning activities and methods of presentation, the reliability of the equipment, the overall course evaluations, and the way the results compare with the results of previous deliveries of the course. This report presents the results of the 1977 deliveries of the two types of courses to elementary teachers. For each course, it provides a course overview and lists topics and  objectives for the individual programs in the course, discusses procedures and instruments used in the course evalaution, and presents the evaluation results. The report includes numerous tables and provides samples of such materials as attitude and background questionnaires, instructional activities rating forms, and equipment report and student satisfaction forms completed by teachers.

This paper first discusses six distinct processes in the CEA: setting a specific purpose for communicating, expressing oneself by speaking, recording speech, reading what has been spoken, revising what has been read, and using the written product in a real situation. The paper notes that the process of skill development is integrated into each of the six processes. A sample instructional plan is then provided to show how the CEA might be used by a group of students in planning a telephone inquiry about a job advertisement.

In this paper, the definition, validation, and use of domains are described, and one strategy for developing domain-referenced measures is proposed. The strategy involves identifying a plausible candidate domain, identifying prototypic items from that domain, specifying relevant variables thought to affect the difficulty of responding correctly to those items, creating sample items, and verifying the domain empirically. An attempt was made to implement this strategy in measuring &quot;ability to find the main point of a passage.&quot; In general, the strategy seems to be a useful approach to test development and theory  refinement, in that it effectively samples and screens variables affecting performance in the domain. On the basis of this study, suggestions are made for further research on finding the main point, and appropriate next steps in developing domain-referenced measures are proposed. (Author)",

In the second study, high school juniors and seniors were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: a questioning-with-training group, an untrained questioning group, or a read-reread control group. Verbal ability, as measured by the &quot;Wide Range Vocabulary Test,&quot; was used to group subjects ex post facto into three levels of verbal ability. Two sessions of approximately 50 minutes each were used for training  and testing the subjects. The first day was devoted to training the experimental groups and administering the verbal ability test. On the second day, students studied two 450-word passages and were tested over their content. Findings from one of the studies showed a significant main effect for treatment in favor of questioning-with-training. Further, results from both studies indicate that student generation of questions during study is more effective for lower than for higher verbal ability students. (Author)",

A major goal is to represent the plot structure of stories about characters who interact. Much of the complexity of such stories arises because the story is about a conflict between the goals of two characters. A person in conflict with another may try to conceal a conflict or to deceive the other into acting in a particular way. A character may thus construct a plan that is intended to be believed by  the other but that is not actually carried out. Such a &quot;virtual plan&quot; plays a central role in &quot;Hansel and Gretel.&quot; Deception and differing beliefs of this kind are a common feature of stories in which characters interact.

The first perspective sees writing as a communicative act. The observation that to write is to communicate, though commonplace, has major and sometimes surprising implications for a theory of writing. It forces a focus on the active role of the reader and leads to an emphasis on the audience in choosing tasks for beginning writers. The second perspective sees writing in the context of a taxonomy of communicative acts. Differences between writing and conversing, writing and lecturing, writing a play and writing a story have important theoretical and practical implications. The third perspective focuses on writing as a decomposable process whose product must  still fulfill an overall communicative function. To this end, various subprocesses of writing are sequentially analysed, including discovering and manipulating ideas and generating text at different structural levels. (Author/AA)",

        "description":"The minimal comprehension principle asserts that the act of comprehension must entail an interaction between an incoming linguistic message and the reader's world knowledge. An analysis of current tests of reading comprehension indicates that test passages are likely to draw broadly from knowledge of the world, so that some of the variability in test performance must be attributable to differences in prior knowledge rather than to differences in reading skills. Most tests of reading comprehension currently in use do not distinguish between these two sources of variability. This does not affect their usefulness as predictive instruments but greatly restricts the use of the tests for diagnosis of reading difficulties or assessment of educational gains. Optimal tests for these  purposes would reduce variability due to prior knowledge or reasoning ability. Various suggestions for achieving this control are in need of empirical verification. (AA)",

The first experiment showed an inability of children to parse sentences meaningfully. Younger children made irregular markings while many of the older children limited themselves to units identified by commas. The second experiment determined that shortening or segmenting sentences increased reading time but decreased error rates. An interaction showed that these text manipulations improved only low ability readers' scores.

In experiment one, the target sentences followed either short or long contexts which induced either literal interpretations or metaphorical ones. Results indicated that only in the short context condition did subjects take significantly longer to understand metaphorical than literal targets. This interaction is explained in terms of the availability of appropriate schemata for interpreting the target. In experiment two, targets were phrases that could be given either an idiomatic or a literal interpretation. It was found that the comprehension of phrases receiving an idiomatic interpretation took no longer than the comprehension of  those same phrases when given a literal interpretation, and there was some evidence that idiomatic interpretations were consistently faster. It is argued that both experiments can be accounted for in terms of contextually generated expectations. The processes required for the comprehension of figurative and literal uses of language seem to be essentially similar. (Author)",

Increasing numbers of capable readers are choosing not to read. This problem is indicated by a 1969 survey that found that 58% of United States adults have never finished a book, and a 1973 study that indicated that only 26% of adults read magazines. Even in school and at work, very little reading is done. Minimum standards programs deal with symptoms but not with such causes as the ever-rising standard of literacy to be met by readers or the problem of poor parental modeling in reading in the home. A balanced program for the solution to aliteracy must include these three emphases: (1) functional literacy must  be viewed as a changing level of ability relative to changing job expectations. (2) The ability to continue learning must be recognized as a basic skill in view of the high likelihood of job change and consequent retraining needs. (3) Since aliterate individuals are likely to fall short of the demands of continued learning and to be poor reading models to their children, schools must emphasize the development of positive reading habits and attitudes among future parents.

When confronted with ethical questions concerning their administrators, colleagues, or students, educators often adopt the stance that &quot;it is never too wise to be too honest.&quot; Honesty, however, is the beginning of ethics. Educators who see a conflict between ethical behavior and practical considerations might be guided by the philosophers Thoreau, Kant, and Nietzsche, among others, whose writings contain a clear call for honesty and courage. Thoughtful action is needed in all times; and whether or not educators engage in such action they cannot escape the state of their ethics being mirrored in their daily words. On a scale  ranking the amount of freedom for integrity found in various occupations, Stuart Chase places that of professors at the midway point. Yet tenure provides educators with the academic freedom to ask ethical questions about such practices as neglecting students and teaching in order to do empty research; overtesting students; avoiding the real causes of illiteracy; ignoring the real needs of students, teachers, and administrators; questioning false methods and misleading claims; and handling censorship. If educators, even with tenure, find it too difficult to ask disturbing ethical questions and confront the answers, perhaps every school throughout the world should establish a loyal opposition, a person or group whose responsibility it is to ask trenchant ethical questions.

Purposes for writing, which may be correlated with the many decisions and selections made in the writing act, are different from those of speech and also differ between various writing modes. An adequate writing model will include explicit strategies for making good decisions. Linguistic research has shown that grammar is related to systems of meaning and language use by the establishment of priorities; sentences typically include both previously known and new material, and information priorities  within sentences can be analyzed. To plan whole texts, a writer must be trained in forming hierarchies of topics. The writer can make the message as strong as possible by considering reader backgrounds and expectations and by tailoring his or her approach to logical arrangement accordingly. Explicit knowledge of the decision making processes in writing and of the prospective consequences of those decisions is of key importance in writing well; such knowledge is a great part of good style and correct usage.

The guide then suggests ways of helping students study heroes and heroines in folk literature, discusses epic conventions that may be treated in class, suggests a sample unit on heroes and heroines, and explains ways of helping students study the epic poem &quot;Beowulf.&quot; Additional discussions show how the special needs of gifted students may be met by providing units on decision making, the Prometheus theme in literature, and fantasy literature. The conclusion of the guide points to adjustments and academic problems frequently faced  by gifted students and stresses the importance of creating educational programs designed to meet their special needs.

This paper discusses the procedures used in selecting the essays to be rewritten, rewriting them, and having them evaluated; it then reports the results of the study, examines the relationship between the holistic ratings and the raters' perceptions of the papers' strengths or weaknesses in each of the rewritten categories, and discusses the results and their pedagogical significance.

A survey, conducted to determine present attitudes toward the advertising person, involved 70 advertising majors and an equal number of other college undergraduates; all completed questionnaires assigning certain personality traits to advertising persons. Results indicated that the traits most associated with advertising persons are &quot;original&quot; and &quot;creative,&quot; and that most of the subjects considered such persons to be bright, energetic, extroverted, trendsetters, and interested in ideas. However, a negative note was indicated by the fact that a large percentage of both groups considered advertising persons to be glib, superficial,  aggressive, neurotic, opportunistic, and heavy drinkers. Negative opinions among advertising majors tended to increase with training, reflecting educators' concern that the single most important problem in teaching advertising in the university is the perceived disreputability of the profession.

Differential psychologists investigate basic traits from which observed behavior is thought to be generated, but if thinking is viewed as a problem in information handling, research will more profitably focus on the relationship between behavior in handling problems of linguistic information processing and behavior on verbal aptitude tests. This will account for the way information processes vary between individuals. The recommended model of reading is based on a series of stages: decoding, active memory, sentence processing, and analysis using long-term memory. Differences in verbal competence have much to do with strictly mechanical components, particularly automatic structural  processes such as decoding and short-term memory capacity, the ability to control attention, and the use of strategies, all of which are components of individual mental competence. The measures which would be expected to be important in information processing are roughly associated with general mental and verbal competence. (Tables and references are included.) (DF)",

The model is designed to account for change within social systems rather than in individuals, although it would also be consistent with information processing and attitude change models. Setting is defined by complex interactions between cultural objects and between these elements and the innovations. The associational structure of the model makes possible increased predictability of future changes because it takes into account all situation-specific relations affecting the actions of a society. Longitudinal multidimensional scaling is the preferred method for providing accurate measures of  alterations. The model is useful for future research into diffusion of innovation phenomena, requiring a continual measurement from the start of the process; this is necessary if the mathematical model is to be tested realistically.

Contract grading can provide the means to reduce the element of threat that impedes effective interpersonal communication between teacher and student. Contract grading is a business like arrangement whereby the instructor defines the performance for each grade to be earned and the student identifies the grade to which he or she will work. Together they sign a contract which commits the instructor to award the grade if the student performs at the specified level. This system of grading is a means to the goal of achieving a classroom climate conducive to supportive interaction and is based on the premise that instruction will be systematically  designed and executed. In this document, the first section is theoretical and deals with the advantages and disadvantages of the system. The second, practical section contains several model contracts which may be used at the secondary and college levels. (DF)",

With genuine consensus, a unit tends to willingly support and implement the new policy. After analyzing how observed small groups had actually reached consensus, the following ten techniques were developed: (1) orient the group, (2) insist on true consensus, (3) maintain your position as long as it is valid, (4) seek out differences in opinion, (5) remain open to other opinions, (6) be willing to compromise, (7) contribute frequently to the discussion, (8) use group pronouns rather than personal pronouns, (9) give adequate information, and (10) clarify the discussion. A study of group decision making showed that groups that followed  these ten techniques were significantly more successful in reaching a consensus, and members of the successful groups were significantly more satisfied with their own performance and the performance of their group. Groups that achieve true consensus have a better chance of making the right decision at the first attempt. (JF)",

        "description":"In the past five years, unprecedented discussion and analysis have been focused on mass media in the third world. Common topics include development journalism, the New Information Order, cultural invasion and exchange, and ruralization of media. Ethical considerations for first world involvement in third world media have arisen in several areas. To thrust sophisticated technological and economic systems on the media of developing countries encourages them to bypass intermediate stages of development, thus fostering exploitation and dependency. The mass media have been treated as the playthings of the urban elite, often for frivolous reasons, while the needs of the rural majority have been ignored. The promotion of foreign-oriented content in third world mass media causes these  societies to be passive recipients of distorted, inadequate, and biased information. The concept of development journalism has, in practice, meant \"government say-so\" journalism, resulting in authoritarian media policies. To conduct mass communications training and research in the framework of urbanized nations, rather than looking at indigenous needs and problems, leads to cultural imperialism. Two camps, aligned with Eastern and Western ideologies, have formed on either side of these issues. (DF)",

However, persuasion and virtue in Aristotle's theory of rhetoric have connections deriving from the nature of the art of rhetoric itself. The ideal practitioner of rhetoric employs the skills and qualities of &quot;phronesis,&quot; or practical wisdom, as outlined in the &quot;Nichomachean Ethics.&quot; Three arguments support this contention. (1) The definitions and concerns of the concepts of rhetoric and phronesis are strikingly similar. (2) Excellent performance of rhetoric requires the characteristics of practical wisdom. (3) The relationships desired between the  person of practical wisdom and the public closely parallel the relationships between the rhetorician and the audience. The interpretation of the ethical stance of the &quot;Rhetoric&quot; must rely on important theoretical and practical relationships between rhetoric and phronesis. The person of practical wisdom has the capacity and the incentive to be an ideal rhetorician. Only when practical wisdom is applied to rhetoric is there the ideal situation in which the name &quot;rhetorician&quot; denotes excellence both of artistry and of purpose. (DF)",

This book describes the status and potential of mass communication instruction in secondary schools. Following an introductory chapter on understanding mass communication, the second chapter reports the results of a study in which 50 state officers of education were polled regarding the status of such instruction in their schools. Chapter three deals with the relationship between mass communication and personal development. In chapter four, the assessment of value-laden mass communication is discussed, and chapter five addresses the institutional approach to the study of  mass media, the organization of media as indicators of priorities. Chapter six is devoted to the vocational approach to the teaching of the subject, aiming at preparing students for a career. The use of co-curricular activities to provide additional training and experience for the interested student is the topic of chapter seven. Chapter eight addresses the administrative problems of developing and maintaining a program, especially costs and staffing. Appendixes include the survey questionnaire and data and a list of competencies for prospective staff in mass communication. (DF)",

Games are activities in which people agree to abide by a set of conditions in order to attain a desired state or end, and simulations are activities that model reality.

Theoretical considerations include the following: the purpose of using games and simulations; disadvantages and cautions in the use of these activities; criteria for selecting an exercise; the process of implementing an  activity, including connecting the experience to students' lives and evaluating performance; and creating and modifying original games or simulations. In the practice section, a number of games and simulations are described that relate to theories and concepts in the field of speech communication; all were created by high school and college teachers and students.

This report analyzes data on the number and character of program participants, the quality of programs, and student achievement in schools receiving funds from one or more of these sources. The evaluation reveals that over a million students were served and that the number of volunteers involved in school programs more than doubled over the previous school year. Students participating in funded programs tended to be more mobile or transient, more likely  to speak second languages, and of lower socioeconomic background than those not served, making comparisons with students in nonparticipating programs inappropriate. Program ratings tended to be good, particularly in grades with ECE funding. Student achievement generally averaged above national norms. Results of two special studies designed to examine indepth the characteristics of ECE schools with increasing and decreasing test scores are also presented. Discussion of the data reported is clarified through use of numerous tables. (Author/PGD)",

This plan is intended to enhance intradistrict communication, provide a context for planning, help establish accountability, allow for the assessment of school and district programs and personnel, and generally clarify the administrative process. Mandated by state law, the two-part plan calls first for a permanent framework of procedures and policies for providing information about the program; for establishing and involving school site councils; for phasing-in schools; for serving students with special needs; for approving, evaluating, and terminating school programs; and for approving requests for released time. The second part of the plan requires the  district to provide an annual description of its program's status. Districts must provide assurance that they will meet requirements for distributing information, providing staff development and school organization activities, inventorying community-based learning, and waiving curriculum requirements for secondary students of proved proficiency. Clarifications and suggestions for implementation are integrated into the statement of planning requirements. (Author/PGD)",

Questionnaires returned by county and district school superintendents and superintendents of community college districts in California reported current levels of liability coverage. The data, covering a period from 1974-75 through 1977-78, reveal that, although premiums have increased over 300 percent, the market for primary coverage is becoming more limited and insurance companies prefer providing excess coverage to basic coverage. While claims made against insurance were higher than the cost  of premiums in 1974-75, by 1976-77 claims amounted to only half the cost of premiums. High school districts, however, consistently made claims higher than their premium costs. Other data, shown in extensive tables, cover deductibles and significant exclusions of coverage. County-wide insurance policies in three counties are treated separately. The questionnaire is included, as are the respondents' suggestions for solutions to the insurance problem. (Author/PGD)",

The model examines the likely effect of the four options, differing in the choice of targets (low-income versus low-achievement pupils) as well as in the method of allocation (block versus matching grant). The general conclusions are that each program is capable of raising the average level of spending on pupils in the target groups to more than the average level spent on nontarget groups; that there is little difference in the amount of aid or the level of expenditure under the different options; that the grants based on a low-income  target appear to be more effective than grants based on a low-achievement target in directing aid to districts with a very large number of low achievers; and that matching grants are more effective per dollar of federal aid in increasing total educational spending. These findings bring into sharp focus the issue of whether compensatory education grants are to be thought of as aid to pupils or to communities. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"An interesting econometric problem is to decide whether any given state in the budget process is an example of the political or the bureaucratic model of budgeting. The current paper presents a method of deciding this question and then uses it to study local governmental spending on education. The method is based on the important difference between the effect of intergovernmental aid that is implied by the political budget model and by the bureaucratic model. According to the bureaucratic model, the effect of aid on each category of education input depends only on the change in total educational spending induced by the aid. In contrast, the political budget model implies that the overall expenditure increase is the result of separate decisions on each of the expenditure  categories and that the changes in these expenditure categories will depend on the form of the aid. Evidence from examination of data from 105 Massachusetts school districts shows quite clearly that the categorical budgets of the school districts are determined by a political process rather than by the bureaucracy of the school systems. The pattern of educational expenditure as well as its total is thus directly responsive to the preferences of the electorate. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"The purpose of the present paper is to measure the effectiveness of a differential add-on grant program, Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The evidence presented shows that this kind of grant program does increase local spending by much more than would be expected of a traditional block grant. The point estimate of the national sample is that 72 cents of each dollar of Title I funds is used to increase school spending. Although the additional specifications that have been estimated suggest that the effectiveness of Title I aid in stimulating local spending may vary among different types of school districts, the estimates support the conclusion that between 50 and 100 percent of the total Title I budget is added to local school spending. These results support  the idea that differential add-on grants do operate in a unique way that deserves attention in the general analysis of intergovernmental aid. It would be valuable to examine other federal and state aid programs to assess whether the effectiveness of block grants in other fields is consistent with this distinction between differential and general add-on grants.

        "description":"One of 52 theoretical papers on school crime and its relation to poverty, this chapter presents four moralization paradigms (psychoanalytic, social learning, humanistic, and cognitive-developmental) as explanatory hypotheses for the relationship between poverty and school crime. The paper takes the position that no one paradigm is sufficient to account completely for school crime. Each paradigm is useful in explaining the moral orientations found both within and between individuals involved in school crime. Recent work in moral education is presented under each of the paradigms as a source for the prevention and control of school crime. It is concluded that an awareness of the complexities involved in the moral orientations of youth is a necessary first step in the development of  broad-based approaches to the prevention and control of school crime.

        "description":"One of 52 theoretical papers on school crime and its relation to poverty, this chapter, by utilizing ethnographic data, develops an understanding of the interrelationships among administrative styles, deterrence, commitment, and disruption. The effect of change in administrative styles on the character of order and disruption in a desegregated southern high school is examined. The concern of this paper is primarily with control systems and their effects, and not with the incidence of misbehavior. The data were drawn from an ongoing ethnographic study geared to investigate the process of interracial schooling. Additional data are presented from an ethnography of another high school in a different southern city to facilitate the formulation of conclusions. The paper concludes that  a highly representative governance system fosters commitment in the vast majority of school participants. The participants have a major role in making and revising the rules, and, thus, when caught violating them, they are hard pressed to question the legitimacy of those rules. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"One of 52 theoretical papers on school crime and its relation to poverty, this chapter focuses solely on changes in student crimes in the period from 1950 to 1975. A number of observations are made about student violence. First, assaults against teachers have increased sharply in the past 25 years in absolute numbers, but not in the percent of teachers assaulted. Further, \"assault\" is so loosely defined that no clear picture of changes in the intensity of assaults can be developed. Second, fires in schools represent the single most costly act students can perpetrate; costs from fires are increasing more rapidly than the value of all school property. Third, vandalism probably increased in this country up to the early 1970s, and has declined since that time in both cost and  frequency, but may have increased in intensity. Fourth, estimates of the costs of crimes occurring in schools varies widely, depending on the group collecting the information and the methodology used for computing the figures. The paper concludes with discussions of probable future actions of pupils, of local schools, and of school security offices. (Author/MLF)",

Program areas explored are organizational modification, curricular/instructional programs, security systems, and counseling services. Specific programs fitting into each category are discussed. The paper concludes that programs of many different kinds are needed to deal effectively with problems of crime and violence in schools. Although there was no striking difference in outcomes between programs that assume competence and those that  do not, the author points out that this was not a research project but a cataloging of programs appearing in the literature. The author cautions that youths involved in such programs may be affected in unexpected ways as a result of program assumptions wholly unconsidered by educators and/or program planners.

Research in educational administration during the last twenty years has been applied or practical rather than purely theoretical or scientific. Although there is certainly a place for practical research, theoretical research ought not be neglected. One goal of theoretical research is to develop theory that can explain phenomena. Another goal is to add to the store of knowledge. Research not based on a body of substantive theory will be weak. Purely practical research is often fragmented and unsystematic. In the late fifties UCEA inspired a movement toward more interdisciplinary and scientific analysis of educational organizations. This so-called &quot;theory&quot; movement  declined in the late sixties partially because of institutionalization and overpromotion. The social and political unrest of the sixties and the financial exigencies of the seventies caused practical and policy research to dominate the field. Yet more scientific and theoretical research is necessary for a full knowledge and understanding of organizational behavior in education. UCEA must continue to be an advocate of such research. (JM)",

Educational equality is defined as the prevailing view that all students should have equal access to the basic educational entitlement represented by a twelve-year elementary and secondary education and that the level of educational resources should not be dependent on the wealth of localities. Indicators to analyze disparities in the distribution of educational resources and revenues were chosen with regard to simplicity of construction, clarity, comprehensiveness, and technical accuracy. The measures of  educational resources chosen include (1) current total expenditures per student; (2) expense for teacher salaries; (3) staff per pupil (weighted by degree level); (4) current total expenditures per student with salaries controlled by degree level; (5) current total expenditures per student, with salaries controlled by degree level and adjusted for equality; and (6) a composite of the previous five. Applying the indicators to 1970 data suggests that in 1970, school finance reform was still needed within states to decrease the dependence of resources on local wealth and that improvement in the resource levels of racial, ethnic, and poverty groups would require an interstate solution.

Variables for the study were chosen because policy-makers were concerned about them and had the power to do something about them. The variables studied were individualized instructional techniques, teacher training, instructional setting, and costs, but findings concerning teacher training and costs were not reported. On the variable of individualized instruction, the study found that no one practice or combination of practices was more effective. Policy implications of these findings are that no particular approach ought to be required by law. Concerning the variable of instructional setting, findings indicate  that where differences in effectiveness were found between &quot;pull-out&quot; instruction and mainstreaming, educational gains in the mainstream setting were always significantly larger. Policy implications of these findings are not sweeping because the study did not cover a representative sample of districts and because mainstreaming may cause problems for some teachers, yet the findings can be used to stimulate further thinking on how to provide mainstream instruction. Finally, data suggest the tentative conclusion that at least in some classrooms in some districts, Title I is helping children learn. (Author/JM)",

Although there are many sources of influence and constraint, by far the most important source is government--both federal and state. Both universities and colleges of advanced education (CAEs) now receive almost all funds from the federal government which sets the total higher education budget and requires commissions and state coordinating agencies to carve it up. Because of the way the funds are administered, institutions cannot make up budgets for more than one year at a time. Institutions no longer determine academic salaries which are instead set by the Federal Academic Salaries Tribunal. Institutions are likewise losing control over decisions about which students and how  many students to accept, as these decisions are now being made at the federal and state level. Some of the constraints experienced by educational institutions result from shifts in power--particularly from state to federal levels, and, at the federal level, from the commissions to other agencies and to ministers and the Cabinet. All these constraints have resulted in a substantial erosion of autonomy for universities and some CAEs. (Author/JM)",

Australian coordination plans must balance freedom for academic institutions with the need to be assured these institutions are serving society's needs. Coordination of post-secondary education is essential on four levels: (1) within each sector--the university, the college, and technical and further education; (2) across post-secondary education as a whole; (3) between post-secondary education and other education; and (4) between post-secondary education and employment. Coordination may come from the central government or a special agency. If by special agency, it may be through  advisory committees, ministerial departments, or statutory authority. Or, finally, it might come through a statewide multicampus system. Coordinating agencies have previously put most emphasis on short-term planning and management functions, but some authors believe their key function should be long-term planning. When establishing coordinating agencies, problems to be solved include tension between agencies and educational institutions, the difficulty of finding high quality staff, and the tendency for administrative structure to become more important than the educational enterprise itself.

As an example of the learning disabled definitions used by most States, Texas's general special education eligibility requirements and specific criteria for the category of Language and/or Learning Disabilities are given, in light of which discrimination in the assessment procedure is examined.

The proposal for this research design was developed around the question of first-hand field experiences. A review of the first-year project revealed some of its weaknesses and reasons for poor results. For the second year, the public school constraints were taken into consideration, a training session for school personnel was conducted, and a research design was planned by all staff and researchers to be involved in it. The design was fairly complex because of the public school constraint that no child ever be denied the \"benefits\" of a program. Two consecutive grade levels at each school were assigned randomly to each of three treatment groups called full, partial and  delayed treatment. Results indicated that students in the full treatment group performed better than students in the partial treatment group, who in turn performed better than those in the delayed treatment group. Advantages were evident in both Spanish and English communication skills. Appendices cover teacher competencies in a bilingual program; parental involvement strategies; and description, analysis and results of the experience-based curriculum project. (AMH)",

        "description":"This paper is a response to Lavandera's question regarding the limits of the study of language variation. Sociolinguistics is characterized by its desire to limit representational meaning much more narrowly than formal linguistics. In addition while formal linguistics views language as species-specific and designed to accomodate logical representations, sociolinguistics views language in the context of common biological inheritance. The proper goal of sociolinguistic theory might be stated as the apportionment of the variance on any sub-section of a linguistic system to the functions of representation, identification, and accomodation, and to predict for any new language the probable distribution of information. Thus, variation studies go beyond grammatical description to  explanations of variable constraints which will lead to conclusions about the form of grammar. Although in its early days sociolinguistic analysis developed to study sociolinguistic stratification, the full value of variation analysis has only gradually become clear. In addition to its usefulness in describing phonological variation, variation analysis can be a tool in the description of syntactic and semantic analysis, and variation theory as a whole can be a heuristic device for determining the shape of linguistic theory.

Research is reviewed which supports the contention that the attitudinal/motivational dimension, or integrative motivation, bears an important relationship to achievement in the second language. Particular attention is given to a recent study suggesting that among francophones in Quebec the fear of losing cultural identity might prevent the development of positive attitudes toward the English-speaking population and so reduce integrative motivation. The present study evaluates relationships between attitudes of the individual and his/her linguistic aptitude and competence in a second language.  Attitudes toward the anglophone population and toward learning English were considered. One thousand one hundred and eighty from six regions in eastern Quebec were the subjects of the study. Data were gathered by means of a 36-item questionnaire eliciting information about attitudes and motivation, as well as other personal information. Three tendencies emerged: (1) students' attitudes toward anglophones, their English course and teacher as well as their motivation are above the mean; (2) negative attitudes are below the mean; and (3) students have a low opinion of their competence in English and their ability to use the language in real life situations. The latter tendency seems to corroborate evidence regarding fear of losing cultural identity. (Text is in French.) (AMH)",

Attitudinal variables of the ATI, integrativeness, motivation, attitudes toward the learning situation, class anxiety, and instrumentality, are described. Correlations suggest that prediction of achievement in French can be reasonably accurate if attention is paid to both aptitude and attitudes. Both MLAT and AMI evidence convergent validity because of substantial correlations with French grades. Only AMI has low correlation  with non-French academic average. MLAT correlates as highly with academic average as it does with French grades. Language enrollment statistics for Ontario and implications of the findings for counseling are presented. (SW)",

The small-group and individualized instruction, the instructional materials and facilities, and the close attention of the teachers contribute to a favorable learning atmosphere. Another advantage of the center is the elimination of feelings of inferiority. The older child, aged 10, spent one year in the center; the other, aged 8, spent a year and a half there before going into a regular school program. The following aspects of their language study are briefly discussed: (1) the center's method of teaching the English sound system, grammar  and vocabulary; (2) the children's progress in learning the language; and (3) three tests given to the children to check their linguistic competence one year after they left the center. One conclusion drawn is that the favorable learning atmosphere at the center and &quot;full immersion&quot; in the environment contributed to the rapid learning of English by the two children.

A stratified random sample of undergraduate Mexican-American (N=153) and Anglo (N=148) students was taken at the University of Texas, El Paso, where one third of the students enrolled have a Spanish surname. A self-devised Sociolinguistic Background Questionnaire was administered to all 301 students; extensive oral and written bilingual tests were administered to 10% of the total sample. The two groups differed significantly in socioeconomic status. The Chicanos were lower in fathers' income and hourly wages (students') and had a heavier burden of self-paid university expenses. Other divergences, varying in degree of significance, were also shown. It was found that  English performance correlated strongly with both Spanish performance and grade point average. Unlike studies made elsewhere, the Mexican-American students revealed high loyalty to the Spanish language and to Mexican-American culture. Chicano students, most of whose schooling had been in English, rated significantly higher in both oral and written English skills than in Spanish. They showed less confidence in both their English and Spanish skills than did their Anglo counterparts--a fact probably contributing, with the less favorable factors, to poorer self-image. This negativism was further compounded by language attitudes: Chicanos assigned relatively low status to Southwest Spanish varieties. Analogies between Mexican-American and Third World youth are emphasized, possibly opening up a  new avenue of research regarding minorities everywhere. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"Adapting sociolinguistic fieldwork techniques for use in teaching a second language is presented as an activity that gets students out of the classroom and into the speech community to observe and use language in real situations. It is intended for intermediate and advanced students who need motivation and encouragement to interact with native speakers. First methodological approaches of sociolinguists studying speech in a social context are examined, beginning with the identification of the speech community to be studied. Also included in the fieldwork techniques are preparing an explanation for the interviews and devising interview forms to guide the conversations, which are tape-recorded. Next, student preparation is discussed, including pre-fieldwork activities (classroom  role-playing), and fieldwork preparation (classroom discussion to prepare topic and schedule). Three sample taped interviews are shown concerning life in New York, Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia, and family life in the United States. The material collected from the fieldwork lends itself to a wide variety of follow-up linguistic activities. The order of the fieldwork analysis is outlined, beginning with a general class discussion followed by examples from particular interviews, student presentations of findings, and ending with a student evaluation of the entire process. This exercise is advocated because it forces students to use what they know in order to learn more. The appendices include suggested interviews for use in three second language situations: bilingual, Americans studying a  foreign language in the United States, and adults in ESL class. (NCR)",

        "description":"Body language, also called kinesics, is the discipline concerned with the study of all bodily motions that are communicative. An understanding of kinesics across cultures necessitates a close look at posture, movement, facial expression, eye management, gestures, and proxemics (distancing). The popularity of one posture over another and the emotion conveyed by a given posture seems to be largely determined by culture. Recent studies of rhythm and dance as they relate to body movement have revealed astonishing new insights into human interaction. Facial expressions are very revealing and would be an important aspect of language learners attempting to master the nonverbal system of another culture. The role of eye contact in a conversational exchange between two Americans is well  defined and is intensely important in interpersonal communication. An understanding of the role gestures play (autistic, technical and folk) within a culture is critical to sensitive communication. In each culture, the use of space (proxemics) depends upon the nature of the social interaction, but all cultures distinguish the four basic categories of intimate, personal, social, and public distance. While it is clear that all cultures make use of kinesic behaviors in communication, scholars do not agree on the precise nature of the role they play and are searching for some kinesic universals. An appendix is included with suggested activities for sensitizing students to aspects of nonverbal communication. A bibliography is also appended. (NCR)",

        "description":"Three approaches to vocabulary presentation in the second language classroom are described. The examples used are drawn largely from German, Russian, French, Latin, and Greek, but they can be extended to all commonly taught languages, although certain approaches are particularly suited to specific languages. In addition, the goals of a particular course must be taken into consideration when deciding on a particular approach. The &quot;root&quot; approach takes advantage of the natural system found in Indo-European languages which consists of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. The &quot;etymological/mnemonic&quot; approach connects a new item with one already existing in memory on the basis of logical connection, similarity, contrast, or simultaneous occurence. Direct borrowings and loan translations  have been found to be very effective within this approach. Finally, the &quot;topical voabulary checklist&quot; approach is an attempt to provide order in vocabulary by grouping semantically related words. Appendices contain a sample of prefix-root matrices and a sample vocabulary checklist. (AM)",

There is no general theoretical model that encompasses personality theory, self-concept, ego development, learning theory, motivation, and body image as they relate to psycholinguistics and linguistics. Definitions of terms and problems in developing a theoretical model are discussed, and outlines of two preliminary models, the communicative and the intrapsychic, are presented. The body of this work, an annotated bibliography, was developed in an attempt to juxtapose works that seem likely to generate productive hypotheses and theories about the relationship between personality and second language learning. The first  part of the reading list, on the communicative model, includes 72 citations in the following sections: (1) culture and social setting; (2) language as a system of communication; (3) personality theory: traits and persona; and (4) the degree of Acquisition of a second language and its relationship to personality. The second section, on the intrapsychic model, includes 56 citations in the following categories: (1) body experience; (2) language as a self-directive system and as a system of speech; (3) personality variables -- sense of identity -- language-specific sense of self; and (4) relationships among body variables, spoken language, and sense of identity. The third section, &quot;A Synthesis: Directions for the Future,&quot; includes 11 citations concerning efforts to localize specific language  functions of the brain. (NCR)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the extent to which listening comprehension is impaired when students are confronted with the colloquial use of French, as opposed to its formal use. It was found that amoung 128 prospective French teachers who participated in the study, there existed a low comprehension level of colloquial French, a discrepancy between comprehension of colloquial and formal French, and a general lack of awareness of the relationship between speech styles and social situations. Some strategies are suggested as a remedy to this situation: (1) increased emphasis on listening comprehension, (2) practice in listening to authentic colloguial French, (3) developing students' awareness of the role and socio-cultural parameters of the various speech styles, (4) helping  students to identify and interpret significant features of colloquial French and their relationship to traditional syntax and phonology, and (5) integrating all these activities into all levels and types of French language and culture study. Several authentic speech documents that might prove helpful in implementing these strategies, such as tape recordings of native speakers, radio and films, are reviewed. Colloquial French is discussed in terms of its linguistic aspects, socio-cultural setting, and implications for second language instruction in particular, the development of communicative competence. It is suggested that attention to all these factors will give students the opportunity to become truly educated speakers and discriminating listeners. (AMH)",

Some of the theoretical and practical issues surrounding such models are assessed, and the movement for more scientific and rational resource allocation is placed in a larger methodological and philosophical context. The focus of the paper is resource allocation rather than institutional management and planning, even though some of the terms and concepts used could apply to these broader areas. An assessment of marginal utility models as a basis of resource allocation reform is undertaken for both practical administrative and theoretical reasons. Marginal utility analysis has three components: (1) dividing available resources into increments so that assessments  and comparisons can be made about increments (or decrements) rather than total resources; (2) assessing the gains or benefits of each increment; and (3) comparing the relative benefits within and across functions. These are discussed, along with overall cost-benefit analysis, economic models, and zero-base budgeting and its alternatives. Sample zero-base budgeting formats used in the state of Georgia are appended. (Author/LBH)",

The data for the study were obtained from approximately 1,850 graduates of 28 medical schools. Initial data were collected in connection with their formal entry into medical school in 1956 and the most recent from a survey of their practice characteristics conducted in 1976. Variables were categorized as  belonging to one of six classes of information: (1) general background factors; (2) personal qualities or attitudes as measured during medical school; (3) achievement measures, obtained at the same time; (4) characteristics of premedical college attended; (5) characteristics of medical school attended, and (6) personal factors at the time of graduation from medical school that might operate as constraints on future choices.

The extent to which the Task Force goals were achieved is contained in Chapter V, and Chapter VI presents the analysis of the extent to which the Task Force recommendations were implemented. Chapter VII contains an analysis of program activities directed toward increasing minority enrollment.

        "description":"Department heads from 134 institutions (mainly universities) indicated the weight they generally give to various criteria for evaluating individual faculty members. The questionnaire they responded to included: criteria used for evaluating overall faculty performance; sources of information for evaluating teaching; and kinds of information used for judging scholarship or research performance. Although teaching, research, and service are generally acknowledged as the major functions of most universities, responses by the 453 department heads indicated that public or university service is usually given little importance in evaluating faculty members for decisions regarding tenure, salary, and promotion. The research universities emphasize research and scholarship. The so-called  doctoral-granting universities and the comprehensive universities and colleges said that teaching was ranked first in importance, followed closely by research. The results of the study also suggest an increase in the use of some of the more systematic and tangible kinds of evidence for evaluating teaching performance (e.g., student ratings), though the use of such evidence falls short of what department heads think is needed. In general, the evaluation of research and scholarship depends very much on the level of the institution and the type of department. For example, peer judgments of research and the number of articles in quality journals are much more important in social science departments in the research universities than in the same departments in the comprehensive universities and  colleges.

Two kinds of decisions faced by citizens are featured--decisions about factual claims, and decisions about group governance. Factual decisions may require gathering and evaluating information to choose between competing claims. Decisions about group governance may require use of both facts and value judgments.

        "description":"Having used instructional television (ITV) since 1955, the Evanston Township High School has been generally dissatisfied with its experiences with closed circuit television (CCTV), dial access ITV, and portable ITV for teachers' in-class use. It appears that future ITV use at Evanston will be minimal, due to wide resistance from students, faculty, and administrators. CCTV was useful for simultaneous large group communication, but prevented individual teacher control. Dial access ITV, while permitting students to work at their own pace, depended too heavily on student motivation, and did not permit teachers to monitor use. Although the portable video equipment requires some mechanical ability to operate, its mobility, relatively low expense, and potential as a tool for in-class  evaluation and feedback make it the most likely form of future use of ITV at Evanston.

CBS grew out of an interest in testing the application of CAI to procedural and perceptual motor skills. With the sophisticated graphics capabilities curently available in many CBS systems, it is possible to program dynamic, two-dimensional representations of physical objects to be displayed on the screen of a computer terminal. Research suggests that advantages of CBS for training include increased trainee proficiency, time savings, cost effectiveness, and student acceptance. The overall recommendation for research in this area is to approach CBS training with a futuristic  orientation to ensure maximal utilization of newly emerging technologies. (Author/CMV)",

In order to minimize needless repetition and address the problem of articulation between such schools and the Catonsville Community College, a five-day workshop was convened during June 1977. Representatives from three vocational/technical schools, two high schools, and the college participated in the workshop to develop a proposal for an integrated curriculum. Participants agreed on and met six objectives: examine each institution's course objectives and learning sequences; compare objectives and learning experiences from all institutions;  recommend changes to obtain uniformity; develop an articulation agreement; develop implementation procedures; and provide for followup and evaluation procedures.

The policy would establish authority for selection decisions, the intellectual framework within which decisions are made, and selection criteria and guidelines. It would serve to protect the library and librarians from criticism of the library collection; aid general collection development; and assist librarians in building a collection responsive to user needs and supplemental to college curricula. As an aid to developing a policy appropriate to ACC, Texas community and junior colleges were asked to send copies of their policies. Of 14 respondents, six schools submitted policies which were  compared to Calvin Boyer's outline that served as the tentative basis of the ACC policy. The statements generally included most of Boyer's major categories: community description, responsibility for selection, intellectual freedom, complaint procedures, specific policies for material by audience, format, and subject, and gifts and weeding policies. After reviewing study results, ACC drafted its own policy; the first draft was rejected by the governing board because it lacked community description and analysis criteria. Another draft was approved. Appendices present the approved ACC policy and copies of policies from study institutions. (TR)",

Computer placement in English courses was  dependent on both total reading and total English test scores. Using the Cooperative English Test manual and the pilot study data, a comparison was drawn between the ECC norms and twelfth grade and freshman college norms. ECC students functioned between twelfth grade and freshman norms in vocabulary and English expression; their speed and level of comprehension paralleled twelfth grade norms; their total reading was only slightly higher than twelfth grade norms; and they functioned slightly lower than twelfth grade norms in total English.

The guide defines the major components of the EPSDT program and outlines what a health coordinator should know and do to utilize the program for delivering services to Medicaid eligible children. The &quot;Preparation&quot; section focuses on getting ready for the school year, including contacting persons or agencies outside of Head Start. Sample letters to a state EPSDT coordinator and a screening provider are included. In subsequent sections, three major functions and activities which Head Start can perform in using EPSDT resources are identified. All three activities--outreach, arranging for screening and follow-up--are discussed in  detail. Outreach informs all families eligible for Medicaid about EPSDT. Arranging for screening involves identifying screening providers, scheduling appointments and overcoming barriers which might prevent the family from receiving service. Follow-up ensures either that all health problems detected through screening receive continuing care until they are remedied, or that a pattern of continuing care is established. The appendix consists of a list of state EPSDT agencies and their addresses. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"This study used the behavioral contrast paradigm to assess the excitatory and inhibitory capabilities of young infants. Behavioral contrast is described as the phenomenon whereby the rates of responding in the presence of two stimuli, both of which were previously associated with reinforcement, change in opposite directions when only one of them becomes associated with the reinforcer. In the study, 20 infants 93 to 120 days old were trained on 2 days to produce rotation of an overhead mobile via right footkicks in the presence of two visual cues. After achieving a criterion of stable responding on a third day, one group of infants receiVed alternating 30-second periods of reinforcement and nonreinforcement with one cue signalling each component of the reinforcement schedule.  These infants dramatically increased their rate of response when reinforcement was available; however, the expected corresponding response decrease during nonreinforcement periods was not evidenced. Control infants, who continued to receive continuous reinforcement throughout the third-day session, did not change their rate of response from criterion. All infants returned to a similar response rate on a fourth day when reinforcement was continuously available for both groups. Results indicated that young infants manipulated their visual environments in relation to changes in reinforcement density from previous reward experiences. Finally, the ability of young infants to rapidly inhibit previously reinforced motoric responses was discussed. (Author/CM)",

This year, for the first time, the annual report also looks at target population groups, such as the rural elderly, handicapped, social security recipients, and those who receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Indicating whether there has been progress in stated rural development goal areas, the report also  discusses examples of efforts by several federal agencies to improve or expand delivery of services in rural health care, housing, and manpower/employment programs and summarizes four important innovations in rural education around the country (Regional Educational Service Agencies, or RESA, rural community colleges, rural school improvement projects, community development). Part three contains material on rural development trends, concerns, and responses from 21 states; content categories are income and employment, population, housing, health, education, water and waste, and transportation.

        "description":"Using data from a cross-sectional sample of 4,376 South Carolina high school seniors in 1969 to determine the differences in the perception of conditions relating to teacher choice among white and black females and males, the study explored the relative perceived importance of the following items in choosing a career: the chance to make a lot of money, the opportunity to help others, the chance to become an important person, steady employment, the opportunity to be one's own boss, and the chance for excitement. Student aspirations to the teaching profession, all professional positions except teaching, and all non-professional positions were compared and coded according to categories compatible with the Census Bureau's occupational classification system. Self-administered  questionnaires were given to 1,510 white boys, 762 black boys, 1,464 white girls, and 762 black girls in 41 (27 primarily white and 14 primarily black) rural and urban high schools in 26 South Carolina counties. Some findings were that: the most important occupational desideratum for both black and white boys, regardless of career aspiration, was the opportunity for steady employment; money was a more desired job attribute for white boys than girls; black girls were concerned with the opportunity to make a lot of money and the chance to be an important person; the chance to help others ranked at or near the top of career desideratum for all seniors aspiring to teach; teaching attracted those groups who, for whatever reasons, had relatively limited professional level career possibilities.

Discussion centered on the degree of effectiveness of educational and governmental institutions to train and support and, subsequently, provide quality health care to those communities most in need. Topics in the area of recruitment, admissions, and retention were examined to determine the continuation of programs designed to increase the participation of ethnic minorities within the entire spectrum of the health care delivery system. Pressing issues such as the legality of minority admission criteria, sensitizing and  motivating faculty and administration to meet ethnic minority needs, developing rationale for program planning, and providing alternatives to traditional entry methods were addressed. Discussion from the work groups centered on identifying common issues, determining functions to implement action oriented activity, and delineating feasible activities that could impact mutual goals of health science centers and consumers of health services. Participants identified the need for a community based advocacy group which could respond to health care delivery issues, impact legislation directly affecting ethnic groups and their access to funds for equalization of opportunities, and devise an informational network to participate in planning strategies for quick response to and pressing issues.

        "description":"A research project in nine Iowa counties attempted to show local level decision makers how to use social indicator data to improve quality of life and increase accountability in policy making. Tools presented were descriptive social reporting (a mechanism for organizing descriptive, time series, social indicator data) and systematic needs assessment (focus on data gathering techniques). A framework for descriptive social reporting was developed to encourage use of social indicators in rural development planning. These reports were presented to rural decision makers in a series of county conferences with data from state and federal sources on policy relevant areas of health, education, public safety, housing, income, employment, leisure/recreation, and physical environment. Social  indicators for each were related to allocation of funds, structure and utilization of available services, and level of aggregate well being. Social indicators were also given for nonmanipulable factors: human resource, geographical/physical, and economic dimensions. Techniques for eliciting attitudinal data for needs assessment were then described (attitude survey, public forum, key informant) along with the social indicator technique for applying nonattitudinal data. Partly as a result of this project, an information delivery system is to be set up at Iowa State University to meet information needs of decision makers. (RS)",

Respondents were primarily women since it was felt they were the best informed about the family's health conditions and medical utilization. Information was obtained on the respondents' demographic characteristics, health status and medical utilization, fertility and family planning, mental health, problems in obtaining health care, and unmet needs. Data were compared, when relevant, with similar data for 554 Anglos, obtained from a study of Dane County households in 1973. Findings included: 3 out of 10 Hispanos felt their health was&quot;fair&quot; or &quot;poor&quot;, compared with 1 out of 10 Anglos; among the Hispanos' most common health complaints were headaches, nervousness, backaches, irritability, low spirits, sleeplessness, eye and sinus troubles; Hispanos felt there was need for dental care, translators or interpreters among health personnel, general and post illness checkups, health information and outreach services, and doctors' offices and clinics to be opened during evenings and weekends; 60% of the Hispano women were currently using some form of contraception; 40% indicated they would seek professional help from a doctor, counseling center, or priest when confronted with a personal problem.

Nonmetropolitan communities disproportionately substitute user charges for general revenue financing, support a higher proportion of local government or community services with donations and fund-raising activities, substitute volunteer for paid effort more, and provide more community services privately than publicly. Estimates of impact on allocations to rural areas in Ohio when various excluded revenues are included bear out the apparent bias. If federal revenue sharing is to be equitable, either adjustments in measure of tax effort are needed or tax effort should be dropped as a criterion. (RS)",

        "description":"Growth and present status of graduate programs, major research interests, and potential for US-Brazilian collaboration indicate the present state of rural sociology in Brazil. In contrast to US rural sociology's identity crisis of the past decade, the field in Brazil has blossomed. Graduate programs are underway at universities of Rio Grande do Sul, Sao Paulo-Piracicaba, Vicosa, Brasilia, and Paraiba-Campina Grande, with 45 professionals affiliated with them. Over half of the full-time staff has Ph.D. degrees, and though staff is small now, projections indicate adequate staffing by 1982. More than 70% of students have undergraduate degrees in one of the social sciences--only 6% in agronomy. Of 116 students who entered programs during the previous two cycles, 76 finished required  credits, with failure to complete course work due primarily to poor student performance. Curriculum at the five centers is comparable to that of US programs. Most popular areas of rural research for both students and staff have been social organization (description/theory, voluntary associations, stratification, education) and social change (diffusion, technological change, agricultural development). Two types of collaboration between US and Brazilian rural sociologists are possible: personnel interchange and joint research (allowing opportunity to test sociological propositions cross culturally).

        "description":"The negative impact of development on women is widespread in a variety of areas, across classes, in different parts of the world. The structural and historical processes that erode the power of women and shift the balance of power to men's favor, as well as shifting power to fewer and fewer men, are related to integration in a world economic system that demands a mobile labor force and the alienation of land, which is then used as a commodity rather than a resource. In earlier days it was assumed that development, following precisely the western model, would be a good thing for everybody. Women, marginal to the whole process, would of course be brought along with the men. Now, however, we are convinced that the western mode of development is fraught with problems for the  developing world. Further, women are now seen both as independent and dependent variables in the development process. Women are very often victims of a development process imposed upon them by western men making western assumptions about what women do. When women are left out of the development process, change becomes lopsided and less effective; as women lose status, future positive change becomes endangered. The implications of territorial displacement of women are crucial in understanding the adverse impact of development on women. Multi-national linkages in development have drawn men away from the countryside and made the life of rural women even more difficult. (Author/BR)",

Data, taken from a survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census as a supplementary part of the December 1976 Current Population Survey, include each State and the District of Columbia but not Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories. Tabular data are organized into three areas: characteristics of the 1976 hired farm working force; selected subgroups of hired farmworkers; and changing characteristics of the hired farm working force. Data indicate that: generally, hired farm workers were  young (median age 23), white (74%), male (74%), and lived off the farm; approximately 11% were Hispanic, 14% were Black & Others, and 25% were women; during 1976, 24% of the Farm Working Force did only farm labor, 17% did non-farm work for most of the year, and 8% were migrants; the average annual wage for farm workers was $1,625.

Forty three Chicano mothers were observed, in their homes, teaching cognitive perceptual tasks to their own 5-year-old children, and each mother and child was administered a battery of measures to assess field dependence-independence. Among the results discussed was the finding that  field-independent mothers used inquiry and praise as teaching strategies and field-dependent mothers more frequently taught through modeling. Also, the contrasting tendencies toward greater or less self-nonself segregation and their cognitive and personality sequelae enter into the mother's choice of teaching strategies. It was found that each mother teaches her young child using the type of strategy that is likely to stimulate in the child the development of a cognitive style similar to her own. In addition, a coherent construct of field dependence emerges somewhat earlier in female than in male Chicanos. (Author/SE)",

Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education of the Committee on Education and Labor, House of Representatives, 95th Congress, 2nd Session on H.R. 9158: To Provide for Grants to Tribally Controlled Community Colleges, and for Other Purposes (May 18, and June 14, 1978).",
        "description":"In May and June of 1978 hearings were conducted on H.R. 9158, which provides for grants for the operation and improvement of tribally controlled community colleges. Appropriations would include $25,000,000 for each of the first two fiscal years and $30,000,000 for the third. The Navajo Community College would receive $60,000,000 over three years with an additional yearly operation and maintenance grant of $125,000. Testimony supporting the bill cited the tribally controlled colleges as &quot;tangible examples of true Indian self-determination&quot;. At present only 10% of Indian college freshmen ever graduate. Weak academic backgrounds, culture shock, and inadequate supportive services at educational institutions are among the reasons for poor Indian academic performance. Indians earning  degrees often are trained for jobs not relevant when they return to the reservation. Many of the brightest students take jobs elsewhere, and their talents are lost to the reservation. A Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) official opposed the act, saying that the BIA already has sufficient authority to provide financial and technical assistance to all tribally controlled community colleges. This document is comprised of the bill itself, testimony at the hearings, and other pertinent information. (DS)",

Meetings with the tribal council, committees, and a household survey shows employment opportunities, education, transportation, and cultural awareness to be the key issues dominating the concerns of the people. Among the 659 tribal members, male employment is at 42 percent and underemployment at 48 percent. Tribal members want the land base used for &quot;job creating activities.&quot; Vocational training and adult education programs are needed. Tribal members are concerned about the loss of the Mojave language and want the children to be more aware of their ancestors and culture. Specific tribal goals include utilization of large portions of tribal land for  agriculture, possible construction of a gambling casino on Nevada lands, building of new access roads, construction of housing subdivisions, creation of a tribal museum at old Fort Mojave, and erection of a large shopping center. In addition to planning goals, this study gives detailed information on the Fort Mojave tribe by discussing population and employment statistics, land use, transportation systems, housing conditions, education, and environmental services. The appendix lists federal, state and local government officials and possible foundation grant sources. (DS)",

        "description":"The Fort Yuma Reservation of the Quechan Tribe is located on 9,246 acres in the southwest corner of California in Imperial County and the southeast corner of Arizona in Yuma County. Historical records indicate the Quechans have inhabited the area since approximately 800 A.D. The 1974 tribal rolls show a population of 1,687. The unemployment rate is 52 percent with underemployment also a severe problem with 39 percent of those employed earning less than $5000 annually. Adequate housing is a major concern as only 632.7 acres are in tribal ownership and some tribal members have difficulty securing permanent housing sites. The use of agricultural land for homes would diminish that economic potential for the reservation. Development of a subdivision might be one solution to alleviate  housing needs. Areas of potential economic development include agriculture, tourism, and a motel-restaurant complex. Job availabilities are centered primarily in surrounding cities and employment education should be a major element in tribal programs to eliminate unemployment and underemployment. In addition to making planning recommendations for tribal action, the document provides socioeconomic analysis, history, and goals of the Quechan people, and discusses their land resources, housing status, physical systems, human resources, and planning alternatives.

        "description":"Designed for presentation in three two-hour class periods, this five-unit module presents both a conceptual framework for the study and analysis of Indian communities and a guide to instructors in schools of social work for presentation of this framework to students in a classroom setting. Primary focus is upon federally recognized tribal reservations. Unit One deals with the 200 year old federal-Indian trust relationship and presents Indian tribal communities as sovereign and separate political entities. Unit Two discusses tribal communities as social systems with developed sub systems and social groupings designed to meet community members' needs. History and effects of federal Indian policy on tribal communities are examined in Unit Three along with the assertion that federal  legal obligations and services have had the intended effect of reducing Indian tribal communities from self-reliance to economic dependency. Also explored is the inability of present American Indian communities to meet tribal members' needs; this situation is not the direct fault of Indian tribal systems but the failure of outside institutional systems imposed on tribal communities to alleviate the \"Indian Problem\". Unit Four examines the concept of Indian self-determination along with its implications for social work practice. Unit Five deals with social work practice with American Indian communities and states that social workers' understanding of the special conditions afforded Indian tribal communities through treaties and the Constitution provide a base for developing a strong  advocate role. Study guide activities are provided to help the learner effectively utilize the conceptual framework presented. (Author/DS)",

Two-thirds of all older American Indian women and slightly more than one-third of the older men were either single, widowed, or divorced. Half of the older Indians received incomes below $1,408; this was 24% below the median income of all older persons. Only 7% of older Indians received incomes of $5,000 or more. The proportion of elderly Indians below the poverty level in 1969 was nearly double that of the total older population. The life expectancy at birth for Indians and Native Alaskans is 65.1 years, seven years less than that for white persons. The leading causes of deaths among the older Indian population in 1974 included heart disease  followed by cancer. Cultural differences, low income, and lack of a focal point for services have all contributed to the plight of elderly Indians. This report, the second of two reports on older American Indians, focuses on persons age 45-64 and 65+. It contains statistical tables and analyses on marital status, household composition, labor force characteristics, income and poverty, education, health, life expectancy, and mortality. Data were taken primarily from the 1970 census as well as from the Indian Health Service and the Social Security Administration; they show the economic, social, and health situations of the older Indian population to be worse than that for elderly persons of all races.

Three appendices contain technical notes, definitions of terms, and a statistical table for each chart. Much of the data in the four sections and one appendix are cross-classified by sex, family  relationship, school years completed, and other demographic and social characteristics. Data indicate that persons of Spanish origin make up 5% of the total population, 4% of the civilian labor force, 6% of the unemployed, 2% of the labor force with four or more years of college, 12% of the labor force with eight or less years of school, 2% of workers in professional or technical occupations, and 7% of those in semiskilled jobs. Twelve percent of all families in poverty are headed by Spanish-origin persons. (RS)",

Migrants are described in terms of characteristics (compared by race, sex, age, education, region of previous residence, employment rate), replacement of nonmetro population lost through outmigration, occupation, and income. Statistics reveal that one-eighth of the 1975 nonmetro population lived in metro areas five years earlier, and that metro/nonmetro migrants more than replaced the 5.1 million persons moving in the opposite direction, except among young adults, blacks, and college educated persons. In occupation,  industry, and income attributes, migrants did not have a negative impact on the nonmetro population. High proportions were in white-collar occupations and industries, and average income was no less than that of the total nonmetro population. Remarkable similarity was noted in incomes of metro/nonmetro migrants and persons moving in the opposite direction. Replacement was nominally higher among people remaining within the North and West than in the South, but in regional exchanges, the South gained at the expense of the rest of the country.

A number of community-controlled educational systems have become the driving force in Navajo bilingual education, and the past three years have produced not just higher quanitity, but considerably improved quality, according to Dr. Bernard Spolsky, director of the Navajo Reading Study at the University of New Mexico (UNM). Spolsky's paper &quot;Advances in Navajo Bilingual Education, 1969-72&quot; is featured in this curriculum bulletin, which seeks to enlarge the case for Navajo bilingual education and update the state of the art. Three conference reports are also included. The first, which covers a Navajo bilingual-bicultural materials  conference held in Albuquerque in October, 1972, discusses curriculum ideas shared by persons involved with Navajo language teaching. The second report includes a student proposal requesting implementation of a Navajo bilingual education program at UNM along with a description of the faculty-student meeting that responded to the proposal. The third paper summarizes proceedings of a November, 1972, conference at UNM which examined questions relating to the training of Navajo bilingual teachers.

This two-part filmstrip and audio tape program is designed to assist educators and students in establishing due process procedures that would be of benefit to all parties concerned. Part I defines due process in its simplest terms as &quot;justice or fair play&quot;. Due process procedures must include assurances of eight basic rights: (1) to have a written notice of charges prior to a formal hearing; (2) to have a fair and impartial hearing; (3) to have parents present and to be represented by council; (4) to cross-examine  witnesses; (5) to receive a written record of the hearing and disciplinary actions taken; (6) to an administrative review and appeal; (7) to remain silent; and (8) if found not guilty, to have all information relating to the charges removed from school records. Part II presents guidelines for establishing due process procedures in a school. It lists student representation in government and an official, written code of rules and regulations as prerequisites for establishment of due process procedures. Suggestions are given for acquainting faculty with the rules and procedures of due process. The necessary components of a formal hearing are discussed along with a step-by-step description of the procedure to be followed. (DS)",

A related problem involving a learning effect associated with Piaget's clinical methods is also investigated. The Piagetian Logical Operations Test (PLOT), a group-administered instrument, was developed and field-tested. Eighty-four students in grades 10-12 participated in the field test. Subjects were randomly selected and assigned membership in one of two equal size groups having the same number of males and females from each grade. Data were obtained by clinical interview, PLOT, and intelligence test records. Subjects in group one received five clinical interviews followed by PLOT, while subjects in group two were administered the instruments in  reverse order. Examination of the findings led to two conclusions: (1) the construct validity of the group test was partially established; (2) a learning effect was present in the PLOT total scores which was attributable to the previously administered clinical interviews, but no such effect was present, in general, in the clinical interview scores that were attributable to the administration of PLOT.

Thus, the SCAT program influenced the knowledge and motivation bases of career choices. However, participants in the program became more indecisive as far as career choices were concerned. Among these students, certain stereotypic career-choice behaviors were already apparent suggesting that programs such as SCAT should start even earlier. The SCAT program uses a highly-interactive, computer-based system to provide information about science career areas. The information is presented in the form of 30-minute dialogs. The dialogs present both printed  information and photographs, as well as problem-solving experiences. The topics of the dialogs are: (1) science careers in general; (2) the engineer; (3) the chemist; (4) the physicist; (5) the earth scientist; (6) the biologist; (7) the mathematician; (8) the social scientist; and (9) the health scientist.

Protested by the Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971, the thousands of protected horses and burros pose a challenge to government leaders, land managers, ranchers, and citizens as they consider methods for managing growing herds on public lands. Discussed are the role of wild horses and burros in Western history; their relationship to their ecosystem; the need for management; and management alternatives and land use decisions. The package includes a teacher's guide and activity poster. It is designed to be used with the film &quot;Dapples and Grays,  Pintos and Bays,&quot; and a children's story, &quot;Thank You for Helping Us.&quot; (RE)",

        "description":"By focusing on controversial social/political issues in high school American history and social studies courses, classroom teachers can help students develop critical thinking skills. Contemporary issues of a controversial nature are particularly good topics for high school because students are generally familiar with the issues through exposure to radio, television, newspapers, and conversations with peers, parents, and teachers. Examples of prominent controversial issues are the Allen Bakke case, the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, political patronage related to the David Marston issue of 1976-78, and First Amendment freedoms exercised by the American Nazi Party. For each of these issues, the monograph presents statements of fact and opinion, points of agreement and  disagreement, and significant omissions by one side or the other. For each issue, information is presented on objectives, suggestions for classroom treatment, and materials for student use. Student activities include examination of fictional, journalistic, and objective accounts of the issue, class discussion, reading and writing assignments, debate, dramatic presentations, and role playing. This type of teaching-learning approach emphasizes reason and critical thinking rather than emotionalism and helps students distinguish fact from opinion and identify and resolve conflicting viewpoints. It also aids educators as they develop social issues programs with the objective of helping students become involved and informed citizens. (DB)",

Phase I of test development was based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress model of testing at age level. The social studies skills and concepts of highest priority were developed by an advisory committee of Connecticut educators and were administered to 29 local school districts with 17,000 students participating. In addition to three objective tests, questionnaires were designed by grade level for local use in curriculum planning and evaluation. In the realm of local history students scored highest at the nine-year-old level while scores declined at the later age levels. In the areas of political science and  knowledge of United States government all grade levels showed relatively low performance, while knowledge of the nature of conflict resolution was relatively high. Scores on citizenship remained constantly high, but performance on the role of political opposition was weak. Geography scores showed that students may be learning &quot;place&quot; geography rather than analytic/predictive skills.

        "description":"Oral history can contribute to social education in a number of ways. Traditionally, data collection has been considered as providing the most benefits to students of oral history. These benefits have derived from the facts that: (1) historical knowledge is immediate and tangible, (2) oral history stimulates students' interests, (3) students interact with diverse groups of people within the community, and (4) students improve their skills in planning and interpersonal communication. In this paper the authors emphasize that additional benefits result from the method and content of data collection. First, oral history promotes ego development in students by providing them with opportunities for social interaction. It also encourages development of empathy and moral sensitivity as  students learn to appreciate other peoples' situations, lifestyles, and values. Finally, through sharing and involvement, oral history promotes a sense of community building. These experiences are especially beneficial for adolescents in terms of their social development. (AV)",

        "description":"Theories and data are examined concerning the rapid spread of the public school system across the United States during the nineteenth century. In the first part of the report the authors review and criticize current interpretations of the development of public education. According to these theories public schooling arose from the class conflicts and elite interests of a developing urban society--the pressures for social control of new working classes, immigrants, and young people freed from traditional constraints. In the second part of the report the authors argue that the spread of schooling can be seen as one of a series of social movements by which the American nation was built, not as a result of state or central elite action. To test their arguments the authors analyzed  state-wide data on educational organization and expansion taken from reports of the Commissioner of Education and from the U. S. Census for the years 1870-1930. They found dramatic educational differences between northern and southern states which they attribute to differences in the regions' political and economic systems. The rapid spread of schooling in rural areas of the north and west is seen to reflect a commonly-held ideology of nation-building that combined the outlook of small entrepreneurs in a world market with evangelical Protestantism and an individualistic philosophy.

Section IV describes a curriculum model which is based on progression through learning stages until students reach their highest potential. Section V identifies learning activities which are part of the model. Students are involved in role playing, exposure to alternative viewpoints, debates, clarification of ideas, defending personal attitudes, and examining consequences of decisions. Section VI lists modules developed for junior and senior high school students. Section VII provides information about how the modules were field tested. The final section offers conclusions.

        "description":"Based on four standards of measurement, it appears that the educational systems of Western Europe fail to provide a significant equalizing influence. The four criteria are: (1) equality of educational access, (2) equality of educational participation, (3) equality of educational results, (4) and equality of educational effects on life chances. Although the distribution of education shows a universal trend toward increasing equality of educational attainments, data indicate that persons from lower social class backgrounds are likely to follow less prestigious and remunerative courses of study. Moreover, they lack the social or political connections to obtain better jobs. This pattern is a result of the perceived role of schooling, which is to prepare students for filling the needs  of capitalistic wage-labor. There is a basic contradiction between this function and that of increasing social mobility. Moreover, the post World War II reduction in economic growth has created an educated, underemployed proletariat. The increasing disjuncture between the values and expectations of the educated worker and the realities of work is creating a new working class of revolutionary youth. Educational reforms must include increasing the selectivity of universities, absorbing enrollment increases through alternative higher education, developing an alternative educational pattern, and emphasizing career education. Work reforms call for changing the organization of work, increasing the prestige of blue collar work, and providing more jobs in the public sector. (KC)",

        "description":"This report presents and interprets birth statistics for the United States with particular emphasis on changes that took place during the period 1970-73. Data for the report were based on information entered on birth certificates collected from all states. The majority of the document comprises graphs and tables of data, but there are four short expository sections which summarize trends. These sections examine details of recent fertility trends, changes in completed fertility and total fertility, changing patterns of fertility control, and future trends. The statistics show that by 1973 the U.S. fertility rate had declined to the lowest number ever recorded, and the annual number of births was the lowest since 1945. Major factors influencing this decline were changes in the ages  at which women give birth and an emerging preference for smaller families. The greatest declines in fertility were for women aged 40 and older. There was a gradual lengthening in the interval between births for both white and black women. White women under age 30 experienced a higher level of childlessness than women of all other races, a reversal of the pattern of previous decades. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"This booklet explores the advantages and drawbacks in the employment of artists as teachers at all educational levels. Until recently, arts professionals did not want to hinder their creative work by confining themselves to the place and time of a school situation. Schools generally sought to hire those who wanted education as a career. In 1969 the National Endowment for the Arts and the U.S. Office of Education (USOE) jointly sponsored the Artist-In-Schools Program. Participants were not required to teach, but to show students how artists act as creators in different media. Other USOE grants brought artists into the schools and placed a heavy emphasis on preparing the schools for the artists by requiring briefing workshops. Such programs have not been trouble-free. Placement of  artists in the schools as teachers can create simple procedural problems or more complex administrative problems. Teachers may feel threatened by the differences in artists' temperament and educational perspectives. Western School for the Arts in Washington, D.C. illustrates the problems of a school specifically created for professional artist-teachers. These include financial limitations, administrative indifferences, hasty planning, and conflicts among various participants. A successful program requires an artist who has a critical sense, can analyze an artistic work, and can communicate skills to children. An intuitive artist may not always be able to discuss the reasons behind a creative action. (Author/MR)",

        "author":["Ehman, Lee H."],
        "description":"This paper presents six generalizations based on political education research and discusses their implications for teaching citizenship in the public schools. In drawing the implications, it was assumed that citizenship education is designed to promote higher political knowledge, interest, trust, tolerance of dissent, and intellectual and participation skills. The six generalizations are that: (1) compared to factors such as family and the media, school is an important agent for transmitting political information to youth, (2) secondary students' political knowledge has decreased between 1970 and 1976, (3) an open classroom climate in which opinions about controversial issues are freely discussed is conducive to positive political attitudes, (4) emphasis on factual content and  patriotic rituals is associated with negative political attitudes, (5) student participation in school governance is related to positive political attitudes, and (6) American students have a lower tolerance of political dissent than do European students. Among the implications of these generalizations are that teachers should use up-to-date instructional materials, pay attention to attitude and behavior outcomes, specify course goals, allow students to express divergent viewpoints, de-emphasize rote factual knowledge, and encourage participation in school governance and extracurricular activities. In addition, teachers should point out that good citizenship does not necessarily imply passive conformity. (Author/AV)",

The hypothesis is that, in contrast to assimilation, the changes in structure caused by accomodation are only partially reversible. The experiment was a multidimensional scaling procedure repeated three times to reproduce walking distances between buildings on a familiar college campus. The second time, the students in the assimilation condition estimated distances between additional buildings, whereas the students in the accommodation condition were asked to estimate distances as though an imaginary barrier blocked the  middle of the campus. The third time, the students were asked to reproduce their original estimates. The results showed that the accommodation condition had a statistically significant effect on the judgments made on the third trial, thus supporting the hypothesis that accommodation produces changes in cognitive structures that are not fully reversible.

The PVI was developed to yield scores relatively independent of traditional measures of scholastic aptitude but at the same time related to academic performance in schools and colleges. Scores from several PVI scales, particularly that labelled Persistence, were moderately correlated with Freshman Average Grade in every college. The PVI scale-scores studied were relatively independent of Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores. Predictions of Freshman Average Grade based on a battery which included PVI scale-scores along with four academic predictors (SAT-Verbal,  SAT-Mathematics, class rank, and the average of College Board Achievement scores) were more closely related to Freshman Grades than predictions based only on the four academic predictors.

The question is raised as to whether the studies that have been reviewed constitute a population or a sample, and if a sample, whether they are representative or biased or random so that inferences can be tested with confidence. The purposes of this study were to: describe the various methods used for specified aspects of reviews and syntheses, determine the frequency of the alternative methods, critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, and suggest ways in which more powerful and valid reviews and syntheses can be done. The primary source of data was a content analysis of  a random sample of reviews and of a sample of allegedly exemplary reviews. The author concludes that although such reviews are important to science and social policy-making, many integrative reviews are done less rigorously than is currently possible. This paper and the recent work of Gene Glass suggest several ideas for improving the prevailing methods for reviews. (Author/CTM)",

        "description":"Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum in their work with the semantic differential developed a technique with which data from an individual could be represented by a three-dimensional model. The model is derived from distance scores based upon profile ratings of concepts such as mother or self, on subscales such as kind-cruel, weak-strong, etc. Osgood identified three main dimensions for meaning (and models)--evaluation, potency, and activity--which are assumed to be orthogonal. The models are fascinating and useful but involve a great deal of work. This paper describes procedures which yield a good approximate model in 3-5 hours; less time is required with experience. Further, the approximate model can serve as the basis to build the exact model in less time than would have been possible  otherwise. The improvements include computer cards which can be used for doing the ratings, FORTRAN computer programs, a special apparatus for use as a frame for building the model, directions, and a template for drawing the model in perspective. Several hundred undergraduate students have completed the models and a few clinical cases have been evaluated. Appendices include administration instructions; sample computer cards, programs, and outputs; and plans for building the model. (Author/CTM)",

Computer simulation was used in the administration of either a conventional or Bayesian adaptive ability test to a hypothetical target population consisting of a minority and majority subgroup. Fairness was evaluated by three indices which reflect the degree of differential validity, errors in prediction (Cleary's model), and proportion of applicants exceeding a selection cutoff (Thorndike's model). Major findings are: (1) when used in conjunction with either the Bayesian or conventional test, differential prediction increased fairness and facilitated  the interpretation of the fairness indices; (2) the Bayesian adaptive tests were consistently fairer than the conventional tests for all item pools above the alpha=.7 discrimination level for tests of more than 30 items; (3) the differential prediction version of the Bayesian adaptive test produced almost perfectly fair performance on all fairness indices at high discrimination levels; and (4) the placement of subgroup prior distribution in the Bayesian adaptive testing procedure can affect test fairness.

        "description":"The Instructional Strategy Diagnostic Profile (ISDP) was designed to enable instructional developers and evaluators to predict the effectiveness of, and prescribe improvements for existing instructional materials. Experimental studies were conducted in introductory college statistics and physics classes to validate the ISDP and its accompanying design prescriptions. Two methodologies were used: (1) existing instructional materials were modified, based on a selected prescription resulting from ISDP analysis of those materials, and two or more versions of the materials were compared; and (2) a weak unit of an existing course was identified and modified via several prescriptions resulting from an ISDP analysis. Test performance, affect, confidence, and time were compared for  students using the revised materials and students using the original materials. When used to revise existing materials, the ISDP prescriptions produced significant differences only in the second study. Failure to obtain predicted results may have been due to confounding factors in the experimental situations. Other studies have demonstrated that existing materials revised according to ISDP prescriptions can significantly improve student performance, especially if the interaction with the materials can be controlled and the tests can be revised to more adequately measure concept classification and rule-using behavior.

        "description":"The scientific implications and practical applications of the Stein estimator approach for estimating true scores from observed scores are of potentially great importance. The conceptual complexity is not much greater than that required for more conventional regression models. The empirical Bayesian aspect allows the examiner to incorporate his/her own degree of prior information about selected examinees. This approach allows for a more accurate estimation of true scores, with the corollary of using fewer test items to achieve those true score estimates. Efron and Morris make the point that there is little penalty for using the rules discussed here because they cannot give larger total mean squared error than the maximum likelihood estimate. This assurance may be a sufficient  reason for more careful examination of the utility of the Stein estimator and its limited translation estimators as they apply to behavioral and social science research. A numerical example is given of prediction of a season's batting averages on the basis of a sample of about 10 percent of the times at bat. (Author/CTM)",

        "description":"This paper is concerned with the question of whether and why individuals who know more about a particular knowledge domain acquire domain-related information more readily than individuals who know less about the domain. A conceptual framework is presented that hypothesizes differences in the memory structure of the high-knowledge and low-knowledge individuals, primarily with respect to concepts, higher ordered conceptual groupings, goal structures, and related strategies. Acquisition differences between high-knowledge and low-knowledge individuals are assumed to be a function of differences in memory structure, and the primary factor involved in the acquisition of domain-related information is assumed to be a process termed structural mapping, i.e., encoding input information in  terms of one's existing memory structure. The results of six experiments using male and female college students that were designed to study various aspects of the acquisition process are reported. The findings support the general framework and also emphasize the facilitative effect of conceptual differentiation and of context in the high-knowledge individuals. (Author/CTM)",

        "description":"The application of latent trait theory to classroom tests necessitates the use of small sample sizes for parameter estimation. Computer generated data were used to assess the accuracy of estimation of the slope and location parameters in the two parameter logistic model with fixed abilities and varying small sample sizes. The maximum likelihood procedure for estimating the parameters was compared to a method in which the observed relative frequencies were smoothed using an isotonic regression method prior to applying the maximum likelihood procedure. The isotonic method was considered promising because the smoothed relative frequencies yield more accurate estimates of the probability of correctly answering a test item given a particular level of the ability than do the observed  relative frequencies. The results were presented in terms of variance and mean squared error of estimating the parameters. The results indicated that the isotonic procedure provided more accurate estimates of the location parameter whereas the maximum likelihood procedure provided more accurate estimates of the slope parameter. Since the isotonic method did provide for more accurate estimation of the location parameter, it was concluded that the isotonic method warrants further attention. The implications of the results for use with classroom tests were also discussed. (Author/CTM)",

        "description":"Factor analyses of two forms of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) Aptitude Test were undertaken to better understand the abilities affecting test performance. Results suggest that three global abilities--two verbal and one quantitative--are consistently tapped by the GRE Aptitude Test. Other less prominent dimensions--some of which appear to be specific to test forms--revealed aspects of the test related to item type, speededness, and the content of reading passages. Factor extension analysis was used to estimate the loadings on these operational test factors of new items from eight experimental tests administered with the operational forms. Statistical removal of the extended factors from the matrices of tetrachoric interitem correlations of the experimental tests and  examination of residual relationships and amount of variance explained suggested that the experimental tests are, in general, adequately explained by the factors in the operational tests. There are, however, several dimensions in the experimental tests distinct from the factors underlying the operational forms. Recommendations based upon these findings are made concerning subtest length, item arrangement, and passage content. The factor analysis method is relevant for supplementing more traditional item classification and analysis techniques, and for the planned restructuring of the GRE Aptitude Test. (Author/ROF)",

While cautioning the reader about the dangers of drawing conclusions from these studies, the authors nonetheless make four broad generalizations: (1) students with higher test scores perform at a higher level in graduate school than those with lower scores; (2) the verbal ability score is most highly related to performance in subjects of a descriptive nature,  for example the humanities, while the quantitative ability score is usually more predictive in the physical sciences; (3) advanced test scores in the appropriate subject were useful predictors and improved the correlation when used along with the aptitude test scores; and (4) best prediction was obtained when undergraduate grades and test scores were used in combination.

        "description":"The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) Aptitude and Advanced Tests were evaluated as predictors of a dichotomous criterion of whether or not the candidate attained the doctorate within a specified length of time. More specifically, the project attempted to define subgroups for which the GRE tests have varying degrees of validity, and to provide biographical profiles of each subgroup as well as the optimal predictive equation for those subgroups. The GRE-Advanced tests were consistently found to be the best predictors of Ph.D. attainment. However, the predictive accuracy of the GRE-Advanced test varied considerably across graduate fields and in one case within a graduate field. That is, prediction on the whole was considerably more accurate in the &quot;hard science&quot; graduate areas of  mathematics and chemistry than in psychology. Within the psychology area, there was a &quot;u&quot; shaped relationship between predictability and age. That is, the total sample regression equation led to greater predictive accuracy for the younger and the older age groups. The middle age group (25-26 years old) was not only less predictable, but the errors in prediction tended to lead to underestimation of their actual rate of Ph.D. attainment. (Author/ROF)",

It was hypothesized that the students could select from a group of ability measures the one best indicator of how well they would do in graduate school. To test this hypothesis the sample was divided into parts, those who felt tests were the best indicator of success (test choosers) and those who felt that some other means of assessment was the best for them (non-test choosers). Within-group regressions were then computed and compared using path analysis techniques. The obtained empirical least squares weighting system gave support to the possibility that graduate students could identify those predictors which  would yield minimum errors of prediction for them. Indications of the importance of motivational measures as predictors for &quot;non-test choosers&quot; were suggested.

The number of subscores currently reported is limited by the high reliability required to make admissions decisions; subscores used only for guidance and placement would not need to meet such a rigorous standard. Subscores based on eight content areas (Personality, Learning, Measurement, Developmental psychology, Social psychology, Physiological and Comparative psychology, Perceptual and Sensory psychology, and Clinical and Abnormal psychology) were identified by the GRE Advanced Psychology Test Committee of Examiners. These experimental subscores, the two currently reported  subscores, and the total score were analyzed. Analysis showed that, for most students, additional information about strengths and weaknesses in some of the areas could be obtained. The particular subscores which could provide useful information varied from student to student. This finding was supported by an examination of fifty randomly chosen answer sheets. It was concluded that subscores based on the content areas identified by the Psychology Committee may have potential for providing additional information for purposes of guidance and placement. Subscores based on a factor analysis of the test, however, were judged not to have equivalent potential. (Author/ROF)",

The population consisted of students enrolled as full-time graduate students for the first time in the fall of 1964 in a college or university belonging to the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS). Subpopulations within each institution were composed of students enrolled in graduate study in 18 major fields--biology, business, chemistry, economics, education, engineering, French, geology, government, history, literature, mathematics, philosophy, physical education, physics, psychology, sociology, and Spanish. Majors in these fields took both the Aptitude Test and the appropriate Advanced Test. Norms are provided for the Verbal  and Quantitative sections of the Aptitude Test by major field of study and for performance on the 15 Advanced Tests. Accuracy of the data is discussed and the appendices contain the names of the institutions participating, the plan of data collection, weights used in preparing the frequency distributions, and specific fields classified under particular fields for sampling purposes.

Data drawn from a three-wave panel study (1969, 1970, 1973), initiated with 438 matrifocal households and supported through Aid for Dependent Children and 102 matrifocal households supported by the earnings of the mother, are analyzed. In the second study, poverty is considered as a breakdown between family and economy and as a function of family organization in relation to participation in the economy. Data are drawn from a two-wave panel study  initiated with 723 low-income men and 414 of their mates in 1973 and 1974.

Many concepts passed on through the educational system and through language have contributed to a form of cultural mental illness in which the objective realities of history and biology are distorted by the colonists' biases. Human relations educators must select strategies based on the theory of oppression to direct their work towards causes, not symptoms. In order to provide quality education, they should not feel bound to ethnically prejudicial testing, but should concentrate on: (1) teaching the truth (not the myth); (2) stressing historical continuity; (3)  fostering self-determination and self-knowledge; and (4) instilling the spirit of liberation, which is the knowledge and capacity to choose and create.

Specific information is provided by State with regard to Federal legislation (pending), State legislation (enacted and failed), State board of education rulings, State department of education activity and local district activity. It is noted that as of April 1976, four States had enacted legislation and four State boards of education had adopted regulations mandating some form of minimal  competency testing. Bills were pending in eight State legislatures, and five State boards had studies underway. The data show that: (1) eleven States have enacted legislation and twenty State boards have adopted regulations regarding minimal competency testing; (2) studies or hearings are in progress in nineteen other States; and (3) State boards are more likely to include life skills and other subjects in addition to the basics than are State legislatures.

School profiles (neighborhood composition, student characteristics, etc.) were matched as closely as was possible in a single school district. Questionnaires sent to teachers, professional staff members and all aides had a response rate of one hundred percent. Through statistical analysis, the following results were tabulated: (1) open schools ranked high in the index of open classroom methods and personalized curriculum, while traditional schools ranked high in the index of traditional classroom methods  and prescribed curriculum; (2) teachers' work was more routine in traditional schools than in open schools; (3) teachers in open schools had much greater participation in strategic and work decisions; (4) teachers in both schools reported a general lack of close supervisory control, but traditional schools had a greater emphasis on rules and procedures; and (5) frequency of attendance at committee meetings and contacts with staff were significantly greater at open schools. In conclusion, it is found that the two types of schools do tend to differ, both in terms of their techniques and the degree of uniformity of the teachers' work. (Author/WI)",

        "description":"There is a need to reduce barriers to women's employment in skilled trades and related blue-collar jobs. Women have been found to perform successfully as machinists, carpenters, welders, or other blue-collar workers. Why are more women working outside the home? Almost three-fourths are working because they need the money. Aware that \"men's jobs\" pay more, more women are turning to these occupations. With social support for breaking out of the stereotyped image, more women are now able to acknowledge their interests and seek personally satisfying work. Nevertheless, statistics show that only 4% of skilled blue-collar jobs are held by women. By 1970, there were 495,000 women (an increase of 80% over the 1960 figure) employed in skilled trades. Employment discrimination has not  ended. Now, however, state and federal laws guarantee women's equal employment opportunities. In addition, affirmative action, required of all federal contractors, can be demanded of other employers under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 if investigation reveals a discrimination pattern. That many women have the aptitudes to perform jobs dominated by men has been demonstrated by tests and on-the-job experience. Employers and unions are finding that women are capable of handling blue-collar jobs and that they are eager for an opportunity to succeed.

The first case study from IBM states that despite educational opportunities, plus strong assurance of enduring employment, many mature engineers did not enroll in job-related courses. IBM is now attempting to motivate engineers through job redesign and other measures. Case 2 is concerned with a Xerox training approach which provides continuing education through the corporation and educational institutions. It is suggested that Xerox may be able to  develop internally most of its senior managers rather than hire new managers from outside. The third case history is a study of the provision by a Pennsylvania state agency of training to municipal employees. One implication drawn from this study and the IBM study is that eliminating the costs of training may be an insufficient stimulus for participation. Steady employment is cited as an important element. (Two earlier reports in this series are also available--see note.) (CSS)",

        "description":"A project was conducted to develop and implement a system which would facilitate (1) communications relating to career education between and among the states and extra-state jurisdictions, federal agencies, and national organizations and (2) the strengthening of career education leadership personnel in the areas of planning, organization and coordination, funding patterns and strategies, and information dissemination. To accomplish these goals, the Committee on Career Education organized two task forces: the Communications Task Force (CTF), which was comprised of six state directors of career education, and the Staff Development Task Force (SDTF), which was comprised of seven state directors of career education. The CTF developed a newsletter (EXCHANGE) as a source of information  for chiefs and state directors of career education and organized two national conferences for state directors/coordinators of career education. The SDTF developed, field-tested, and modified an information-gathering instrument designed to provide information on competencies perceived to be desirable and the extent to which these existed. This instrument was used to collect data at the first national conference, and the collected data served as a basis for planning the second conference. The high priority needs identified by the survey were needs assessments, evaluation, utilizing advisory councils, and implementation. In addition, the project produced several print products related to these priority needs. (These products, conference evaluation reports, and other conference-related  materials are appended.) (BM)",

Two hundred sixty-one participants, representing all fifty states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, attended the conference. Nine topical areas were considered as they apply to career education: teaching/learning processes, evaluation, counseling, business/labor/industry involvement, parent involvement, handicapped students, female students, gifted and talented students, and minority students. Phase 1 examined these topics from the practitioners' viewpoint. Phase 2 considered implications for state coordinators of career education. Phase 3 examined the topics from a national perspective as conceptualizers and executive officers of national associations made suggestions and  recommendations. In addition to the mini-conferences, four meetings regarding evaluation and data collection were held for the directors of federally funded career education projects. The conference participants were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their perceptions of the outcomes of the conferences, suggestions for improvement, and issues in need of further investigation. Most of the participants mentioned that the greatest benefits they derived from the conferences were the innovative ideas on practice, administration, and involvement of groups other than educators in career education.

Based on these sub-goals, thirty-five  objectives were identified. Seven Michigan career education planning districts participated in the project. Each planning district was responsible for at least one objective in each of three sub-goal areas. It was found that 78% of the objectives were successfully accomplished and that many planning districts were providing more services than required. Although achievement testing was included in the evaluation plan, the achievement related to career education required the development and use of criterion-referenced tests, which were generally open-ended type items. This did not permit the usual statistical analyses and comparisons; however, results indicated that both the experimental and control groups improved in achievement.

Two sets of research studies are used as a background for analyzing needs and services. The first set of studies consists of thirty state and national surveys or needs assessments of \"learners,\"\"would-be,\" or \"potential learners.\" The second set of studies consists of investigations into the self-directed learning activities of adults. The author attempts to integrate the findings of both sets of research. A third resource which is examined consists of more than forty sets of recommendations for program implementation. In supplying the missing link between learner interest and learning resources the author focuses on three general areas: (1) facilitating access to  appropriate learning resources, a process that includes access for underserved groups and advocacy for the special needs of adult learners; (2) providing information to adult learners about available learning resources and about themselves and their strengths and weaknesses, and (3) providing counseling and referral services designed to assist learners in planning, and matching learner needs to appropriate learning resources.

Two recent innovations, programmable controllers and programmable hand calculators, are considered, along with the more familiar numerical control, in part I. Part I also briefly discusses powder metallurgy and \"nontraditional\" machining. Part II deals  with training requirements and sources of training. It describes several programs in educational institutions outside the industry. The third part, four case studies in training in metalworking, considers different firms of varying size and technology. Two of the case studies deal with sources of, and needs for, numerical control (NC) training. The other two describe training for powder metallurgy and electrochemical machining. Implications are drawn for productivity and the quality of working life in the metalworking industries.

        "description":"Two separate research reports are presented in this paper. In the first report, we have identified through literacy research three sets of job-related reading tasks for adults: (1) those involved in getting a job, (2) those concerned with learning a job, and (3) those concerned with doing a job. National surveys have indicated that the black, poor, and undereducated (the primary adult basic education population) do poorly on task 1 skills, such as reading employment ads. Evidence suggests that job training might produce job-specific reading skills and permit marginally literate persons to function more adequately in task 3 (on-the-job) skills than their reading score might predict. In the second research report, we have employed a model of stages involved in the child's  acquisition of reading skills. The model emphasized primacy of language before reading and the fact that reading is built upon language competency. One competency aspect is auding, the ability to comprehend spoken language. A confirmation of the model is that third, fourth, and fifth-grade students have been found to comprehend better by auding than by reading. Marginally literate young men have typically been found to be low in language and reading skills. One research implication is that adult basic education reading training should be based first on what students comprehend by auding. (CSS)",

Although the study was limited by its neglect of factors such as the effect of judicial decisions on  authorizing or prohibiting such contracting, it was able to draw the following conclusions: (1) federal statutes and regulations permit such contracts when reasonable justification for them exists; (2) state laws and regulations vary from granting expressed authority to only implying such authority; and (3) a small number of state constitutions restrict the use of public funds for such contracts; and (4) forty-four state plans provide for such contracts despite existing state laws. Also reviewed in the study were the state laws governing the licensing and minimum standards for private vocational training sources. (The appendix contains the state profiles and is organized into six categories based on the clarity of the authorization or prohibition of such contracts.) (ELG)",

        "description":"This paper argues that the military plays an extremely important role in youth labor markets by providing not only jobs but also experience and training which can later be transferred to the civilian labor market. Following the introduction, section II examines the military's demand for labor; its fluctuations due to secular, cyclical, and seasonal variables; and its impact on the youth labor market. The military is an important factor in the youth labor market, and it is becoming an important one also in the minorities and women's labor markets. Section III considers the supply side effects of military service by discussing the flow between the military and civilian youth labor markets, the variables that affect the decisions of enlisting or leaving the military, and the human  capital accumulation gained through military work experience that can then be used in the civilian manpower pool. Sections IV and V explore the military's impact on youth unemployment, focusing on demographic trends over time and the black unemployment problem. In section VI it is concluded that the paper's findings have several implications for the measurement and collection of data on the youth labor market, specifically in the areas of (1) youth unemployment rates which should include military as well as civilian labor, (2) aggregate labor force statistics which should be subdivided to reflect factors such as age and race, and (3) special labor force data which should acknowledge an individual's military experience.

        "description":"Thirteen studies have evaluated the potential benefits from military training that individuals gain upon leaving active duty. Despite the fact that three-fourths of military jobs have direct civilian counterparts, most of these studies indicate that military training does not have a positive effect on the civilian job opportunities for veterans. The conclusions of these studies, however, are questionable because of the methodologies and samples used. Three different approaches have been tried relying on (1) opinion survey data from separatees or retirees, (2) cross-tabulations of occupational codes comparing the military specialty of separatees with their current civilian occupations, and (3) multiple regression analysis to measure the economic benefits in civilian life that  separatees derive from service training. The results have also been influenced by the use of limited samples (for example, separatees with only two years or less of active duty or only infantrymen) or by the time period in which the selected sample served their tours of duty. Because of the restricted scope of these previous studies, future research should be broadened to consider issues such as the return to training for separatees who use their military skills in the civilian sector compared to the return for those who do not; comparison between individuals in the same occupation who have military training and those who do not; and the distinction between formal and informal military training.

        "description":"An interim study was conducted in Kentucky to determine the effectiveness of Competency Based Vocational Education (CBVE) and to compare its effectiveness to that of traditional teaching methodologies. Research surveys of those directly involved in the implementation of CBVE were used to ascertain if CBVE is meeting its self-stated goals. Approximately twenty-five percent of all high school and postsecondary educators and students (forty-five administrators, fifty-five teachers, and 745 students) participating in CBVE in Kentucky were questioned. Five aspects of the program were evaluated: instructional planning, student impact, instructional management, professional development, and programmatic aspects. To compare the effectiveness of CBVE and traditional methodologies, a  cognitive skill test and classroom summary report (which incorporated a performance skill test) were administered to eleven classes in the areas of bank teller, secretary, and tractor mechanics. Based on the test scores and questionnaire responses, the following conclusions were reached: (1) CBVE was meeting the career needs of students, (2) CBVE students were progressing faster than students taught by traditional methods and learned a larger amount of subject matter, and (3) CBVE was inexpensive to implement in the schools' present facilities. Because these conclusions resulted from an interim, and therefore limited, study, they should be viewed within that context. (ELG)",

The first of seven chapters addresses the following issues: the availability of job training/retraining data, the desirability of informing workers in advance of technological change, advantages/disadvantages of training methods, and the general effectiveness of retraining to assure job security. The first case study, presented in chapter 2, discusses the removal of foundry worker's apprehensions about moving into a new foundry through on-the-job training (OJT) and assurances that job declines would be met through attrition. Chapter 3 examines a case in which single craft mechanics were transformed to multicraft  personnel through OJT and home study. The fourth chapter contains a case in which graphic arts innovations and employer attitudes resulted in mature worker's layoffs. Chapter 5 discusses the use of simulation to upgrade welders' skills. Chapter 6 recounts a case in which Detroit retrained building inspectors. The importance of continuing education and training are emphasized in chapter 7. This final chapter formulates policy implications and suggests that efforts to achieve high productivity through technology is generally accepted by unions provided companies pursue a job security policy.

        "description":"This document presents the final report of a study conducted by the Committee on Evaluation and Training Programs to assess the impact of CETA (Comprehensive Employment and Training Act) on manpower programs. The report examines the differences between CETA Title I programs and their predecessors and compares legislative goals with results. It also examines the impact of public service employment programs on the structurally oriented programs of Title I and the degree to which the primary objective of Title V (creation of new jobs) is achieved. Chapter 1 of ten chapters provides an overview of CETA history, a summary of CETA objectives, and a summary of the evaluation committee's conclusions in relation to accomplishments, problems and recommendations, and policy issues. Chapters  2-9 discuss the major findings under the following categories: resources and allocations; manpower planning; administration; program choices; the delivery of Title I services; public service employment; clientele; and program effectiveness. The last chapter summarizes the major findings and recommendations under the following topics: allocation of resources; substantive aspects of CETA programs; administrative processes; and institutional relationships. Included in the appendixes are a glossary of manpower acronyms; the calculation formula for the job creation ratio; highlights of the proposals and recommendations made by the National Commission for Manpower Policy; and statistical tables.

        "description":"This paper describes physician and physician extender (i.e., a person who renders services under the supervision and responsibility of a physician) supply and distribution and provides projections of the supply. It addresses inequities of access to health care by examining the relationship to disparities in physician distribution by specialty and geography. The first of eight sections gives the 1976 active physician supply (as determined by American Medical Association and American Osteopathic Association data) as 362,970. Primary, secondary, and tertiary-care physician supply is investigated, and data on osteopathic doctors, women, minorities, foreign medical graduates, and specialty manpower is presented. Section 2 reviews the intern/resident supply for the groups mentioned  above. In section 3 characteristics of physician extenders, such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, are examined. Section 4 looks at the geographic distribution of physician and physician extenders. The fifth section projects the medical specialist supply. A first-year residency illustration shows that primary medical doctor care to population ratio might be expected to increase from sixty-five to eighty-five per 100,000 from 1974 to 1990. Section 6 discusses projected increases in the physician extender supply. Areas for further research are identified in section 7. The final section highlights policies, strategies, and priorities which impact on physician and physician extender supply and distribution. (This publication is an updated version of ED 144 512.)

Focusing on the functions of the advisory committee, chapter 1 discusses the following topics: reasons for establishing an advisory group; role of advisory council for total school programs; role of advisory committee for individual career programs; roles of supportive school personnel; and defining what type of group is needed. Chapter 2 focuses on the organization of advisory committees and discusses their functions with school administration; obtaining support for an advisory committee; developing a working membership; and  establishing advisory committees. Chapter 3 presents important information related to advisory committee meetings and includes such topics as elements of a good meeting; how many meetings are necessary; planning the agenda; and evaluation and follow-up. Some of the topics discussed in the final chapter on maintenance are orientation of members; long-range planning; outside assignments; recognition; and revitalizing old committees and/or ineffective ones. Several related materials are appended, such as an organization checklist, roles and responsibilities of committee officers and members, a sample constitution of an advisory committee for career education, sample agendas, evaluation forms, and a sample letter of appreciation.

Interviews with one hundred thirty lower ranking enlisted personnel provided information about soldiers' satisfaction with various facets of military experience and their perceptions of the behavior of superiors whom they viewed as either formulating (originators) or merely relaying (givers) daily orders. Regression analyses indicated that satisfaction with both the quality of army life in general and leadership in particular were related more closely to perceived attributes of the originator rather than to such attributes of the giver. This finding is attributed to the originator's greater hierarchical influence within the army structure.  (Author)",

Divided into six major sections, this report reviews the Center's activities and attempts to place these activities into the context of the Nation's progress in productivity relative to economic and social goals. Section 1 points out the need for a national policy explicitly directed toward improving productivity. The second section emphasizes the contribution productivity growth can make to solving some national problems and to achieving some long term goals. The third section details the  recent deceleration in the rate at which our productivity is improving. The next two sections outline, on a national basis and for specific sectors, what has been, is being, and needs to be done to increase productive efficiency. The sixth section sets forth the Center's recommendations for actions, both public and private, which would raise the nation's rate of productivity growth. Appended materials include an annotated listing of the Center's publications; listings of Center-sponsored studies, reports, articles, and other activities; a listing of productivity and quality of working life centers (see also CE 019 154); and a brief summary of some of the productivity-related projects of other federal agencies.

Also, the number of unemployed youth dropped by 280,000 over the year to 2.0 million, with the greatest decrease occurring among those not in school. Unemployment rates are described as relatively high for students and out-of-school youths. Blacks are reported to have much higher unemployment rates than whites. The article is supplemented by seventeen tables based on census data from the Current Population Survey. The tables provide information on the employment status of the civilian  noninstitutional population by school enrollment status, race, sex, and age (sixteen to thirty-four years old). Data is also presented for this population according to type of school and race. Other tables contain employment status figures for high school graduates, college graduates, high school and college dropouts, and persons of Spanish origin. Data is presented for the worker's occupation, industry, and class (self-employed or wage/salary worker). In addition, unemployment duration for persons enrolled in school, high school graduates, and dropouts is depicted. Explanatory notes related to the tables are included. (CSS)",

Victims were assumed to be consenting parties unless criminal circumstances could be proved. Victims were oftened questioned about past sexual behavior. Current reform efforts have attempted to correct these injustices. Legislative changes have attempted to redefine rape to recognize varying degrees with flexible penalty structures and to take into account issues of child sexual molestation, rape within marriage, and the rape in which a male is the victim. In some states, penalty structures are being reduced. Privacy for victims, advocate programs, service programs, and prevention and self-defense programs are being  introduced. The Michigan and Washington State laws offer patterns of successful change. Appendices include a summation table and narrative description of legislation for each state. (Author/JLL)",

In the twentieth century, the trend toward institutionalization began to be reversed. Patients or clients were released or returned to communities and community care through increasingly available medical and social resources. The impetus toward the use of alternatives to institutionalization has come from federal legislation and from a continuing loss of institutionalized clientele since the 1950's.

And to the guidance counselors themselves, who often have the primary responsibility of insuring for an effective guidance program, the monograph will surely prove to be a useful resource. Chapters deal with all  aspects of guidance program development, including needs assessment, planning and organization, program implementation, and program evaluation. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper presents the results of a study of 211 North Carolina school counselors within their first five years of the profession. The counselors were surveyed as to their functions, areas of competence, and areas of professional difficulty. Professional difficulty was defined as a discrepancy between function and competence. From the study, a profile of elementary, junior high, and high school counselors can be determined. Among other things, it was found that levels of competence seem to reflect the level at which one counsels rather than training received. This supports the idea that counselors develop competence as a result of performing functions once they are on the job. Among the types of counseling listed as performed most often are value clarification; vocational;  education; and personal-social. (Author/BP)",

        "description":"This is the fifth and final paper of a symposium on the evaluation of juvenile diversion programs by the Claremont Graduate School Center for Applied Social Research. The first four papers deal with specific methodologies used to obtain information at each of four levels of evaluation: general project management, description of the intervention, assessment of client outcomes, and analysis of system-wide impact. This fifth paper provides an overview of how the specific methodologies fit into the framework of our overall evaluation plan. A key concept in the author's approach to evaluation is the use of multiple sources of information to address each major program issue (e.g., What is the impact of diversion programs on the juvenile justice system?). Thus, a number of data sources  in addition to those described in the methodological papers were used, including archival sources, questionnaires, and interviews. This paper includes a discussion of these aspects of the evaluation effort, and focuses on relationships between various methodological approaches. Another topic discussed is the difficulty evaluators face in attempting simultaneously to fulfill responsibilities to diverse constituencies including clients, project staff, service providers, the community, and funding agencies and political bodies.

In recent years, however, this emphasis has been questioned and from the current debate over treatment goals and outcome measures at least two areas of controversy have emerged. The first, called the \"abstention-moderation\" controversy, questions whether some alcoholics can return to and maintain normal or controlled drinking, and discusses the implications of this outcome for treatment goals. The second involves the broadening of outcome measures to include a wide spectrum of social and psychological behavior, including attitudes and self-concept, job and marital stability, and earnings or income from employment. Research on various aspects of these two areas has  been conducted, but a resolution of the conflicts has not yet emerged. (Author/BP)",

These questionnaires were issued to a sample of 238 families during a nine-month period, and return rates of 80% were achieved. Three classes of variables were examined for possible association with premature termination from services: (a) client satisfaction measured by questionnaire responses; (b) demographic client characteristics; and (c) clinician  characteristics. Premature terminators and clients who followed through with clinic services were indistinguishable on the basis of client satisfaction and demographic variables. Contrary to expectations, clients who terminated prematurely did not have greater levels of dissatisfaction with clinic services and procedures. (Author)",

While most tutoring programs are aimed at helping tutees or tutors with academic difficulties, this study involved all children in two classrooms in a peer tutoring project. A multiple baseline design indicated that prompting was effective in establishing tutoring behaviors among the children. By the end of the program, children were using corrective feedback, re-presenting questions, and employing contingent praise. Positive findings were found in academic, behavioral, and consumer satisfaction indices. Also evaluated were two interventions directed at enhancing social skills in groups of first and third grade children. Triads were taught one of four social  skills -- touching, asking questions, sharing or praising through a behavioral intervention consisting of instructions, modeling, behavioral rehearsal, feedback and reinforcement. While increases in social behaviors were noted, follow-up indicated substantial erosion in gains. In the ecological intervention, dramatic increases in sharing were noted for an isolate child after he was placed in a group whose members displayed high levels of sharing. Comparisons were made of the differential effectiveness of behavioral versus ecological approaches in establishing and maintaining behaviors. (Author)",

Benjamin Bloom's &quot;Cognitive Taxonomy&quot; can serve as a hierarchical framework for the design of questions. Within this framework, a teacher can confront decision making in a sophisticated manner and design powerful reading comprehension activities. Five questions a teacher must consider relative to the style and content of the text and to the nature of the learner are: In examining the selection, are there problems with style that may impede understanding of the lowest levels of content, identified by Bloom as knowledge and translation? To what extent does the selection content enable the teacher to expand the  cognitive levels of questioning so as to go beyond the memory level of reading comprehension? How can the instructional planner diversify the questions that guide reading comprehension so as to incorporate higher cognitive levels? How does a cognitive ordering of questions affect the way the reader processes the reading material? What kind of affective &quot;side-effects&quot; are aroused by the nature of the questions, and how do they influence the readers' attitude toward reading? (TJ)",

The children reported spending a median time of 60 minutes per week in leisure reading, primarily with either books or comics, but also with newspapers. While gender and reading attainment emerged as the strongest predictors of leisure reading, the most significant finding was the apparent complexity of leisure reading: although earlier studies related the individual variables used in this study to leisure reading, those same variables collectively accounted for only 22.9% of the variation in time  devoted to book reading, 7.46% of the variation in time spent reading comics, and 18.75% of the differences between book and comic readers.

Three guidelines should be followed in evaluating college remedial reading programs: first, appropriate variables that allow for maximum input must be selected; second, the evaluation must cover not only the performance of the students in the program but the entire program itself; and, finally, the end result of the evaluation must be program improvement. Since no complete evaluation model has been developed to aid college remedial reading program directors, directors must rely on the few evaluation models that have been proposed. Until meaningful systematic  evaluations of college remedial reading programs can be carried out, the success of such programs and their various methodologies--in short, the need for such programs--will be seriously questioned.

After they have finished reading, they retell the significant chapter events, state the conflicts, and identify the characters as the teacher records the information on the chalkboard. A sentence combining activity can be used following a &quot;read a book in an hour&quot; session. The teacher writes student contributions in short, simple sentences on the board and then asks students to combine the sentences either working alone or in small groups. Instruction in comprehension also can be enhanced by use of the &quot;read a book in an hour&quot; technique. Organizational patterns used by authors, such as cause and effect,  comparison and contrast, time order, and simple listing, can be recognized by students as they analyze a story. Activities which might teach these elements are numerous. &quot;Read a book in an hour,&quot; then, can be a valuable technique by itself for encouraging reluctant readers or it can be combined with other exercises to teach several language arts skills.

        "description":"Fifteen high school English teachers and 544 students in their classes participated in a study to determine how well teachers assess student reading habits and attitudes and to compare the accuracy of their judgments with those of student-peers. Each student was administered a measure of reading ability and of reading attitude; additional data gathered for each student included grades received in previous English and social studies classes. Reading habits were measured through a self-report indicating the number of books read by the student during the previous six months. The students were asked to list the three classmates who had the most positive attitudes and the three with the most negative attitudes toward reading. Teachers were asked to rate the reading attitude of each  class member as \"positive,\"\"moderate,\" or \"negative.\" Results showed that reading attitude and reading habit were separable from measures of academic ability, that the ability of both teachers and student-peers to assess reading attitude correlated more highly with English grades than with measures of reading habit or attitude, and that the reading attitude measure used in the study was able to predict student reading habit with more accuracy than were either teachers or students.

The purpose of the first experiment was to examine some basic aspects of the processing of words, pseudowords, and nonwords and to discover basic differences in processing that might underlie the word advantage (the relative perceptibility of words, compared to that of nonwords). The second experiment assessed the contribution of whole-word and letter cluster cues to the word advantage. The other two experiments focused on whether the word advantage can be wholly explained in terms of response bias or sophisticated guessing. The study yielded these results: the word advantage is mediated by  perceptual processes; in terms of basic information processing, the processing of words and nonwords appears to be quite similar; and although identity and positional information are extracted by separate mechanisms, they exhibit a mutual dependence. The results are compatible with a criterion-bias model that attributes the word advantage to the relationship among single letters and lexical units in memory.

Teacher beliefs about reading can be viewed both in terms of standard models (such as basal text, linear skills, natural language, interest-based, and integrated curriculum models) and in terms of dimensions of teacher decision-making as revealed by field observation. The Propositional Inventory, the instrument developed to assess teacher beliefs, yields data relative to both perspectives, measuring both the theoretical and practical domains of a teacher's belief system in reading. The instrument went through a two-year evolution before reaching its final  form. It can be used to ascertain consistency of professed beliefs with classroom practices, to determine if teachers with particular reading beliefs share dimensions of decision-making with other belief systems, to investigate the relationship between beliefs and demographic characteristics, and to monitor change in reading beliefs over time.

Some techniques that may be helpful to teachers in motivating the disadvantaged to read are: reading silently while students read; reading aloud to students; setting paperback books on their desks; reading aloud to a climactic point and stopping; allowing students to act out reading material; establishing a classroom library; advertising reading through posters, book jackets, and slogans; and  utilizing the newspaper as a medium for reading.

Familiarity with a model of studying that divides studying into prereading, reading, and postreading provides one explanation for this effectiveness. In prereading, students clarify the purposes related to the study session. During reading, they go through a series of instructional episodes that include reading, a response-demand event, student response, feedback, and decisions on what to do next. In postreading, students employ strategies to enrich learning. The self-questioning technique provides guidelines for how to divide the reading material into small units, helps create a nontrivial response-demand  event, and encourages students to test themselves on how well they know the material. Positive comments from students indicate that the technique is a guide, distinguishes the relevant from the trivial, and facilitates memory. Negative comments are that it is too time-consuming, the overall picture is sometimes lost, and students learn more than they need to know. Nevertheless, the technique can be a supporting activity used in a number of ways or the questions can be seen as an index to students' reading comprehension. (TJ)",

Prior to the viewings, the subjects' aggression levels were measured by means of a questionnaire. A continuous measurement of galvanic skin response was made as the subjects viewed the presentations. After the viewings, the subjects participated in an experimental game which provided them with the opportunity to reward or punish (or refrain from  either) a person of the same sex whose role was to provide them with information necessary to achieve a desired goal and who provoked frustration in the subjects by occasionally giving incorrect information. It was concluded that no evidence for a general arousal effect was observed, that evidence of observational learning was found only for prosocial behavior, and that arousal and frustration levels predicted only subsequent antisocial behavior.

Analysis of the data indicated that  adolescents from pluralistic families knew more than other adolescents about consumer-related matters, were better able to detect puffery in advertising and to manage a family budget, knew more about products, and were more likely to show socially desirable consumer behaviors.

Results, based on responses to a 16-item knowledge test mailed to newspaper subscribers and nonsubscribers before and after the series appeared, showed that newspaper subscribers increased their scores significantly from 1976 when the series began to 1977, that nonsubscribers did not increase their scores significantly, and that those who remembered reading at least one article from the series increased their scores by more than those who did not remember reading an article. Examination of specific test items showed that persons who both  received the pretest questionnaire and saw the series of articles generally received the highest scores on the posttest, suggesting that questionnaire sensitization was a factor in the study. Scores both before and after the series were found to increase as educational level increased, and younger readers learned more from the series than older readers.

Among the questions posed by the communications educators were how these capabilities might be of use to journalism instruction and research, and whether there are advantages to having them integrated into one system. The educators wanted a computer system to help in such areas as computer assisted instruction, analysis of textual materials, tabulation and reduction of statistical data, reductions in the complexity of conventional  computer tasks, bibliographic systems, analysis of the editorial process, simulation and games, word processing, and the transfer of electronic copy. The problems in implementing such a system involve such factors as cost, formidable complexity, system augmentation and modernization, potential intrusions into the teaching process, and security.

These perceptual and cognitive shifts, however, were not matched by behavioral changes in any of the  investigated areas; despite initial expectations, few respondents in the followup had detected any changes in their own behaviors with people of other races, had actively sought to discover their own roots, or had read the book version of &quot;Roots.&quot; One explanation for the lack of long-term behavioral changes is that anticipated changes may have been minimized by a communication environment that returned to &quot;normal&quot; after heightened interest in &quot;Roots&quot; waned and that no longer placed a premium on altering one's interactions with people of other races, reading the book, or searching for one's roots.

        "description":"Comments of experienced teachers suggest that writing may be avoided in school not simply because of its inherent difficulty, but because its undertaking typically lacks connection to anything else in the lives of students or teachers. It is possible that teachers can best serve the acquisition of writing skills by structuring the social occasions within which writing might function meaningfully, thus creating a situation similar to that in which children first acquire language skills. One second-grade classroom in central Michigan, in which children do a great deal of writing, was studied closely by researchers during one school year. The classroom had been transformed into the town of &quot;Betterburg&quot; and included such features as law enforcement and governing agencies, cultural  and commercial activities, and a postal system. Children wrote often and produced a wide variety of documents; their central writing activity was writing letters to each other, their families, and such outsiders as manufacturers of toys and games. The postal system of Betterburg symbolizes the potential efficacy of the students in the world of communication. (The report includes items showing the importance students attached to their town of &quot;Betterburg&quot; and a table showing writing products and occasions for writing on one particular day.)

The 131 editorials that were examined appeared in the &quot;New York Times,&quot; the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; the &quot;Wall Street Journal,&quot; the &quot;Chicago Tribune,&quot; and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; within 21 days of the following news events: the Tonkin Gulf incident, the 1968 Tet Offensive, President Nixon's 1969 &quot;Vietnamization&quot; announcement, and the fall of Saigon. Five major findings resulted from the content analysis: (1) The overall tone of the editorials was antiwar. (2) During the periods studied, the &quot;New York Times&quot; was consistently antiwar while the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; trended from antiwar to  prowar and the other three newspapers trended from prowar to antiwar. (3) The newspapers were willing to take definite stands during the periods under study. (4) The paper that most clearly appeared to have changed its editorial opinion was the &quot;Los Angeles Times.&quot; (5) The &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Washington Post,&quot; both generally prolific in their editorials throughout the periods studied, inexplicably presented fewer items on the Tet Offensive than the other papers.

The next six essays present practical proposals for teaching the new student, which include using traditional literature, popular fiction, formula fiction, native American literature, folklore, and moral value discussions in composition. The  remaining essays call for a humanistic response to the future of writing as proposed by Marshall McLuhan and others, discuss the theories that support traditional modes of rhetoric, and illustrate the function of metaphor in science, the humanities, and all discourse.

Both science and environmental writers have suggested that the problems they face would be decreased by the use of more interpretive and investigative reporting, and the use of interpretive reporting in science writing has in fact been on the rise. In recognition of the value to writers of personal or real world experience, some programs have been developed to offer such experience to science writers and to undergraduate students in science and environmental writing programs. At Lehigh University, students in one course write reports after attending meetings of local environmental groups,  after visiting a local industrial or environmental site such as a steel plant, and after working in teams on three-month investigative studies of ongoing local environmental problems. In a second course, students work for environmental groups, preparing public relations materials. Courses in science writing require students to write interpretive magazine articles on controversial scientific issues and have enabled some students to attend and write about a meeting of a national scientific association. New experiential programs are planned for the future. (GW)",

The  five role-model treatments were administered to 20 \"client\" groups, each composed of from three to five undergraduate public relations students working on a case study project. Following the five-week case study project, the student-clients completed questionnaires. The findings revealed that the problem-solving/task facilitator role received the highest ratings on task accomplishment, process efficacy, and consultant expertise.

The responses of 88 pairs were used to allow for a study of the adviser/principal relationship as it pertained to the job satisfaction of the adviser. Job satisfaction scores of the advisers were compared with scores on their perception of communication conditions with the principal, the types of news the principal allowed to be printed, the topics allowed, the overall censorship situation, and whether or not the advisers were certified to teach journalism. The job satisfaction scores were then compared to corresponding principals' scores in areas  of symbaditic communication and to principals' rankings of their own management styles.

Some of the persuasive techniques of the black folk tradition include punning, language improvisation, indirection (a technique of sending messages through innuendo or suggestion), metaphorical image making, bragging, exaggerated language, and the use of words or phrases for sound effects. Forms of communication that enrich black language range from \"Call and Response,\" involving a spontaneous and nonverbal interaction between the speaker's calls and the listener's answers  (found in spirituals, work songs, and sermons), to sequencing of narratives or storytelling that is structured to explain, persuade, influence, or entertain (illustrated in black folk stories and toasts). Another communication system, semantic signaling by way of tones, consists of using vocal inflections and voice rhythms to convey meaning and involves a type of talk-singing. (MAI)",

Decisions issued by several federal circuit courts of appeal have freed students from regulations allowing arbitrary prior censorship although none of these cases specifically applied to official school newspapers. In 1971, the California Legislature set forth freedom of expression guarantees for secondary students but made no reference to student newspapers produced in journalism classes; some school districts, therefore, concluded that such papers were not covered  in the guarantees. The Los Angeles school board produced its own guidelines that prohibited the use of profanity and the endorsement of political candidates and allowed for prior censorship by principals. However, in 1976, the California Supreme Court banned any form of prior censorship, after which the California statute was amended to include student newspapers and to allow prior restraint only in cases of libel, slander, obscenity, and material threatening a substantial disruption of school activities. In spite of this, some school officials continue to ignore the law and to adopt restrictive policies for student newspapers.

The speech cases concerned the right of individuals to communicate directly with other individuals through speech, signs, symbols, or leaflets. The press cases dealt with the right to communicate indirectly using a form of mass communication. Newspaper stories were examined for three days and editorials for ten days after the decisions had been filed. The ten newspapers combined gave  significantly greater coverage to the press decisions, reporting them 85% of the time as opposed to 60% of the time for speech cases. Press decisions were mentioned in headlines 65% of the time, compared to 25% for speech cases. The newspapers editorialized on press decisions 24% of the time to 8% for speech decisions, and tended to favor free expression significantly more often in editorials about the press than in those about speech.

After Comstock declared two issues of a socialist newspaper unmailable because Sanger had mentioned the names of venereal diseases in her articles on sex, Sanger resorted to publishing her own newspaper, &quot;The Woman Rebel.&quot; The first issue and six of the next eight issues were suppressed for their controversial content and Sanger was indicted on nine  counts of law violation, despite the fact that the articles contained only general discussions of contraception. After Sanger fled to Europe, alleging that the courts were treating her unfairly, her estranged husband was arrested for passing on one copy of her birth control pamphlet. Resentful of his publicity, Sanger returned seeking a court trial in order to achieve publicity for her cause. When the government decided not to prosecute her, she achieved publicity by forming an organization to promote contraception. (MAI)",

        "description":"Experiential learning techniques, widely used in the United States in the field of intercultural communication, can be modified for use by individuals from other cultures. The experiential learning approach involves the use of exercises that parallel real life situations, involve all participants, require active participation, provide instant feedback, and are flexible. The approach works primarily on the affective level and is based on enabling individuals to learn how to learn. Among its basic assumptions are that an open, supportive, and nonevaluative environment should be developed; that the responsibility for learning rests ultimately on the learner; and that experiential learning builds on the experience of the individual. Experiential instruction in intercultural  communication aims at increasing understanding of other cultures, developing skills for effective cross-cultural interactions, and promoting intercultural communication. A number of simulation exercises and games have been developed for these purposes. (Sixteen simulation exercises are listed; playing time, suggested number and educational level of participants, and a brief description are included for each exercise. A bibliography of relevant materials is also provided.) (GW)",

Puppets are small, easy to transport and to operate, fun to see, have little cultural identification, can talk about embarrassing things, and can encourage people to think and talk by asking questions or by helping them see themselves more clearly. The Welfare Services Division of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has developed a handbook for making puppets and has written scripts dealing with health concepts for use in Samoa, Fiji, and Tonga. The agency has also offered workshops for teachers on those islands in the making and use of puppets and has assisted them in  developing scripts about local health problems. Workshop participants have used puppets throughout the region to teach some difficult health subjects in an interesting way. (TJ)",

Combining information from educational literature with material from personal interviews, it describes functioning examples of each type of school. One chapter focuses on districts offering a large spectrum of alternatives and suggests reasons for the successes and failures of these programs. A concluding chapter offers  a selection of helpful ideas gleaned from the literature and from interviews on successful implementation of an alternative school program.

This booklet reviews literature on self-concept and describes many programs designed to improve student self-esteem. The paper begins by noting that although no one understands the order of the cause and effect relationship, there is a strong correlation between self-concept and achievement. Then ways to improve self-concept are discussed, with a warning that techniques for measuring self-concept have problems. Methods for improving self-concept include classroom techniques, counseling and discussion groups, and teacher inservice programs. One chapter is devoted to programs for dropouts, delinquents, and the disadvantaged. A final chapter documents  the effects of teacher attitudes and beliefs and suggests ways to improve teacher self-concept. The overall conclusion is that one reason for the success of self-concept improvement programs may be that positive teacher attitudes about student abilities have strong effects on student self-concept and student academic achievement.

The program, conducted in an open space building with an open campus policy, was evaluated in order to assess its effect on the cognitive and affective behavior of students. The social studies area was focused on since it was considered the most innovative aspect of the program. The evaluation process used objective tests, observations, interviews, and examinations of school materials and included two other schools for comparison. Results indicated that compared to  students in other programs, seniors in the Rumson-Fair Haven program regarded their situation as more open, flexible, and responsive and displayed greater critical thinking ability and tolerance of ambiguity. On the other hand, these students were not most satisfied with their educational experience, did not show greater mastery of concepts and skills, and did not lead on a measure of self-assessed growth. The evaluators recommended continuing and strengthening the program. (Author/PGD)",

The collaboratives are in competition with the regional education centers and with the local education agencies for state and federal funds. The history of collaboratives is traced and their areas of conflict with state and local agencies are discussed. Proposed legislation concerning collaboratives is presented. Areas of  increasing conflict are projected for the future when, because of dwindling resources, the state attempts more centralization of services. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"The deliberate assignment of students to groups, generally grades and classrooms, is an integral part of education in schools; in addition, tracks, streams, and ability groups are created in many educational systems. The resulting partitioning of students is referred to here as the organizational differentiation of students. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the consequences of various forms of organizational differentiation in regard to opportunities and achievements of students. Organizational differentiation may affect student outcomes through a number of mechanisms--by creating career trajectories in a system and thus structuring educational opportunities; by creating different learning and social environments relevant for academic achievement and socialization; and by  creating a set of signals about the competencies and likely futures of students relevant to the decision-making of teachers, parents, and students. The main proposal of the present paper is to recognize in future research that the organizational differentiation of students defines a structure of flows in an educational system. The processes that govern the flows are a far broader research topic than the isolated concerns for the existence of an origin bias in assignment or a learning effect of ability grouping.

        "description":"The workings of schools have not received the attention due them in the study of educational administration. We need to generate new &quot;images&quot; or models of school organization that are more congruent with reality. These models need to be refined through expression and discussion and selected and changed through scientific methodology. Although this idea is nothing new, it has been given little attention. In the past, instead of generating theories by observing schools, we have borrowed inappropriate models from administrative science and organizational theory. Popular models of school organization like Weber's ideal bureaucracy are of questionable validity. We need to formulate new models by focusing on how schools are different from other organizations. They are human service  organizations that do not have to attract clients, must deal with children, and have members that are unusually autonomous, among other differences. Several recent theories of school organization are worthy of consideration. The &quot;garbage can&quot; theory or organized anarchy theory holds that because schools have unclear goals, changing membership, and indeterminate technology, unpredictable activity and anarchy are the characteristic state of affairs. The theory of flexible systems holds that schools are made up of many elements that couple and uncouple. (Author/JM)",

Such attitudes and problems of educators as perception of the parent role as an inactive one, neglect of training needed for effective interaction with parents, a negative view of the entire package designed to ensure educational opportunities for the handicapped, and a feeling of a lack of management and instructional skills necessary to serve handicapped children, are explored. Also described are attitudes and problems of parents, such as lack of skill or  desire to become involved, lack of time or financial resources, and lack of education or familiarity with the school environment. Suggestions are made to foster greater parent involvement, including providing parents with work areas and supplies in the school, opportunities for social interaction with school personnel, counseling, and parent groups.

Study topics focus on acquisition of new second-language vocabulary, students' organization of their notebooks, studying for tests, observation of classroom communication, and test-taking strategies. Nineteen native English-speaking students from the United States who were spending their junior year in Israel were studied. They were taking an intensive Hebrew program for two months, followed by a field experience, and then less intensive Hebrew studies. A language background questionnaire was administered to the students to obtain pre-instruction profiles. Study results suggest that if students used some associational patterns for learning  vocabulary, the words were retained successfully over time. No one note-taking or review method is appropriate for all students, but students did not differ much in basic note-taking and review patterns, as revealed by self-report. Students themselves can be a good source of information concerning study tips. Good and bad communicative strategies appeared across class levels and were used both by better and poorer students. It was demonstrated that it is difficult for an outside observer to establish the actual source of the error and to identify the learner strategy being employed without consulting the learners. Six suggestions about how to take tests were generated. The language background questionnaire is appended. (SW)",

Industry, which carries out 69% of the R&amp;D in the United States, spent $26.6 billion on these activities in 1976, 10% above the 1975 level. In constant dollars, this presents an increase of 5% between the two years. Other figures in this report show that the Federal R&amp;D funds to industry rose by 7% mainly because of increased amounts for energy R&amp;D, defense-related R&amp;D, and development of the space shuttle. Companies spent a total of $17.4 billion of their funds on R&amp;D in 1976, an increase of 12% over 1975. Energy R&amp;D expenditures by industrial firms rose 17% between 1975 and 1976 to $1.6 billion. Nearly 90% of this total  supported nuclear and fossil fuel R&amp;D programs. Funds for industrial performance of basic research rose 10% to a total of $786 million in 1976. Data for years 1975 through 1977 are presented in tables and graphs. (Author/HM)",

The panel comes from essentially all major types of industry involved in research and development (R&amp;D) and covers a wide range of firms and cooperations. The findings of the survey show that almost one-half of those who responded to the survey reported that, since 1970, their firms have increased the proportion of Ph.D.s among those hired for R&amp;D activities. The most often cited reasons for this change in hiring practices were: (1) industrial technology has become more complex, and (2) more science and engineering Ph.D.s have been available for work in industry. The findings also show that about 30% of the respondents expect their firms to increase the proportion of  R&amp;D employees who have doctorates while only 3% anticipated a drop. Tabulated data present distribution of responses from directors of industrial research and development on past and anticipated proportions of employees who have doctorates. (Author/HM)",

Examples of problems which have recently arisen from the increased interdependence of technology and society include depletion of the ozone layer of the atmosphere by aerosol sprays, prolongation of life by artificial means, and rapidly increasing population due partially to improved medical care. A growing sense of discomfort with technology is exemplified by many social indicators, including: (1) lack of interest, despite widespread public demand, in recycling or reprocessing waste material unless it can be profitably done; (2) corrosion of folk knowledge regarding social values in response to scientific and social scientific pronouncements; and (3) a general feeling of individual helplessness in  the face of phenomena such as overpopulation, hunger, resource depletion, nuclear warfare, and human cloning. The conclusion is that social policies should be developed which reflect a proper government role in areas such as economic centralization and resource allocation. These policies should aid individuals in making reasonable choices regarding housing, energy consumption, and family planning. (Author/DB)",

Five areas of academic competency serve as course objectives. These are that students should: (1) be acquainted with purposes, methods, and nature of evidence in humanities and social sciences; (2) have practice in critical thinking; (3) be able to use resources in humanities and social sciences; (4) be aware of the history, major findings, current state, and directions of inquiry in the two fields; and (5) be able to conduct independent inquiry and communicate effectively in oral, written, and visual  forms. Course activities involve students in a social science research project, a humanities research project, and a mastery project which involves methods of inquiry from both the social sciences and the humanities. In the social science project, students are directed to answer a question about classroom learning using behavioral observation, survey, statistical analysis, and cultural analysis. In the humanities project, students are directed to use introspection, comparison, and logical analysis in a study of human imagination and creativity. For each project, information is presented on instructional strategies, evaluation methods, and possible research topics. (Author/DB)",

Developmental education is interpreted as learning that helps an individual develop the abilities necessary for pursuing personal and social goals. Abilities, differing at each stage of human growth, include cognitive; affective; interpersonal; social; moral ethical; and psychomotor. Modules based on developmental education concepts include a variety of objectives, materials, and skills which can be rearranged to meet individual student needs. Modules should be collected in a library so that they can be integrated into other courses and used as independent study resources. For each module, information should be available on  objectives, entry level knowledge required, staff requirements, materials, and time necessary to complete the module.

        "author":["Kuhmerker, Lisa"],
        "description":"Methodology related to Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development has been continuously refined by creation and evaluation of additional research instruments. Instruments have been tested at summer scoring workshops presented by Kohlberg and his staff at the Center for Moral Education, Harvard University, in 1972, 1973, and 1976. Instruments include: (1) a standard-form scoring system to redefine the stages of moral development at a structural level and distinguish more clearly between issues and concerns; (2) a structural interviewing system which penetrates beyond a subject's opinions, attitudes, and beliefs to basic reasoning or justification patterns; and (3) a standard moral-interview format, which directs the subject to make the choice at the beginning of each dilemma.  Many problems related to interviewer misperception of values placed by the subject on a particular issue have been alleviated by asking the subject to weight the values. Other problems encountered by participants at scoring workshops relate to dominant-issue scoring. Participants should have fewer problems with scoring if they refer to Kohlberg's 1977 manual, average across elements within the governing norm, and consider unsolicited reasoning responses by the subject during the interview. The conclusion is that Kohlberg's moral development theory is constantly being improved as Kohlberg and other scholars work to make it more relevant to moral dilemmas. (Author/DB)",

Several dozen research and development projects, selected from among the more than 200 initiated during this period, are analyzed to indicate the wide range of scope and funding, nominal success or failure, distribution among art forms, research strategies, and objectives. The report is presented in six chapters. Chapter I offers a history of art education research and stresses the importance of the federal funding for art education research pursuant to the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Chapter II discusses AHP's role as administrator of ESEA funds to art education research. Chapter III compares the limited funding of basic research with  the more generous funding of proposals aimed toward strengthening the position of art in education. Chapter IV describes activities such as conferences and surveys which were developed to spur research. Chapter V focuses on research into art classroom occurrences and practices. Topics discussed include measurement and testing, teaching methods, art in the curriculum, music in the curriculum, educational laboratory theatre, and curriculum development. The final chapter stresses the need for increased federal funding in art education research. (Author/BC)",

The overall objective is to provide students with a comparative overview of two basic energy concepts: energy is a basic need in all cultures; and energy use affects the way people live. In the lessons, which can easily be integrated into studies of world cultures and physical geography of the world, students compare Accra, Ghana, with the Washington, D.C. area in terms of climate, geographic location, energy dependence, and services that meet their needs. The four lessons developed by teachers are: (1) A Geographical Picture of Two Cities; (2) Tracing the Sources of Electric Power in Ghana and in the Washington, D.C. area; (3) Two Transportation Systems: How Are They  Alike? How Are They Different; and (4) How Is Electricity Used In Two Different Cultures? The second lesson can also be taught in science courses. Students construct climagraphs, analyze and interpret fact sheet maps and bar graphs, answer questions about highway and road maps, and examine case studies. A time allotment varying from one to four classes for each of the four lessons is suggested, but will probably vary depending on student interest and ability. Each lesson contains complete teacher and student materials background information for the teacher on the topic under study. (Author/RM)",

The lessons were developed by teachers. The overall objective is to help students understand the present necessity to reexamine and perhaps alter our present energy patterns. Students study about the impact that the different types of energy used from colonial times to the present have had on U.S. culture and learn about the physical properties of wood, coal, and oil, particularly about the ability of these substances to give heat. The activities in which students are involved include answering questions based on short reading selections; gathering and interpreting materials from a picture;  comparing the uses of energy by a colonial farm family and by a family of today; constructing a can calorimeter; learning how to determine the energy content of wood; applying the principles of scientific motivation to energy data; constructing and interpreting graphs; making a model of a steam turbine; and learning how to determine the heat content of oil. The amount of time needed to teach each lesson varies from one to four classroom periods. Each lesson is self-contained, and includes instructions for the teacher and student materials. The eight lessons are organized into three units: (1) America's Wooden Age (1650-1820); (2) The Coming of Coal (1840-1920); and (3) Oil: Bright Promise (1880-present). (Author/RM)",

        "description":"A key question to ask in determining whether a solution will be found to the current worldwide destruction of plant and animal life is whether people will learn to reconcile effectively the demands of environmental conservationists and developers. Probably the most immediate threat which ecological destruction poses to human welfare is shrinkage of the plant genepools available to agricultural scientists, farmers, and foresters. Additional problems are the extinction of species with economic or medical value and the ecological disturbances which result from the loss of any species. Demands for rapid economic and social development in Third World nations present particular problems for long-term environmental conservation. Unless national and international economic systems provide  more opportunity for advancement, the dispossessed will naturally molest legally protected lands, trees, and animals. Environmental planners in all nations and foreign aid agencies in developed nations must incorporate concern for preservation of biological diversity into their policy decisions. A start toward the creation of needed ecological protectorates was made in 1978 when UNESCO designated 144 areas in 35 nations as part of a global network of Biosphere Reserves. The conclusion is that developers and conservationists must cooperate to develop policies to keep the biosphere in good order, slow the population growth, and satisfy people's basic needs.

The authors point out that Hinduism cannot be comprehended totally by reading books; thus the resources identified in this guide will enhance understanding based on reading. The guide is intended for use by high school and college students, teachers, anthropologists, musicologists, sociologists, and historians of religion, art, music, dance, literature, and drama. Most of the materials cited were published during the 1960s and 1970s. Section I presents films and videotapes, and section II identifies slides, filmstrips, and microfiche. Both sections group the materials according to three categories: those designed for the study of Hinduism, those useful as background material, and those  prepared by a sect for sectarian purposes. Included in these resources are films about ceremonies, lives of holy men, and pilgrimages. For each resource, information is given on length, color or black/white, film speed, sale and rental fees, publication date, publisher, and a lengthy annotation. Section III describes 16 recordings of Hindu music, songs, and chants. A concluding section identifies 29 organizational sources of information and materials. (Author/AV)",

An introduction explains that there are five forest types in the county, which is a scenic and recreation area. Ten major areas of environmental and human concern in the county include water pollution abatement, solid waste disposal, and rare and endangered habitats. Endangered and threatened wildlife are identified. Section one presents 13 social studies  activities based on two major concepts: (1) as population increases, its effects on the environment change, and (2) although resources are finite, there are almost infinite demands on those resources. Activities involve creation and observation of terrarium life and simulation of different community members' water needs. Section II presents six language arts activities based on the concept that as population increases, its effects on the environment become more pronounced. Activities include calculation of birth and death rates, and writing poetry about ecology. A concluding section outlines Florida school regulations concerning educational field trips. (AV)",

        "description":"The history of adult and community education in Michigan since 1862 can be divided into five major periods. In the first period, 1862-1930, adult and evening education was instituted by Henri A. Hobart in the Upper Peninsula and was extended by Frank Cody in Detroit. During the second period, the 1930s, Charles Stewart Mott and Frank J. Manly laid groundwork for community education and the Department of Public Instruction administered numerous adult education programs to counteract deleterious effects of the depression years. During the third period, the 1940s, the Department of Public Instruction embarked on an experimental adult education program. In 1948, passage of the State Aid Act allowed reimbursement to schools for pupils over 21 years of age. In the period of the 1950s  and 1960s, additional state legislation was enacted to provide adult basic education, high school completion programs, and G.E.D. equivalency. The final major period of educational development, 1970-77, reveals gradual progress of funding by the state for adult and community education programs in leisure and enrichment, basic skills review, business and industrial subjects, precollege entrance, preparation for retirement, senior citizen orientation, community development, and foreign languages.

        "description":"A report is given of a trip to the Peoples' Republic of China. In July 1978, 22 educators and social workers traveled to five cities in China to observe how mass-line democratic centralism produces grass-roots peer pressure for carrying out Communist party policy. &quot;Mass line&quot; is the overall policy direction on how to re-order Chinese society. &quot;Democratic centralism&quot; involves internalizing the mass line at the grass roots level and involving all citizens in political activity. In Peking, the group visited Peking University, the University library, and a May 7 cadre school. The university is presently enforcing a more strict admission policy than had been in effect under the Gang of Four's leadership. May 7 cadre schools are work and study retreats, mainly for bureaucrats, which  combine physical labor with study of Marxism. In Yenan, the group visited the museum which commemorates Mao's battles against the Japanese and the Chinese Nationalists. The group also observed how an urban, communal neighborhood center is organized, relates politically to the national government, and transmits the mass line. In addition, the group visited the Great Wall, Mao's mausoleum, the Chin tomb, containing 8,000 life-size statues, and the Shensi Provincial Museum, which was originally a Confucian temple. The author concludes that the controlled involvement of each Chinese citizen in production and government is for them an acceptable and secure alternative to previous suffering and starvation. (AV)",

Four objectives for these training centers are stated: (1) to assist the six regional training centers with the systematic identification of teacher perceived needs; (2) to conduct three training institutes during the school year for trainers of teachers and training center staff; (3) to maintain a resource linkage system and a training resource  bank and create a state access system; and (4) to review the effectiveness of the training centers through demonstrated expertise in offering inservice instruction and information services. Included in this document are the original proposal and outline for the model, and a summary report issued eight months later. (JD)",

Martens' hypothesis that an audience acts as a stimulus to elicit arousal or drive in the performance of an individual, which in turn enhances the emission of the dominant habit, is reexamined. Where incorrect responses are dominant, learning of a novel task will be inhibited, or at least improvement will not be as rapid as for individuals performing alone. Uncomplicated motor learning tasks were used, in a partial replication of Marten's procedures, to examine the effect of the following four conditions: audience present/videotape present; audience present/videotape absent; audience absent/videotape present; and audience absent/videotape absent. Results indicated that in the initial stages of motor learning subjects performing before an audience were more variable in their  performance than subjects performing without an audience. Subjects reported the presence of an audience provided greater arousal, and in some cases this arousal was shown to be positively correlated to their performance scores. Overall, the findings indicated that audience effects account for only a small portion of variance in motor behavior. (JD)",

Opinions about the relative importance of the twenty-five generic competencies used in the SUCO/CBTE program were collected from the faculty and students of the college and from the faculty in the surrounding schools. A factor analysis was made on the responses to identify categories of competencies which could be defined as generic teacher roles. This analysis resulted in four clusters or teacher roles as measured by  the twenty-five original competencies: (1) teacher as a strategist; (2) teacher as a person; (3) teacher as an assessor; and (4) teacher as a professional. An analysis of the results of the questionnaire indicated that preservice teacher education students tend to rate the importance of the role of the teacher as person higher than did the faculty from both the college and the participating schools. A second finding suggested that the students rate the importance of teacher as a professional higher than the school faculty but not higher than the college faculty. The findings from this study are discussed, and a copy of the questionnaire is appended. (JD)",

Previous studies indicated a positive correlation between such behavior and student achievement. It was hypothesized that businesslike teacher behavior would not result in a decrease in the level of teacher warmth, and could possibly produce an increase. The subjects of this study participated in a training program planned to develop four behaviors: (1) seriousness; (2) deliberateness; (3) goal orientedness; and (4) organization. Following this program, the participants were  observed to determine what effect such training had upon their personal characteristics of warmth and friendly interaction with students. The data demonstrated that it is possible to train preservice teachers to increase their observable level of businesslike teaching behavior, and that an increase in this behavior has no observable adverse effect on the level of teacher warmth.

Unit tests were administered frequently to determine student achievement of the 38 course objectives. Two retests per student were allowed, with retesting focusing only on those objectives not achieved. The 83-item final examination was categorized with respect to the 10 instructional units in the course. Results indicated a correlation of .406 between unit test performance (expressed as objectives achieved) and retention scores. Correlation coefficients between unit objectives achieved (both total number and number achieved on the initial attempt) and the retention test subscore for  that unit were also positive. In conclusion, empirical evidence supported the assignment of grade credit on the basis of attainment of objectives during instruction; however,the final examination should also contribute to the course grade. Such grading policy favors the Personalized System of Instruction. The correlation values are not so great as to encourage the Mastery Learning approach which suggests that grades can be assigned entirely by final exam performance. (CP)",

The measurement and aggregation problems in the determination of productivity changes in education are explained, and three productivity studies are described. Productivity declines are attributed to the lack of incentive for efficiency improvement in public schools, and the fact that education is intrinsically high in labor intensity but low in capital. A report on the literature on educational production functions describes micro-level functions as the learning of relatively simple items, meso-level functions as simple regressions involving student achievement  test scores and background variables, and macro-level functions as simulation models which project the number of enrollees, graduates, and dropouts as a function of budget levels, dropout rates, and repetition rates. Relevant articles listed for each level of production, and research directions based on level boundaries are described. In an evaluation of the efficiency and productivity of educational systems, production possibilities, economic efficiency, technical efficiency, and efficiency in the absence of output prices are defined. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses are described as a means for determining how gain and optimal levels of inputs and outputs vary with price. (Author/JAC)",

Independent variables were: (1) beginning-of-year CTBS mathematics pretest score; (2) teacher's verbal ability; (3) years of teacher experience; (4) teacher degree level; (5) student self-expectation; (6) number of CAI sessions that a student had in the year; and (7) intelligence test score. By regression analysis, end-of-year CTBS posttest scores were compared with these independent variables using linear, Cobb-Douglas (homogeneous and nonhomogeneous), and transcendental logarithmic model specifications of student achievement. CAI had a significant and  positive impact on achievement in most cases. Typically, 100 5-10 minute CAI sessions--given daily to weekly--can, during the course of a school year, raise a disadvantaged student's grade placement in mathematics by perhaps .3 years over what the achievement gain would have been otherwise. Furthermore, at the present cost of $25 to $75 per student for provision of 100 sessions per year, CAI is substantially less expensive than most alternatives for compensatory education. Advantages and limitations of the Cobb-Douglas and transcendental-logarithmic specifications are also discussed. (Author/CP)",

The literacy measure was obtained for a probable sample of the U.S. population in 1972, from the National Reading Survey.

Variables examined were: 1972 earnings, wage rate, work hours, years of schooling, reading score, potential work experience, other income, father's education, mother's education, age, race, sex, and employment status. Three models were used: simple earnings function, labor market, and educational achievement. Methodologically, both recursive and  simultaneous models were examined in both the labor market and the educational achievement analysis. In terms of increased annual earnings, estimated benefits of a hypothetical compulsory education for a representative individual are the highest for white males ($3,810) and the lowest for white females ($1,370). Corresponding benefits for black males and females are $2,580 and $1,940. Estimated benefits of a low target compensatory reading program for a representative individual are $323 and $273 for white males and black males, only $12 for white females, and negative for black females.

The relation of these attitudes to field of study was also examined. Data from a second national sample were analyzed by ethnic group--there were 2,036 whites, 87 orientals, an 128 blacks. Overall, blacks were clearly the most critical--96% believed the tests were oriented toward white middle-class culture. Surprisingly, attitudes toward tests were unrelated to graduate or undergraduate grades. Nearly all comments from both  studies were critical. Students disputed test content (how well the test represented their educational experience), validity (its relation to the real field of work) and coverage (its ability to measure success factors such as creativity, academic motivation, and interpersonal skills). Finally, students were concerned that the tests and the testing organizations have too much power. In conclusion, the role of admissions test as only one factor in predicting academic success should be emphasized; nevertheless, these criticisms should stimulate research into the meaning of professional competence.

        "description":"The National Symposium for Professors of Educational Research for 1976 focused on two topics: the nature of affect, and principles and guidelines for measuring individual affect and learning environment. This document contains five major papers presented at the conference. The first paper contrasted the physiological and emotional concept of affect as a feeling-state of unusual intensity, with the educational concept of affect as the link between cognition and behavior, emphasizing the perceptual aspects of affect and self concept, self esteem, and the learning climate in the schools. The second paper discussed affect from a biochemical perspective. The third paper emphasized the relation between individual affect and dimensions of educational environments, and described a number  of instruments for evaluating school or class climate and studies relating them to achievement test scores. The fourth paper described a self-concept theory of motivation and learning with emphasis on feelings of personal worth, ability to cope, ability to express, and ability to make choices. The last paper discussed evaluation as measurement, decision making, and judgment; described the affective domain as psysiological and psycho-social including values, emotions, and perceptions; and commended the acceptance of an affective epistemology.

        "description":"In September 1977 a reading and language arts test, based upon 40 objectives slated for student accomplishment by the end of grade four, was administered to all Delaware fourth graders. This test, the Objective-Referenced Measure in Communications, was intended to provide entry level diagnostic information to classroom teachers and to inform administrators about the status of schools and districts on curriculum objectives. To justify, describe, and explain the test, separate manuals for curriculum analysis and instructional planning were developed and provided. Leadership services and products were offered in support of program improvement to encourage use of test results. Services included technical field assistance, information retrieval, state facilitators, and mini-grant  programs. Products included a Textbook to Objective Correlation, Communications Activity Packs, and an Item Bank. The 160 items in the test were grouped into eight categories: study skills, literature, writing, listening, word recognition, reading-literal comprehension, reading-interpretive comprehension, and reading-critical comprehension. Percentage of students answering items correctly within each category ranged from 78% for reading-interpretive comprehensive, to 64% for reading-critical comprehesion. Results were analyzed by classroom, objective, category, total test, and item response by objective. The Delaware Educational Accountability System provided a framework for this testing program.

The My Class Inventory was administered to ninety classrooms of fifth grade students in a large suburban school district. The 45 items on the inventory are distributed over five factors: satisfaction, friction, competitiveness, difficulty, and cohesiveness. The test was administered in three ways: (1) by the teacher; (2) by outside test administrators; and (3) by children, using pre-recorded tape cassettes. Significant differences were found for factors of satisfaction, friction, and cohesiveness, but there were no significant differences among methods on competitiveness and difficulty. There were factor  differences and overall differences between teacher administered and the other techniques. There were no significant differences between outside administrator and the student cassette tape method. Student tape cassettes were the preferred technique because they minimized teacher bias, were inexpensive, and standardized directions and procedures. Results also indicated that the pre-recorded taped directions administered by students more closely approximated the results obtained by an outside evaluator than did the results obtained by teacher administration of the same instrument.

There were 44 school districts with 4,579 students in the database, and information on 273 variables including many different tests and scales. However, only 204 pupils in grades 3 and 4 with at least 3 years of bilingual education could be used in the experimental group, and 109 pupils in the control group were just starting in the bilingual program. Achievement test scores indicated that students with more years in the program were stronger in both the productive English skills  (speaking and writing) and the receptive skills (listening and reading). It appeared that bilingual schooling enhanced conceptual development. However, bilingual schooling did not appear to enhance native language skill in all areas; and it appeared that attitudes toward self, school, and community were negatively influenced by years of bilingual schooling. Language use in the home affected native language proficiency. The author regrets that lack of rigor in experimental design makes interpretation of the findings subject to debate. Questionnaires in English and Spanish, as well as resulting statistical data are appended. (CTM)",

        "description":"The 1978 edition of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests was analyzed for sex stereotyping and for the use of male, female, or neuter references and a comparison was made with the 1970 edition. There was less bias in the new edition, and there was relatively little sex stereotyping with respect to occupations, activities, and roles for females. There was, however some sex stereotyping with respect to the display of emotions. The index of sex bias used was the ratio of male nouns and pronouns to female, with a correction for repeated references to the same person. A similar index computed the ratio of neutral personal nouns and pronouns to gender-specific words. Illustrations were coded similarly for gender ratios and also analyzed for the comparative stature of males and females.  The possible effects of sex bias and sex stereotyping in test content on test performance are yet to be determined; test developers have assumed that an even balance of male and female references would minimize test bias. The 1978 edition of the MAT is more balanced than the 1970 edition, and generally presents a less stereotyped portrayal of both sexes. (CTM)",

Both forms of the SASW-4 presented seven personal and social situations, but differed in the sex of the individuals described in the items. Responses were made on five-point semantic differential scales and test items are appended. Spence and Helmreich's Attitudes Toward Women Scale (AWS), a 55-item inventory concerning women's social, educational, and vocational roles, was also administered. Concurrent validity was established from the correlation of SASW-4 and AWS scores. Two way analyses of variance (form by sex) were performed on SASW-4 total score  and individual item responses. Forty-one of the 49 items on the SASW-4 yielded significant differences between forms, and 28 yielded significant interaction effects. Men scored significantly higher on the form in which individuals behaved in traditional ways, while women scored more positively in situations in which individuals exhibited non-traditional behaviors. When subjects were combined, the response to the traditional behavior forms of the SASW-4 was significantly more positive than to the non-traditional form. Potential uses for the instrument are briefly discussed. (Author/JAC)",

The study was implemented to determine whether the approaches would provide identical classifications of items as to degree of aberrance for culturally different populations and classifications of minimal bias for subsamples of a single population. Actual item response data were obtained from 2,637 hearing impaired and 1,607 normal students, and two pseudo-culture group samples of subjects from the same population with different mean total scores. The Stanford Achievement Test, a 48-item test of reading comprehension, was administered to the students. In the diverse culture group comparison,  subjects responded to a pool of items which measured reading comprehension, and several items were found to be biased. Degrees of aberrance in the equal-culture group were consistently low for the icc theory and chi-square approaches. These approaches were felt to be the most promising, and the icc theory approach was sensitive to individual and group bias. The factor score and chi-square approaches were inadequate for identifying bias. Several common items were identified for the diverse culture comparison by the transformed item difficulties, icc theory, and chi-square approaches. Recommendations are made for future studies incorporating known parameters and distractor response analysis. (Author/JAC)",

Data were collected during the eighth month of pregnancy and five times within the infant's first year, from 193 mother-infant pairs. The following assessment methods were used: mother questionnaire, father questionnaire, mother interview, observation of environment, observation of parent-child interaction, developmental testing, and pediatric  examination. Four mediating predictor variables formed a conceptual framework for the study: infant characteristics, infant's environment, parental perceptions, and mother's life change. An Optimal Parent-Infant Profile was presented as a compilation of information identified as being important during pregnancy and the first year of life. The Profile included variables related to the mother and family, psychosocial support, life change, parents' developmental expectations, mother's health, mother's perception of the infant, infant's health and sleeping behavior, mother-infant interaction, and home environment. Results clearly indicate the parents' major role in shaping the child's behavior.

In a multiracial school environment, children can be taught to respect the attitudes, values, and life styles of others. However, the schools must not only be desegregated in name only, but there must also be mutual interaction between students of different racial backgrounds. In addition, provided that teachers do not consider minority group children intellectually retarded, these children will profit academically from attending a multiracial school, while white students will not suffer. Teacher attitudes and behavior are also important in dealing with discipline problems in a desegregated school. Educational leaders must be  committed both politically and ideologically and use their skills to obtain a nationwide egalitarian multiracial school system. They must recognize that their roles are political as well as educational when it comes to such issues as busing students.

The interaction of stratification and schooling in the United States is explained. The methodology of ethnographic studies is described. The character of the city and the setting are considered in terms of their effect on the general outcome of school desegregation in Memphis. Each of the school system's three subsystems (administrative, academic, student) are discussed as they affect the process of interracial schooling at &quot;Crossover High School.&quot; In the discussion of the administrative subsystem, the differing experiences of  the school under two different principals are examined. The examination of the academic subsystem reviews the climate of learning in the classroom both before and after desegregation. The section on the student subsystem focuses on extracurricular activities. The outcomes of desegregation that were witnessed at &quot;Crossover&quot; (including white flight) are focused on and utilized to formulate recommendations for making desegregation successful.

        "description":"The purpose of Project WIEDS in 1977-78 was to initiate a pilot research effort designed to identify and describe successful desegration strategies and remaining areas of need in selected desegregated schools. Two sources of data were used for the purpose of the study; desegregation literature and selected school district personnel within a close proximity of Austin, Texas. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted by the WIEDS project team, and on site interviews were conducted with central office personnel, principals, and teachers in two selected school districts. Both of these data collection methods categorized findings in terms of three types of strategies; (1) administrative/governance; (2) staff development; and (3) teaching/learning. The literature indicated  that school desegregation does not occur in a vacuum, i.e., that local and national conflicts and consensus help to determine the particular direction judicial and governing bodies will take when they decide that school systems will be desegregated. The review also indicated information regarding the pressures to desegregate schools and the effects of these efforts. The results of the field study indicated that the desegregation process for a school district usually begins in a legal context via some judicial or governmental action. These findings hold implications for future research and strategies in the area of school integration. (Author/AM)",

        "author":["Warren, Constancia"],
        "description":"The current boom in magnet schools (or multiple option systems) draws strength from three converging trends in education in the last decade: (1) the search for appropriate educational options to meet the diverse learning needs of children; (2) the desire for greater parental participation in the educational process; and (3) the search for voluntary desegregation measures. The use of magnet schools or projects in the process of school desegregation still poses problems that are difficult to resolve. For example, one or two, or even several magnet schools, no matter how racially balanced their individual student populations, are not sufficient to bring about district wide desegregation. Magnet schools may also raise problems concerning the question of equity in educational services  within a school district as a whole. It is also possible that magnet schools will not bring about equal educational opportunity and social mobility. For example, there is always the danger that less educated parents will not be adequately informed to make the best choices for their children, despite the availability of several options. However, positive aspects of the growing number of magnet schools and multiple option systems should be emphasized: (1) they respond to the need for alternatives to the standard curriculum in the public school; (2) they provide a wide variety of learning experiences to children; and (3) the multiple option systems legitimize diversity.

Social isolation is defined as that which affects groups or individuals in such a manner as to limit or deny their access to, and to bar their freedom to choose among the options which society offers to a majority of citizens. Two models (analytical and functional) for the reduction of isolation in metropolitan areas are proposed. A guide for the reduction of isolation in metropolitan areas is described. This guide is designed to help concerned individuals to examine the problems and to search for solutions, and has 5 elements: (1) identification of the extent of isolation; (2) involving leaders and individuals; (3) developing strategies; (4) implementing the action; and (5)  evaluation. Essays concerning litigation, proposed solutions, and research on desegregation discuss themes such as: (1) metropolitan school desegregation litigation; (2) pursuing metropolitan desegregation in the courts; (3) isolation in metropolitan education and the impact of the courts; (4) the urban fiscal crisis (5) nonpublic schools and public school education; (6) the higher education system and public school isolation; (7) metropolitan research designs; and (8) factors affecting reduction of isolation in public education.

A military sample of 2,675 and a civilian sample of 1,974 were surveyed by means of a job inventory checklist and relative time spent rating method. Of the three job types that were identified (grounds maintenance, equipment operators, and pavements workers), military grounds workers expressed the lowest job interest and job utilization of training and skills. No significant difference was found between civilian and military members in number of tasks performed for the total sample; however, average task difficulty and job difficulty appeared higher for the military. A major difference was discovered in length of time  on the job with military members reporting considerably less time because of their transitory status. Generally, civilian workers indicated higher job interest and job utilization than did military personnel. To determine if the improved utilization of equipment was an effective means of increasing job interest for military members, a comparison was made between military data collected in 1969 and the current data, and an increase in job interest was indicated as a result of greater equipment use.

Data for 1968-73 was gathered in interviews and from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience. The information obtained was related to the subject's education, employment, training, and family experience. Relationships were examined among race, school leaving, motherhood, and employment status. School leaving and the imminence of marriage or a child were found to be associated with a major shift toward family role; the child's arrival resulted in a shift towards positive work attitudes. Almost two out of three black dropouts and one out of three white dropouts plan to  return to school; however, most do not return. Dropouts experienced higher unemployment rates, more part-time work, and less pay than graduates. When dropouts were compared to graduates after five years, findings revealed that most graduates were working, and most dropouts were not. By 1973 there were still substantial wage differences between graduates and dropouts. It was concluded that child-related considerations relate to dropping out and subsequently affect the ability of a woman to take formal training programs and to find meaningful employment at a reasonable salary.

The canning industry was found to be a suitable area for this type of training since it had annual lay-offs followed by assured recalls to work and was feeling affirmative action pressures. The project's final efforts (after two years of discouraging experiences) in the canning industry were quite successful and included the following benefits: (1) extensive changes in the knowledge and attitudes of working women toward advancement and employment; (2) the job status of women improved; (3) both the companies and the union learned about the operation of their labor market;  (4) the affirmative action process was accelerated; (5) the industry developed internal training programs; and (6) the public schools developed adult basic education for the cannery workers.

        "description":"A study, growing out of human capital theory, examined the economic consequences of dropping out of high school. Effect of schooling over time on labor market success (hourly pay rate, occupational prestige, and employment incidence and duration) was measured. Data on young men and women was obtained from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience and personal interviews. The study universe consisted of respondents who left school between 1958-70 (males) and 1960-72 (females), completed nine-to-twelve years of schooling, and were not enrolled at the time of the survey. A three-equation recursive model was used to determine schooling contribution to success measures. Findings demonstrated substantial labor market benefits for all groups during the first decade of  labor market experience. Earnings differences between graduates and dropouts were not pronounced immediately upon leaving school, but became significant over time. Graduates' age-earnings profiles were steeper than those of dropouts. The difference in occupational status between black graduates and dropouts shrank over time. All graduates, except black females, enjoyed greater immunity to unemployment than dropouts. In employment duration the advantage of black males and black and white females deteriorated over time; little difference was demonstrated between white male graduates and dropouts. (CSS)",

        "description":"A comprehensive investigation of the military recruitment process during the Vietnam era focused on multiple facets of the equity issue to assess the impact of military manpower policies. Using data from a sample of young men in the National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS) three questions were addressed: who served, who was drafted, and who chose to enlist. The effects of ten determinants of military service (health conditions, mental ability, dependents, education, draft pressure, socioeconomic status, residence, earnings, unemployment, and knowledge of the world of work) on the probability of serving, enlisting, and being drafted were studied. Formulated hypotheses were tested by multiple classification analysis and logit. Separate analyses by race were also conducted. Results of  the study included these: fathers served at rates significantly below average; racial inequalities in implementation of the health deferment existed; the military did not draw disproportionately from any one social class when fulfilling its manpower demands; draft pressure was the strongest predictor (the manpower needs of an intensifying war may have been the single most important factor in negating some of the earlier inequitable draft policies); and potential wage was not significantly related to black enlistment, though it was a strong predictor among whites.

        "description":"A longitudinal study was conducted to evaluate the U.S. Employment Service's Specific Aptitude Test Battery (SATB) for plumber/pipe fitter from three aspects: technical adequacy of the research; fairness to minorities; and usefulness in the selection of individuals for training as plumber/pipe fitter apprentices. The validation sample consisted of 253 apprentices (including sixty-nine minority group members) in their first year of apprenticeship during 1974-1976 in eight states and the District of Columbia. The tests for this sample were taken from the General Aptitude Test Battery, while on-the-job competency was gauged by supervisors' ratings, and ability to perform five categories of related course work was measured by instructors' ratings. A cross-validation sample was also  used, based on data collected in 1953-1954 from 322 apprentices in Texas (the minority group composition of which was unknown). Criterion for this group consisted of category ratings for a combination of job performance and school achievement. SATB was found (1) to be useful in the selection of apprentices; (2) to be fair to minorities; and (3) to meet all criteria for validity using the more recent sample and for cross-validity based on the prior test sample. (The appendixes include the following: statistics for black and nonminority subgroups of the validation sample; descriptive rating scales for employers and instructors; and a job description and the first-year apprenticeship curriculum for plumbers/pipe fitters.)

She then presents criticism of the natural science model as a basis for social and behavioral science research. She notes that the human being and his behavior are so complex that unidimensional research models are inadequate. However, she finds balance in the contribution of scientific rigor to careful investigation of human phenomena. The author next discusses the inclusion of new procedural options and vistas in research. Two areas of particular interest to her are the involvement of subjects as co-designers and co-experimenters in investigations and the inclusion of religious beliefs as a subject of research. She notes the difficulties of work in this area, including  the lack of theory and reliable methods. She concludes with a description of a peer counseling program for school truants which she is in the process of developing. The emphasis is on changing the school environment, and the experiment will involve the peer counselors as co-designers and participant observers. (DOW)",

This paper examines the results cross-sectionally and reveals between-group, or cohort effects. The youngest and oldest cohorts displayed low anxiety. Within-group longitudinal changes did not closely match this cross-sectional difference. Current data was compared to previously published longitudinal studies. Longitudinal anxiety patterns varied across cohorts and samples while defensiveness showed longitudinal decreases across all studies. The consistency in defensiveness results and the lack of consistency in test anxiety results across the three studies suggest that anxiety is more a function of situational factors and  that defensiveness is more a function of organismic factors.

        "description":"This study examined the effects of student supervision upon the social environment of York College male dormitory residents. All 132 male students living in a student run dormitory, and all 170 residents of a non-student adult supervised hall received the University Residence Environment Scale. Statistical analysis revealed that the respondents from the student operated dormitory scored significantly higher than the adult supervised residents on the following subscales: Emotional Support; Intellectuality; Order and Organization; and Student Influence. The student supervised group received significantly lower scores on two subscales: Traditional Social Orientation; and Competition. The findings indicated that a student operated dormitory can produce a comparable, and in many ways  more effective social environment as compared to an adult supervised hall. It was recommended that York College continue to employ students as resident hall directors. The Office of Residence Life was urged to consider strengthening dormitory programming by providing additional scholarly, cultural and artistic presentations, providing reinforcement for achievement, and increasing coeducational interaction. Finally, it was also recommended that an extensive study of all on and off campus student living conditions be conducted to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the entire residence life system.

The process dimensions are boundary behaviors, subgrouping, normative behaviors, organizing, establishing personal significance, group and leader interchanges, self disclosures, conflict, support, and emotional atmosphere. Content categories include physiological, security, belongingness/love, esteem, and self actualization concerns and satisfactions. Analysis of variance and correlational techniques are used to assess frequencies of occurrence of these dimensions and categories and the relationships among them. It is shown that one may analyze process and content elements of group behavior among these aged. It is argued that viewing groups of elderly  participants in these terms will yield advantages for application of group helping techniques. The contention is that group helping techniques should be geared to the naturally occurring group processes at the appropriate developmental stages for their intended beneficiaries. (Author)",

        "description":"In an age when decision making is becoming more and more significant for us human beings as we face dilemmas about whether or not to clone, to engineer behavior on mass scale, to expand or to decrease nuclear power, we educators must assist students to increase their decision-making skills. Many of our students will soon be decision makers for humankind. While we often teach decision-making skills didactically, we do not spend enough time getting students to examine how they are making decisions personally. This paper describes a model for evaluating decision passages. The model has three phases: (1) introduction to and understanding of the concept of decision passages; (2) developing a log of one's decision passages; and (3) evaluating decision-making patterns evident in  decision passages. Each phase of the model is presented with examples and illustrations. The model is appropriate for use in several settings: teaching and/or counseling in group setting or in a one-on-one situation. It is an assessment model built on the premise that assessment is a first step to changing behavior. (Author)",

        "description":"This manual is based upon a study of 247 old people and their families and five long-term care facilities in New York City. The data indicate that what families do for their aged kin in institutions makes a difference to the older person, and that the ability of families to maintain contact with their institutionalized relative depends, in part, on the extent to which the institution encourages the presence and activities of families. The first part of this manual discusses how staff can work with aged residents, their families, and the family-less aged in long-term care facilities. There is a bibliography for this section and appendices with suggestions for application forms, interdepartmental memoranda, and a handbook for applicants and their families. The second part of the  manual provides a theoretical formulation which can be used as the basis for the design and evaluation of long-term care facility policies and programs. This section includes an analysis of: (1) differences in structure and function between the long-term care facility and the family; (2) attributes of the institution and the family which create tension between them; (3) linkage mechanisms which institutions and families use which enable them to work together.

The guide attempts to set forth in legislative language certain basic principles regarding the operation of family and juvenile  courts and the administration by executive agencies of state and local programs. Special emphases are placed on ways in which children can be diverted from the juvenile justice system consistent with the protection of both the juvenile and the public, and on providing services and facilities in the communities in which the children live. State and local agencies, legislative committees, and state and community planning agencies must determine how best to use these suggested statutory provisions to meet their own requirements, state constitution and legislation already enacted.

Findings from two studies indicate that in some ways teenagers as a group differ from older individuals. The paper details some of the ways in which sexual experiences are influenced by social and emotional maturity and outlines some of the problems which result from the need to coordinate development on the levels of biology, individual differences, and social interactions. Many of these problems are more pressing during adolescence than they ever appear in later life. The author points out that human fertility decisions always demand a blend of emotion and logic. The ability to make life decisions which combine both feelings and facts develops during the adolescent years, and this characteristic  must be central to all thinking about psychosocial development.

Drug education experts throughout the country also responded to the same questions. The survey showed that the opinions of educators differ markedly from the opinions of drug education experts and that there is more agreement in opinion among experts than among educators. The survey also showed that educator attitudes can be a source of resistance to effective drug education as it is defined by experts because: (1) educators are more likely than experts to see drug use as immoral and as a result of parental  permissiveness; (2) educators are more likely to believe that schools cannot help drug users; and (3) educators take a more punitive approach to drug users than do experts. Incorporating this information on educator and expert attitudes toward drug education, the survey authors present an evaluation checklist for a drug education program. (Author/RF)",

The message was a prose passage about modes of transportation. Second grade students (N=51) were subjects. A third of the children presented oral reports on the contents of the message (speaker condition); a third listened to the reports (listener condition); and a third functioned as controls. Retention was assessed one and three days later. As predicted, speakers' free recall of topical information and cued recall of factual information exceeded that of listeners and controls. The production of related new topics during free recall tended to increase over the retention  interval. The results support the notion that covert editing activities, stimulated by the active, overt reconstruction of stored information, lead to the formation of a highly efficient retrieval system.

The EGG has the potential of offering preventive counseling to large numbers of people. In each group, previously held values and beliefs are challenged, new information is presented, and participants plan ways of using their fresh awareness and knowledge. EGG's fill the gap between what is learned in the classroom and on the streets. For counselors, EGG's help them expand their impact in a university/school by working with students who probably would not come for personal counseling.

Analysis of data from large and small police departments across the United States shows that fewer than 3% of the crimes reported as rape result in a conviction; many cases are not filed or are plea bargained to a lesser offense because of insufficient evidence. This manual focuses on a step-by-step development of evidence through interviews with the victim, physical and medical evidence of force, crime scene evidence, interviews with witnesses, and use of third party reports such as local rape crisis lines or victim service organizations. Establishing a suspect,  confirming the identification of arrestees, and collecting corroborating evidence are discussed. Special attention is given to particular problems of rape investigation, such as the need for establishing lack of consent when the victim knows the assailant. In addition, crime scene evidence and medical evidence of particular value in proving force are recommended. (Author)",

        "description":"Children learning to read are often exposed to &quot;stories&quot; which are really little more than lists of sentences. A good story has at least continuity and conflict which may be analyzed in two ways: story grammar (analysis of setting and plot) and plans and beliefs (analysis of the plans and beliefs of the characters, including the reader's understanding of the events of the story). Using the story &quot;The Fox and the Rooster&quot; to illustrate these two methods of text analysis, we find that story grammar provides a summary of events but ignores the internal structure of the plans and the beliefs of the characters concerning actions which occur. A plans and beliefs analysis includes an analysis of the reader because individuals have different beliefs and expectations (for example, about  foxes, roosters, dogs, and stories). Sometimes the writer's understanding and the reader's understanding are different, and &quot;misunderstanding&quot; of the story results. This appears as a reader comprehension problem but may be a problem of point of view about social roles and behavior as discovered through a plans and beliefs analysis. (TJ)",

Following the training, both their free recall performance and their ability to estimate their readiness for a recall test improved significantly. In the present research, the students were tested for maintenance and generalization one year following the original training. The younger children (MA = six years) showed no effects of the training, whereas an older group (MA = eight years) both maintained the trained strategies on the original rote recall task and generalized it effectively to a novel situation involving gist recall of prose passages. In comparison to a pair of control groups, the students trained  in the use of self-checking routines took more time studying, recalled more idea units from the passages, and further, their recall was more clearly related to the thematic importance of the constituent idea units, a pattern characteristic of developmentally more advanced subjects.

To determine whether or not students have matured in their use of written syntax, several methods may be used: clause length, subordination indices, type of subordination and unit length, and indices of sentence-combining transformations. Methods such as incidence of usage errors and length of sentences are not as valuable. The most useful index is length of  T-Unit (Minimal Terminal Unit) since it is easy to count, simple to use, objective, and demonstrates a clear progression toward maturity in syntactical control.

A word sort is an activity in which the learner arranges words printed on cards into groups. This technique can be manipulated in many ways to help children draw conclusions about how words are related. The basic activity consists of sorting a deck of word cards and grouping them on the basis of similarities. There are two types of word sorts: open-ended and closed-ended. In the latter the common property of the words to be grouped is stated in advance. These sorts help children develop comparison and convergent reasoning. The common property of  the words is not stated in an open-ended sort; the learner discerns relationships among the words while sorting them. In this way, the learner forms tentative rules for including words in that group, and redefines the dimensions of the group by adding and removing words. Few other techniques for word study are so flexible, retain students' interest so long, or engage them in such high-level thinking as word sorts. (FL)",

Twenty second-graders who were reading at, or not more than one year above, grade level were pretested to determine the extent of their prior knowledge about the topic they would be reading. Based on their pretest scores, the students were divided into two groups: one group had weak prior knowledge and the other had extensive prior knowledge of the topic. It was hypothesized that the group with more extensive prior knowledge would achieve better comprehension results. The study also investigated the possible influence of explicit and implicit questions on comprehension; half of the posttest questions were explicit and the others implicit. It was hypothesized that the implicit  questions would be more difficult for both groups of students. Both hypotheses were substantiated. In addition, it was found that the ability to answer explicit questions did not differ significantly between the two groups of students, but those with greater prior knowledge were better at answering the implicit questions.

        "description":"How well items of information which comprise a text are learned may depend upon the semantic and syntactic relationships (ideational bonds) which exist among those items. To determine if the ability of learners to recall text information is influenced by the location of the information within the text and by syntactic contrasts among informational items, 22 college students were given a passage to study and then were administered a completion-type recall test. The results showed that items of information located in a context of topically related information are more readily recalled than those located in a topically unrelated context. However, items which were contrasted with one another through syntactic cues were recalled no better than those which occurred alone and  unconnected. These findings suggest that if logical relations are built into the semantic structure of texts, learning from the texts will be improved. (FL)",

Each child was asked to define reading, and their responses were placed into four categories: those which were vague or irrelevant, those which focused on classroom procedure or the educational value of reading, those which focused on decoding or word recognition, and those which focused on meaning or understanding. Responses which fell into the first category were ignored and only the responses which fell into one of the remaining categories were analyzed. Of this group, the majority of students gave responses which fell into the second or third categories, implying that to them reading was a classroom procedure or a decoding process. Very few  responses fell into the fourth category, indicating that most students were not able to associate meaning with reading. The results suggest that teachers should not assume that instruction in reading is necessarily instruction in comprehension. Direct comprehension instruction is needed to make reading sensible for children, and teachers must provide it. (FL)",

The externalist sees creativity as outside the normal language, and the internalist views creativity as a basic process of language use. In this paper, creativity is regarded as the adaptation of the potential of systems to the demands of a particular act of communication. Any modification must be motivated; it is also restricted by the tolerance level of language users. Creativity is not a matter of texts or a special focus on the message, but is a shared activity of speaker and hearer. The modification that the speaker performs on systems or on system correlation, as well as his motivation, must be recovered by the hearer. The basic mechanisms of creativity are means of recombination; new  elements added to the repertory must appear in motivating combinations within or among systems. This definition of creativity is more general and flexible than are the older theories. Creativity is the process whereby we become aware of the present and the possible conditions for the organization of cognition, and whereby we enable others to reenact that awareness. In whatever modifications are performed on prevailing systems, language users gain new insights into both the standards of those systems and their potential for change. (DF)",

Sources of income regularly included backers who were community promoters of politicians and who frequently withdrew their support with little notice. Other sources of income were equally unreliable and included advertising (very cheap and infrequent), subscriptions (often not paid for), public printing (not very profitable), and job printing (rare). Getting supplies was difficult, and the mails could not be counted on for delivery of news from the East or for delivery of papers to subscribers. Equipment was seldom adequate and was often second or third hand. Journeyman  printers and compositors of the time were difficult to find and moved often. Nevertheless, the newspaper business flourished and by 1850 the combined circulation of Wisconsin Territory newspapers was more than two million. (TJ)",

        "description":"The validity of current standardized competency tests for writing is in doubt as is the need for such testing at all. Some tests, especially those requiring little writing, may not be testing what they purport to test (content validity). Instructional validity (testing what has actually been taught) raises the issue that what is being tested is precisely the teaching which brought on the demand for testing in the first place. Many states are using tests (such as those produced by the National Assessment of Educational Progress and by the Educational Testing Service) which provide inadequate time for the student to write, provide inadequate motivation for students to write their best, or require students to write on subjects about which they may have little information. Other  tests are so simple as not to ensure even marginal literacy or they focus on mechanical skills exclusively. The data which brought about the demand for testing are open to question. Cultural bias on tests, inadequate understanding of test results, and irresponsible use of test data create confusion about literacy levels and make the term &quot;functional illiterate&quot; meaningless. The demand for competency testing comes when a major breakthrough in teaching reading may preview a similar development in teaching writing. The school system in England and the Bay Area Writing Project may provide useable models for teaching and testing writing skills.

        "description":"Future research on mass media and mass communication organizations might profitably emphasize phenomenological methods (phenomenology being an interpersonal, subjective reality construction as contrasted to an objective, rationalistic, institutional reality construction). Some major phenomenological concepts important to such research were developed by Edmund Husserl and Alfred Schutz: (1) life-world, (2) typification, (3) intersubjectivity, (4) reflective nature of meaning, (5) the role of social science, (6) reduction, and (7) relevance. A few studies of mass media and mass communication organizations have been conducted using phenomenological categories or approaches, some self-consciously, others nevertheless effectively. Edward Jay Epstein, David L. Altheide, and Gaye  Tuchman are among those few researchers to use phenomenological categories to do their work. Future research might extend such inquiry by intensifying the process of reduction (considering the internal logic of phenomena without regard to external context), or by applying the concept of typification (making sense of the life-world by imposing structure on it) more inclusively and systematically. Another promising area of phenomenological research is the communicator's perception of the audience. (TJ)",

        "description":"To determine if children watch adult programs on weekday prime-time television because more suitable age-specific programming is unavailable, a study was conducted to assess children's viewing preferences using a forced-choice instrument. After a pilot study established the validity of the instrument, four popular children's programs were systematically pitted against early prime-time network programs in a questionnaire administered to 308 third and fifth grade students. The overwhelming majority of respondents indicated a preference for their favorite adult programs even when children's programs were available. When a preferred adult program was unavailable to the child, however, the relative appeal of children's programming increased markedly. The results suggest that even  popular children's programs would have trouble competing for the child audience against adult programs in prime time. Further, since much weekday afternoon programming is off-network adult television, children's programming would face similar difficulties attracting an audience if scheduled during that time. (FL)",

Teacher preparation, on the other hand, has consisted mainly in producing English majors who emphasized historical periods, famous authors, and literary criticism. In 1968, the National Council of Teachers of English produced a statement of guidelines for teacher preparation in literature which emphasized knowledge and skills. In 1976, a new statement was prepared which emphasized the teacher as helper, guide, and facilitator. The new statement emphasizes English as something people do and use rather than something people know and study. The statement has much more emphasis than earlier ones on teacher  qualities important to effective interaction. Since personal qualities are as important as scholarly ones, current teacher education strategies are not very effective. Part of the difficulty is that it is necessary to do more than identify teachers who have the preferred qualities; they must be produced. Unfortunately, it may not be possible to create a teacher model which depends on personal characteristics rather than on academic skills and such a model may be outdated by future changes of educational philosophy.

Two goals were identified: rational (cost, functional benefits of product, or possible undesirable consequences from use of the product) and social (conformity to perceived expectations of others). Users who have specific goals seek evaluative information of one sort or another. For instance, those who have social goals tend to depend on others' opinions for information and are apt to rely on the mass media. Consumers with economic goals are apt to prefer print advertisements, and those who perceive performance risk are likely to view salespeople  as important information sources.

The strengths of the business school grow from its systems approach while the strengths of the journalism school grow from its emphasis on language, thinking, and creativity. Among the reasons given for selecting their major, advertising students often list a desire to be creative, an interest in writing, and a desire to be involved with their work. All of these reasons fit into the journalism environment. Further, many of the objectives of advertising are the same as those of journalism. Advertising, then,  should be a part of the journalism school curriculum. However, in light of the long struggle for legitimacy by advertising education, both sides of the controversy should be working together toward the same goals. Advertising should be taught within the broader framework of business and journalism programs, not as an isolated institution, but as an integral part of living in the modern world. (FL)",

        "description":"Senators of the Eighty-third Congress were studied to ascertain what factors were most highly correlated with press coverage for each individual senator. This information was then correlated with an earlier study of the Eighty-ninth, Ninety-first, and Ninety-third Congresses to see what differences might exist which could indicate the development of a \"new breed\" of publicity-minded senators commanding a power base through national constituencies created by media coverage. Few differences were found between the earlier study of the more recent Congresses and the study of the Eighty-third Congress. While senators with a high institutional opportunity (a combination of seniority, prestigious committee leadership assignments, and state size) have an advantage over less powerful  colleagues which shows up more in the Eighty-third Congress than in the later ones, nevertheless, senate activity (measured by number of Congressional Record entries and bills and resolutions sponsored) is a more powerful predictor of press coverage than institutional opportunity in all four Congresses. Senators with power bases created in part by media coverage are not a recent phenomenon and are at least as evident in the Eighty-third Congress as in the Ninety-third Congress. (TJ)",

According to the debate rules, each candidate was allowed three minutes to answer a question and two minutes for follow up on an opponent's question; an overall evaluation revealed that Ford was asked 13 follow up questions, while Carter was asked 10, and that Ford spoke on camera eight and a half minutes longer than Carter. This time discrepancy was explained by the different rates of speaking of the men. The camera shots for each candidate were analyzed as follows: the most obvious single shot was the talking  head/shoulders image with little variation between men; in reaction shots, Carter projected a positive image while Ford projected a negative one; in shots where one man answered while the audience observed the other, Carter was shown reacting to Ford more frequently; and in camera shots where neither man was talking, there was no advantage given to either candidate. The camera shots for all three debates were judged as fair to both candidates, whether by accident or design. (Data tables are appended.) (MAI)",

        "description":"To achieve competency as consumers in the marketplace, young people need to acquire specific consumer skills. To determine the influence of such socialization agents as television, family, peers, and school on the acquisition of these skills, 607 middle and high school students in Kentucky and North Carolina completed self-administered questionnaires which focused on four variables relevant to the consumer role: brand knowledge, price accuracy, consumer affairs knowledge, and socially desirable consumer role perceptions. The results indicated that consumer skills varied according to the age, sex, and social class of the respondents. Older adolescents were found to possess these skills to a greater extent than younger adolescents. Males could more accurately price products and  services, had greater consumer affairs knowledge, and were more aware of socially desirable consumer behaviors than females; but females were more aware of available brands. Upper-class adolescents scored higher in all four skills than lower-class adolescents. Peers and television were the most influential socialization agents. From their peers adolescents apparently learned about the availability of brands and about consumer matters, while from television they learned perceptions of effective consumer behavior. Parents and schools, however, contributed little to the acquisition of these skills, highlighting the need for evaluating current consumer education materials and practices at school and suggesting that some consumer education efforts could be aimed at adults.

The hand movements were emblems (hand movement not related to speech), illustrators (hand movement which accompanies speech), self-adaptors (nervous self-touching), and object-adaptors (nervous touching of objects). The first and second hypotheses stated that high communication apprehensive individuals would manifest fewer emblems and illustrators than moderates, who would manifest fewer than low communication apprehensive individuals. The third and fourth hypotheses stated that high communication apprehensive individuals would manifest more self- and object-adaptors than moderates,  who would manifest more than low communication apprehensive individuals. Each subject participated in an interview that was videotaped and coded by three independent judges. The hand movements were recorded according to their frequency of occurence. Only two emblems were observed; therefore all analyses addressing the first hypothesis were dropped. The second hypothesis was partially confirmed. The third and fourth hypotheses were not confirmed.

The study was based on the assumption that submissiveness is positively related to skill in decoding nonverbal cues and was designed after consideration of previous studies (many of which are summarized) of the connections between decoding ability and personal characteristics, personality correlates, and other communicative skills. The research questions addressed the relationships between orientation toward control by powerful others, femininity, and the ability to decode nonverbal cues, and the ability of orientation toward control by powerful others, gender, and  femininity to serve as predictors of decoding ability. Measurement instruments included the Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity, the Bem Sex Role Inventory, and two scales that measured the degree of orientation toward control by powerful others. Analysis of the results indicated that females are better decoders than males, that dominance and decoding may not be meaningfully related, and that femininity and ability to decode nonverbal cues are negatively related.

        "description":"One of 52 theoretical papers on school crime and its relation to poverty, this chapter reports that there is a growing trend in this country to blame youth crime on parental overpermissiveness. Available data fail to support this and show that all types of crime, including school crime, develop within families and school systems emphasizing aversive and athoritarian discipline techniques. Also, racism and personal injustice are more common in an authoritarian atmosphere. Of all types of aversive behavior control, corporal punishment appears most apt to induce aggression. A theory relating delinquent agression to the severity of parental discipline is sketched out, and it is suggested that a national effort be made to discourage the use of corporal punishment as a socially  acceptable child-rearing technique. Since corporal punishment tends to produce both fear and anger, its continued use in the school can only be counterproductive to the learning process. A joint effort should be made to train teachers in nonaversive but effective techniques of pupil control. In addition, individual teachers need the support of well-trained guidance personnel who are willing to enter homes and work with the behavioral problems at their source. (Author/MLF)",

The climate of the region is discussed by selected cities in terms of the effect of climate on solar heating requirements. The four states covered are California, Oregon, Washington, and Arizona. Presented in detail are the design parameters and performance characteristics of liquid space heating systems of the active type using flat plate collectors, water heat storage, and forced air distribution; active air space heating systems using flat plate collectors, rock-bed storage, and forced air distribution; and domestic hot water  heaters of the active type using liquid-cooled flat plate collectors. The analyses are based on hour-by-hour computer simulations using actual weather data from six selected cities. The collector area required for the three types of active systems has been determined as well as the effect of changes in all the design parameters. A simple, empirical, monthly solar-load ratio method for determining collector area is described and results are presented for 13 additional locations within the region. Swimming pool heaters are described briefly, and passive space heating systems are discussed qualitatively in terms of a number of successful designs. (Author)",

Within each of these areas  the important potential barriers to the commercialization of SHAC systems are identified, assessed, and evaluated. The most effective incentive options are evaluated and in a detailed, comprehensive appendix, each of these incentive options is analyzed in depth, and numerous other potential incentives are also discussed. Listings of state solar energy legislation enacted or proposed as of January 1977 are given in the appendix. (Author/MLF)",

The complexity of the study, the time available for data base development and analysis, and the relationship of the study to educational policy-making can all increase the criticality of such reexamination. Analysis of the error levels in the National Institute of Education's Instructional Dimensions Study (IDS) revealed inconsistencies between the data gathered in the field and the data finally analyzed in the study. Most of these problems were traced to processing errors that could have been corrected before the data were analyzed. The results of the IDS data base reexamination indicate that spending additional time and effort to assure accuracy of the data processing techniques could have saved time and effort by  eliminating the need to search for problems. This document briefly describes the basic purposes and the technical design of the IDS to clarify the processes used in this instance of data reexamination. Three examples of error-finding and error-solving are included. (Author/PGD)",

The fault for this failure can be ascribed in part to a lack of understanding of the planning process, particularly of the need to assess problems before proposing solutions. Even more critical, however, is the need to recognize that the bureaucratic structure of educational administration, while apparently efficient, is also often dysfunctional. Deriving from the monarchical form of government, the hierarchical structure of educational administration passes power from top to bottom. Those in the hierarchy are always more responsive to the desires of their superiors than to the actual needs of those below them.  Until decision-making power is redistributed, administrators and teachers are always going to be at odds and educational change is going to be a slow and painful process. (Author/PGD)",

        "description":"When effects of Proposition 13 are taken as a whole, the amendment will have an insignificant overall effect on the nation's economy. The property tax cut will stimulate consumer spending somewhat and lead to a lower price level because property taxes are a part of the housing component of the consumer price index (CPI). These economic stimulants, however, will be balanced by necessary cutbacks in state and local spending that should depress the economy. More precisely, Proposition 13 will cause (1) marginally lower levels of real economic activity through the first half of 1978 and marginally higher levels by mid-1980; (2) an employment loss of about 60,000 by the end of 1978 that will gradually diminish; and (3) a reduction in the CPI of .2 percent by the end of 1978 and .4  percent by mid-1980. The proposition will cause only slight increases in federal revenues, as smaller federal property tax deductions balance the lower income tax collections resulting from the measure's depressive influences. Total federal expenditures will not be significantly affected. If similar propositions spread to a large number of states, the net effect could be a slowdown in economic activity and employment growth, unless tax reductions are at least twice as large as the accompanying expenditure cuts.

It is part of a much larger effort to evaluate the social and economic consequences of PIL activity and to learn whether this recent institutional innovation is a useful supplement to government in correcting allocative-efficiency and distributive-equity failures of the private sector. After a brief introduction, the authors discuss the nature of potential market failures in education and the rationale for PIL intervention. In the main part of the paper, the authors focus on the school finance reform movement, the Serrano family of litigation, to determine the effect it has had not merely in the courtroom but in the actual reshaping of public policy toward  school finance. This litigation illustrates both the strengths and weaknesses of litigation as an instrument for change in educational finance. Whereas the PIL efforts seem to have precipitated major school finance reform, there is at least some evidence that such developments were forthcoming anyway--although perhaps not quite so quickly. School finance litigation has, however, had a noteworthy direct and indirect effect in at least a few states. (Author/IRT)",

In this bulletin, Brother Victor Hickey, F.S.C., analyzes and criticizes the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) report on secondary school education renewal entitled \"This We Believe: Secondary School in a Changing Society.\" According to the author, the NASSP report suggests a number of secondary education reforms including lowering the age for compulsory schooling and broadening graduation requirements. The report also condemns the  isolation of adolescents from the rest of society and real life work experiences. It, in essence, criticizes the whole process of moving from youth to adulthood in today's society. Although many of these proposed reforms are laudable, the author maintains, the NASSP report fails to mention the role of religious values in education or the contribution American churches and parochial schools have made as educators of American youth.

The key feature of 1977 school finance reforms is a revised general aid equalization formula that distributes more state aid to school districts low in property wealth. Other reforms concern special education, compensatory education, bilingual-bicultural education, aid to central cities, aid to poor rural areas, income factors in state aid formulas, cost-of-education adjustments, and tax and expenditure controls.  Section 2 of the booklet provides an overview of public policy issues related to school finance reform and discusses the results of research conducted on those issues.

School boards that aspire toward enhancing their policy-making function are here provided with a basic structure for policy-making. Policy-making means setting the general direction in which the school system charts its course, and the manner in which the schools are to be operated. The policy-making framework presented here is a six-step process that involves answering several questions: (1) What ought to be? (2) What is the current state of affairs? (3) What is the problem? (4) What are the alternative solutions? (5) What shall be the policy? (6) What are the  results of the policy? The first question involves the consideration of values, a consideration vital to policy-making because of values' influence on aspirations, goals, and perception of reality. Determining the difference between the answer to question one and the answer to question two constitutes needs assessment. Question six is vital because policy evaluation is necessary to correct policy malfunction. (Author/JM)",

Robert Samples has described the realm of the left hemisphere as that of rationality, logic, linear thinking, and separation of reality into its component parts. He sees the right hemisphere as the realm of metaphor, intuition, wholistic thinking, creativity, and synthesis. Jerome Bruner saw the right hand (controlled by the left hemisphere) as symbolizing order and action while the left hand (controlled by the right hemisphere) symbolized sentiment and intuition. In the realm of educational policy, partially because of cultural bias favoring rationality over intuition, there has been increasing pressure to ground the process of policy  formulation in rationality. While rationality is no doubt necessary for policy-making, it is not enough. Policy-making also requires the use of intuition, imagination, and hunch. This type of intuitive thought is especially valuable in the creativity involved in conceiving of policy alternatives. Thus, the left hand has lessons that, taken together with those of the right, will enable educators to conceive and forge stronger and better policy in education. (Author/JM)",

Kalenius, Jr. reviews data from 138 current research studies which indicate that handicapped children were able to learn the art forms, enjoyed the activities, increased feelings of self worth and learned academic skills as a result of arts activities. S. Madeja discusses the role of aesthetic perception, the critical process, and knowledge about the arts in arts instruction for the handicapped. L. Molloy discusses architectural and program accessibility factors for public arts facilities. Methods of facilitating career development and leisure time enjoyment of the arts are discussed by J.  Goldstein. Papers by J. Newberg and J. Kukuk deal with the artist's role in working with handicapped people and the major components of comprehensive arts education programs for the handicapped. G. Barlow cites the negative attitudes of society toward the handicapped in general, and suggests the need to identify attitudes specific to the handicapped in the arts. Further research needs are projected by J. Morrison. A conference summary outlines conclusions (regarding the Federal role, research, and arts in education, public facilities and attitudes), implications, and projections. (CL)",

A total of 11 monolingual team teachers and 11 bilingual teachers were asked fifteen questions related to the following areas: (1) language instruction; (2) teacher aides' services; (3) classroom needs; (4) inservice training needs; (5) supervision and services  by the Title VII staff; and (6) cultural awareness activities. The results for each of the fifteen items are discussed, and some of the results are presented as conclusions. One conclusion singled out as noteworthy is the fact that 36% of the bilingual teachers conduct none or almost none of their instructional activities in Spanish. Other observations are concerned with the successful teacher aide program, alternatives to inservice training workshops for staff training, means of identifying the appropriate instructional language(s), and language and cultural awareness activities.

Following a discussion of the results of each of the fifteen items, two significant conclusions are drawn: (1) because the burden of Spanish instruction falls on teachers aides, special training activities for and close supervision of the four aides seem necessary; and (2) to make up for the current lack of cultural activities, a heavy reliance on the aide for such activities is suggested.

        "description":"Teacher talk can be characterized as a &quot;caregiving&quot; style which has certain identifiable phonological, lexical, and grammatical features. Analysis of classroom discourse can make teachers and students of language aware of the process of communication, and can identify particular uses of nonverbal as well as verbal communication. This, in turn, can help teachers adjust their use of language to pedagogical goals and improve the teaching of language skills and the teaching of general knowledge. Examination by teachers and students of the features of teacher talk as register, discourse, and specialized language of control can help supplement traditional methods of teaching language arts. The following recommendations are made with a view toward observing and analyzing language  variation in the classroom: (1) teachers should discuss the language of routines with students; (2) teachers should be conscious of the behaviors of routine that differ for the school as a whole and within their class; (3) students should be asked what can be accomplished when turns are taken in talking; (4) ambiguous instructions should be made explicit whenever possible; and (5) inferences should also be clearly identified as such.

Among the variables that may affect the nature of the course are the students' and the instructor's backgrounds and interests, the institution, and the disciplines chosen for inclusion in the scope of the course, such as anthropology, psychology, and sociology. The content of an introductory course on language and linguistics should provide a dual focus: (1) presentation of the basic structure of languages; and (2) exploration of a wide variety of questions, issues, and concerns with respect to the roles of language in our lives. A sample syllabus for this  content is provided, grouping the material under the following divisions: (1) views of language; (2)morphology; (3) phonology; (4) writing systems; (5) syntax; (6) semantics and pragmatics; (7) language change and variation; (8) language learning; (9) language in education; and (10) overview. A selected, annotated bibliography of materials and resources completes the volume. (Author/AM)",

A review of research leads to the assumption that taboo word comprehension and production are the result of some or all of the following elements of the communication context: (1) social and physical setting; (2) speaker-listener relation; (3) topic of discussion; (4) intended meaning of the message; and (5) any grammatical constraints on the message. The model presented here is used to interpret research in which college students rated the likelihood and the offensiveness of particular combinations of speakers, locations and words. Data are presented indicating that dirty word comprehension  and production, or degree of offensiveness and frequency of usage as defined here, are dependent on the contextual factors specified above.

In some countries, higher education is coordinated by a central bureaucracy in which there is much nationalization of the curriculum, a nationalized degree structure, and a nationalized system of admissions. This approach is contrasted to decentralized and diversified systems which are more responsible to societal changes. The control of higher education by a monopoly of power or by a single form of organization is discussed. Decision-making needs to take place closer to the participants and the realities of local operating conditions. Cross national comparison indicates the insufficiency of uniform institutions and the need for institutional differentiation. The  European version of open-door access and the notion of educational equality are discussed. Autonomous action and planning are both needed as mechanisms of differentiation, coordination, and changes. (SW)",

Issues concerning school personnel and women's educational development are considered. Postsecondary and elementary/secondary education are considered separately. Sex role stereotyping of teachers and administrators and numbers and ranking of men and women in academics are addressed. The federal government needs a mechanism for surveying recruitment and promotion of college faculty that provides data on faculty sex distributions by rank, longitudinal surveys of individual faculty members, and separate tabulations of newly-promoted and newly-hired faculty. Similar needs exist for elementary and secondary systems. Regular monitoring is needed of faculty pay scales among institutions  differing in faculty sex composition. Analyses and dissemination of information on the sex composition of school administrators are needed. Monitoring of tne educational status of women should address educational progress (degrees obtained), education experiences (characterisitcs of education programs), fields of study, and persistence rates. Annual surveys on the educational status of women should include 10- or 15-year trends in enrollments and degrees awarded for men and women. Information is presented on these trends. Factors influencing women's career development and low mathematics interests and skills at the elementary and secondary levels need to be explored.

Women have been acquiring the necessary credentials for employment and promotion in art departments, but they are balanced between a future of full participation in academe and a decline to tokenism. Women constitute over 50 percent of the undergraduate art majors, but the percentage of women in art faculties has been declining to a low of 19.5 percent in 1974, and the status of women in art administration is even lower. Hiring, promotion, tenure, and salary differentials have been discriminatory against women. Women are not fairly represented on art studies, art education, or art history faculties. Lack of visibility in exhibitions, publications, and on college faculties  has made it difficult for women to present themselves as serious artists and teachers. The influence of the women's movement on attitudes and social change, laws which prohibit discrimination in education and employment, and affirmative action programs are discussed. (SW)",

A profile by state is presented of the followinq seven major factors commonly included for new program review: program description, purposes and objectives, need analysis, cost analysis, resources analysis, program accreditation, and availability of adequate student financial aid. Procedures of the various review processes are discussed, and academic reviews conducted in New York and Florida are  described. Difficulties encountered in the selection of existing programs for review and in developing a functioning definition of programs are discussed. The criteria used most frequently for existing program review by various agencies are productivity, cost, quality, and need. Four types of reviewers and problems that occur in review, including legal, political, and due process issues, are discussed. Recommendations for the optimal conditions for academic program review are offered. (SW)",

The first concerns an experiment that tested the relative effectiveness of three teaching methods: an uninterrupted lecture, a tape-recording, and reading a prescribed text. The three-way research design used the three teaching methods, three groups of six student teachers of physical medicine between the ages of 24 and 42, and three psychological topics as subject matter. Each teaching method was followed at once by a multiple choice test designed to measure eight cognitive levels from Bloom's &quot;Cognitive Taxonomy of Educational Objectives.&quot; These levels of thinking are: terminology, facts, generalizations, understanding, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. A discussion of these concepts, testing conditions, and results  of the pilot experiment is provided. The second baper concerns objective tests of the effectiveness of teaching methods in higher education. The correspondence between logical processes in the student's mind and categories of Bloom's &quot;Cognitive Taxonomy of Educational Objectives&quot; are expressed in terms of propositional, or truth functional, logic. The analysis concerns testing: a student's knowledge of fact presented during instruction, knowledge of presented relations betweeen facts, unpresented relations between presented facts, the ability to apply presented principles and generalizations, the ability to analyze unstated generalizations, unpresented relations between presented facts, the ability to evaluate, and value judgments.

Section II focuses on the number and proportions of men and women at each degree level and shows increased representation by women. Tables in Section III emphasize the number of degrees awarded by control and level of institution, indicating a decreasing proportion of degrees awarded by private institutions. Section IV analyzes the pattern of degrees awarded, by discipline division and by level for the five-year period 1970-71 through 1974-75. Discipline divisions that experienced the largest  changes in numbers of degrees awarded are further analyzed in terms of specialties. At the bachelor's level, changes in numbers of degrees awarded in selected specialties (and thus changes in manpower supply) are compared with the projected labor demand for workers in these areas, using information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In order to construct an index of demand for full-time faculty, the age distribution had to be estimated. The net mobility by five-year age group for the period 1970 to 1975 was determined, and the net mobility was estimated for the period ending in 1985. Two striking findings are documented: (1) the median age of faculty increased by one year between 1970 and 1975, and is projected to increase by four years during the 1975-1985 period; and (2) the net mobility of faculty is expected to decline significantly in the five years ending in 1980, and drop even further between 1980 and 1985 to roughly one-fifth the levels experienced in the first half of the 1970's. Job opportunities for young PhD's can  be expected to deteriorate significantly. The extent of this decline in job opportunities portends the loss of a whole generation of potential scholars.

Rural areas do not have an adequate supply of qualified health manpower, and almost one-third of the nation's critical health manpower shortage areas are in southern states. Data are presented on the ratios of physicians to civilian population and the percentage of physicians in primary medical care. Strategies for influencing the distribution of physicians are directed to the selection and education of medical students and residents in training, and others relate to fiscal policies and community recruitment activities after training. Strategies involve money, policies and procedures, program  development, or changes in laws. The state government holds the power to modify licensure laws, provide scholarships and loans, fund residency training programs in family practice, fund Area Health Education Centers, and influence reimbursement schedules. A combination of policies and incentives coordinated in an overall plan by the state is needed to deal with the problems of physician distribution. (SW)",

Planning models and program change data were solicited from 76 selected institutions through a structured personal letter and a seven-point Likert scale with 24 possible policy initiatives. Seven institutions were then selected as representative of varied uses of labor market data in planning. Analyses of these institutions' data uses, program changes, and planning models constitute a section of this report entitled Policy Initiatives Utilizing Labor Market Data. That section is  preceded by a section called Institutional Attributes containing statistical profiles of the several types of institutions in the sample and which tests the hypothesis that these schools are representative of most American colleges and universities. The bulk of the report is a section called Site Visits, followed by a section entitled Site Visit Theme Analysis. Site visits are reported for Alma College, Central Michigan University, Colorado Mountain College, University of Oregon, St. Cloud University, Washington Technical Institute, and Willamette University. Appended are excerpts from the Minnesota Higher Education Coordinating Board, the Montana Commission of Postsecondary Education, and the University of Wisconsin System. (LBH)",

Based on a program developed by Joseph E. Hill of Oakland Community College in Michigan, the project specified four objectives: (1) to develop and test procedures for the measurement of the 32 dimensions of Hill's model of educational cognitive style; (2) to train faculty and staff of the participating institutions to understand the model; (3) to assist these trained faculty members in developing and  carrying out plans for implementing cognitive style mapping procedures in making educational decisions in their individual courses; and (4) to plan and carry out systematic evaluations of the effect of the mapping procedures and data on educational outcomes in each setting. The project results did not establish the existence of significant relationships between the use of cognitive style measures and data on educational outcomes.

Private endowments, foundation support, and federal funds should be sought. Specialized libraries ought to be considered national resources and funded accordingly. Other access problems needing attention are restricted hours, too little reference service, physical and psychological barriers, and no specialized programs for the institutionalized, the inner-city poor, and children. The response emphasizes such positive aspects of library access today as the use of library system borrower's cards and more convenient material return systems. The New York Libraries Inter-System Borrowing (NYLIB) provides cross-system access.  Physical barriers are being removed and psychological barriers are absent; the major barrier is lack of public awareness. Public libraries are instituting programs to serve the visually handicapped and functionally illiterate, but services to rural residents and the institutionalized require funding. (Author/JAB)",

By 1977 fifteen public libraries in three systems were involved in seven projects, each funded for three years. The original objective was to provide beginning professional librarians the opportunity to work in libraries serving populations of less than 10,000 that had not had professional staff members until that time. In actual practice, the persons hired did not work as the administrators of small libraries, but as staff members in reference and adult services, children's work, community service, cataloging, homebound service, and administrative services in libraries of various sizes. The program policy review  resulted in a recommendation that the program continue because it was effectively increasing the numbers of professional librarians in public libraries and was based on sound principles of public library operation.

The impact on the organization of the school was assessed through interviews, observations, and a readministration of the original survey instruments. The results showed that, after the workshop, staff members used organizational theory to define problems and continued to rely on  problem-solving techniques to develop solutions. Between the two surveys there were some significant changes in the school's organizational patterns and levels of conflict. (Author)",

The Early Childhood Development Division in Texas evaluated how and why coordination begins and is maintained over time in groups of two organizations and in networks of many organizations. In studying the pairs of organizations it was found that four factors needed to exist before organizations would exchange resources--awareness, resource dependence, domain consensus, and problem commitment of goal similarity. Among the major findings of the study were that coordination occurs primarily as a rational response to a need for resources necessary to achieve certain organizational goals; that organizations that have something in common  are more likely to coordinate than are those with nothing in common; that successful relationships are likely to emerge incrementally and to grow with small, successful encounters; and that the effectiveness of coordination can be measured by the amount of resources available as a result of coordination, by the attitudes of the partners, by reduction in competition between agencies, and through formalization of communication.

The authors reach different conclusions about the role of rationality and bargaining because they use different definitions, because of the influence of the dominant mode of thinking at the time they wrote, because of the differing character of the puzzles examined, and because of the questions the analysts wanted to answer and why they wanted to answer them. Three lessons can be learned from efforts to apply models to decision-making. First, alternative models hold out the possibility of a better, if not more complicated, understanding of how decisions are actually made and how programs are actually implemented. Second, models have  added measurably to the complexity of conducting policy research. Third, the utility of a model depends in part on the personal judgments of the analyst on what is important and appropriate for study. Models of decision-making, whether frustrating or not, have helped analysts gain a deeper understanding of society and its study, and they are essential for the further development of policy analysis.

They rank ordered both real and ideal role dimensions and agreed that the role is not what it should be. Principals now serve as disciplinarians but do not wish to do so. Both teachers and principals would like to see the principal as a staff selector/orientor. Neither group was too anxious to see the principal as an evaluator, although teachers felt that principals carry out this role more than principals believe they do. In conclusion, both principals (very strongly) and teachers want the principal's role as instructional and curriculum supervisor to be more pronounced than it presently  is. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper includes a functional model for upgrading the effectiveness of inservice training for school administrators. It is based on the writer's contention that most inservice programs for administrators do not relate to the leadership concerns of each participant, skills developed in those programs often are not applied to the participant's back-home school setting, the leadership behavior of the administrator is a key factor in stimulating or inhibiting meaningful change in the school, and a narrow focus--the participant's interests and skills--has been the thrust of most inservice programs rather than the multifaceted aspect of providing effective leadership for the institutions served by the participating administrators. The writing focuses on the school administrator as a  barrier or a gateway to change in schools, some techniques of organizing leadership inservice education, the dynamic relationship between the administrator's inservice training and the school he serves, and the Leadership Inservice Education Model (LIEM) for upgrading the effectiveness of inservice activities. The need for school systems to place a higher priority on inservice training for the administrator as a key to program improvement is emphsized. (Author/IRT)",

The author (who is president of the Institute for Responsive Education) advocates the reintroduction of democratic values into education. Through school-based management, many important aspects of decision-making can be decentralized to the school building level. Workable decentralization requires a sensible plan of checks and balances, and citizens councils can encourage its development. Currently, however, citizens councils seem ineffective, partly because they have been given little authority or assistance by school officials. The author also advocates community access to collective bargaining in the  schools and educational program diversity to serve different interests in the community. (Author/DS)",

In 1976, modular home construction companies were surveyed in Texas and across the United States to assess the extent of their construction activity and market penetration and to gather some insight into the future of modular residential construction. A questionnaire was sent to 196 manufacturers. Of these, 77 responses were received and 48 had useable information. One manufacturer was producing units to be used as motels, schools, and townhouses. Information requested covered a wide range of topics including individual contruction techniques, square footages, features, per-unit costs, financing methods, sales and aggregation of  markets, average shipping distances, unit merchandising, and assessment of effects of added government regulation, emerging trends, and indications of the nature and extent of future industry problems.

Students, qualifying under Title I guidelines, in grades 3-7 were provided with ten minutes of practice daily. The weight of the data support CAI. Students made at least a month gain per month of instruction on the computer curricula; middle school CAI students made significantly higher standardized test gains than did non-CAI students. Both CAI and control programs were equally effective in achieving reading gains. Elementary mathematics gains generally favored CAI students. Elementary teacher responses to  questionnaires indicated that the teachers perceive CAI as beneficial to student achievement; middle school teachers were less positive but still moderately supportive. Student responses to questionnaires indicated that they perceived CAI drill and practice as personally beneficial and as an enjoyable activity. (Author/IRT)",

Also provided is the complete synthesis of informal interviews conducted at mid-year with teachers, principals, and parents. Eight comparisons of achievement were made to assess the effect of the magnet-vanguard plan on the student's mathematics and reading skills at grades 4 and 5. Of these eight comparisons, five were not significant, two were significant favoring magnet students, and one was significant favoring both magnet and neighborhood students over  vanguard students. All significant differences occurred at grade 4; none at grade 5. Magnet-vanguard teachers and principals favored the plan but strongly recommended a modification in the criteria for student placement. Regular classroom teachers' responses were mixed. Parents' opinions were most favorable. (Author/IRT)",

The topic suggests that users impact innovations just as innovations impact the user. The study's paradigm for implementation has three components--program specifications, the procedures specified for the innovation; user practices, the ways the user performs the task prior to the introduction of the innovation; and operational characteristics, the actual manner in which the user operates the innovation. In this paradigm, implementation is conceived as a bilateral event: both the innovation and user are altered. Two types of mutual adaptations were identified in the elementary reading and mathematics programs examined--those that were mixtures of and those that  were actually different from the related program specifications and user practices. Conditions affecting alterations to the programs were the non-dynamic features of the user's environment, the other programs that the user operates, emergent innovations, the incompleteness of the innovation, ramifications of other alternatives, and the evaluative judgments of the user. This study has clearly shown that the innovation was impacted during implementation. (Author/IRT)",

One of the principles of organizational development is that unless the individual's perceived self-interest can be engaged, there will be no change. Several strategies available for federal officals to engage the self-interests of school personnel are the forcing, buying, persuading, manipulating, and reinforcing of change. The political feasibility of these strategies varies by the legitimacy necessary to sanction their use, and with attitudes versus behavior as a target for change. A number of features are suggested that would characterize a user-driven  system and those features are related to the paradox. Two rules used in selecting these features are the determination of (1) what will maximize the prospects for successful change at the service delivery level (schools and classrooms), and (2) what can reasonably be assumed to be within reach of federal policy-makers and program administrators.

Information on 14 groups of private and parochial schools was collected, although the authors emphasize that their research was not exhaustive. The results show an overall decline from the 1965-66 enrollment high point to 1976, although Catholic schools suffered a much greater enrollment decline than other private and parochial schools. Some varieties of nonpublic schools (such as private alternative schools) have gained enrollment across the ten-year period. The data show that with the exception of Catholic schools, enrollment decline has generally been resisted in nonpublic schools. The data  indicate that during the past five years, the demand for nonpublic schools has taken a decided upturn, especially for nonpublic schools that represent a strong protest against certain features of public education. On the basis of this data, the authors conclude that public disenchantment with the public schools is reaching serious proportions, particularly in some parts of the nation (the Deep South, Florida, and the Southwest).

During the summer, Ss were given a 25-item questionnaire taken from the Attitudes towards Deafness scale. Six months later, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 30 of the initial respondents. Among findings were the following: hearing students generally have a positive attitude toward deaf people prior to their arrival on campus; there is little difference in attitudes between hearing students living in the residence halls where hearing students were in the majority and those living in the complex where deaf students were the majority; and there seems to be a difference in the attitudes of students depending upon  the program or major in which they are enrolled.

Through interviews, questionnaires, and observations during labor, delivery and the postpartum period, 100 mothers were identified as at high risk for abnormal parenting procedures. Ss were then randomly divided into a High-Risk Intervene (HRI) group and a High-Risk Nonintervene (HRN) group. HRI Ss received comprehensive pediatric followup by a physician or other health personnel, while HRN Ss received routine care. Evaluations were completed on 25 families in each group and a control group when the children were approximately 2 years old. Among results were that perinatal screening procedures successfully identified a high risk  group; 5 Ss in the HRN group required hospitalization for serious injuries thought to be secondary to abnormal parenting procedures; and the most accurate predictive information was provided by labor-delivery observations and nursery observations and interveiws.

In Experiment I, Ss were required to retrieve information from semantic categories, as well as judge whether specific items were members of a given category. Results showed that retarded Ss retrieved only about 60% of the total number of items retrieved by nonretarded Ss, a difference which could not be wholly accounted for by the items available in storage. Experiment 2 was designed to remediate this retrieval deficit by introducing an organized retrieval plan consisting of subcategory cues. The organization facilitated retrieval as long as it was experimentally provided. Retrieval returned to its original level,  however, when the cues were withdrawn. It was concluded that retarded individuals had an accessibility deficit in addition to an availability deficit; one aspect of this assessibility deficit involved the failure to spontaneously use mnemonic strategies that were consistent with the semantic organization.

Quality of tutor-student interaction during multiplication drills was based on the pace or rate at which students interacted with the material and the accuracy level at which they performed. Ss were instructed to listen to cassette tapes of an individual giving answers and were asked to mark with a pencil the problems on the probe sheet for which they heard a mistake. Almost 94% of the errors were identified by students functioning at their own rate and 96.8% of the errors were identified by students functioning at or below their own rate.

The objective of the project is to implement a comprehensive intervention program for the child by means of both direct treatment and referral to other appropriate community resources. Outclient services focus on counseling parents and teachers in alternative methods of child management. Intervention effectiveness is monitored by means of behavioral data. After 3 1/2 years of operation, treatment success is 76% at termination of active intervention services with 58% of the children behaving acceptably at 12-month followup. The treatment effectiveness data, in  combination with relatively short treatment time required, strongly support the use of intensive, closely monitored intervention procedures with this population. Interagency participation in the project appears to have significant impact on treatment effectiveness. The interagency model does create problems in financial management and personnel matters and requires assertive public relations efforts for community acceptance, but treatment effectiveness data supports continuation of the model. (Among appendixes are a table of referral statistics, a diagram of the model, and information on termination and followup.) (Author/SBH)",

The residential services are designed to develop community competency from the vantage point of its unique integration of the human service delivery network. Application of behavior therapy principles is aimed at clinical outcomes that meet the expectations of the consumer. Within the therapy context, the residential treatment team has developed a &quot;package&quot; treatment program implemented by staff mediators by synthesizing diagnostic and treatment procedures for each resident on the basis of a token economy system. Evaluation of the treatment  effectiveness has been done within single-subject and between-subject research designs, while the untreated non-random control group with pre- and post tests has been chosen as the most feasible research design.

Test marking may be narrow, in which only the exact word omitted is counted as correct, or broad, where any acceptable word is correct.

Linguistic research on reading is reviewed, illustrating the parallel development of studies in syntactic-semantic theory and research on the reading process.

The first paper, &quot;Against Universal Semantic Representation,&quot; by Gilbert Harman, argues against the need for (and the possibility of) a level of semantic representation in a theory of language. &quot;Remarks on the Lexicography of Performative Verbs,&quot; by James D. McCawley, is primarily concerned with a characterization of performativity. &quot;A Classification of Illocutionary Acts,&quot; by John R. Searle, sets up a classification scheme in terms of illocutionary acts, rather than illocutionary verbs. The next two papers, &quot;Where to Do Things with Words,&quot; by John Robert Ross, and &quot;Aspects of Linguistic Pragmatics,&quot; by Jerrold M. Sadock, concern themselves with the question of  how to treat cases in which what a sentence might be said to mean is not what the speaker might be said to have meant. &quot;What You Can Do with Words: Politeness, Pragmatics and Performatives,&quot; by Robin Lakoff, explores politeness in language. &quot;Pragmatics in Natural Logic,&quot; by George Lakoff, shows how three pragmatic conerns (indexical elements, performatives and implicatures) can be incorporated into a generative semantics theory. The final three papers deal with the problems of presupposition: &quot;Pragmatic Presuppositions,&quot; by Robert Stalnaker; &quot;Presupposition and Linguistic Context,&quot; by Lauri Karttunen; and &quot;Where Pragmatics Fits In,&quot; by Richard H.

        "description":"Several research studies have looked at Japanese-American interaction with other ethnic groups in Hawaii. A study by McCandless and Hoyt, &quot;Sex, Ethnicity, and Play Preferences of Preschool Children,&quot; reveals that children in Hawaii base their choice of friends on racial distinctions. This is due, however, not to racial hostility or discrimination but to a tendency to engage in more communication with those with whom one has most in common. Vinacke, in his study, &quot;Stereotyping Among National-Racial Groups in Hawaii,&quot; concludes that stereotyping cannot be equated with prejudice; it is more a reflection of &quot;truth&quot; than racial prejudice. In &quot;Some Observations Regarding Haole-Japanese Marriages in Hawaii,&quot; Nagoshi and Nishimura note that the attitudes of Japanese- Americans are  changing from almost universal objection to mixed marriages to increasing acceptance or at least tolerance. Keinecke's study &quot;Pidgin English in Hawaii&quot; shows that those who speak pidgin find that otherwise insurmountable obstacles can be overcome in interracial contacts. In his study &quot;The ILWU as a Force for Interracial Unity in Hawaii,&quot; Thompson discusses how the unified labor force which was created by the ILWU brought varied races and peoples together. It seems that Hawaii is not so much a community of racial distinction as one of cultural pluralism. (CFM)",

        "description":"This paper views communication as the major human survival tool. Any approach which limits or hampers the innate metabolic human ability to adapt, in order to maximize the chances for survival through communication, is thus seen as dangerous. Instead, a methodology is suggested to develop a communication sub-culture, to facilitate individual contributions and adaptations, rather than the use of methodologies, organizations or systems based on fitting participants into preconceived structures. Development of a matrix for interaction thus becomes a result of maximized individual development and adaptation rather than a result of submerging the individual into some definitional group, system, or organization. This basic principle is specifically applied to the area of international  and intercultural communication. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"The paper draws attention to communication in multilingual states which may be said to exist at three levels: sub-state, state, and inter-state level. Communication at the sub-state level may involve an &quot;in-group&quot; language or a regional one, and hence a multilingual model is required at this level. At the state level, on the other hand, there will be one or more languages, to the effect that the whole population may be involved in the &quot;effective functioning of the nation-state&quot;. The advantages of a unilingual model as compared with a multilingual one at this level are examined, and it is suggested that for many African states, the latter model may be inevitable. At the inner-state level, a unilingual or multilingual model may be required. Where an exoglossic language is both the  language of communication at inter-state and state levels, the gulf between the educated elites and the masses tends to be widened. It is suggested therefore that a realistic policy must involve a narrowing of this gap through an increasing use of the indigenous languages. (Author)",

This instrument was designed to ascertain how teachers perceive the pupils in their classroom and how two teachers representing different backgrounds perceive children of similar and different backgrounds. Ratings were completed on a total of 373 children in 12 bilingual classrooms. Each participant was rated by a bilingual and monolingual English teacher at the beginning and at the end of the school year. The 20-item bilingual scale which was organized along three levels of abstraction was reduced, through factor analytic techniques, to three factors labeled as Spanish Orientation, Task Orientation and English Orientation. The  observed high reliability in ratings between the English and bilingual teachers indicated high teachers' agreement for the three factors, and suggest that behaviors inferred by the three factors are readily observable and measurable.

        "author":["Blaubergs, Maija S."],
        "description":"That semantics interacts with syntax has been shown in psycholinguistic investigations of the processing of language by adults and of the acquisition of language by children. The few programs for language assessment and therapy that have attempted to incorporate semantic considerations have included some misunderstandings of the psycholinguistic basis. In an attempt to remedy those misunderstandings, some general recommendations are presented, and some of the specific misunderstandings in the program developed by MacDonald (1975) are pointed out. The general recommendations include the following: (1) If remedial programs are to be based on the normal language acquisition process in which syntax and semantics interact, that precludes basing remedial programs on any abstract  syntactical model of an adult language user and the exclusive use of techniques for instilling desired language patterns that are void of meaning. (2) If the goal of remedial programs becomes the establishment of communication, measures of comprehension and intent would be at least as important as verbal performance. (3) If situational or contextual factors are recognized as relevant to the child's comprehension and intent, the clinician would use the linguistic and non-linguistic environment in interpreting and interacting with the child.

        "description":"Numerous reasons can be cited by scholars concerning lexical problems that face anyone embarking upon such an enterprise as that of preparing a Basque-English dictionary. First, &quot;euskera,&quot; a term given to this ancient tongue, is both written and spoken today as it was millennia ago. Second, Basque, as a result, has not been subjected to constant revisions, improvements, additions and deletions of vocabulary as has occurred in English. Third, in reference to linguistic classification, the former, like Finnish, is both flexional and agglutinative, while the latter, by distinction, is flexional but isolating, which implies being completely analytic. Fourth, and perhaps the most salient characteristic of Basque, and which indeed presents enormous problems to any linguist, is the  complex structure of dialectal variations inherent in the language's syntax and vocabulary. These variations, in terms of spellings and meanings, are not mutually understandable by Basques. Basque lexicographers concur that having a Basque-English dictionary would serve not only as an indispensable tool to scholarly research in determining clues to the mystery surrounding the origin of Basque, but would be an instructive guide in terms of furnishing precise information relative to etymology, morphology, syntax and semantics. Lastly, Basques in America and elsewhere would have a text of English vocabulary, word meanings and their essential components to improve their skills in the two languages. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"This is a report in outline form of the status of teaching English literature in Austria. The schools syllabus prescribes that English literature should be taught after students have studied English for four years, that is, in the 5th form. The short story is the usual prose form selected. In the 5th and 6th forms, one literary work is studied in detail, in addition to a number of short extracts; in the 7th at least one literary work is studied, in addition to various extracts from a Shakespearean play or plays. In the 8th form, two contemporary literary works, plus extracts from various literary genres or periods, are studied. Samples of British verse also are studied in the 7th and 8th forms. A list is given here of the texts used in one school in Vienna for the 5th - 8th  forms. Each student must also read a certain number of literary texts on his own at home. The &quot;school leaving&quot; and &quot;university entrance&quot; examination comprises a five-hour essay paper and an optional oral examination. There are two professional associations of English teachers, which are described here. School leaving standards tend to be higher in Vienna and in provincial capitals than elsewhere in Austria. About 1/6 of all university undergraduates study English. The university offers survey courses, literature lecture courses, and literary seminars. Undergraduate course offerings and requirements are described, and graduate study is mentioned briefly. The range and quality of translations of British literature are also briefly discussed, as is the availability of literature texts.  (CFM)",

        "description":"The introduction of a listening comprehension component in the Israeli Matriculation examination of English as a Foreign Language has necessitated research into more effective methods of testing listening comprehension. Oral proficiency has been part of the examination for some time, but more reliable methods of evaluating the test are needed. An article on group testing by Folland and Robertson (1976) inspired the experiment. The test begins in the language laboratory, where students listen to a passage twice for listening comprehension. During the second hearing they are required to answer multiple-choice comprehension questions. In groups of five the students are then invited to sit informally around a table and discuss the tape they have heard. The examiners sit behind them,  and each one awards a grade for one aspect of oral proficiency (i.e., lexis, pronunciation, etc.). An overall grade is awarded for communicative competence by each teacher and the average grade is then computed. Results were highly satisfactory in that the correlations between final grades and teacher ratings were high. Students were enthusiastic about the test, and the examiners felt that this approach was as objective as possible. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"Sixty-five grade 5-6 children were tested on a verbal recall task involving material of varying semantic and syntactic content. There was no difference between best and poorest readers in their performance on random lists of words, but there were clear differences on meaningful sentences and on syntactically well-formed but semantically anomalous sentences. Semantic and syntactic regularities provide cues which may facilitate performance on all but the random lists of words, if the child has knowledge of the structural possibilities of English and the acceptable word combinations. The results on the recall task shows, therefore, that not all children are equally able to make use of semantic and syntactic knowledge in processing oral language and that this knowledge is related to  their reading competence. The same linguistic information may be used by efficient adult readers in processing textual materials. Thus it seems likely that there may be a threshold level of proficiency prerequisite to reading development. (Author)",

        "description":"The years after children demonstrate comprehension of particular syntactic structures have received little attention. What happens in language development after mastery is achieved? Are children then like adult speakers in judging the acceptability of grammatical structures? Questions addressed in this research were: Will older children and young adolescents, comprehending a structure, also judge it acceptable? Will judgments of acceptability and unacceptable elements be determined by Ss' age? Will judgments be under control of the type of psychological complexity built into the stimuli? Sentences were of the form, &quot;The girl promises the boy to feed the dog&quot;; 5 reflected and 5 contradicted the logical relations Ss considered most likely. Ss in grades 4 through 8 (12 per grade)  individually heard all sentences, answered comprehension questions, evaluated the items' acceptability, and identified unacceptable elements. Comprehension was clearly demonstrated. Expectation (i.e., whether sentences reflected or contradicted the most likely logical relations), but not grade, affected judgments of acceptability. Four categories of unacceptable elements resulted: structure, agent, the verb &quot;promise,&quot; and verb tense. Relative frequencies differed between levels of expectation and among the grades. Implications are related to developmental trends among older children, the multi-dimensional nature of expectations, and stimulus materials in future research. (Author)",

By comparing the performance of immersion pupils on an Irish (as a second language) version of the problem arithmetic test with the performance of non-immersion pupils on an English (as a first language) version, Macnamara's study confounds bilinguals' competence in arithmetic with their ability to demonstrate this competence when tested through their weaker language. Macnamara's attempt to demonstrate the equivalence of Irish and English versions of the problem arithmetic test fails to take account of probable differences in Irish competence between the immersion pupils in the pretest and those in the  main study.

This approach does not require the language learner to speak until he feels comfortable doing so. Both past and current applications of a delayed oral practice approach to language learning are surveyed. Research described shows that language learners not required to speak immediately--though they may if they wish--can make more significant gains in reading, writing and speaking, as well as in listening comprehension, than students required to speak right away in a typical audio-lingual program. A variety of non-verbal response modes requiring active listening and student participation are discussed. (Author/AM)",

Section two, which is based on a Ph.D. thesis (Kay 1963), develops the hypothesis that Tahitian words for social classification and the common French translations are semantically equivalent for most native speakers of Tahitian. This means that when a French word is used, the Tahitian meaning is intended. Section three, which attempts to relate the data in section two to more recent anthropological research, develops the hypothesis that words designating racial/social types in Brazilian Portuguese do not constitute a shared semantic system which permits native speakers to communicate effectively in this domain. This semantic ambiguity may be due  to a desire to slur class and race distinctions. Section four discusses the implications of these hypotheses for semantic theory, and presents research on other sets of words whose meanings seem to imply underlying notions of quantity and statistical distribution.

The first, &quot;Institutional Goal Achievement: Measures of Progress&quot; (IGA), suggested by its results that the process of setting goals and measuring progress would benefit from consensus-building techniques, whether in individual institutions, among institutions of one type, or across institutional types. The second, The Higher Education Outcome Measures Identification Study (OMIS), studied and developed procedures for collecting outcomes and associated measures deemed most important to different types and levels of decisionmakers. The procedures of these two studies can be useful  in goal translation, and, in addition, important insights can be gained about the outcomes information preferences and needs of postsecondary education participants and constituents when the measures are used as research tools.

Basically, a lesson review is a set of comments about the lesson ranging from alternative instructional strategy suggestions to grammatical corrections, from content accuracy to punctuation. This report describes the evolution of the lesson review process and discusses review effectiveness in terms of resulting lesson revision and author training.

Evaluators considered themselves competent and self-sufficient to evaluate libraries without strict adherence to SACS's standard. They expressed a need, however, for guidance from SACS through quantitative guidelines, check lists, and questionnaires, and have developed their own. A profile was constructed based on procedures used by evaluators. The study concluded that minimal guidance is given to evaluators, and that there is  minimal communication between SACS and evaluators. The study recommended the SACS should: (1) produce and distribute publications to evaluators identifying differences between suggestions and recommendations; (2) give first-time evaluators copies of good past reports; (3) assign library evaluators to libraries and not other institutional aspects; and (4) make the library standard modern and flexible, containing normative data and quantitative guidelines. Further research on evaluator competency and other libraries and accreditating associations was recommended. Cover letter, questionnaire, and bibliography are appended. (Author/KP)",

Preliminary data from this survey are not encouraging to the professional instructional developer. Innovative and aggressive teaching faculty from the subject area disciplines, or high level academic officers, seem to play a larger role in the development of new programs than formally trained developers. Data also indicate that, although faculty were sometimes given rewards of money or release time, personal commitment to projects appeared to be more important in ensuring success. This study graphically demonstrated that instructional development as a systematic approach to solving  educational program problems is dependent upon the efficiency of the communication and management systems within a given institution. Without interrelation of communication, management, and instructional decision-making systems, projects may anticipate confusion, delays, frustration, and eventual failure. (Author/WBC)",

The report also covers the areas of bibliographic services, reader services, international role, and the LC and North American library community. It notes that the LC must press for realization of a coherent national bibliographic system, that specialized data bases could be used as foundation for a generalized national information and retrieval service, that the LC must promote greater  international cooperation, and that advisory mechanisms from the library community are needed to improve the continuity and utility of the LC.

Thirty-one students, enrolled in the junior year of the baccalaureate program in nursing at Widener College, participated in the study. A criterion-referenced pre-test was given to the 31 students. Then the class was randomly divided into two groups. Fourteen studnts in Group A viewed the videotape on the Administration of the Denver Developmental Screening Test while 17 students in Group B received the same information by the didactic method. The students were given the opportunity to administer the Denver Test to a child in the clinical area. The two groups were given a posttest to measure learning gain.  Both groups improved their scores on the posttest, although there was more of an increase in Group B than in Group A. Since both methods produced learning on the posttest, and the students seem to favor the videotape presentation, the videotape method with an instructor present for discussion appeared to be a viable method for this course. Recommendations are made for further study. (Author/BM)",

Fourteen representative journal titles were selected in seven specialized areas, using periodical guides. Number of references and call numbers were recorded for cited titles in bibliographies of the first article in the first and third 1975 issues. Journals and monographs were referred to approximately an equal number of times, and four subject disciplines accounted for over 75 percent of  the literature covered by educational journals: (1) education; (2) psychology; (3) sociology; and (4) political science. The graduate library held 24 of 25 titles cited at least twice in the subject areas of education, psychology, and sociology. The study concluded that the libraries have resources to adequately support research in education, and that material in psychology is needed to supplement the &quot;L&quot; materials in the education collection.

To overcome this difficulty, a computer program was developed which functions as a line-by-line proof checker in Sentential Calculus. The program, DEMON, first evaluates any statement supplied by the student to see whether it is well-formed; second, it checks each line of the student's proof to determine whether it is a legitimate inference from the premises and earlier lines of the proof. This program, combined with a second which offers drill and feedback on translating English to and from logical symbols, is the key part of an integrated computer assisted curriculum in informal and formal logic. It is argued that these &quot;simulations&quot; of  logical processes, in conjunction with the CAI approach, enable college students to acquire an understanding of symbolic logic more quickly and at a higher level than courses using more conventional methods.

Since 1972-73 it has offered a two year MLS program which requires students to identify an area of special interest and to prepare a specialization paper; information science can be an area of specialization. Each student in the first year of the program takes nine required courses considered fundamental to professional library competence. One of these is Introduction to Information Science, and several of them incorporate &quot;information science&quot; as appropriate. During the second year students not specifically committed to information science as a specialty also may choose  appropriate advanced courses in the field. Such choices are realistic because the program's background requirements include familiarity with a programming language and mathematics in addition to foreign language competence. The flexibility of the two-year program and the quarter calendar makes it possible not only to prepare librarians specializing in information science, but also to provide other librarians with basic and advanced skills in information science.

At its center is an interactively updated and queried set of files concerned with all items currently in process. Principal products include all purchase orders, claims, and cancellations; receiving and invoicing reports; catalogers' work-sheets and proofsheets; in process listings; and a variety of management and user reports. The system also supports the data base for an on-line circulation system (BELLREL) and a photocomposed printed book catalog. Operational since the beginning of 1972, BELLTIP provides a number of advantages over the previous manual system. These include faster processing of orders, better information  about orders in process, automatic handling of routine processes, elimination of redundant record transcriptions, and better management information.

The study sample consisted of 633 students from six community colleges, 379 of which had college admissions test scores available. Of these 379 students, 203 had scored at or below the thirty-third percentile (&quot;new&quot; students) and 84 scored at or above the sixty-seventh percentile (traditional students). Cognitive styles of the sample students were measured by the Group Embedded Figures Test, and preferences for social and structural aspects of the learning environment and for community college programs were measured by means of a questionnaire. Results of the study showed that the cognitive style of field dependence occurred  significantly more frequently in &quot;new&quot; students than in traditional students, that field dependent students had preferences for college majors which emphasized interpersonal skills and for majors which involved writing and discussion, and that field dependent students preferred courses which were highly structured. Implications and recommendations for instruction, counseling, and institutional planning are presented, based on the needs and preferences of field dependent students. A bibliography and the preference questionnaire are appended. (JDS)",

The Center is sponsored by the Delaware Valley School District and operated through a contract with Northampton County Area Community College (NCACC), the nearest community college. The policies, procedures, programs and courses of NCACC apply to the Center and its director is responsible to the NCACC president, but the Center retains local control and initiative through its own Operating Board. Funding is provided by the school district, student tuition and state  reimbursement. The Center has no facilities of its own but provides a wide range of associate degree and certificate programs in liberal arts and occupational areas and non-credit adult education courses utilizing leased and borrowed facilities and part-time faculty. The Center's Cooperative Commuting College Division makes available specialized high-cost career programs through contractual arrangements with neighboring colleges in New York State.

About 68% of the withdrawees were of non-Caucasian background, compared with a non-Caucasian student body of about 79%, and 55% of the withdrawees were female, while the student body was 50% female. Of spring 1976 withdrawees, 47% had not been employed during the semester compared with a student body only one-third of which was unemployed, but 28% of the withdrawees were employed full time. About 36% of the spring 1976 withdrawees indicated they planned to transfer to a four-year college, 30% did not intend to transfer and 34%  were not sure; corresponding figures for the total student body were 69%, 11% and 19%, respectively. Almost half of the withdrawees indicated plans to return to college. Full-time employment, personal reasons, and transfer, in that order, were the most frequently cited reasons for withdrawal in each year. Nine tables of data display the demographic characteristics of withdrawees. (Author/JDS)",

        "description":"This paper reports the results of an evaluative statistical analysis of the instrument employed for student evaluation of faculty at Oakton Community College (Illinois). The analysis was performed because the locally devised instrument had never been subjected to systematic study of reliability or validity, and because a review of pertinent literature indicated a lack of consensus on what types of variables affect students' evaluations of faculty. Results suggested that the instrument failed to discriminate clearly between positive and negative aspects of course organization, faculty performance, classroom ambience, and other evaluation variables; that the positive wording used in constructing the instrument was such that faulty data might result from inculcation of a response  set; and that equal weighting was given to each item on the evaluation form, even though each item was not necessarily applicable to each instructor or class. It was recommended that Oakton define and clarify the purposes of faculty evaluation, review existing instruments in use at other institutions, select or design an instrument meeting the purposes, and pretest the chosen instrument for reliability and validity before implementation. A review of the literature, tabular data from the instrument analysis, a bibliography, and the evaluation instrument are included. (JDS)",

The program--a non-credit, individualized, programmed, laboratory experience--utilized self-defined resolution of skill deficiencies as perceived by each student, through an individual learning contract. At the conclusion of the program 25 students showed positive growth in self-concept as measured by the TSCS and all of the students indicated positive attitudes through the subjective  questionnaire. Overall, the GPA's of students improved, with the majority of returning students improving their GPA from the previous semester and the majority of new students earning an overall &quot;C&quot; grade; of the three students whose GPA's showed a decline, two had increased their course load over that of the previous semester. It was concluded that an effective basic skills program can result in measurable positive growth in self-concepts of high-risk community college students, and that the self goal-setting learning environment can set the stage for student success.

        "description":"A survey of students at Oxnard Community College (California) was conducted in order to determine whether students who had identified their major or career interests knew the psychology course requirements of their majors, and to solicit student preferences for psychology courses related to their career fields. In addition, student preferences for course offerings and scheduling were measured. A sample of 428 students completed the survey, with the results indicating that 60% of the students had an interest in career fields, and of these students, half knew the psychology requirements for their respective career fields; 18% had an interest in academic and/or other fields, of which 37% knew the psychology requirements for their majors; and 63% of the students who knew their major  or career fields selected psychology courses commensurate with these fields. It was concluded that the preferences of students for courses could be measured and that such measurement might be used as an aid in course scheduling and instructor assignments. In addition, it was felt that through more intensive counseling and a continuing effort to survey the preferences of students, Oxnard College could reduce student confusion regarding course requirements and offer a better selection of psychology classes.

        "description":"This paper reviews the rationale for community services education and the effects of different methods of financing adult education programs. Two case studies of community services financing in California are reported to illustrate different approaches toward financing permissible under state statute. The College of San Mateo finances its community services program by both local tax and user's fees, with emphasis on the latter, while Foothill College utilizes both taxes and fees, with the emphasis on the former. Both colleges' programs are essentially enrollment-driven and fee-supported, with fees set to cover the expenses of each course. Both colleges also specify lower fees for certain target populations generally found in the lowest income brackets, and scholarships are  available when necessary. Although public funding of community services has often been a source of controversy, it is argued that such community-oriented programs provide valuable services to society. It is therefore recommended that (1) the maximum community service tax should be levied; (2) fees should be established by Boards of Trustees, (3) federal aid should be sought for specific programs but state aid should not be sought lest restrictions on types of courses be imposed; and (4) scholarships should be established for community services and publicized.

The growth of total academic and occupational full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment over this period was 26.4%, with the only decline occurring in 1976. FTE enrollment declined 6.2% from 1975, from 88,538 to 83,028, and headcount enrollment declined from 151,644 to 145,962, with approximately one-third of the decreases accounted for by a revised data collection methodology. The percentage of state high school graduates entering community colleges in 1976 rose from 27.9% to 30.3%. A decline in student mobility was apparent in the decrease in transfer students and out-of-state entrants, coupled with greater student retention. After four years of continuous increase,  veteran enrollment dropped sharply in 1976, decreasing by 7,753 or 36.5%. This factor was the most significant influence on 1976 community college enrollments, affecting virtually all of the other demographic areas and accounting for a 2% decline in the number of full-time students, a decline in the average age from 29 to 28 and in the median age from 26 to 25, and a significant decline in the number of male students. Women accounted for 52.3% of enrollment in 1976 but only 44.1% in 1972. Minority enrollments increased steadily over the five year period, constituting 13.9% of total enrollment in 1976.

A survey of institutions offering similar courses elsewhere was made and pertinent literature was reviewed in order to identify appropriate means and objectives for an assessment preparation course. Summaries of the specific types of learning usually included in such courses were then prepared, organized by means of Bloom's Taxonomy, and were translated into learning objectives for  both the affective and cognitive domain.

Chapter Four discusses the simulations approach at Long Beach City College and analyzes the need for realistic, well-defined  writing situations. Chapter Five describes the classroom-tutorial approach at Tarrant County Junior College and analyzes individualization in composition instruction, and Chapter Six describes the applied communication alternative to composition at Meramec Community College and analyzes the rationale for a career-oriented alternative for those students desiring it.

        "description":"This document explores state-level involvement in the governance of postsecondary education, particularly in those states which use coordinating boards to govern their institutions. Rising enrollments and costs of the 1960's, concern with more effective resource use in the 1970's, and the influence of federal aid programs have combined to accelerate the degree of state control of local institutions. While little firm evidence exists to substantiate the value of such control, the advantages and disadvantages of increased centralization and control are strongly argued by partisans on both sides. State control is exercised through the budget process, program management, and planning--functions that are shared, albeit unequally, by the governor, the legislature, and coordinating  agencies, each with conflicting and overlapping authority and powers. The trend toward state control shows no sign of abating, and, if unchecked, it will further circumscribe the autonomy of colleges and universities. Attempts to bring about change will require accurate identification of the role of each agency of state government in the coordination/control process, agreement on essential elements of institutional and local autonomy, reversal of the trend toward increased state control or stabilization of the status quo, simplification of current state control mechanisms, and promotion of institutional autonomy within multi-unit systems.

Organizational level analyses suggested that formal participation was related to increased faculty control over course-related activities and to a somewhat less hierarchical distribution of control over managerial decisions. Generally, the relationship between formal participation and the distribution of control was not strong; additionally, formal participation was not associated with an expansion of organizational control (i.e., an increase in the  control exercised by members at all levels). Individual level analyses indicated that other factors besides the extensiveness of the participative committee structure were important in explaining members' perceptions of influence, particularly the extent to which committees were viewed as powerful by college members. Additionally, the quality of interpersonal relations was related to members' perceptions of influence. The results suggest that formal participative structures, in the absence of other power bases, may have marginal impact on the distribution of organizational control. (Author/JDS)",

The articles presented deal with alternative modes of assessing academic achievement, evaluating student readiness for further education, the use of different assessment techniques and policies for evaluating  different types of transfer students, evaluating student preparation for work and the efficacy of occupational programs, important affective and socioeconomic considerations in assessing student progress, and evaluating the college in terms of its service to the community. A review of additional pertinent literature and a bibliography are included. Contributors include: Oscar Lenning, Clifford Lunneborg, S. V. Martorana, Richard Rinehart, Brent Mack Shea, Jane Matson, and Leonard Baird. (JDS)",

        "description":"During October and November of 1975, course outlines were solicited from the sixteen Florida community colleges offering an integrated humanities course. Ten colleges provided outlines, which were subsequently reviewed in terms of the textual materials used, the teaching approach employed, and stated objectives. The review showed that all of the colleges emphasized cognitive content, and taught knowledge of &quot;great&quot; art (the aesthetics approach) or historical periods and influences (the cultural history approach) to increase the students' appreciation and improve their ability to make value judgments, on the assumption that knowledge precedes taste. All but one of the courses had behavioral objectives, but most of the objectives were directed toward development of the cognitive  domain; those dealing with affective behavior were not supported by unit objectives. Although several of the courses required students to become involved in a creative process, evaluation was too often based on the product rather than the process. Lastly, all but one of the courses focused exclusively on the humanistic achievements of Europe. It was concluded that the integrated humanities courses reviewed were less than integrated and emphasized facts at the expense of process. (JDS)",

        "description":"A study was conducted in order to determine if the success of full-time, associate degree students at Forsyth Technical Institute, as reflected by grade point average, was related to the number of hours per week that such students were employed. The fall 1976 grade point averages of random samples drawn from a population of 783 students were grouped according to the number of hours per week that the students were employed. Statistical analysis of the relationship between employment and grade point average was performed, controlling for such additional variables as year in school, years since high school graduation, sex, and selected curricula. Results indicated a relationship between grade point average and hours per week of employment only for first-year students. It was found  that those students employed 1-13, 14-26, and 40 hours or more per week had higher grades than did unemployed students. However, those employed 27-39 hours per week had lower grades than unemployed students. It was recommended that counselors be aware of both the apparent beneficial and detrimental aspects of student employment when advising entering students and other students with academic difficulty.

        "description":"This document describes a modified Delphi technique for use in establishing research needs and priorities at the institutional level. Six steps are essential to the technique: identification of needs, collection of rankings of the relative importance of the identified needs by institutional administrators, calculation of the rank of identified needs using an importance/consensus method, feedback of rankings to campus administrators, planning of actions with campus administrators, and reporting of developed plans to all administrators. The modified Delphi technique relies on individual or small group interviews during the first round of information gathering and relies on much more face-to-face interaction during later rounds of data organizing and reporting than does the  traditional Delphi technique. It is suggested that this process is both efficient and effective as a method for obtaining institutional consensus on research needs and priorities. Appended is a computational example for calculating the importance/consensus rankings for use in the modified Delphi process. (JDS)",

Students ranged in age from 18 to 50, all with previous art instruction at the high school level. After responding to questionnaires in which they offered suggestions about course planning, students were exposed to a learning module based on the systems approach and behavioral objectives which was designed to incorporate pre- and post-testing, extensive media presentations, individual teacher conferences, and independent study. Evaluation of student drawings was performed by the interacting classroom-instructor method, exposing the entire class to strategies employed by all the students in completing their  drawings. This produced positive and negative peer reinforcement, giving an opportunity for instant feedback to students and motivating a more creative classroom discussion. Results of the experiment included a higher degree of completion among students, increased class motivation, and improved quality of drawings. The document contains the objectives, resources, and explicit instructions for the replication of this instructional design. Criterion measures are appended. (RT)",

Sixty percent responded. Interviews with non-respondents showed that the academically able were more likely to respond, but that questionnaire item responses varied little. Data included demographic information, goals upon entry to the college, and current goal outcomes. Major goals were (1) graduating with an A. A. degree, (2) career training and employment, and (3) transfer to a four-year institution. Of the 53% who originally planned to graduate, 42% had earned degrees or certificates. Among career-goal students, 79% held full-time jobs, and of these, 73% reported jobs related to their college programs. These  students felt preparation was good, but college placement efforts poor. Of those intending to transfer, 76% did so, with most continuing in majors related to their community college studies. The research did not assess outcomes of the college beyond initial student aims, outside factors contributing to student success, or ask if the unemployed were seeking work. Entrance goals reported after three and one-half years may have been subject to change. The data are presented with comparative statistics to the larger state-wide study, the methodology is detailed, and the questionnaire is appended. (RT)",

Implications of Piaget's theory for the curriculum of a toddler program are discussed. The specific program developed is described in terms of guidelines for arrangement of the environment, definition of teacher roles, development of open-ended curricula, decisions concerning developmental appropriateness, and individualization of curriculum and environment. Emphasis throughout the program is on process rather than product. Approximately half the paper consists of specific activities for toddlers accompanied by developmental goals relating the activities to Piagetian concepts.  (Author/SB)",

        "description":"This paper describes the development of a simulation technique that can be used in the training of infant day care administrators and personnel. The planning of the simulation was designed as a training experience for graduate students in an early childhood education program. Students, faculty members and child care professionals from the community were asked to role play the parts of director, teacher, parent, aide, community representative and junior college representative. Participants were divided into small groups and given envelopes of &quot;in-box&quot; materials, letters and memos on specific situations and problems typically confronting day care personnel each week. In the first phase of the simulation, all participants assumed the role of the director. In the second stage the  scene shifted to a staff meeting for which different roles were assigned. The third phase was an advisory board meeting. Participants attempted to organize materials in terms of priority within each phase of the simulation and solve the most important problems. Summaries of small group discussions and consensus on topics were recorded. These records were used in an evaluation of the session, as were summary evaluations by individual participants and evaluation forms filled out at the end of group simulations. The evaluation procedure is discussed in detail, and recommendations for potential use of the simulation are made. Appendices include the background information presented to participants: a description of the simulated center, in-box materials, and the evaluation form used by  participants. (SB)",

        "description":"This study examined the contingency behaviors, attitudinal dispositions, and personality traits of male caregivers in day care settings. A random sample of 20 male caregivers was contrasted with 20 female caregivers and 20 male engineers on measures of sex-typed attitudes and personality traits. Male and female caregivers were also contrasted on their sex-typed contingency behaviors as observed with the Fagot-Patterson Checklist. Results showed that all three groups maintained that boys should be masculine but felt that girls should be equally masculine and feminine in their behavior. Both male and female caregivers reinforced children significantly more for feminine behaviors than masculine behaviors and punished masculine behaviors more than feminine behaviors. Although the  personalities of the male caregivers corresponded to the feminine direction of their female counterparts, they were not significantly more feminine than the male engineers. The female caregivers however, scored significantly more feminine in personality than the male engineers. It was concluded that the findings reported here did not confirm the flood of impressionistic reports in the educational literature which claim that males should be employed to counterbalance the &quot;feminized&quot; environment in early education.

        "description":"This paper discusses research on the effects of formal features of television programs on children's attention, comprehension, and social behavior. Formal features are defined as visual and auditory events which are not primarily a part of the content or message. Three models of the influences of form and content are discussed: (1) the observational learning model which posits that children imitate form the way they do content; (2) the satiation-habituation model which predicts that behavior which contrasts with dominant formal features should result from viewing; and (3) the general arousal model which posits that form and content combine to form a net total arousal that activates whatever behavior is cued in the situation. It is proposed that younger children and other  inexperienced viewers respond directly to the most salient features of form and, to some extent, content as isolated attention getting features, whereas older children are more interested in content themes than in formal features. A sample of 19 commercial programs was examined for action, pace, variability, visual techniques and violent content. It was found that programs appealing to preschool children have shorter segments and higher levels of action, pace, variability and special visual effects than programs designed for elementary school children. It is noted that the change in content and form of programs appealing to older children follows the developmental changes proposed in Piagetian and other developmental theories. (SB)",

The Early Childhood Setting Observation Instrument (ECSOI) provides a comprehensive matrix of categories useful in describing and analyzing adult-child interactions. Adult behavior categories included in the matrix are: reporter, manager, extender, observer and socializer. These categories are crossed in an interaction matrix with four child behavior categories: verbal pursuit, environmental pursuit, attention pursuit and passive-non-pursuit. For each category of the instrument a description of intent, a general description of the category behavior and numerous examples of behavior are included. An extended example is given of a supervision strategy  for field experiences of early childhood students which utilizes the ECSOI as the primary observation tool. Components of the supervision strategy are: (1) the development of a common language for supervisor and student to describe adult-child interactions; (2) on-site observation; and (3) individual conference and supportive feedback.

        "description":"In this study of 40 primaparous mothers (15 to 36 years of age) and their newborns the significance of predictors of maternal responsiveness was assessed immediately following birth in the delivery room and at feedings 2-3 days and 4 weeks following delivery. The variables used as predictors included the mothers' age and background, prenatal factors, the fathers' presence and responsiveness in the delivery room and neonatal characteristics as assessed by the Brazelton Neonatal Assessment Scale. The variables derived from data collected prenatally and in the immediate postpartum period were added to the analysis as they were generated. Results indicate that the father's responsiveness in the delivery room significantly predicts the mother's responsiveness immediately following  birth, and that the mother's behavior at this time predicts her responsiveness during a hospital feeding. Age as a continuous variable and the choice to have a rooming-in arrangement in the hospital significantly predicts maternal responsiveness as it was assessed 4 weeks following delivery. The variance in the predictive significance of the variables at the immediate and 4-week postpartum observation is discussed as evidence of predisposition for positive maternal behavior. Also discussed is how these findings support the Sensitive Period Hypothesis which emphasizes the importance of the amount of contact time a mother has with her infant for the development of a positive attachment.

An 18-item Likert-type scale was devised to determine a mother's confidence in child rearing. Results of the post-test measure were insignificant. However, the discussions following each lecture allowed mothers to freely express and share their fears and concerns regarding child rearing, and appeared to have a therapeutic  effect.

Cross-lagged panels were tested using correlations between viewing amount, academic grades, and effort grades. The amount-effort panel supported the causal hypothesis that increased television viewing caused lower school grades (z = -2.00, p< .05). The difference between cross-lagged correlations for effort and academic grades of 6 - 7-year-olds and effort grades of low achievers provided strongest support for the prediction. For the latter groups, two specific content categories  positively affected academic grades and two content types decreased grades. Effort grades were generally decreased by total viewing irrespective of content dimensions. (Author/SB)",

Four assessments of mothers and children were made at 12, 15, 24, and 30 months and involved audio tapes of mother and child language, children's language comprehension, observations of mother-child interaction in the home and in the laboratory, observations of children's play with toys, probes of stranger reactions, assessments of maternal play styles,  and standardized tests such as the Bayley mental scales. Extensive data on demographic and family life variables were also collected. Three types of analyses were performed: (1) comparison of treatment effects on children's behavior, (2) cross-lagged correlation of maternal behavioral patterns and subsequent child behaviors, and (3) analysis of the effects of family organization and structures on curriculum success or failure.

        "description":"In this study, developmental changes in duration of the icon (visual sensory store) were investigated with three converging tachistoscopic tasks. (1) Stimulus interuption detection (SID), a variation of the two-flash threshold method, was performed by 29 first- and 32 fifth-graders, and 32 undergraduates. Icon duration was estimated by stimulus interruption that resulted in 75% performance. Results suggest that the icon lasts longer in younger subjects. (2) Letter detection (LD), an adaptation of the Estes and Taylor detection method, estimated effective icon duration as the shortest interval between the stimulus field and noise mask that resulted in equivalent-to-unmasked performance. Data were collected over seven sessions with ten 6- to 11-year-old females. No strong relation  between age and iconic duration was apparent. (3) Judgement of cyclic stimulus disappearance, fashioned after Haber's direct method consisted of a letter matrix, alternating with a blank field. As the blank field increased in duration, the LD subjects judged when the letters seemed to disappear and when the letters seemed to remain on continuously as the blank field duration was decreased. The results indicate no strong evidence for a change in icon duration with age. Methodological issues were examined in comparing the results of the three approaches. The age difference in SID can be attributed to factors other than icon duration. The evidence favors the view that icon duration is constant across age. (Author/MS)",

Specifically, this report includes the following tabular data: public school consolidation trends revealed by statistics of 1-teacher schools and pupil transportation for the U.S. as a whole, 1918-48; number of 1-teacher schools by years specified and by states, 1918-48; percentage of 1-teacher schools in 1917-18 remaining, by years specified and by states; percentage ratios of 1-teacher schools to all public schools by years  indicated and by states, 1918-48; percentage ratios of teachers in 1-teacher schools to teachers in all public schools by years indicated and by states, 1918-48; number and percentage of all public school pupils attending 1-teacher, 2-teacher, and 3-teacher schools in certain states, 1947-48. The data presented here indicate that: of the remaining 75,000 1-teacher schools, most are small in building, enrollment, and community served; while generally the 1-teacher school is vanishing, in nearly all the northcentral prairie region it accounts for nearly 75% of that region's public schools, 25% of its teachers, and 20% of its students.

        "description":"In order to provide the Florida Migratory Child Compensatory Education Program with information required for determining whether and to what extent the educational needs of migrant children were being met by the present educational programs, eight study tasks were implemented. These tasks involved looking at the changes and characteristics of the Florida migrant population, students' needs, subgroup differences, ethnic group differences, funding resources for migrant families, program objectives, the implementation of migrant programs, and changes in needs of migrant children in 1980. The comprehensive findings provided a foundation on which to base a coordinated, multifaceted approach to the addressing of the problems of Florida's migrant students. It was recommended that these  findings be utilized as the basis for the formulation of a 5-Year Multi-Intervention Action Plan to meet the needs of children of migratory agricultural workers, and that the State Department of Education assume the major responsibility for providing the leadership for its formulation and implementation. This report presents a description of the methodology used in addressing each task and a summary of the salient findings and recommendations. Special emphasis is given to three of the tasks by providing a general overview of the needs of migrant students as a group, their needs according to subgroup classification (nonmigrant, former migrant, and current migrant), and the ethnic differences and characteristics.

        "description":"Estimates of population change and the components of change for North Carolina and its counties were made for the 1970-75 period. Attention was given to the growth patterns in the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas of North Carolina and the southern region. Data showed that the state's population grew at a faster rate during this period than it had in the previous decade due to the reversal of the state's long term pattern of net outmigration. Although more counties had relative increases higher than that for the state during 1970-75 than was the case for the previous decade (41 counties as compared with 31), most of the growth in the state's population resulted from counties with relative increases less than the average for the state. During the sixties, 70 out of 100  counties experienced net outmigration; in the 1970-75 period, only 25 counties experienced net outmigration. Growth in nonmetropolitan areas had been a manifestation of change in both urban and rural areas. The retention and attraction of people to rural areas was influenced by decentralization of manufacturing and trade, development of retirement and recreational areas, and the growth of educational institutions of various types. Also the slowing of outmigration from largely agricultural counties and from counties with relatively sizeable black populations, especially in the South, an increased awareness of the problems of cities, unemployment, and residential preferences affected the change in the pattern of regional growth.

        "description":"Too often inadequate preparation in facilitating an outdoor experience is the rule and the subsequent group experience suffers. In an organization like Outward Bound where areas are used repeatedly, an evolutionary form of reconnaissance is often adequate. However, for school groups, this form of reconnaissance is not practical since too few of them use a site on a regular basis. A high level physical reconnaissance is not necessary for a school experience due to limitations in leader experience, actual time in the field, and equipment. Yet, the information needed and the lead time required for a well planned school sponsored excursion is considerable. Therefore, a school planner might consider a team approach, using several teachers and/or students as a reconnaissance team to  accomplish a number of tasks. This group reconnaissance idea offers the farsighted innovator much more of a chance to bring about institutional change. Outward Bound tried a group reconnaissance in April 1975 with four youth leaders from Denver. These individuals were involved in an advanced reconnaissance, a total group preplanning meeting, a 4-day reconnaissance at Pawnee National Grasslands, a debriefing and future planning session, a resource guide development meeting, and a resource guide draft meeting. Included are copies of the preparation responsibilities list, tentative resources guide outline, and the project center program planning sheet. (Author/NQ)",

The three Rothman models and the community issues analyzed were: (1) the locality development model as applied to development of a county-wide comprehensive rural fire protection program; (2) the social planning model as applied to extension agents' responses to a request for assistance in exploring alternatives for establishing a county-wide human services campus; (3) the social action model of planned change as applied to provision of adequate community  services and facilities to a densely populated minority (black) neighborhood. Analysis indicated that: in the instance of rural fire protection, the role of Extension personnel ranged from emphasis on information gathering/dissemination to efforts to involve and inform a communication network; in the case of the human services campus, the primary extension involvement was fact-gathering and analyzation for decision making; in the case of service and facility provision to a low-income black community, the Extension involvement became more catalytic than directive.

The methodology employed included: interview questionnaires; investigation of similar projects; literature search; meetings with project participants, government representatives, community leaders; work sessions with other  agencies; and use of consultant architectural services. Project benefits were identified as: increased agency interaction and visibility; reduced facility duplication; increased range of services/facilities; and improved public accessibility. Proposals coming out of the study were: (1) ownership/management; financing models (county owns/tenants lease; eleemosynary or nonprofit corporation owns/tenant leases; combination ownership/tenants lease; and condominium ownership); (2) alternative development strategies (buildings arranged linearly along a pedestrian street; strong pedestrian arrangement to the west; buildings dispersed on the site; and new agencies clustered but removed from existing facilities); (3) recommendations re: campus role in the county.

Specifically, this paper asserts that Willcox school personnel hired under the Experimental Schools Program were faced with an ambiguous situation in that there was no clear distinction made between adult-centered and student-centered roles. The analysis of extensive formal and informal interviews with school people as presented here suggests that: there was a definite correlation between staff turnover and  the impact of the Experimental Schools Program; the creation of new positions for implementing federally sponsored change is no easy task, since people brought in to be change agents do not seem to be able to operate effectively without a personal tradition of pupil-centered or adult-centered &quot;world views&quot;; and the adult-centered world of administrators can more readily incorporate new people within its structures than the pupil-centered world.

Initial comments outline criteria for assessing internal and external validity of studies. Distinctions are made between research, evaluation, measurement, judgement, and public relations. The work of Rosen, Hutchinson, Scriven, and Stake is recommended as important background reading for those interested in the evaluation of Experiential Education programs. Summary of existing work is presented in five categories: (1) studies of Outward Bound programs, (2) studies of related educational programs, (3) studies of programs for urban youth and delinquents, (4) non-empirical studies, and (5) recent work. The 29 works deal with strengthening  self-image, social functioning, changing self-concept, changes in personality and values, tolerance of others, the roles of counselors, changes in the home environment, self-awareness, dropouts, organizational change, parent relationships, college ambition, race relations, value of education, recidivism rate, consequences of aggression, the American Indian world view and Outward Bound, affective goals, and student's stability.

It is suggested that the following decision making mandate would serve as a better touch stone when considering leadership in rural development: &quot;the mandate is for participation, not direction...and the message obviously not yet heard by the leaders surveyed, is that people want to be included and informed, not managed and ignored&quot;. Maintaining that &quot;powerful is not the same as competent&quot;, this paper builds the following argument: in complex matters, nobody knows and nobody can do all that is needed; therefore, edict management is  out, and since our systems today work in a way that everybody is not dependent on a few, interdependence is the key relationship; complex operations require diffuse competence, so looking for leaders may be a good deal less productive than looking for and using a variety of people with many different abilities, experiences, interests, and styles so that a system can be developed that includes all the necessary competencies; the democratic process is the best way to put together all that is needed to give good direction to development, because democracy is a good protection from the threat that some segment of society will be allowed to do the wrong things very efficiently.

Results indicated: the hypothesized model was supported by zero-order relationships; there was little empirical validity in the path analytic results; the effects of perceived constraints were not significant for either sub-sample in a comparison of the basic model for whites and nonwhites, though the coefficients were much larger for nonwhites than for whites.

Also, behavior of 75 randomly selected visitors was recorded as they proceeded through the exhibit area. Findings of this study include the following: (1) attraction to the exhibit was highest among highly educated, white, young adults; (2) this audience tended to have most of the attitudes and knowledge the exhibit was designed to impart; (3) the exhibit was most effective in terms of gain in knowledge  with the group that completed high school; (4) behavior of visitors varied, with certain displays (films, sculpture) holding a higher percentage of visitors; (5) one-third of the visitors left before \"seeing\" all of it; (6) films were rated as most liked; (7) one-fourth of posttested participants indicated willingness to do one or more specific things to improve the environment; and (8) 80% considered the exhibit experience as a positive one.

After reviewing the literature relating to chaining as a component of problem solving, the author argues that a test of chaining should be free of requirements to recall previously learned material, remember general information, or apply abstract principles. The current study used a task in which subjects were required to execute a sequence of trades. Subjects were drawn from kindergarten, third grade, sixth grade, and college populations, and were individually tested. Results indicated that college and sixth-grade students were able to solve all problems without hints. Younger students were able to solve the problems after a few trials.

Tasks devised to test for conservation of equation and function were administered, along with typical Piagetian tasks, to 72 students, aged 12, 14, and 17. Results suggest that conservation of equation, significantly more often than not, precedes formal thought, whereas conservation of function may or may not precede formal thought. Techniques used in this study can be extended to investigate conservation of abstract mathematical structure and its relationship to Piaget's present model of development. (Author)",

A sample of 50 classes came from 13 suburban high schools. The most consistent results showed that pupil and observer assessments of clarity, enthusiasm, and task orientation were important for attitudes toward mathematics. Teachers whose pupils rated them as emphasizing analysis had classes with lower attitudes on several scales. Achievement criteria were not as productive. Nevertheless, teachers rated as higher on task orientation had higher residuals on computation and comprehensive cognitive functioning levels. Teachers rated clearer had higher residuals on comprehension. Analysis correlated with teacher behaviors of probing and enthusiasm.  (Author/RH)",

Among the areas currently needing urgent and sustained attention are the following: population, world food supply, energy, materials, climate, and the environment. The fact that the problems are global in scope indicates their pervasive and fundamental character as well as the difficulty confronting them. The first chapter reviews the more familiar challenges and discusses general aspects of the newer ones. The second chapter examines several problems encompassed in the broader challenge of man's increasing power. The nature and scope of each problem is discussed, and the past and potential role of science and technology in alleviating the problem is noted. The third chapter explores the adequacy of science and technology for helping to  respond to such problems. Cancer and energy are taken as illustrative tests of the present capabilities of science and technology. The fourth chapter presents conclusions drawn from these assessments. The final chapter recommends actions and policies aimed at strengthening the scientific and technological response to present and future challenges. (Author/RH)",

The paper considers the major political effects of cybernetic and associated communications technology. These include: (1) the centralization of power in public and private spheres, (2) the shift in governmental authority from the local and state level to the federal government, and (3) the gradual elimination of free choice of housing and education for lower income people. The introduction of data acquisition and management systems, which will give us a system-management capability of substantial complexity and power, will transform America in the two social policy areas of housing and education. Technology fosters a gradual centralization of power in both the private and public spheres, and it causes a  substantial change in national policies and the national politics which support them. Ideological politics is now apparent in education in the three significant areas of racial integration, sex education curriculum, and the teaching of evolution in science courses. Parents have been unable to ignore the decisions of the schools in any of these areas. The author concludes that the major force which will shape the United States in the year 2000 is a revolution in ability to control physical and social organizations. References are included.

The original tests measured students' abilities to generalize and draw inferences from short paragraphs containing data relevant to social studies. The &quot;Social Studies Inference Test&quot; specifically measured students' ability to discriminate between various items given in the problem and to recognize the limits of the data and not over-generalize. The method used in the current research was to develop new stories from which over 200 students in grades 4-6 could draw generalizations and inferences. Strengths and weaknesses of the modified tests are listed and summary statistics on raw scores of each test instrument are reported. Results of the&quot;Social Studies Inference Test&quot; indicated that the new stories were easier for the students to understand, that the test is fairly reliable, and that the test efficiency should be upgraded. Results of the &quot;Application of Principles Test&quot; indicated fair efficiency, appropriate difficulty, but poor reliability and poor standard error of measurement. Copies of the modified test instruments are included. Additional testing, test development, and story development is recommended. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The current political conflict over school policy making is raised as a source of political learning for the young. It is hypothesized that the current politicization of educational issues influences students as never before and that this influence has great potential for re-shaping perceptions and evaluations of the political world. In the last decade a set of constituencies of the school system has challenged authority and decisions long imposed by the education profession. Each constituency focuses on a distinctive policy which it wants altered to accomodate a new distribution on resources and values. Conflicts discussed include desegregation, finance reform, teacher power, accountability, and student rights. Common features of the new school politics include the continual  power/resource struggle; centralization of authority in American government; widespread political agitation; financial problems; the political learning context of students; and the perception, judgment, and conceptualization of the political process by the young. Speculation indicates that political conflict in local schools over the last decade has provided a teaching surrogate, the salience of school issues for the young has transcended other kinds of politics, and it should have had greater effect on political learning than traditional classroom instruction. Further research on political learning among the young is needed to turn this information from speculation into data. (Author/DB)",

A total of 126 graduate and 90 undergraduate male and female subjects were assigned randomly to six treatment groups. The six groups were provided different levels of information on a continuum from no information to full disclosure of the purpose and expectations of the research. Measures were taken on a cognitive task and an affective instrument. The data among all treatment groups yielded nonsignificant differences indicating no treatment effects. This is contrary to much of the published literature.

The first section describes the distinguishing characteristics of the main elements of the functions of administration and policymaking process. The second section examines the following three models of policymaking: the elite, group, and rational models. Twelve characteristics of public policymaking are discussed including complexity, dynamic process, decision making, action promotion, future orientation, and public interest. In the last section, the integral role that social science research has played in the development of educational policy is analyzed. It is emphasized that minority communities need to be cognizant of how  policymakers use selected social science research as a basis for significant legal and policymaking decisions. Discussion focuses on the concerns minority communities have in relation to steps necessary to make educational policy more responsive to the minority community. To effect change in educational policy the minority community needs to: (1) become actively involved and knowledgeable of educational policy and its direct effect on the minority community; (2) initiate and facilitate action with and through the community and educational system; (3) maintain an open line of communication with local, state, and national representatives in government; (4) be concerned about social science research; and (5) conduct empirical research and synthesize other research.

The term educology implies a body of knowledge with scientific merit that is unique to the description and explanation of teaching-learning processes. Chapter I discusses education as a teaching-learning process, followed by presentation of qualitative, quantitative and performance examples of education in chapter II. Chapter III presents anecdotes on educology from educational literature. The relation of educology to sociology and psychology is explored in chapter IV, followed by discussion of how to produce educology in chapter V. Two types of theory models of educology are discussed: (1) mechanistic,  consisting of parts that act in predetermined ways to bring about specific effects; and (2) organismic, structured as a unit whose content and form are determined by function. Chapter VI focuses on the importance of educology in sorting out linguistic confusion in educational research. Ways of furthering educology are identified in chapter VII, including training in educational research methodology, statement of objectives in educology programs, and improved teacher education. The conclusion is that educology must have a degree program on the university level if it is to nurture and advance knowledge about education. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The study evaluates the effectiveness of a set of social studies activities in promoting cooperative interaction among junior high school students. A field experiment was designed to test three hypotheses: (1) groups which have previously worked together structure tasks more cooperatively than a newly formed group: (2) groups which have participated in curricular activities structure a given task more cooperatively than groups which have not participated; and (3) cohesiveness is greater among groups which have worked together on all curricular activities. Two experimental groups and one control group of randomly assigned 7th grade social studies students participated in five cooperative activities, involving puzzles, pantomime, and establishing game strategies. The first phase of  the study took place in regular classrooms and was videotaped. During the evaluative phase of the project, one week after completion of the first phase activities, students discussed game rules, participated in a simulation, and rated group performance. Data were collected from the initial class activities and discussion, videotapes of group processes during the simulation, and a questionnaire filled out after the simulation activity ended. Findings indicated that children do organize a cooperative strategy for carrying out activity if they perceive that cooperation provides the greatest potential rewards. However, being trained together does not increase group cohesiveness. It was concluded that cooperation can be initiated by tasks that are intrinsically interesting.  (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The book explores why nonformal education programs in Latin America fail to promote and influence desired social change. Nonformal education includes community involvement and technical training in schools after school hours, adult basic education, extension courses relating to agriculture, health, and community enterprises. The book contains seven chapters. Chapter I discusses the relationship of social policy and underdevelopment to nonformal education and suggests that different ideological perspectives of educational developers lead to inconsistencies in goal definition. Chapter II outlines relevant theoretical literature for conceptualizing education and social change. Chapters III-VI discuss nonformal education programs, including technical schools, adult education,  extension and community organization programs, and integrated development programs which combine financial aid, educational expertise, community organizations, and overall objectives. The final chapter summarizes the knowledge which has been gained from nonformal education programs. It concludes that a successful strategy for nonformal education in the future will have to combine long-term alteration in man's behavior with alteration of the social structure along lines of change-strategy principles emanating from the theoretical literature.

        "description":"The shifting political milieu which surrounded and conditioned all of Illinois' educational endeavors in the half century after 1870 is discussed. Studies of those elements of society which have influenced the development of schools have often neglected the political milieu that affects educational policy-making at the state level. The political milieu of any state plays an important role in determining the destinies of its state-supported educational institutions. Examination of the shifting relationships, objectives, and values within the Illinois government which affected its allocation process between 1870 and 1890 may provide a valuable approach to understanding the development of public education at every level. Between 1870 and 1900 the legislature was criticized for  corruption and procedural sloppiness, and the general disorderliness of its meetings did little to encourage careful consideration by merit of issues concerning state-supported education. The community centeredness of American life before the 20th century resulted in a belief in &quot;economy in government&quot; and, consequently, a slow rate of increase in state appropriations. Another significant influence on the allocation of state funds in the late 1890s was the near dictatorship in state politics by Illinois farmers. The emergence of numerous organizations beginning in the mid 1890s combined with a substantial change in the appropriation process itself to push state spending steadily upward through the first decade of the 20th century.

The hypothesis was that there are no differences in measured intelligence between ethnic and racial groups when socioeconomic factors and childhood health care are equalized. Two myths have had profound impact on black education: (1) the belief in the inherent cognitive inferiority of blacks, and (2) the belief that compensatory programs have no impact on later cognitive development of minority children. To help isolate factors that have been found most supportive for black educational achievement and upward mobility, 100 middle income black parents were interviewed. Questions centered around mobility patterns over four generations, the family structure, the kin-help network, and the sources  of educational and occupational aspiration. Findings indicated that the two factors most related to the quality of family life were the strong family support system and the desire for a supportive educational system. The conclusion was that the economic status of blacks as a group must be improved if their academic achievement is to improve. Remediation offered by groups such as Head Start will have only limited impact when compared to raising the general economic security of the family. Tables and references are included. (Author/DB)",

The term social science research is interpreted as including both educational evaluation and educational research. The history of social science research and critical issues associated with social science research and public policy formulation are discussed. A review of decision making indicates that public policy makers have sought social science input on crucial issues such as resource management from the earliest days of recorded history. Foci of the paper are: (1) the user of social science research, particularly political committees composed of local, state, and federal politicians, and the courts; (2) the producer of social science  research who fulfills roles of advocate and scholar and must deal with societal forces which act to control the direction of social science research; (3) social science research as a systematic area of inquiry in spite of its many data and implementation limitations; and (4) the demand for social science research. Recommendations to improve the quality and utilization of social science research are suggested, including examination of the advocacy role of researchers, inclusion of more women and minorities in research efforts, less reliance on linear models of analysis, and additional data usage.

Conversely, subject matter may be a means to the energizing experience. Section two cites factors and conditions which  create an energy flow within the classroom.

        "description":"Sociopolitical influences on education and research in the United States, China, and the Soviet Union are contrasted. Discussions with American scholars who have knowledge of educational practice in socialist nations are presented. The major philosophical difference stressed by these scholars is the pervasive influence of dialectical materialism on interpretation of scientific data. Institutional considerations of Soviet higher education include highly selective admission policies, financial aid, and guaranteed employment. Soviet educational research stresses qualitative detail and process complexity, although on smaller scale projects than are generally undertaken in American research. Post-revolutionary China has focused on sacrifice of traditional academic freedoms in favor of  collective interests, acceleration towards socialism and communism, and the joining of work and schooling. Investigation of Western scholarly research indicates that philosophical/political influences are present under the cover of neutrality and objectivity. The conclusion is that Western education and research will improve if graduate students study sociopolitical theory; emphasize mutual cooperation, criticism, and self-criticism; and direct their research towards socially defined goals. Financial support, employability, and a planned collective ethic are suggested as improvements in our capitalist orientation towards education and research. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The concept of community satisfaction is often discussed in sociological research on subjective social indicators. The hypothesis of this paper is that clearer understanding of the concept of community satisfaction is necessary if research measuring the concept is to be valid. The paper concentrates on three areas of concern. Section I reviews previous research efforts treating community satisfaction, beginning with the pathbreaking study by sociologist Vernon Davies in 1945. The major problem with most studies has been that they focus on the determinants of community satisfaction with little discussion of more general conceptual concerns. Section II presents a critical assessment of the term as it has been used and maintains that some researchers have not taken into  consideration how community members define their own situations. The authors argue that an understanding of the objective nature of community must precede any attempt to interpret community attitudes. Section III suggests a conceptual scheme in which community satisfaction may be understood as tri-dimensional, composed of: (1) factual knowledge to provide the descriptive content; (2) evaluative direction to suggest personal appraisal of a situation; and (3) salience to indicate the relevance of a circumstance to the actor. Additional research on the problem of relevance of community satisfaction with regard to specific issues such as school busing is recommended. References are included. (Author/DB)",

This lack of communication not only contributes to the low-prestige image of the knowledge utilization field, but also creates confusion concerning the roles of those professionals in both fields. To bridge the gap, a group of &quot;architect design specialists&quot; could fulfill the need for a new direction in educational psychology. The term &quot;architect&quot; refers to one who creatively designs answers to practical problems based upon scientific  information. Advantages to a new direction would include a more systematic classifying system, better informed teachers and personnel and the creation of a new field in educational psychology for architect-design specialists. Two charts map out the *uidelines for the use of psychology information in subject matter areas. (KC)",

FLE refers to a school program or activity aimed directly at enhancing students' understanding of personal development and family living. Results are presented in three sections: adoption of FLE by school districts, district perspectives on FLE, and classroom perspectives on FLE programs. Introduction of FLE appears to be more likely in larger school districts, districts serving highly populated areas, separate school districts, and districts with a greater number of trustees. Titles of FLE programs tend to emphasize the total moral, personal, and social development of the child. Program coordinators' advice to school boards includes keeping parents informed and  involved, sponsoring teacher workshops, and making FLE courses optional. Elementary level FLE stresses family relationships, junior high FLE explores the social and personal life of the young adolescent, and senior high FLE covers sexual content including venereal disease, birth control, and abortion. Almost all students through grade eight participate in FLE programs, but a lower proportion of secondary level students participate. Teachers consider the program to be necessary for all students, and they feel comfortable teaching it. A copy of the survey questionnaire is included. The entire report is written in parallel columns of French and English. (Author/AV)",

The Laboratory was created to study and initiate programs correlating the field of social work with that of manpower needs. Papers presented explore the major questions concerning processes in social work and manpower, collaboration and competition, and curriculum content. They are arranged in four sections. Section one focuses on the need for the mutual development of social work and manpower programs, as well as the problems, challenges, and trends anticipated by this collaboration. Section two, notes and comments, addresses several questions. Briefly considered are such questions as why social workers should be involved in  manpower, what kind of preparation is necessary, what jobs are to be done, and what is the role of social work education. The third section is devoted to curriculum development in the social work/manpower field. This section contains outlines for an interdisciplinary seminar, a master's degree program, a doctor's degree program, and the manpower components in a social work curriculum. The reports in section four consider the future by discussing challenges that must be met while urging caution in the development of new programs. Implications for the National Association for Social Workers are also discussed. (KC)",

This laboratory experiment was organized in recognition of the increasing demand for manpower specialists created by federally funded programs and of the need for unification between social workers and manpower organizations. This program performed three major functions: (1) the development of a training program in which graduate students in social work served internships in diverse community and federal manpower organizations; (2) the availability  of technical assistance to these organizations in terms of community organizing, program and staff development, and mediating; and (3) the initiation of a social work curriculum devised to familiarize the student with the world of work and with the coordination of manpower programs and social work through a new approach to field work. Six essays by students involved in the experimental field work program reflect positive results for both the students and the organizations involved in the laboratory project.

The survey was an effort to identify distinguishing characteristics of the increasing numbers of women entering engineering programs. Respondents, who included men and women, were asked to give information about family and educational background, study habits, social life and extracurricular activities, work experience, political views, personality traits, financial status, career attitudes, factors influencing choice of curriculum, and future educOtional pl;ns. The introductory narrative section of the revised edition is identical to that of ED 127 248, describing how the author selected representative groups of students and how she  weighted response data. Response data were reprogrammed due to an error in computer programming for the initial report. The result is that there are now more significant levels of difference between the responses of men and women than there were originally. The body of the report contains lists of comparative response data for each of the 230 questions on the survey. Significance of difference is indicated where there is none, where it is at the five percent level, and where it is at the one percent level. (AV)",

The report documents the activities of the White House, OMB, the Federal Regional Councils, and the Federal Executive Boards. Housing, school desegregation, business enterprises, and federal grants in relation to the prominent minority groups are investigated. The administration's failure to enforce Federal civil rights legislation during 1972-76 is attributed to the executive branch of government. This branch failed to provide policymakers with effective means to discover the nature of problems or to suggest ways to implement corrective action. In the belief that executive direction is  indispensable to civil rights legislation, it is recommended that the President assume responsibility for Federal civil rights enforcement programs and that a cabinent-level position be created whose role would be to strengthen enforcement programs. It is also recommended that a Division of Civil Rights within the OMB be established. (KC)",

        "description":"The paper analyzes how the attempt to assimilate ethnic groups into American society has contributed to social, economic, and political inequality. The hypothesis is that the official model of classical sociology has blinded us to a vast range of social phenomena which must be understood if we are to cope with the problems of contemporary America. While not often explicit, the American ideal that ethnic groups should be incorporated into the melting pot has created a society in which many observable forms of inequality are perpetrated. This stratification analysis extends the concept of poverty beyond the narrow limits of income to include political and personal relations. Among issues addressed are immigrant history, social acceptance, power and elitist vs. minority perspectives  on education, religion, opportunity, and self-concept. A theory of ethnicity is advanced which explains ethnic identification as an integration of belongingness, self-esteem, the need for community relationships, symbolic interaction, and human understanding. The conclusion is that the ultimate aim of social policy in a democracy is to eliminate various forms of institutionalized inequalities rather than ethnicity, which is a basic right.

        "description":"The author discusses the acculturation process of first, second, and third generation Italian families in the United States in terms of the interrelationships among cultural, social, and psychological events. As background to the discussion, the role of the family is described. In southern Italy, the nuclear family is the essential feature of the social system. It is dominated by an authoritarian father, godparents are very significant figures, male children are social and economic assets, and female children are protected socially. Family relationships give the individual status and a guarantee of security. Upon immigration to America, however, Italian values conflict with Anglo-American orientations toward individualism and mastery over nature. Alienation and other  psychological crises arise because of the immigrants' familistic personality orientation. In first-generation families, intercultural and intergenerational conflict and changes occur, often marked by isolation and anomie. Most second-generation families exhibit a move toward shaping the structure and functions of the family in accordance with the contemporary urban American type of family. Third-generation families show even more influence of industrialization and urbanization on fertility, child rearing, class status, and occupational choice. (AV)",

NAEP organized skill exercise items around two subthemes: (1) obtaining information, including raising questions, seeking answers, identifying sources of information, and using standard reference sources and aids in locating information; and (2) interpreting graphs and maps, and using a variety of nontraditional sources of information. The paper contains selected released exercises developed to carry out assessment of the two categories. These skill exercises include multiple-choice tests, short essays, and longer essay-type written oral responses. Exercises are based on questions involving explanation of the human condition,  insight into human affairs based on historical, philosophical, or literary information, and factual knowledge of events in American history. Findings indicated that respondents perform better on the items for obtaining information than on items dealing with interpreting information. It is concluded that NAEP results should be utilized as information sources for educators in setting curriculum norms rather than accepted as curriculum norms themselves. The NAEP social studies objectives for 1971-72 are presented in the appendix.

        "description":"Black student alienation in liberal arts colleges is discussed. A study was conducted of eight four-year liberal arts colleges in the Midwest. Respondents included 267 black students, nearly 60% of all black students enrolled. A standard alienation scale measured feelings of powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, cultural estrangement, social estrangement, and estrangement from work. Results showed a high degree of normlessness contrasted with low overall powerlessness. This suggests that black students believe opportunities for advancement do exist, but not within the prevailing normative structure. Other results showed high social estrangement in black females living on campus, students from the suburbs living on campus, and nursing majors. This lack of integration  probably stems from the ethnocentric nature of the institutions. Changes are recommended in terms of recruitment of more black and other minority students and faculty, a strong black student association headed by a black student advisor, well-developed black studies programs, tutoring services for inadequately prepared black freshmen, and a faculty committee on minority education. Although drastic institutional change might harm its relationship with its founding and sustaining ethnic group, certain actions need to be taken toward proper integration. (AV)",

A sample of 1485 readers of &quot;Barrister Magazine&quot; participated in the study. Lawyers responding to the survey valued specialization both as a means for providing better legal services and as an attractive feature for lawyers. With regard to the structure of specialization programs, responding lawyers showed a strong preference for programs of certification rather than self-designation. Most responding lawyers would require attendance at continuing legal education courses and some form of screening process to determine which lawyers should be recognized as specialists. Despite general support for specialization programs,  nonspecialists, new lawyers, and lawyers practicing in small offices indicated concern that specialization programs would adversely affect their own practice. The questionnaire responses also showed strong support for relicensing programs and for mandatory continuing education courses as an appropriate vehicle for improving the quality of legal practice. Survey questions and their results by specialty status, location, length of practice, and size of office are presented and discussed in tables which conclude the study. (Author/DB)",

The outgrowth of a program of international inquiries by scholars over a period of several years, the monograph documents value dimensions of cultural relations in Japan, India, Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and The United States. The essay is presented in six chapters. A new humanistic viewpoint which recognizes values as a basic cultural theme is described in chapter I. Chapter II focuses on prominent features of modern society which provide opportunities for restructuring human relationships  through value conflicts. Chapter III describes a meaningful life today as one which attempts to restructure human institutions by mutual human, social, and economic endeavors. A humane outlook is identified as the source of meaningful living in chapter IV, followed by identification of promising recent humanistic innovations and suggestions for improving international humanistic relationships, including professional exchanges, improved humanities education, international philanthropy, technological advancement in developing nations, and community development by transnational corporations.

The role of amateur writers is discussed and popular works of Chinese children's literature are summarized. The author also contrasts content and objectives of children's literature in China and the United States. Chinese teaching style, which emphasizes political education, publicizes models for emulation and fosters the ideology of collectivism. The American teaching style publicizes creativity, individual worth and gain, and fosters the ideology of capitalism. Eight stories for Chinese children are identified and summarized. All stress the children's contribution to protecting collective property  and fighting against imperialism. The books are very inexpensive and are therefore accessible to the working class. In local communities, individual storytellers often become well known for helping to instill proper political and moral values. Books and storytellers both illustrate a basic belief, stemming from Mao's ideas, that influencing and shaping attitudes is by far the most important task of teachers and schools. (Author/AV)",

        "author":["Morrison, Linda"],
        "description":"The controversy surrounding the Chinese film &quot;Pioneers&quot; is analyzed and presented as a case study of a film caught in the recent two-line struggle in literature and art in the People's Republic of China. Within the history of the arts in China, there has been a difference of opinion between those in favor of the continued portrayal of bourgeois themes and those who believe in the exclusive depiction of the struggles of the worker. Those two opposing views have come to be called the two-line struggle in literature and art. &quot;Pioneers&quot; is a feature length film documenting the successful establishment of a model revolutionary industrial community near Siberia. It was filmed in the early 1970s at the suggestion of Premier Chou En-lai. However, upon its completion in 1975, its release  was banned by Chiang Ch'ing, Mao's wife, whom he had made overseer of all fine arts productions. She condemned the film for glorifying the achievements of specific individuals. Mao disagreed with her decision, but she persisted in keeping the film and its producers under surveillance. Since the arrest of Chiang Ch'ing in October 1976, Mao's successor has allowed the film to be released. Perhaps this indicates his support of Chou En-lai and Mao or perhaps he sees no serious errors in revolutionary thought in the film's content. (Author/AV)",

Biographies are valuable for building reading skills, background of a subject, or personal development. These biographies are appealing to young people on the basis of subject interest, reading level, depth of detail, and writing style. Suitability for junior high students is indicated where it is appropriate. Impact of sexism is evident in the lack of references to women in the fields of business and science. Ethnic group representation is good for Blacks but less comprehensive for Oriental, Jewish, Mexican-American, and American Indian women.

The 63 individual biographies comprise the main section of the document. Provided are title, author, publisher, date, length, and extensive annotations. A range of women, interests, and life styles are included, such as Marie Curie, Billie Jean King, Elizabeth Blackwell (first woman doctor), Mahalia Jackson, Golda Meir, Eleanor Roosevelt, and a 15-year-old girl stricken with cancer.

The assessment was conducted during 1974-75 with groups of nine-, 13-, and 17-year-olds. This report examines four design and drawing exercises that measure art-production activities. Art production objectives include ability to (1) produce original works of art, (2) express visual ideas fluently, (3) produce works of art with a particular expressive content, and (4) demonstrate application of media and forming processes. This report contains comparative score tables of the three age groups accompanied by drawings which were judged to be acceptable, unacceptable, or above average. The exercises involved drawing people  seated at a table as seen from one end, a bedroom wall which incorporates a door, and three children at a playground at various distances from the viewer. In another drawing exercise, students were asked to show motion by using parts of the human anatomy or expressive devices. Techniques included foreshortening, overlapping, tilted planes, and point perspective. Results showed similar scores in males and females, lower scores in blacks and low-metropolitan students, and greatest increases in achievement between the ages of nine and 13. Original plans for comprehensive assessment of art education were curtailed in 1973 by budgetary changes. Additional exercises will be included in the 1978-79 art assessment program.

        "description":"The author purports the need to treat moral education as a serious academic subject and suggests ways educators can manage it in an intellectually defensible way. Ethical education must avoid indoctrination, yet it should not be a mere training in philosophical ethics. The domain of moral education should include four partially interdependent goals. The goals are (1) to teach children what are and are not moral phenomena, (2) to teach children the role of morality in the development of the personality and in the organization of society, (3) to help children to become aware of their own values, and (4) to train children to consider the moral consequences of their own actions. These goals must then be adapted to the kinds of issues most relevant at the particular point in the  child's life. Much research remains to be done in the field of moral instruction. Most crucial is the area of early education programs for &quot;disadvantaged&quot; children, which would be directed toward moral, as distinguished from cognitive, education. Other vital areas for future research are: the design of measures of moral development both reliable and sensitive to change; the instruction of teenagers, as potential parents, in how to teach moral education themselves; the establishment of criteria for selection of teachers of moral education; and the instruction of these teachers in how to teach it.

The program is intended for junior high school students. Several major existing theoretical positions on moral education and values education are briefly described, followed by an explanation of how SEA is distinct from them. SEA's uniqueness rests on the program's emphasis on behavior. The objective is to teach a process for acting ethically and to help students internalize the process so that they consciously use it in daily life. This objective is accomplished through skill training which stresses identification of component skills and  emphasizes behavioral outcomes. The six-step strategy employed by the materials is outlined. It combines ethical decision making, action consistent with self-held values, and evaluation. Instructional design of the four units is described next. The units exhibit a progression in complexity from simulation to active assertion of values, and from a sense of personal friends to regard for others beyond the personal sphere. Final sections discuss reading level and remedial activities, explain how SEA relates to other curriculum, and provide an annotated bibliography of six relevant books. (Author/AV)",

Maintaining that the works of historical revisionists must be critically analyzed and their inadequacies recognized if they are to have lasting value, the author presents a textual criticism of a recent work which contains all of the complaints which conservative scholars generally level against works by revisionists. The book, by Columbia education professor Diane Ravitch, is entitled &quot;The Revisionists Revised: Studies in the Historiography of American Education.&quot; The review describes Ravitch's technique as one which discovers presumed errors in the works of revisionist authors and attempts to discredit them on grounds of poor scholarship  and/or incorrect interpretation. The author maintains that Ravitch clouds issues raised by revisionists by refusing to recognize contributions made by progressive writers on social and occupational mobility, IQ scores, capitalist imperatives, racism, access to higher education, and class analysis. The conclusion is that Ravitch's critique is obscurationist, constitutes a political attack on the revisionists is not in the spirit of academic freedom of inquiry, and is reactionary rhetoric rather than collegial criticism.

A number of kinds of oral history are discussed, such as folk telling, family interviews, social history, and sound portraits. Program staff interview a variety of individuals, including a 92-year-old pioneer from South Dakota, an author of an oral history of Jews in the South, a folksinger who finds oral history in songs about slavery, a native American whose French great-grandfather joined an Indian tribe, and an author of a book about attitudes of working class women. The transcript combines excerpts of interviews with these people with analytical remarks about the nature of oral history. Among the comments are that  conventionally documented history represents only the well-educated sector of a population, whereas oral history allows any individual to express himself in a culture where one of the most oppressing sensations is being anonymous. Oral stories about one's past or one's family may not be entirely accurate or true, but the process of interviewing and talking is good because it promotes a personal interaction among the participants and it reawakens pride in one's ethnic background.

On the district level, a majority of 345 art education supervisors noted a stable employment, financial, and instructional materials situation. Most frequently mentioned obstacles to art education on the district level were lack of commitment to the arts as an educational priority, and lack of money, time, personnel, and space for art instruction. On  the state level, approximately 30% of the 52 state and territorial respondents observed an increase in art education personnel within their state. It was concluded that additional research of a broader and more sophisticated nature is necessary, a symposium concerning the improvements of the image and the visibility of art education must be undertaken, and further dialogue between people concerned with art in American education letters are presented in the appendix.

A major purpose was to determine whether a gap exists between the needs of schools and supply of adequate leaders. It was hypothesized that lack of progress in the arts in schools could be attributed to inadequate leadership. Four groups of professional educators were asked to respond to questionnaires related to their specific expertise: (1) state department art consultants were querried as to exemplar programs, (2) curriculum leaders were asked about their graduate course work in art education and about the number of K-12 students served in their district, (3) professors of curriculum and supervision were asked to provide information about art in undergraduate education, and (4)  professors of educational administration were asked to describe the role of art education on the graduate level. Findings indicated that opportunities exist for art educators to experience aesthetic education on the graduate level, students are not encouraged by their professors to seek experience in aesthetic education, there is a need for greater dialogue among educators, and leadership programs should be developed for administrators and arts educators. It was concluded that there is a need for graduate level programs stressing the role and importance of the arts and that more time, money, and effective planning is needed. (Author/DB)",

The guide, presented in six sections, begins by defining the political system, legitimacy, decision-making, law, institutions, interdependence, and citizenship as basic political science concepts. In section II, the main components of citizenship education are identified as awareness of the functions of government and politics and student responsibility for determining policies  important to their daily lives. Section IV lists six goals (descriptors) of political understanding as ethical responsibility, inquiry, political knowledge, school environment, larger community, and history. These descriptors are further broken down in section V into knowledge and awarenesses that students should master. Section VI suggests 25 themes as areas for study and lists concepts as appropriate for study in grades K-3, 4-6, or 7-12.

Because 80% of the population lives in a rural agricultural setting, and because most doctors and medical services are located in cities, there is a serious need for medical personnel in the rural areas of the country. After Chairman Mao declared in 1965 that emphasis in medical and health work should be stressed in rural areas, preparation of &quot;barefoot doctors&quot; began. They are selected by fellow commune workers on the basis of intelligence, educational level, desire to become doctors, and will to serve the commune. They can be of any age or sex. All undergo three to six months formal training in either a  commune hospital, agricultural college, or medical college. This is followed by on the job training. Courses include anatomy, physiology, pathology, acupuncture, and medicinal herbs. Basic responsibilities are environmental sanitation and preventive medicine. They supervise collection, treatment, storage, and use of human excrement for fertilizer; spraying of pesticides; and storage of drinking water. They dispense first aid, immunizations, and health examinations; and decide when a person should be sent to the commune hospital. (Author/AV)",

In the spring of 1977, kinesiology graduate and undergraduate students at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro and 60 local fifth-grade students carried out a kinesiology carnival at the campus school. The major goals of the carnival were to present kinesiological principles of human movement in new and exciting ways to elementary school children, to encourage the development of critical and creative skills in both the children and the college students, and to provide the physical education majors with a first-hand experience in working with elementary school pupils. Prior to the carnival, the university students were  divided into six groups for the preparation of six separate stations, each of which would employ a planned multimedia presentation of a kinesthetic principle. The students were encouraged to explore various teaching methods and resources in preparing these presentations. On carnival day, the elementary students (in groups of ten) visited one station at a time, rotating through the gym until all stations had been covered. Evaluation procedures were undertaken at the conclusion of the carnival. The carnival was found to be an effective, low-cost tool for providing direct experiential learning of both content and communication skills for undergraduate and graduate physical education majors.

Objectives outlined for the teacher are: (1) to be able to distinguish between broad goals and instructional objectives; (2) to be able to identify the characteristics of an instructional objective; (3) to be able to describe the general categories of instructional objectives; and (4) to be able to write instructional objectives precisely. The teacher should be prepared in an instruction session to clearly identify what each student is expected to do and the limits of what should be accomplished. An understanding that the learning process consists not only of intellectual activity but also physical activity (sight, touch, etc.) is important in teaching  successfully. It is also essential that the teacher encourage enthusiasm and interests in the student so learning will be pursued beyond the classroom. At the conclusion of this guide, a competency check is presented for the teacher to assess his/her knowledge of the objective originally outlined at the beginning of the paper. (JD)",

The problems identified--(1) improvement in the quality of education, (2) provision of life-long learning experiences, and (3) improvement in the quality of life--create a demand on formal education probably impossible to meet under existing conditions. The direction of responses to these challenges, and often the possibility of coming up with a solution, depends upon the view one takes of the problem--e.g., strictly economic, &quot;basics only,&quot; alternative schools, etc. A systemic perspective, however, encompasses a macro-system view of education, directed toward identifying its  components and interrelationships, thereby clarifying key entities around which the system should be organized. At the center of the system is the individual learner, and around this learner exist various domains facilitating his/her development: (1) the primary social system (family, peers, friends); (2) the formal educational system (various schools); (3) community educational systems (churches, agencies, cultural groups); (4) the communications system (press, TV, radio libraries); (5) the work system (public and private employment); and (6) ad hoc learning systems. A societal-level organization of these domains through informal and formal interorganizational arrangements would result in a manifold increase in educational potential, thus raising the possibility of solutions to existing  educational challenges.

The curriculum contains modules set up for curriculum, field experience, microteaching, and learning centers. The learning experience of the students over the past five years in which CBTE has been in  effect has seemed to justify this method of teacher education.

The first section outlines the rationale for the study and defines its particular thrust. The main intention of the survey is to describe and define the tasks and requisite skills of early childhood teachers in supporting families in the care and education of their children. Part two details the issues most relevant to a definition of teacher competence: (1) the purpose of early childhood programs, (2) the environments of center-based programs, (3) the roles of the teacher, and (4) a review of the nature and quality of research into teacher behavior. The third section details the methods of observation of teachers, the criteria upon which opinions were based and analysis of  teacher behaviors in not only classroom situations but also in interaction with parents. The tasks and competence of the early childhood teacher are discussed in detail in the fourth section. These are divided into three major catagories: (1) design and implementation of program -- ability to relate the use of time, space and activities to the developmental levels, learning abilities, and individual characteristics of children; (2) personal competence -- ability to serve as an effective model of behavior for children and other adults; (3) interpersonal competence -- ability to facilitate the child's mastery and satisfaction in interactions with physical environment, peers and adults. In section five the implications of the survey are discussed, and section six contains recommendations for  improvement in the field. (JD)",

The third problem concerns power measurement and its quantification, and its interpretation as a possession or a relationship. The final problem concerns the phenomenon  of change and fluctation in power configurations. The importance of power analysis in studying and understanding the forces controlling schools is stressed.

The experiment was conducted as follows: Selected male and female subjects were given the task of following a blind maze with a stylus. They were tested in performance under three different circumstances, alone, with a coactor, and with an observer. It was hypothesized that the presence of an observer (audience) or coactors would increased an individual's generalized drive which would enhance the emission of the most dominant motor response (either correct or incorrect). The distraction of intermittant noise was added during testing. The noise condition was surprisingly ineffective in producing an effect on performance. Relative to an alone-control  condition, the social and physical stress conditions increased subjects' error rate during the incorrect-response phase and decreased errors during the correct-response phase of the experiment. The results of this study demonstrated the response pattern predicted by the hypothesis. A distinct difference between the sexes was noted, with women more significantly affected by coaction than men and making more errors under this condition. (JD)",

Two male subjects were observed under six randomly ordered conditions. The duration of index finger oscillation to exhaustion, paced at 1.2Hz., was observed on separate days immediately, 5, 10, and 15 minutes following cuff application, and after kinesthetic sense loss (KSL). A control condition observed only reflex responses to sudden flexions and extensions of the relaxed finger at the above times during a single cuff application with no active movement. These reflex responses were also observed before cuff application and following movement on other days. Finger movement persisted for two or more  minutes at each interval before KSL, and just under one minute following KSL. Reflexes appeared uninfluenced by cuff application without movement. Following movement during cuff application, reflexes were not found beyond the ten-minute observation. These findings indicate reduced but experimentally useful movement capability following KSL provided the subject rests. The alteration of muscle spindle function following movement before KSL is relevant to studies using INB to study the role of proprioception in skilled movement. (Author)",

The sample for the study consisted of fifty-eight secondary school student teachers in suburban schools and twenty-seven secondary student teachers in inner-city schools. Subjects were administered the Pupil Control Ideology Inventory Questionnaire during prestudent teaching orientation and again during the last week of student teaching. Survey results indicate that student teachers tend to  enter student teaching with an idealistic and sometimes erroneous concept of what is involved regarding discipline maintenance in the classroom, thus undergoing a marked change toward more dominant classroom control forms as the experience progresses. The more stringent screening process for student teachers in inner-city schools appears to account in part for the finding that these student teachers are more custodial before they begin student teaching than are suburban student teachers after they complete student teaching.

Models remained general descriptions until control theory introduced explicit system analyses. Cybernetic models emphasize feedback and adaptivity but give little attention to creativity. Research on artificial intelligence and transformational grammar indicates the importance of generative processes in intelligence systems. A model, Generative Model of the Teaching-Learning Process (GENTL), expands the early Test-Operate-Test-Exit (TOTE) unit into a monitor and three subsystems--designer, executor, and adaptor--each isomorphic with the overall system, thereby permitting recursion of generic functions. Such a model has support in TLP literature  and suggests a generative approach to teacher training. (Author)",

The position under attack is that teachers themselves, no matter how progressive, are a part of the social hierarchy and impose middle class values on children, thus perpetuating the system. They are, in brief, one of the &quot;enemy&quot; to the true radical. The argument is made that it is desirable to join progressive teachers with marxists through active trade unions, using the best potential of all to change the system. An association of the practice-oriented progressive teacher with the theory-oriented socialist will help resolve the gap of understanding between the two and aid in the development of a socialist, revolutionary, educational praxis.

        "description":"This document cautions against high expectations on the part of educators for rapid cognitive growth during middle school years--and urges a rethinking of curricular structure for those years--based upon neurological data concerning brain growth patterns. Empirical research (case studies, autopsy studies, cadaver research) conducted by Epstein has borne out that brain growth is found to be consistent with two components: (1) increase in body size and (2) a set of five descrete periods of growth occurring in the age intervals three-ten months, two-four years, six-eight years, ten-twelve years, and fourteen-sixteen years. In approximately eighty-five percent of all youngsters, brain growth ceases between ages twelve-fourteen. Predictions concerning abilities for cognitive growth  potential in the period two-four years and six-eight years are borne out by the fact that Head Start programs, conducted in the four-six year period, are generally much less successful than programs conducted during either the earlier or later period. Extrapolating these results to the middle school years, and recognizing the need for further study, the argument is made for concentration upon reinforcement of existing cognitive skills and reinforcement of psychomotor, affective, and self-concept development, rather than upon cognitive growth. Concentration in these areas would better prepare the transescent child for the next spurt in brain growth and cognitive growth potential. (MB)",

Immediately following the session, feedback in the form of discussion, consultation, and viewing of the tape helps the participant to single out basic skills in communicating that are in need of improvement. Eight particular skills are identified as being of prime importance for a supervisor to possess in dealing with teachers. (1) attending behavior -- demonstrating interest and listening attentively; (2) leading -- inviting verbal expression and opening lines of communication; (3) focusing -- isolating the important points under discussion and keeping them upper-most in the conversation; (4) questioning -- asking questions that will elicit the most response and encourage further understanding; (5) clarifying -- understanding the perceptions of a situation and another's point of view; (6) reflecting feeling -- sympathetic understanding of problems; (7) respecting -- displaying a positive regard for the other person; and (8) summarizing -- clearly reviewing the conversation illustrating a complete understanding of the situation under discussion.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to assess Welford's dual controlling factor interpretation of Fitts' Law--describing movement time as being a linear function of movement distance (or amplitude) and the required precision of the movement (or target width). Welford's amplification of the theory postulates that two separate processes ought to be distinguished, a faster one concerned with distance covering and a slower one for homing onto the target. Twenty subjects, all scuba divers, were required to perform a reciprocal tapping task. In an attempt to separate the two factors, the subjects were tested on land and underwater. This did not change the basic parameters of the task but did put the subjects under informational stress in that underwater the movement was less ballistic in  nature and, therefore, would require the processing of more information (feedback) in order to complete the task. The land data appeared to support Fitts in that the contributions of movement amplitude and precision were approximately equal. However, the relative changes in contribution of these factors to movement time underwater suggests that these parameters do in fact represent separate controlling factors. (Author/MB)",

The analysis of the data demonstrated: (a) the competition, initial ability level, and social reinforcement factors did not interact with one another; (b) social reinforcement (reproof) facilitated performance, while competition had no effect; (c) competition hindered learning in later performance; and (d) the competition groups had a greater tonic heart rate (increase from basal) than the noncompetitive group. The results of the study suggest that social factors (i.e., social reinforcement, competition) have a greater effect in later performance after  some initial learning of the perceptual motor skill has occurred.

The subjects for the research were 30 women. Initial tests consisted of measuring the electromyographic response of the frontalis muscle of the forehead to stress. After the test procedures were completed, training sessions were conducted. BF subjects were instructed to use a feedback tone as a guide for relaxation. PMR subjects heard progressive relaxation instructions that were modified so that the majority of the training instructions were directed specifically to the frontalis muscle. The group of subjects receiving placebo training listened to a short, taped presentation on the benefits of relaxation  after which they heard music that fluctuated in volume and tempo. Results showed that both BF and PMR training reduced resting electromyography significantly more than the placebo-control procedure. BF subjects had significantly greater reductions following training than either the PMR or control groups. (JD)",

Twenty specific suggestions are made to guide the advisor in performing the task of helping teachers adjust to new situations and different approaches or methods of teaching. Two vital points are made on the subject of handling changing situations. First, imposed change, whether from outside the system or from outside the classroom, is seldom effective or enduring. Real growth arises from the needs and aspirations of individual teachers and administrators, supported by and responsive to the community they serve. Second, persons serving in advisory roles can facilitate change only if they are available to work with school staffs and their right to be there is  clearly established by the school system. A relationship of trust and mutual support between teachers and advisors is the key to successful change. (JD)",

The presence of a parent observer during practice was hypothesized to exert a depressing effect on learning and a facilitating effect on performance when parent observer was introduced later in practice. Male and female children age 6 to 10 years were randomly assigned to two groups. In the parent-present-early group, four 25-second trials on a stabilometer were given with a parent present as a passive observer. An additional 4 trials were given after the parent left the testing area. The parent-present-late group was tested in the same way except the parent was absent during the first 4 trials and passively observed during the last 4 trials. Analysis indicated no  significant differences between the parent-present-early and the parent-present-late conditions for the learning trials and the performance trials. Analysis of the final two performance trials revealed that children performing without a parent observer were significantly superior to those performing in the presence of a parent. (Author/JD)",

Tanzania's new educational policy demands that the educational effort be directed at the needs of the society, the nation and of the majority of the pupils: that the school be integrated with the community; and that it also identify itself with current national struggles. Furthermore, the policy requires that values such as cooperation, respect for human dignity and equality be inculcated in the students; and that education be integrated with production-that is, schools should be economic, as well as educational communities. Evaluation is regarded as an integral  part of curriculum development, particularly at Tanzania's current stage of development when the philosophy, the concept, the purpose; and the content of education is radically different from the previous system. The results of evaluation are essential to determining the effectiveness of (1) instructional materials and methods in achieving specified objectives; (2) teacher education programs; (3) integrating school and community; (4) integrating education and production; and (5) assessing the impact of educational programs on popular attitudes toward education and social policy.

(3) Construction of situations in which the student will be required or expected to demonstrate desired ways of behaving. (4) Determination of the criteria that will be used to assess the value, correctness, or desirability of the behavior elicited. (5) Administration of the measuring instrument--the tests, rating scales, situational performance tests, etc. (6) Scoring the responses elicited by the measuring instruments. (7) Judging the degree to which the scores obtained by the students reflect achievement of the educational  activity. The author warns that misunderstandings about the function of evaluation arise from the failure to distinguish between summative and formative evaluation. The former comes at the end of an educational activity or project, while the latter occurs continually during the activity or project, with the aim of providing feedback to ensure that the appropriate aims and objectives are being met.

Work completed in the development and validation of the Self Observation Scales (SOS) Primary Level (Stenner and Katzenmeyer, 1973) serves to illustrate one method of establishing structural integrity. The name of each scale of the SOS is a construct: an abbreviated thesis about the nature of the underlying variable which determines the configuration of indicants (questions) comprising the scale. SOS constructs (self acceptance, social maturity, school affiliation, and self security) are analyzed for different student groups. Traditional psychometrics assumes that the same questions measure the same underlying variables in all respondents; the validity of interperson  and intergroup comparisons rests on this assumption. However, ample evidence suggests that this assumption is frequently in error. Procedures outlined in this paper provide a method for assessing the validity of this assumption, and a basis for developing reliable and valid instruments. (Author/MV)",

An analysis of the achievement and intelligence test scores in a small, upper middle class, New Jersey elementary school district showed an overall increase in achievement and intelligence test scores. This trend reversal was interpreted as being primarily due to the introduction in 1972 of an Individually Guided Education (IGE) program in the 3 elementary schools of the district. (Author/MV)",

Predictive criterion-related validation studies are difficult to develop, time consuming, impractical and expensive. Since training and knowledge variables are not necessarily sufficient to predict job proficiency, it appears logical to look to performance testing for solutions to the problems of validating and revising licensure exams more effectively. Four areas in which there are differences in practice across differing licensure examinations: (1) the type of test, (2) the type of controls involved in the testing process, (3) the kind of evidence utilized in the entry decision, and (4) the range of authority and the degree to which the examination provides a right to  practice are discussed in Part II. Differences in practices across these four areas appear to be directed toward differential control of three primary sources of malpractice--absence of entry level professional skills, absence of adequate behavior patterns to cope with the pressures of professional practice and absence of adequate updating of professional practice.

Regretably, much of the research to date has been poorly done and hence has led to few changes. The purpose of this research was to overcome many of the past deficiencies and provide a comprehensive study of faculty and students' views concerning the uses of grading in several instructional settings, and the appropriateness of a variety of commonly used grading systems for accomplishing intended uses of grades. Specifically, faculty and students' views on: (1) The importance of twelve possible uses of grades in different instructional settings (courses in students' major  area of concentration versus non-major areas of concentration); (2) The acceptability of each of the five common grading systems for accomplishing twelve possible uses of grades; and (3) The effects of each of five common grading systems on a variety of course outcomes (for example, maintaining academic standards and maximizing amount of learning). Overall, the results strongly support the belief that faculty and students are in favor of a criterion-referenced grading system. While the results cannot be generalized to other institutions, several innovations in the research design should provide guidelines for researchers to enable them to conduct better studies on grading in their own institutions.

Validation of these two uses of interest inventories requires different treatments of criterion group base rates.

Scale distributions are highly similar for males and females, as evidenced by a median overlap of 92  percent. The goal was achieved with no loss in the technical quality of the instrument. The median coefficient alpha reliability estimates for the six scales assessing Holland types is .87.

This test, known as the Test of Language Dominance, was simultaneously developed in English, Navajo, Spanish, Yupik and Zuni. Items which did not indicate satisfactory statistical rigor during the pilot test phase were removed or modified. The test is divided into Part I (receptive verbal ability) and Part II (expressive verbal ability). Part I, which features progressive item difficulty, is group-administered to children who respond by marking one picture out of the four  which the administrator describes. Part II is individually administered with each student naming as many things as he can in a given domain in one minute. The test must be administered by a person fluent in both of the languages being assessed. Standardized directions are provided; and scoring is objective and extremely simple. In pilot testing, run with over 1000 students, test reliability was .75 in English and .94 in other languages. The validated version of the TOLD has now been translated into 15 additional languages.

The underlying assumption in this turn of events is that results generated by criterion referenced tests within the statewide assessment context permit the drawing of value inferences about the effectiveness of the educational curricula under study. The tenability of this assumption is examined in light of rigorous requirements for test construction and validation. The extent to which the test construction steps can be followed closely to yield a content valid test determines the extent to which the tests can be justifiably used to evaluate the curricula or programs under study. In summary, it is to be concluded that the content validity  of measuring instruments must be carefully established in order to ensure meaningful and defensible decision making. The risk involved in using an invalid test must be judged in terms of the costs (psychological, financial, etc.) attendant on making erroneous decisions in a given situation. (MV)",

        "description":"In the evaluation of Project Information Packages (PIPs), a content analysis was performed to detect congruence between items in a norm-referenced test and the content in six exemplary compensatory education program curricula. Gains on congruent items were used to assess the effectiveness of the programs. Preliminary results show that the amount of congruence was too small to make strong inferences, but that gains on congruent items were slightly higher in well-implemented programs. The procedures can be easily replicated for evaluations which require that gains on norm-referenced tests be the major criteria for success. (Author)",

        "description":"Three hundred-fifty-two standardized tests of reading comprehension and 373 standardized vocabulary measures were analyzed in terms of a number of criteria related to psychometric quality and educational ability. The criteria were based primarily on the Standards for Educational and Psychological Tests developed by the American Psychological Association, the American Educational Research Association, and the National Council on Measurement in Education, and the MEAN test evaluation system developed by the Center for the Study of Evaluation. Fewer than l0 percent of the tests reported reliability and validity coefficients sufficiently high to make them appropriate for use by researchers or evaluators. Approximately 30 to 40 percent of the tests reported good raw score distribution  characteristics and useful converted scores. Very few instruments had nationally representative norm samples or useful information for decision making about pupils. Given the quality of many &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; instruments, researchers and evaluators should have a variety of alternate measurement strategies at hand. (Author/MV)",

These eight polls reveal a public that has confidence in its schools and its teachers and supports specific innovations, particularly career education, moral education, and various types of alternative public schools. The public is concerned about discipline, basic skills, class size, and size of schools; and is strongly opposed to forced busing for racial integration, expanding students' rights, and giving students a greater voice in decision making in schools. In the 1976 Eighth Annual Gallup Poll, discipline continues to be cited by adults as the most important problem in public schools. Discipline is followed by problems associated  with busing and integration. The third critical issue is educational finance. Criticisms of poor or inappropriate curricula are becoming more frequent. Other trends are also reported. A guide for conducting a local opinion poll, reprinted from The Gallup Poll of Attitudes Toward Education, 1969 - 1973 is included. (MV)",

        "description":"In order to improve on their selection, promotion, and identification decisions regarding high level management personnel, many large corporations, some small ones, and several governmental agencies have resorted to the assessment center approach. Briefly, the assessment center is an intensive multiple-techniques evaluation process. Candidates for assessment are brought in small groups of from eight to twelve to a testing location and run through a battery of tests over a 2- or 3-day period. These often include paper-and-pencil psychological measures, projective measures, interviews, and both individual and group situational tests. The situational tests are often miniature job situations. Candidates are evaluated by several trained assessors, who are usually successful high-level  managers and sometimes are psychologists. This report is an annotated bibliography of published articles on assessment centers. Several types of articles appear: general publicity articles, reports on the implementation of an assessment center, research studies investigating methods of achieving over-all ratings of potential, and reports on validities of assessment center programs. The general finding in the reports described is that assessment center evaluations are more predictive of future management success than the traditional evaluations which are based on supervisors' reports, paper-and-pencil tests, and interviews.

The final three items ask students to give their opinions about whether or not the teacher they are rating has any distracting personal mannerisms, to give the reason they took the teacher's course, and to tell whether they would recommend the course to another student. As reported in the Educational Quality Assessment manual (Hertzog, 1976) this instrument has  evidenced an internal consistency reliability of .86. As evidences of validity significant correlations have been found with such variables as the number of books read by students, the number of days they were truant, and their desires to quit school (Masters, Shannon and Reardon, 1975).

Interviews are seen as falling into two broad categories: standardized interviews and open interviews. The standardized type is further divided into two subcategories: the diagnostic type of interview and the survey type. The techniques involved in the several types of interviewing are adduced from a number of illustrative projects involving interviews conducted in various educational settings. The author suggests that there are five concepts that are basic to any form of measurement and that, insofar as the  interviewing process incorporates these concepts, it qualifies as a measuring device. Generally speaking, the standardized type of interview tends to meet these criteria more readily than does the open type, but the latter is seen as more likely to uncover new dimensions to be measured. The practicality of both types of interviews is briefly assessed. (Author)",

Both KR Formula 20 and KR Formula 21 were used to estimate reliability on each test. The 26 tests were sorted into a high item difficulty variability group and a low item difficulty variability group, and the magnitude of differences in KR20 and KR21 reliability coefficients were compared for the two groups. The difference in KR20 and KR21 reliability coefficients was significantly greater when the range of item difficulty values was .30 or more. Nevertheless, KR21 was a good estimate of KR20 when the range of item  difficulty was relatively narrow. Implications for test selection are suggested. When KR21 has been used to estimate a test's reliability, the user should note that the test has a lower bound of internal consistency reliability, particularly when the item difficulty range is great.

A tenative proposal to establish a centralized registry of psychology graduate students is made. A centralized registry might be more efficient and economical and also would establish a research data pool which could  provide a more reliable means for identifying and matriculating graduate students who will make significant contributions to psychology.

Too much emphasis had been placed on diagnostic testing while counseling and consulting activities seemed to be less emphasized, but needed more. Standard referral procedures were not followed closely, resulting in incomplete case files.

        "description":"The results of a modified version of the Goodenough-Harris Drawing Test are presented in relation to selected demographic and socioeconomic factors as they affect youths aged 12-17 years in the noninstitutionalized population of the United States. Findings are based on data gathered on a sample of 6,768 adolescents who participated in the Health Examination Survey of 1966-70. A consistent positive relationship was found between the level of parental education and the adolescents' test scores. An equally consistent positive association was observed between scores and family income. When either of these factors was held constant, the effect of the other persisted. Differences related to factors other than family income and parental education were negligible. The data did not reveal  any significant data on differences among geographic regions, between urban and rural areas, or among racial groups which are not largely ascribable to socioeconomic status. Location of household with respect to city or suburbs was not significant, but rate of population change in the area of residence was associated with some small difference in performance. Differences in test performance--associated with school-related variables and academic achievement were considerably smaller than those observed for reading and arithmetic tests. In general, the test functioned as a general ability measure in the earlier years of adolescence, but after about age 15 it discriminated only in the lower reaches of the ability distribution.

        "description":"Research was conducted to improve applicant selection procedures in the Air Force Reserve Officers' Training Corps (AFROTC) scholarship program. The objectives were to document predictive relationships, if any, between student aptitude measures, academic major, institutional selectivity, and eventual completion of the scholarship program. The analysis included records of student performance for all AFROTC participants during FY 71 through FY 75 (N = 23,000). Results indicated that success in the program could be forecast with prior knowledge of: (a) applicant scores on the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT)-OQ composite and (b) the intended academic major (science and engineering versus other). A significant degree of predictive accuracy was achieved for each of the  4-year, 3-year, and 2-year programs. The effects of additional information based on the AFOQT (Pilot and Navigator composites) and institutional selectivity was found to be non-essential for predicting ROTC training outcomes although the usefulness of the rated training composites was again documented for undergraduate pilot and navigator training. Specifications were discussed to developing a dual selection system appropriate for both pre- and post-entry training programs. The implementation of such a system could result in considerable savings given the high costs of attrition typically associated with these programs. (Author)",

        "description":"This report identifies and analyzes forces in the schooling process that create delays in completions, that limit attainment, that foster the drop out rate and that reduce chances for higher education among Puerto Ricns in metropolitan areas in the U.S., as revealed by statistics from the 1970 census. In this study, an explanatory set of social and economic variables were related to educational measures for preparing and evaluating influences stemming from the school system, the Puerto Rican community and the parents. Multivariate correlations and the use of path analysis provided a basis for conclusions, as well as observations, regarding patterns of variation among the eleven metropolitan areas selected for intensive research. The findings showed that as of 1970 little or no  progress had taken place in the schooling of Puerto Rican young adults when compared with the parent generation's school attainment and the attainment of other minority groups. Nationally, about 60% of Puerto Rican youth enumerated in the 1970 Census had left the educational system before high school graduation. An additional 25% graduated, but with some delay in the usual schedule for completion, indicating problems even when school was successfully completed. In varying degrees the delay/drop out pattern was found in nine out of the eleven metropolitan areas, some of which represent more than a single city. It was concluded that some of the social factors identified as influences on school problems could be modified by short-term changes in organization, but others would require  redirection in the social structure that has ascribed to Puerto Ricans a minority and dependent role in the internal colonial system.

These benefits may be provided by the government (food stamps, Medicare, etc.), or the private sector (health insurance, free housing, etc.). The problem addressed in the paper is the development of a theoretically acceptable, yet empirically implementable, methodology for converting in-kind income into its equivalent cash income from the perspective of the direct recipient. The conversion depends on the preferences of individual recipients and on the precise parameters of the in-kind subsidy. The paper focuses on four types of in-kind benefits (food stamps, public housing, Medicaid, and Medicare) since data on other types of in-kind benefits are sparse.  For these four types, impacts across families and across states are sizeable. The paper also discusses how to value the increase in income from in-kind subsidies and it shows how individual recipients may be affected differently by the receipt of in-kind income. Some of the findings include the following: (1) in-kind income makes many persons and families better off, though they may not be better off to the full extent of the provider outlays on the in-kind goods; (2) in order for in-kind income to be treated consistently with cash income the provider cost of in-kind subsidies must be reduced to its cash equivalent value to recipient families; (3) empirical findings show the cash equivalent value of various in-kind subsidies to be significantly below government cost, and (4) the average  cash equivalent values will vary sharply across families by income level, family size, and other demographic characteristics.

The survey is a comprehensive source of detailed information on the expenditure patterns and savings behavior of American consumers in relation to their income and other characteristics. The first part of the paper describes the most recent survey, its sample design, questionnaire content, and general limitations. Section 2 reviews the major uses of data provided by the survey. The discussion focuses on the survey's usefulness for deriving measures of poverty, indicating both strengths and weaknesses. The basic conclusion is that, while the data collected in the survey are ideal in most respects for construction of alternative poverty measures, for both needs and income the  sample size is not large enough to support meaningful analysis of breakdowns cross-classified by income, family size, geographic location, and Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas of residence. Section 3 discusses the preliminary results of the survey in terms of changes in basic spending patterns for food that have occurred since the last survey. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This technical report describes the impact that a definition of poverty based on the household unit, instead of on the currently used family unit, would have on the status of unrelated individuals and on the status of those family members who live in a household in which unrelated individuals are present. This information is based on a special tabulation of the March 1975 Current Population file which shows the poverty status of unrelated individuals based on (1) the current official definition of poverty, and (2) a definition of poverty in which a household concept was used in place of the family concept. For those unrelated individuals who live with a family, the tabulations also show the official poverty status of the family. It is shown that the change to a household-based  concept would not affect the poverty status of persons who live alone or persons who live only with relatives, but it would affect the poverty count among unrelated individuals who do not live alone and among family members who live in a residence in which unrelated individuals are present. A definite statement on the relative merits of the household over the familial concept cannot yet be made. The issue depends upon the economic relationship between or among household members. The addition of questions to the Current Population Survey which would allow tabulation of data for non-familial spending units is a possible solution. The spending unit concept is subject to some ambiguity, however, because persons may share some basic expenses and not others. In the absence of spending unit  information, it would be useful to periodically publish poverty counts based on the household concept. (Author/AM)",

The major virtues of such a definition are that it is explicitly relative and it is easy to understand and construct. The major flaw is that, in the absence of a major shift in the income distribution, the proportion of persons in poverty would remain constant over time. The evidence in this paper indicates that such a poverty measure would have the effect of identifying as poor a nearly fixed proportion of the population. In the absence of significant shifts in the income distribution, the proportion of the population in poverty would not be lowered by a growth in the  average level of real income. Using a definition based on median income would also allow the possibility of introducing inter-area differentials through the use of sub-national medians. However, even though the application of a single national poverty standard causes some inequities, the data suggests that the adoption of a poverty standard based on sub-national medians would create its own inequities. The only realistic way of introducing inter-area differentials into a poverty definition is to develop a survey which will produce acceptable data on inter-area differences in living costs.

        "description":"This study is a two-part analysis aimed at determining what differences occur in the incidence of poverty when different definitions of income are employed and when the time frame of analysis is changed. The first part of the analysis concentrates on school-aged children, while the second part studies families. The study is based on data from the Survey Research Center's Panel Study of Income Dynamics, for the years 1968-1972. For the analyses of school-aged children, all children in the panel between the ages of 5 and 18 in the spring of 1972 were counted, resulting in a sample of 5,834 children. For the family analysis those families in 1972 which included a male head from 1968, a female head from 1968, or the wife of a male head in 1968 were counted, resulting in a sample size  of 4,010 families. In general, adjustments to annual family money income to account for certain costs of receiving income, and for certain non-money components of income, result in little change in the rank ordering in economic status of familes and children. The results also show that the incidence of poverty is higher for children than for families, by all measures. Although adjustments to annual money income can change a family's economic position, especially in moving it out of the poverty classification, the time period covered appears to be a more influential factor. A crude assessment of the effects of changing the measure of poverty on the relative number counted as poor in different sub-national areas was attempted. The results are inconclusive. Various policy implications  stemming from the results of this study are given. (Author/AM)",

The characteristics of the poverty population in 1974 under the current federal definition and under the various alternative poverty defintions are presented based on data from the March 1975 Current Population Survey. In addition, changes over time in the size and composition of  poverty populations such as the elderly, female headed families, school aged children, and blacks under the alternative measures are analyzed. A discussion of the impact of the alternative definitions on the geographic distribution of the poor based on the One Percent Sample of the 1970 Census of Population is also included. The effect of the alternative poverty definitions on the number and characteristics of the poor varies the most with two basic changes in the poverty definition: first, large increments in the level of thresholds, and second, elimination of the variations by family size. The subgroups that deviated most from the general pattern noted for the total population of declining poverty rates under the fixed measures and fairly constant poverty rates under the relative  measures between 1967 and 1974 were the elderly and persons in families with a female head.

        "description":"This is an examination of the first two years of this school and community project for abused and neglected children. The program was one of three federally funded demonstration projects designed to serve as a guideline for establishing child abuse and child neglect programs on a national scale. The purposes of the program were: early identification of children who manifested symptoms of abuse or neglect, evaluation of the most appropriate methods for prevention of child abuse or neglect, changing parental attitudes towards themselves and their methods of child rearing, and modifying negative behavior in the parent child relationship by working with the family. The program was staffed by a project coordinator, a full and part-time social work supervisor, two caseworkers, a family  worker, and nine social work interns. Two hundred twenty-five children were referred to the program by community public agencies, school personnel, and the Bureau of Child Welfare (BCW). Children referred by the BCW were compared on the variables of age and family background to students referred by the community, schools, and public agencies (non-BCW). Program intervention was evaluated by means of two locally developed rating scales, the Socioemotional Rating Scale, which measures change from early to late program intervention for each child, and the Guardian Attitude Scale, which measures the caseworkers' perceptions of change in attitudes of parents or guardians. The results of these measures were analyzed for the BCW and non-BCW groups. The findings indicate that the families of the  two groups did not differ in their initial attitude or final attitude, but a larger attitude change was observed for the BCW group. The program staff perceived a small change in attitude among the parents and guardians with whom they worked. The report concluded that the program is making a contribution to the alleviation of both child abuse and neglect through early identification and prevention. Data collection forms, materials distributed at workshops, parent questionnaires, the two rating scales used, and an annotated bibliography are included in the appendix. (Author/JP)",

        "description":"This report is a case study of a federally-funded effort to implement comprehensive change in public education. Specifically, it examined the strategy of the Minneapolis public schools during the past five years to achieve this goal by creating a system of alternative schools, called Southeast Alternatives (SEA). Established as a separate administrative district of the Minneapolis public schools, SEA served as an experiment in decentralized administration, school-community participation in decision-making and parent/student choice among educational programs. The system of alternative schools included four separate school models at the elementary level: a free school, an open school, a continuous progress school, and a contemporary or traditional school. Selected options, based  upon the elementary programs, were offered at the secondary level. SEA served approximately 2,500 students and each student had the choice of attending any of the alternative schools. This report focused upon the process through which SEA implemented a system of alternative schools. A description of the process of change was discussed in seven steps: diagnosis, initiation, definition, implementation, monitoring instructional environments, monitoring instruction efforts and stabilizing the program. The evaluation strategies included school-based ethnographies, development and yearly administration of objectives-based tests in reading and mathematics, an affective survey, observations of formal meetings, structured classroom observations, and extensive formal and informal interviews of  school and community participants.

        "description":"The literature of white enrollment decline in desegregated schools is described in this report. The controversy over whether or not desegregation accelerates the enrollment decline of whites from central city public school districts is discussed in terms of school integration, black enrollment patterns and trends, resegregation of predominantly black public schools, and white flight to the suburbs. A study on enrollment trends from 1956 to 1974 in the Kansas City, Missouri public school district is reported. This large midwestern district, surrounded by predominantly white smaller districts, has been undergoing a decline in the proportion of white student enrollment. Enrollment data for the district were examined to determine whether the level and rate of desegregation have been  associated with declines in white enrollment. The sample for this study consisted of all the 75 schools which served as elementary schools during all or most of the period between 1956 and 1975. The findings of this study indicated that white enrollment decline has tended to accelerate in schools with more than 30 percent black students and/or a rapid increase in the percentage of black students. The report recommended that policymakers be cautious in determining the level and rate of desegregation in large city school distrcits. (Author/JP)",

The two purposes of the program were to improve the competency of the students in reading and mathematics skills, and increase student motivation and interest by developing positive attitudes toward self and school. Two hundred sixty students in grades two through eight were recommended by Title I specialists in consultation with principals, teachers, parents and pupils to receive additional help in reading and mathematics. The project was conducted after school hours, two hours daily, four days per week. High school tutors were instructed to encourage pupil self-confidence and to provide a  warm climate in which the students could perform freely. A student questionnaire consisting of twelve items explored attitudes toward school, self, tutors, reading, and mathematics. The questionnaire was given to the students twice as a pre-and post-evaluation. The results indicated that the students demonstrated considerable improvements in attitude toward self and school by the end of the program.

Pupils were selected for the program on the basis of residential area and educational disadvantagement. Reading was taught to individual pupils either developmentally or remedially with emphasis on readiness, word attack, and comprehension skills. Speech therapy was clinically-oriented to offset individual speech problems and related language  difficulties. The art component focused on a creative and motivational approach to meet reading and communication defects. Psychological and social work services were designed to promote optimal adjustment in order to make language instruction more meaningful. The Peabody Individual Achievement Test and Photo Articulation Test were used to assess reading improvement.

        "description":"Beginning in the 1870's mill owners in Texton, a New England industrial town of approximately 100,000 people, recruited Portugese labor. From then until 1920 many Portugese emigrated to Texton. From 1920-1960 the immigration of Portugese into America slowed as the result of the declining labor market, the war, and restrictive laws. Following the Immigration Act of 1965, Portugese immigration took a dramatic jump upwards. This flood of unskilled, primarily rural Portugese to an area where unemployment was high, Texton, and where there was a tradition of hostility to Portugese speakers, exacerbated existing relations between the latter and other groups. By the early 1970's certain members of the community decided that some public steps would have to be taken to mend increasingly  dysfunctional schisms. The mayor proclaimed Portugese Day, which featured a number of activities emphasizing the positive role which the target group had played. However, there were really two groups of Portugese-Americans. Those early arrivals who considered themselves and were considered by recent immigrants as Americans were distinct from recent immigrants who considered themselves and were categorized by earlier immigrants as Portugese. The disjuncture between old and new Portugese existed prior to Portugese Day. What had created the schism? At least three factors were at work: a competition for scarce resources; a higher level of expectations in the newly arrived group; and, a monetary base for corporateness among the latter which was not available to earlier arrivals. This case  study demonstrates the great potential for dissonance which lies in those situations where the actors believe they have a code in common but do not; when they believe they have a nexus of common understanding which, in fact, does not exist.

        "description":"This 1975-76 final evaluation report of the Elementary Secondary Education Act Title I programs, in the Washington, D.C. public schools is divided in two parts. Part one focuses on the program's creation, purposes, goals, objectives, and administration. Part two describes the relationship between school achievement and student characteristics. Part one involves the following areas: a description of the target group, population figures, goals, purposes, objectives, and impact of the program on the exceptional student; a delineation of the recommendations based upon the characteristics of Title I students, types of programs offered, and educational outcomes; an outline of the legislative creation, program responsibilities, types of financial assistance offered, and the unique  administrative structure of the D.C public school system. Also, target areas, eligibility requirements, student development and achievement goals, program design and implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of information are discussed as is an outline of the general design strategy. Part two of the evaluation accomplishes the following: summarizes selected characteristics of Title I students compared to their non-Title I peers; explores in detail the effects of the Title I program on achievement; elaborates upon some of the relationships between self concept, student achievement, and classroom behavior; examines the relationships between motor, psychomotor, perceptual motor domains and achievement of male and female, Title I and non-Title I students; contains a brief description of  the cognitive theory proposed by Jean Piaget. Also, the relationship between Piagetian conservation ability and avhievement in both mathematics and reading is investigated; analyzes data regarding teachers, educational aids, inservice training, teacher attitudes, and class management relative to the instructional processes; comments on the relationship between school administration and ancillary services in terms of their functions in delivering support to the instructional program; describes the characteristics of handicapped students and special instructional programs for these students; gives some attention to the private school students' achievement, eligibility requirements, instructional programs, and school personnel. Numerous tables, charts, and an appendix are included.  (JP)",

        "description":"Recent change in the life cycle processes of educational, occupational, and earnings attainments among blacks native to the South, native to the North, and among black migrants from the South to the North is analyzed. Native northerners begin from relatively superior social origins and are better able to capitalize on these processes in the attainments of education and occupation than are either southern-born group. Between 1962 and 1973 the stratification experiences of the northern-born blacks rapidly converged with those of the white majority so that by 1973 their system of stratification was more like that of whites than of southern-born blacks. The processes of status allocation among the southern-born in 1973 were like those of northern natives in 1962. In this sense the  integration of blacks into the majority stratification system began first and has proceeded furthest among blacks born in the North. Men living in the North, regardless of nativity, enjoy higher earnings than men living in the South. In all, changes over the recent decade have supported the internal differentiation of the black population, the development of more distinct socioeconomic strata, the greater stability of inequalities between generations of blacks, and gains toward socioeconomic integration. These changes have been more characteristic of the North than the South. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The first part of this document summarizes the current state of knowledge on trends in inequality of economic well-being in the United States since World War II. It surveys alternative answers to the often asked question: Has inequality in the U.S. increased, decreased, or remained roughly the same over a period of time? Intelligent laymen, and indeed economists, might well be confused about the apparent divergence of views on this issue among experts. One purpose of this paper is to reconcile, as far as possible, the disparate results coming out of recent studies. While some of the differences can be readily explained by differences in the income concept and recipient unit used, other discrepancies remain a puzzle mainly because of the inadequacies of available data. The second  paper summarizes the discussion of the participants at a conference on the trend in inequality of well-being in the United States since World II for which the first paper was prepared. There was a concensus among the participants that statements concerning the trend in inequality are sensitive to the choice of income concept, and that government actions affect both recipient units and the form of income. These choices bias estimates of the trend. The conference format was designed to catalog what was known about how each of these biases affected the level of inequality and its trend. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper presents a brief historical overview and summary of the various approaches and recent developments in the field of bilingual education. The controversy that exists with respect to the different approaches to bilingual education has prevented the development of national goals and guidelines and the preparation of adequate evaluation instruments. Educators are now striving to remove the stigma that bilingual education is only compensatory education for the disadvantaged. Efforts are being made to demonstrate the importance of establishing and maintaining bilingual programs. The Bilingual Education Act was enacted in 1968, and in 1974, educational amendments were introduced to authorize funding for the Bilingual Education Program so that its goals could be reached.  Considerable inroads have been made in the field of bilingual-bicultural education at the elementary and high school levels. However, institutions of higher education have been slower in providing equal educational opportunities. The second part of this paper focuses on a model developed at the college level which is designed to serve the special educational needs of a sizeable number of Spanish dominant students attending the Community College of Philadelphia. A major goal of this program is to provide the city's Hispanic community with an opportunity to acquire English language proficiency through its intensive English as a second language component, and to increase access to post secondary education for Hispanic students in the Philadelphia public schools.

        "description":"The contention that among black people there is a cognitive style which seems to require a more active intervention with the learning environment than what is needed by their white counterpart is advanced in this discussion of cognitive style among black Africans and black Americans. Cognitive styles of blacks in the infant, early school, and young adulthood life stages are described. In the infant stage, birth to 36 months, the African babies experience a parenting style of socially active intimacy which appears to promote sensorimotor development superior to that of European infants. The relationship between teaching strategies and black children's cognitive modes are discussed in the light of these cognitive style differences. The decline of academic achievement of black  elementary and secondary school students is analyzed. Childrearing practices in America are described for lower socioeconomic groups. The active display of cognitive and motoric domains of black athletes are described. It is suggested that the \"active stream of cognition\" of young black adults has not been fully tapped by education planners. Also, implications for social change which can emerge from a theory of group differentiated sensorimotor development such as the one suggested by this paper are suggested for the areas of parenting, schooling, therapy, space, and natural groupings (peer group interaction).

It is timely to delve into the research which has been done in this area in the past, what research is presently being undertaken and what research concerns are emerging for the future. The chronological review presented in this document examines research literature concerning women in rural areas. This research begins in the 1930s and continues to the present. The review traces the development of the research, looks at how research is affected by events, and evaluates how research has affected women and women's needs and issues. The review also serves as a resource for those who wish to compare the differences between women and their concerns due to  their location in rural rather than urban areas. In some cases, the research also deals with class and race. Following the review is a discussion of research methods and theories, a list of research questions and needs for the future and a concluding commentary on the present status of women in rural areas. The commentary is based on popular literature, attitude surveys and current events. All research studies included in this review are abstracted in Appendix A, entitled 'Annotated Bibliography of Women in Rural America.' Popular literature, monographs, agricultural bulletins on the subject of U.S. rural-based women are also included in this bibliography. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper provides a historical review of national standardized testing and its relation to ethnic and racial minorities. In the pre-World War I period, psychological testing was conducted on the large masses of immigrants that were arriving in the U.S., and on black and white army draftees. Generally these tests showed that black draftees and refugees scored lower than the white middle class. No one in this period questioned the appropriateness of these tests for people whose backgrounds, language, and life styles were different than the majority of the population. But then, as now, the cultural bias inherent in such tests served the very useful purpose of labeling. Until recently race was still not considered to be a factor in test sampling. Furthermore it is only recently  that there are provisions made in test administration for children whose first language is not English. Many who presently oppose the use of standardized tests with minority and ethnic groups and blacks do so out of the belief that such tests, especially intelligence tests, cannot be divorced from the cultural frame within which the individual exists, lives, and learns. While it may be argued that procedures of test development are less biased now than forty, twenty, or ten years ago, two problems remain to be solved: the development of test content representative of a pluralistic American society, and more appropriate use of tests and test results.

These innovations, &quot;Student Learning Teams&quot; and &quot;Academic Divisions,&quot; are evaluated in a two by two factorial field experiment in eight seventh grade English classes (the teams and divisions versus no teams, no divisions comparison was replicated in two additional schools.) The treatments were as follows: Control students worked individually. Cooperative work was allowed, but not encouraged. Students received scores on their quizzes. No Teams, Achievement Divisions: Same as control, except that students were assigned to homogeneous achievement divisions based on past grades in English. At the end of each week, each  student's score on the sum of two quizzes was compared to that received by the others in his or her division. Students' individual divisional points were reported in a weekly class newsletter. Teams, No Achievement Divisions: Same as control, except that students were assigned to teams. Each team was made up of a high achiever, a low achiever, and average achievers. Students tutored each other. At the end of the week, a newsletter announced the teams with the highest point averages. Teams and Achievement Divisions: This treatment incorporated both the team and division components. In summary, the results are favorable toward the Student Teams- Achievement Divisions (STAD) combination. STAD is more effective than the control in increasing academic achievement, peer support for academic  performance, liking of others, and number of students cited as friends. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The gap in academic achievement between blacks and whites is one of the most serious problems in education today. Recent evidence suggests that this gap may be reduced without impairing the performance of whites if students are allowed to work in cooperative learning teams, as team techniques have been shown to increase academic achievement more for minority students than for anglos. This study tests findings with a student team technique called STAD, for Student Teams-Achievement Divisions. STAD is a generic learning technique capable of being used for any subject area in which objective tests can be given. Its most important feature is student teams, which are composed of four to five students of different past achievement. Each team is a cross-section of the class in terms of  sex and race as well as academic achievement. The teams are given worksheets to study in pairs or as a group through peer tutoring. Students are tested on the material studied in the teams twice each week, and the individuals' scores are contributed to their team scores. However, the scores are first transformed to remove the effect of past achievement on present performance. Team success is rewarded by means of a weekly class newsletter. The subjects of the study were 65 seventh grade students in two English classes in a Baltimore junior high school. Results indicate that STAD does increase achievement dramatically for blacks, but only minimally for whites. Implications for education are discussed. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The three research papers in this document concern open admissions and student success in the classrooms of Bronx Community College. Together, these projects capture much of what is involved in a comprehensive open admissions program. The first research report explores the technical characteristics, and therefore, the feasibility for use with community college students, of a recently developed mathematics competency test. This study also attempts to develop an equivalent form of the test, and evaluates differential mathematics achievement over a four month instructional period, under two modes of instruction. The second research project develops an interaction analysis system, specifically designed to describe the interpersonal process in the classroom. The classroom activities  paradigm presented in this report was a reliable process-descriptive instrument, capable of providing a check on program claims of innovative classroom interaction. The third project examined the functioning and the impact of Project Total Discovery (TD) over a three year period. In this report the three successive interdisciplinary programs implemented at Bronx Community College for remediation of underprepared freshmen are reviewed. It is shown that the evolvement of the interdisciplinary approaches to remediation from Project STIR to Project LINK to Project Total Discovery was marked by clearer objectives and more precise evaluation. Increased administrative control was also noted. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to suggest the utility of an alternate level of data collection for desegregation research. There appears to exist an important disparity between the results generated by a large number of empirical studies and their application to segregation remedy at the classroom, school, and district level. This paper's bias is that the &quot;numerical indicators&quot; and correlates of desegregation which have been used in national level studies have had minimal impact in moving schools from the segregated to desegregated to the integrated stages. The emphasis then of this data collection model is focused on those school and district level factors which continue to render schools for all practical purposes segregated. These school and district level factors are classified  as follows: Organizational Patterns (Fiscal Considerations, Funding Patterns, Allocation of Educational Resources; Policy Considerations; Adjustment Procedure Mentality, Acquiescent Mentality), Administrative Patterns (Staffing Patterns, System-Individual Metaperspective, Information Access, and Instructional Patterns (In-School Segregation, Counseling, Special Education, Co-Curricular Activities). This paper indicates that these factors are critical to the desegregation process. Although a school has been designated legally desegregated, occurrences within it can render it for all practical purposes virtually racially segregated. Thus, a school which is desegregated or desegregating, can through manipulations of the above factors, become resegregated. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this project was to design a bilingual/bicultural kindergarten course of study based on the concepts of the Richards Education Through Music Method. This method is rooted in the Hungarian composer-educator Zoltan Kodaly's educational philosophy and was developed in the U.S. by Mary Helen Richards. This is a method of teaching all areas of the curriculum through musical activities. This methodology involves games and extensive aural experience. Both the acceptance of a child's culture and the acquisition and development of a second language are fostered. The classroom chosen for this research pilot project was an urban bilingual kindergarten class in the New Jersey school system. The class was made up of twenty-one children from Spanish-speaking homes, most of them  of Cuban descent. The focus of the program was on language arts readiness through music. The lessons of the five-lesson unit were based on Jose Marti, a Cuban national hero. Objectives in music, language arts, and social studies were developed around this central theme. Strong points of the lessons were: they provided a natural mode of expression for children who come from cultures where music is an integral part of daily life, and the games which music provided were an indirect way of teaching the concepts. The weak points were: some musical activities called for a certain level of proficiency in the musical skills which the children did not have, and the lessons should have followed each other more closely, not twice a week, so that the concepts could have been better reinforced. The  pilot unit with the lessons are included in the appendix. (Author/AM)",

Pupils were selected for the program on the basis of family background information and pupils' inability to speak English because of recent arrival to the U.S. The program activities were based upon the cognitive/affective approach. Pupil growth in social skills, physical abilities, intellectual ability, English fluency, self image, and parent involvement were assessed. A screening test for learning disabilities, an intelligence test, teacher rating scale of pupils' attitudes, and interviews with school personnel and parents were used to evaluate the program. The report  concluded that the program was successful in increasing the social skills, physical abilities, and intellectual ability of the 45 pupils. The program was also successful in developing more positive self image and cultural awareness of the pupils. Parent involvement in school activities were increased. The program fulfilled the goal of preparing children for kindergarten and first grade curricula.

The project was designed to increase the spoken English language comprehension of elementary school age children who were found to be below the 20th percentile on the Language Assessment Battery. Ten educational assistants worked closely with 168 target youngsters in activities that ranged from individualized instruction, to small group work, to testing, diagnosing, and prescribing interventions. The primary goal of these activities was to bring each participant to a higher level of competence in using and understanding English. The findings of the evaluation were that the major goal was not fully realized, in spite of very well coordinated,  highly professional effort on the part of project staff members. Only 47.1 percent (short of the 65 percent goal) of the students participating in the project gained the expected 10 percentile ranks needed to satisfy the project objectives. The project was recommended for continuation, however, with some modifications. (Author/JM)",

Forty children selected from each school were given remedial work in reading and mathematics. Four educational assistants under the supervision of the reading specialists of each school comprised the staff. The specific evaluation objectives of the program were that participants attending fifty percent or more of the scheduled program sessions show statisticaly significant improvement in reading and mathematics skills over  the anticipated gain as measured by a comparison of pre and post-test scores using the historical regression formula. The Stanford Early School Achievement Test II and the Metropolitan Achievement Test were used to measure functioning in reading and in mathematics. An analysis of the data yielded mixed results with statistical significance only partly achieved. The results must be regarded as tentative due to the short duration of the program (one semester), the use of two instruments instead of one, and the small sample sizes.

Phase one, a pre-camp educational program in the classroom, was designed to introduce the participating classes to the concepts of environmental sciences which the children would be studying while in camp. Phase two was a four day camp experience in Connecticut. Phase three was a series of projects and reports completed by the children when they returned from camp, detailing their camp experiences. Phase four was an integration of the lessons learned by the camp experience into the life of the children in New York City. The major program objectives were to significantly increase the children's knowledge  of environmental science, change their attitudes about environmental concerns to more positive ones, help students utilize their knowledge in defining local environmental concerns, and to help students develop plans to improve their neighborhood environments. The instruments used to evaluate the program objectives were a test of science knowledge constructed by the district science coordinator, the Attitude Development Through Outdoor Education Scale, and a follow-up questionnaire which was completed by participating teachers. Correlated T tests of the first two objectives indicated that the post-test scores were significantly higher than pre-test scores. Also, follow-up activities suggested that the students brought their experiences back to their neighborhood school districts and were  more aware of the environmental concerns in which they lived. The report concluded that all three evaluation objectives were met and produced significant positive findings. The instruments used in the evaluation are included in the appendix. (JP)",

For those target students not knowing the alphabet, a preliminary Alphabet Identification phase was used to train them in alphabet letter naming. Classes included in the program were those with students of relatively low reading scores. The remedial component of the program included additional decoding skill training. The main screening measure was the Word Analysis sub-test of the Durrell Analysis of Reading Difficulty. The program was staffed by a part-time coordinator, one full-time  auxiliary trainer, one part-time teacher trainer, and sixteen part-time educational assistants. Specific evaluation objectives of the program were: (1) that 90% of the participants would identify 100 percent of a random list of the entire alphabet correctly; (2) that the decoding ability of participants in the first, second, and third grades would show a statistically significant difference between their real and anticipated post-test scores; (3) that those participants in the remedial component would show a statistically significant difference between their real and anticipated post-test scores; and, (4) that the program would parallel the program proposal. The first evaluation objective was accomplished by 91.95 percent of the participants. The second evaluation objective showed  statistically significant results. Although the third evaluation objective, which dealt with the remedial component, produced mixed results, participants did make gains in their decoding skills. Program implementation paralleled the program proposal. On the basis of the program evaluation, it was recommended that the program be recycled. Tabled data are included in this report. (Author/BS)",

The primary goal of the program was to improve the reading achievement of first and second grade pupils in selected schools through the use of photographs taken by the pupils. The program was conducted in six elementary schools in four school districts in New York City and involved approximately 280 pupils who had scored two years or more below grade level on citywide reading tests. Seven second grade and three first grade classes were included in the program. Two of the second grade classes were bilingual. The program was staffed by a coordinator, an educational associate, two educational assistants, two teacher aides, and two student  aides. The evaluation objectives were: (1) to determine the extent to which the program was implemented in accordance with the specifications described in the program proposal; (2) to determine whether 70% of the first grade pupils and 90% of the second grade pupils would master the ten selected instructional objectives chosen from the Prescriptive Reading Inventory, Red Book, Level A; and, (3) to determine whether pupil attitudes toward school would improve as demonstrated by increased school attendance. Although program guidelines were fully implemented, the absence of ongoing professional supervision and direction of the instructional process and teacher misinterpretation of the objectives of the program resulted in an undertaking that lacked the necessary elements of an educational  program. With regard to pupil reading performance, grade one pupils attained their criterion level for two out of the ten instructional objectives. Grade two pupils did not attain criterion level for any of the ten selected objectives. Since program pupil attendance was already high at the beginning of the program and slightly higher than nonprogram pupil attendance, expectations of additional increases in attendance by program classes were found to be unrealistic.

        "description":"This report evaluated a teacher education program designed to improve the quality of instruction for low income students in New York City. A major goal of the program was to increase student reading and English fluency skills. Teachers for the program were trained on college campuses. Each participating school designed its training program to suit its own educational needs. Parent participation in the design of the program was solicited. In addition to the teacher training aspect of the program, 150 students were provided with corrective reading services twice per week and 55 students participated in a small group English as a second language tutoring program. The objectives of the program were improvement of reading achievement, language ability, and teacher instruction ratings  as defined by a seven point scale. The methods of evaluation of the program were: assessment of pre and post reading and English language fluency test scores, direct observation of all aspects of the program, interviews with school personnel, and completion of questionnaires by principals who rated teacher performance. The evaluation concluded that of the 129 students tested 52 percent showed significant growth in reading ability and English fluency. Bilingual students had difficulty with language forms. The principals' ratings of teacher performance indicated that teachers exhibited exceptional growth in diagnosis of learning disabilities, corrective instruction, use of instructional materials, procedures for pupil evaluation, methods of individualizing instruction, and techniques of  parent involvement. The principal evaluation questionnaire is included in the appendix. (Author/JP)",

The program was designed to offer after school instruction in 13 elementary schools and 4 junior high schools. Three hundred ninety elementary school students and 120 junior high students in grades two through nine participated in the program. Tutorial classes met once or twice a week for a total of two hours with the exception of one junior high school where students met in the morning before the start of regular classes. The program was administered by teachers, paraprofessionals, and high school students who provided individual tutoring for two or three students. The major objective of the evaluation was to determine if, as a result of participation in the program, there was  significant improvement in reading comprehension skills. All students were given alternate forms of the Stanford Diagnostic Test on a pre and post-test basis. The report concluded that the tutorial program in reading was successful in the fourth, sixth, and seventh grades. There was growth in the second, third, fifth, eighth, and ninth grades but these grades did not show significant gains. (Author/JP)",

        "description":"This report evaluates a remedial reading and mathematics after school program for 227 third, fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students who scored at least one year below expected grade levels on New York City standardized tests. The program was a selected New York City Umbrella program funded under a grant from the New York State legislature. The program also taught English as a Second Language (ESL) to 82 parents in the school community. Bilingual teachers from the participating elementary school were sent into both community agencies and private homes where they held English language instruction classes for parents. The major objectives of the program were to help students in both the remedial reading and mathematics program achieve significant growth in their reading and  mathematics skills and to help the participating parents in the ESL program to improve their conversational skills in English. Pre and post city wide reading and mathematics standardized tests were used to assess the students' growth. A teacher made test of conversational English as well as the New York City Non-English Rating Scale was used to assess the parents' improvement of their English conversational skills. The findings of the program indicated that the students' average growth in mathematics was 11.8 months for a ten month period and the average growth in mathematics was 11.8 months for the same period. Also, data collected on the pre and post English conversational test for parents indicated that parents met the eligibility criteria of minimal competence in English. The appendix  contains the Teacher Made Test of Conversational English. (JP)",

        "description":"One experiment investigated the relationship of goal setting and locus of control to the work performance of mentally retarded adults and a second experiment was a semi-replication study done on college adults. Two main effects were studied: (1) Method of goal setting (whether a worker set his own goal, had a goal set by a supervisor, or simply observed his own production without setting a goal); and (2) locus of control (whether the subject's locus of control was internal or external). In the first experiment, 48 mentally retarded workers completed a simple task. Setting goals as opposed to not having goals did make a positive difference in production, but it seemed immaterial whether the individual or the supervisor set the goal. Locus of control made no significant difference.  A second study was conducted on college students, with the expectation that subjects of higher intelligence would show differences when setting their own goals as opposed to having goals set for them. When 64 university students performed a simple clerical task, neither goal setting nor locus of control seemed to affect performance. The failure to get this result with the college students and the limited effect with the retarded subjects suggest that whether goal setting does or does not improve performance is a function of several factors, including difficulty of task and environmental conditions, and that the relationship between locus of control and work performance is more complex than had previously been thought.

General overall differences between career education and vocational education are outlined in the final section and include the following: Career education is for all students; vocational education is for students who wish to acquire skills for a particular job or job cluster. Career education spans early childhood and adulthood; vocational education usually begins no sooner than grade 10. Career education  emphasizes unpaid and paid employment; vocational education emphasizes paid employment in jobs that require training at less than the baccalaureate degree. Career education concepts are integrated into the ongoing curriculum; vocational education curriculum has as its core substantive content in a trade area. Similar teaching-learning strategies employed by both career education and vocational education are also noted: To work with advisory councils and the business community, and to use guidance services, including placement; however, career education works with representatives from a wide spectrum of occupations and at all skill and professional levels, whereas vocational education works with people who represent the trade area being taught.

The report emphasizes the systems in the United States and Canada as bases for comparison. Following an introductory chaper, which discusses the scope of the report, Chapter II describes the various types of unemployment benefit schemes in use and classifies countries by type. Coverage, eligibility, and benefit provisions are discussed in the next four chapters, and the treatment of special categories  of unemployed workers in chapter VII. Financing and administrative arrangements are taken up in chapters VIII and IX. Chapter X discusses various measures used to promote reemployment and to improve the functioning of the labor market. Tables appear throughout the report, and a bibliography is included. An appendix contains summaries of the unemployment insurance programs in each of 10 countries. Another appendix describes activities of the International Labor Organization and the International Social Security Association in the field of unemployment insurance. (Author/LMS)",

After citing and discussing some baseline facts about vocational education's budget and enrollment figures, the author provides several reasons for having a national policy: (1) The scope of responsibility of the vocational education establishment has never been precisely defined, (2) vocational education is uniquely vulnerable to attack from its critics because there is no carefully articulated policy against which its effectiveness can be measured, and (3) the need to strengthen the tradition of local control and adaptability with a clear and comprehensive policy which defines goals precisely so that individual  institutions and subsystems can pursue them confidently and systematically. The author also discusses major points from the papers delivered at the vocational education Bicentennial Conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota, such as the work ethic, reshaping employers' approaches to the definition of work, harmonizing vocational educational policy with policy on other related areas, and the need for knowledge of the labor force. Concluding statements cover the author's ideas about the direction which a national policy should take. (HD)",

In addition, the mail questionnaire measured differences in views and experiences according to sex, race, year of graduation, and major of the alumni. The study also explored alumni attitude toward the alma mater and avocational activities of the alumni. The questionnaire was first field tested and revised. A random sample of 4,387 alumni was chosen, with a response rate of 33.6%. The &quot;Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&quot; was used to analyze the data. Findings indicated that student  participation in an undergraduate program of cooperative education had an impact on their after-graduation career goals, expectations, and actual experiences; that there were differential effects of cooperative work experience for students in different curricula, for men and women students, and for minority students; and that aside from greater career choice stability, the impact of cooperative work experience appeared to diminish over time. Alumni of cooperative and noncooperative programs did not differ greatly in their attitudes toward their alma mater or in their avocational activities.

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine the ability of women who enroll in traditionally male occupations to receive equal training and equal employment benefits to those of males enrolled in the same programs. (A traditionally male occupation was defined as an occupation which employed 80% or more males.) The eight programs included in the study were those which were defined as traditionally male and which enrolled and graduated females who were successfully followed up. Programs were selected using data obtained from the 1970 Minnesota Census Data and from the Minnesota Vocational Follow-Up System data tapes for 1971-72 and 1972-73 graduates. From the sampling procedure, a total of 21 females from the eight program areas and a total of 21 males were drawn in such a way that there was  an equal number of males and females drawn from each program area. Based on the results of the study it appears that the traditionally male instructional programs offered by the Minnesota area vocational-technical institutes are open to women and that women rate the quality of the programs similarly to men. However, few women enter these programs and even fewer complete them. Results imply that not only do proportionally less women get employed in training-related traditionally male occupations but they receive significantly less salary. They also seem to be less satisfied with their jobs and see less potential for advancement. (SH)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used measures of job effectiveness, concentrating on a recent development in the field, the Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS); and proposes a new approach, the Behavior Description Index (BDI), which the author contends reduces or avoids most of the shortcomings of other methods. After discussing the advantages and distinguishing features of BARS, the author refers to the main problems of currently used instruments that have been cited in the literature: Low inter-rater reliability, central tendency (inclination of rater to avoid extreme ratings), halo effect (tendency to assign the same rating to each factor being rated), and leniency effect (tendency of supervisors to overrate subordinates). Two  shortcomings not dealt with in the literature reviewed are also presented: Waste of valuable information and multidimensionality. The paper then examines the characteristics of the BDI and claims advantages of the new scale over other scales (for example, that the BDI uses behavioral criteria; uses a larger sample of the total job behavior domain than BARS; has less leniency, halo, and central tendency effects; and probably has higher inter-rater reliability). Implications of the use of the new instrument in performance and training evaluation are discussed. References and examples of statements from the BARS are appended. (LMS)",

The sample consisted of 281 fathers from 14 randomly selected rural school districts in Iowa. Fathering style was measured by using a 48-item instrument, from which five clusters, measured on a continuum, emerged: Growth (awareness of the child's needs ranging from physical to creative self-expression); power (physical control  over the child); power (emotional control over the child); laissez faire treatment; and smothering behavior. (Discussion of findings and samples of questionnaire items are included for each cluster.) Since fathers perceived they should ideally be more sensitive to the feelings of the child, accepting of autonomous actions, and involved in decisionmaking, it was recommended that family life education programs be developed with this in mind. Since results were similar to those from a study of urban parents, it was recommended that statewide programs, rather than separate rural and urban programs, be developed. (LMS)",

Because students have experienced difficulty in writing the plan, a seminar in process education was developed to help students develop skills in question-asking, reflecting, and synthesizing for the purpose of integrating their academic education with their experiential education into a bachelor's degree program. A pilot test of the seminar during the fall quarter used an experimental group of 12 persons (who took the seminar) and a control group of 17 persons (who did not). The subjects were invited to participate, and both groups were given  the same pretests and posttests. At the end of the seminar, both groups wrote a rough draft of their Long Term Degree Plan. Both groups received similar scores that were relatively high. It was determined, however, that in general, students in the control group were older, longer established in their careers, and had more education than those in the experimental group. Student evaluations of the seminar indicated that it was useful for those who participated. (LSM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted on 42 adults in west central Minnesota to identify emerging patterns of educational barriers, explore the relationships among the barriers, and determine the effect barriers have in influencing the adult learner's participation in education. The study used three anthropological fieldwork techniques: Network analysis using the referral technique to identify the research population (the 12 primary subjects referred the investigators to 30 others); ethnographic data collection through indepth personal interviews; and ethnoscience techniques used in the organization and analysis of the data. (Ethnoscience is defined as a mode of eliciting, in a rigorous way, the means by which a culture structures meaning for its participants.) Five main categories of barriers  were identified: Access to educational facilities, family responsibilities, finances, time, and motivation. The investigators found that over two-thirds of the participants reported the presence of two or more barriers and that the barriers were intricately related to one another. Three generalizations were reached: Barriers are derived from the situations people face and the value orientations people hold; value-related barriers require personal readjustments by the adult learner; and situational barriers have the potential to be overcome by external sources. (Implications of the study for adult educators and for the authors' own situation are also explored.) (LMS)",

The first and major part of the paper deals with the use of case studies in generating data and communicating knowledge and feelings. The second part deals with how quantitative analysis was related to qualitative knowledge. Using an analogy of a clock, the author presents a number of advantages of the case study approach over the survey approach and gives the rationale for the use of the case study approach. Polanyi's concepts of tacit knowledge and propositional knowledge are discussed, and the author indicates how both types of knowledge were communicated through written  case studies. Turning to a discussion of how quantitative analysis is related to qualitative analysis, the author states that quantitative analysis may only be used to confirm a theoretical insight derived from qualitative knowledge, not to discover new insights. He gives an example of how quantitative analysis was used to confirm a theoretical insight that there are three types of project orientation: transactive, institution, and community. (LMS)",

A wide range of alternative futures is discussed which has emerged from this work, conducted in graduate seminars in short and long term social action research and participatory planning projects with institutions and consortia. Futures invention is described as a discovery method based on claims that the future is open to human choice, decision, and action, if and when persons become clear about their intentions and are prepared to negotiate with others their commitments and actions. The paper focuses on the ways in which these participants chose to understand lifelong learning and its  associated educative activities as aspects of the futures of higher/postsecondary education. Reported and discussed in detail are 221 items taken from individual and policy team intentional claims on the future. The items are organized into two main categories: (1) The adult learner as agent, and (2) alternative desirable futures for postsecondary education. Substantive concerns discussed include teaching/learning roles, definitions, activities; organizational arrangements (certification, accreditation, etc.); systems of sanctions and rewards; active/passive relationships with other institutional domains; notions of organizational and social change; and philosophical orientations and practical strategies.

        "description":"Traditional research literature distinguishes between two general types of threats to the generalizability of experimental findings: Internal validity and external validity. Relatively minor importance has been attached to external validity in educational literature. Bracht and Glass elaborate on external validity and deal with two types: Population validity and ecological validity. Snow indicates that the biggest threat to external validity occurs when the experiment does not fit the phenomena being studied. Traditional experiments are nonecologically oriented, tend to manipulate the subject for experimental convenience, and yield results which are non-representative. Historically, basic research has emphasized internal validity and applied research has been concerned with  immediate problem solving (external generalizability). Generalizability must be the sole factor in judging all good research, and the fundamental design principle governing generalizability is representativeness. There are a number of strategies educational researchers may use to build significant and generalizable studies, for example, imbedding experimental procedures in existing structures in as nondisruptive a manner as possible, replicating experiments, using placebo treatment groups, examining the utility of proposed research, and not overgeneralizing from results. Adult educators also must be concerned with the generalizability of their research. They must be applied researchers, emphasizing external validity over internal validity. (LMS)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to develop an instrument which would require a relatively short time to complete and would predict an adult's probable performance on a five-part General Educational Development (GED) test. It was believed that the cloze procedure (a measure of reading comprehension in which every fifth word is deleted from a reading passage and replaced by a blank line) might be useful in the development of a predictive instrument. A cloze test, which took about 30 minutes to complete and consisted of a 250-word passage written at the 10th grade level, was developed and administered to 148 subjects upon their completion of the GED. Results indicated a significant positive relationship between the cloze test scores and all of the five GED sub-test scores and the total GED  test scores. The cloze test was most highly related to, in descending order, the grammar, literary, social studies, natural science, and mathematics sub-tests. To determine the cloze test's predictive validity, another investigation was conducted on 461 students preparing for the GED exam. The direct cloze test-GED relationship was upheld, but it was concluded that other factors, such as sex and race, also affect GED performance. The original study was replicated on 110 people with similar significant relationships demonstrated. (References and a copy of the cloze test used in the study are included.) (LMS)",

Using results from an extensive socioeconomic questionnaire completed by 242 participants attending 11 continuing education courses at the University of British Columbia, hypotheses based on threshold pricing theory were tested. Significant differences existed between course prices and participant-determined upper and lower bound prices. Positive and significant correlations  occurred for selected &quot;wealth&quot; and &quot;continuing education commitment&quot; variables, as both variables related to upper and lower bound prices. The author notes that the study defined beneficial uses for both market segmentation considerations and threshold pricing practices as each related to adult education; however, it is suggested that further studies be conducted to broaden the scope of these marketing strategy techniques. The first half of this paper provides background information on concepts related to product pricing and consumer reactions. The second half describes the study. (SH)",

An extensive list of competencies was developed from a variety of sources and grouped under six major areas for adult education administrators and four major areas for ABE instructors. From the extensive list, a group of 16 adult education administrators from throughout the State of Iowa participated in three rounds to select, by consensus, a final list of 167 administrative competencies. Concurrently, a group of 23 administrators and ABE instructors participated in three rounds to select 136 ABE instructional competencies. The resulting competencies were (1) divided within each area by knowledge competencies  and skill competencies and by desired time of achieving each competency--either at the beginning of one's career in adult education or later in one's career, and (2) ranked within each area in order of its importance to one's performance as administrator or instructor, the ranking being determined by the persons participating in the Delphi study. This paper describes and analyzes the process of selecting the administrative and instructional competencies and presents and discusses the results, implications, and recommendations of both lists.

Knowledge and attitudes toward social and psychological factors associated with disability have not kept pace with these advances. Professionals working with disabled have not significantly changed their attitudes concerning the needs and sexual functioning of the disabled. Surveys of physicians' attitudes have shown that they are feeling more inadequately prepared than in the past to handle questions regarding sexuality. Similar conclusions have been drawn about other professional groups; professionals in all disciplines relate much personal discomfort in their often futile attempts at discussing sexuality with their clients. Contrary to  popular belief, social change, the \"sexual revolution,\" and increased visibility of the disabled in society appear to have done little to change knowledge and attitudes concerning sexuality in disabled individuals.

Father-child and mother-child relationships are qualitatively different. They involve different types of experiences and have different implications for the child's personality development. The fathers' sex-differentiating behavior focuses the children's--especially the boys'--attention on the same-sex parent. Early parent-infant interactions may facilitate gender role acquisition. Siblings seem to play an important role in facilitating infant mastery over the inanimate environment. It appears that infants are not attached to their preschool-aged siblings. Yet siblings may still exert an important impact on infant development. Parent-infant and sibling-infant relationships  both underscore the need for theory and research on the complexity and multidimensionality of the infant social world. (Author/JLL)",

It is a first step toward constructing a systematic body of knowledge about learning strategies. The course covered four topics, chosen because they were complex enough to require several weeks to make progress, but simple enough that some measurable level of skill would indeed be acquired. Topics were playing the soprano recorder; computer programing; playing bridge; and the history of the American Civil War. In addition to describing the course, the author discusses some of the learning principles he teaches. He emphasizes the need to instruct students about their own mental processes, including short-term memory limitations and the need to cluster or \"chunk\"  related concepts. He also argues that there are at least three modes of learning: accretion, restructuring, and tuning. These concepts can be used to help students analyze their own learning. (Author/BP)",

        "description":"This paper reports findings of an exploratory field study of the teenager's first year of motherhood. Twelve subjects, aged 14-19, were interviewed a number of times during that year. Interviews were largely unstructured, allowing mothers to express their concerns and feelings. Data for analysis were: (1) narrative style protocols that were recorded as nearly verbatim as possible immediately following interviews; and (2) neonatal perception inventories. Internal constraints included innaccurate interpretations of the situation and the infants' behavior dependence on their mothers, confusion of feminine identity, and expressions of a high level of hostility. Infants' health status reflected their mothers' difficulties; two infants experienced failure-to-thrive syndrome, and one  infant suffered a skull fracture. Factors that increased mothering competence included the ability to: progress in other roles, experience reward and gratification in watching their infants grow and mature, experience a changed, more mature relationship with their mothers, and experience a rewarding relationship with a mate. External constraints included conflicting societal values and norms which increased their anxiety, making them feel like misfits. Marriage was viewed by the single teenagers as financially penalizing, as imposing additional work, and as preventing them from getting ahead. Lack of institutional support, i.e., financial help for married couples and child-care centers for all, made it difficult to pursue educational and professional goals. (Author/MFD)",

A simple modification of the Darlington-Bishop method (algebraically and conceptually similar to ridge regression, but independently derived) is proposed and examined; it is intended to increase scale validity by reducing validity shrinkage. In a double cross-validation design, MMPI items were used to predict diagnostic category (schizophrenic vs. other) for 200 hospitalized patients. With one anomalous exception, the proposed technique produced scales more valid than those from the original Darlington-Bishop technique. (Author)",

As a consequence there is renewed interest in redefining retirement criteria in terms of a functional age concept which would give due attention to individual variability in the maintenance and development of behavioral competence. This paper calls attention to a number of problems with the undifferentiated use of the functional age concept and indicates a number of possible alternative approaches, some of which may be more appropriate for application to retirement issues than others. A distinction is made between functional age as a general index  applicable to basic psychophysiological mechanisms and a matrix of functional ages referring to specific social or environmental situations.

        "description":"An investigation was conducted with 20 cohabiting dyads (total N=40) to assess the implications of exchange orientation (EO) on dyadic functioning. EO was defined as the degree to which individual members of the dyad seek reciprocity from their partner. Most individuals tend to be quite sensitive to their own work input within the dyad, but are less sensitive to the contribution of their partner. This perceptual imbalance becomes a problem only if the individual believes that a 50-50 &quot;work&quot; or &quot;privileges&quot; approach is necessary for his/her satisfaction within the dyadic relationship. As predicted, the results demonstrated an inverse relationship between exchanged orientation and dyadic functioning. Although EO was found to be a more critical variable for females in their dyadic  functioning, high EO for both sexes proved to be inimical to pair commitment. Additional analyses demonstrated that for females, interactions with friendship networks tended to enhance dyadic functioning, while the reverse was true for males. Differential effects for males and females were interpreted in terms of traditional role patterns and expectations. (Author)",

        "description":"Cognitive style models describe individual differences in information-processing, or methods for deriving meaning from the world. Each style is theoretically value-free; each is valid and has strengths or weaknesses depending upon its context. However, this value freedom has been threatened in two ways. First, while cognitive style has been ignored by most educators, typically, those behaviors consistent with one pole of a style dimension have implicitly or explicitly been valued, thereby devaluing the alternative style. Second, sex differences in cognitive style tend to be such that those styles that predominate among males are favored by educators and researchers. It may be concluded that one of the merits of the concept of cognitive style is that any style is valid and  valuable. However, value judgments, often redundant with sex and sex role differences, have denied such contributions as the field dependent's ecological sensitivity and the intuitive's talents for problem-definition and brainstorming. Research by practititoners suggests that style-biased education cuts off options for individuals and favors stereotyping and stagnation within courses and careers. Style-sensitive educational programming capitalizes on the strengths of the style that one brings to a task and provides means of developing individual and educational flexibility. (Author)",

The theory is entertained that a match (or congruence) of family and school styles improves some student outcomes, while a mismatch (or incongruence) of environments results in improvement of different student outcomes. Using survey data from 4,079 white students in grades 6, 7, 9 and 12 in 16 secondary schools in Maryland, tests for interaction effects fail to reach accepted levels of significance consistently across grades for any outcome or within grades for multiple outcomes by any family environmental dimension. Instead of interpretable family-school interactions, there are important main effects. Particular family and school conditions have  consistently significant, positive consequences throughout adolescence for the seven student outcomes. At all grade levels greater participation in family decisions is associated with more positive personality development and school coping skills; greater participation in classroom decisions are related to more positive school coping skills; and higher family socio-economic status is important for higher aspirations. The study demonstrates the benefits of using specific family and school environmental measures to supplement standard social class variables for better understanding of educational processes.

Parental acceptance-rejection theory postulates that rejected children throughout our species share in common a constellation of personality characteristics different from the personality dispositions of accepted children. Specifically, rejected children are more likely than accepted children to be hostile, aggressive or passive aggressive (or to have problems with the management of hostility and aggression), to be dependent, emotionally unresponsive, emotionally unstable, to have impaired feelings of self esteem and self adequacy,  and to have a negative world view. In addition, the theory postulates certain worldwide antecedents of parental rejection and acceptance, and the theory also predicts certain expressive systems outcomes to parental acceptance-rejection. Cross-cultural and intracultural tests confirm hypotheses derived from acceptance-rejection theory. (Author)",

Using a letter identification task, it was found that subjects who were low in overall reading ability scan a visual image more slowly than do high ability readers and are slower in identifying letters when they do not occur in a familiar sequence. Using an oral reading task, it was found that low ability readers rely on holistic properties of words (presumably their visual characteristics) in recognizing common words, while high ability readers tend to use decoding skills in recognizing both common and uncommon words. Using a lexical decision task, it was found that decoding proceeds more slowly when the stimulus item is visually unfamiliar. While low ability readers were more  susceptible to the effects of visual familiarity, they did not differ from high ability readers in times for lexical access and retrieval. (AA)",

Existing tests were reviewed and rejected because of their focus on specific knowledge and diagnostic concepts rather than on measuring the knowledge implicitly tied to the concepts of reading. The paper proposes a field observation instrument based on the three forms of knowledge identified by J.F. Soltis: knowledge \"that\" refers to cognitive, verbal, or propositional knowledge; knowledge \"how\" explains noncognitive abilities that are teachable and learnable when one possesses certain skills; and knowledge \"to,\" or the disposition to act in certain ways. The paper suggests that a first step in  constructing items for the evaluation is to define the \"thats\" consistent with a given conception of reading in order to establish a basis for the \"how\" behaviors.

The average reading grade level equivalency score obtained on the reading test administered during the first week of recruit training was considered a man's reading score. Analysis of the results indicates that, in recruit training, reading was most predictive of discharge during the academic phase of training, suggesting that the academic demands of recruit training in interaction with low reading grade level is a potent discharge factor.

Subjects in the competitive-context conditions experienced more uncertainty,  engaged in more information-seeking behavior, and were more accurate in cognitive perspective-taking than were subjects in the cooperative-context condition. Subjects in the competitive-context condition also experienced more cognitive dissonance, derogated the confederate and the confederate's position and arguments to a greater extent, and indicated greater closed-mindedness in responding to the confederate and the confederate's arguments.

The fit of the hypothesized component factor model is tested using covariance data for 11 chronometric measures, chosen to reflect separate stages of processing. The fit of the structural model is found to be good (p=.2). Three alternative models are developed, each representing a simplification of the general model; in each case the alternative structural model is rejected.

This paper examines the relations between Comsat and the government agencies involved in shaping United States communications satellite policy during the negotiations for the Interim Intelsat Agreements. Following an explanation (with diagrams) of a conceptual framework for interdependence and coordination in decision making, the paper examines events of 1962 through 1964 relating to the establishment of Comsat; the development of negotiations between Comsat, the United States government, and representatives of European countries, the United Kingdom, and Canada; and the establishment of the Interim Intelsat Agreements. The paper shows  how Comsat, which originally proposed an organizational model that would have given the United States government and foreign participants a limited role in management of the system, was forced to accept a multilateral organization with somewhat greater foreign and United States government involvement. It also shows how the cooperation that evolved between Comsat and government agencies led to the success of the Interim Intelsat Agreements. (GW)",

Because political struggle and social reform have accompanied the educational and cultural progress of Egypt, the news publications have traditionally been utilitarian. Official control of the press was established in 1824 and continued until 1974, in spite of weak constitutional provisions for a free press. Gamal Abdul Nasser enforced strict censorship during his regime, with the singular exception that Mohamed Hassanein Heykal, head of the national press department and Nasser's personal friend, was permitted to maintain intellectual independence and to openly criticize government policies. It was a  significant step toward a world perspective for Egypt, the report concludes, when Anwar Sadat ended press censorship in 1974. It is paradoxical, however, that Sadat deposed Heykal, his most vocal critic, at the same time. (MAI)",

Subjects in grades four, six, nine, and eleven learned to play a novel game from a televised demonstration. Experimental subjects also viewed another videotape, showing an ineffectual attempt by one person to communicate the game rules to another. The intent was to sensitize experimental subjects to possible communication difficulties without providing any positive guidance. Subjects then wrote instructions for playing the game. Overall, sensitization increased the number of essential ideas expressed, but did not affect clarity of expression. It increased  the number of words written by the youngest subjects and decreased the number written by the oldest, and had the effect of nullifying a steep rise in wordiness observed between grades six and eleven among control subjects. Results suggested that an underlying growth in role-taking capacity manifests itself in different surface characteristics of writing at different ages. (Author)",

The potential each of these content types has for constructing mass communication theories is discussed. The second half of the paper reports on five content analyses concerning the 1960 and 1976 presidential debates in order to illustrate the kind of research that can be conducted on two of the four content types identified. These five content analyses covered the major issues  discussed, media coverage of the debates, relationship between public issues and the issues debated, imagery used by the candidates in debate, and individual differences in fluency.

Teachers can motivate students to read by identifying the reasons for reading, showing students what benefits various reading materials offer. Teachers can also encourage students to read by expressing interest in the books that students have read (asking questions and suggesting other reading materials on the same subject) and by making books accessible in the classroom (developing a classroom library and setting aside class time for independent reading). Once the children have been motivated to read, teachers should introduce them to quality literature. This can be done by considering students' individual interests  when choosing books for required reading, by having faith in students' reading abilities (not dominating discussion of a book and not analyzing the book's content in great detail), by using the original version of a literary work rather than an abridged version, by encouraging students to share books and discuss reading materials, and by involving parents in their children's reading activities.

Seven hundred twenty-one children in grades four, six, and eight responded to a questionnaire listing 29 television programs appearing in one season and indicated the frequency of viewing for each program. In addition, an index of social behavior was constructed to rate each child on the four areas of behavior under consideration, and a random subsample of 293 mothers of these children participated in the study by viewing television with  their children.

        "description":"This paper begins with a description of four generations of research in machine translation: the original efforts of 1957 to 1965 and three types of surviving and sometimes competing present projects. The three types of present projects include those relying on \"brute force\" methods involving larger and faster computers; those based on a linguistic tradition which asserts that knowledge required for machine translation can be assimilated to the structure of a grammar-based system with a semantic component; and those stemming from artificial intelligence research, with an emphasis on knowledge structures. The paper argues that the artificial intelligence approach has the best chance of simulating the communicative abilities necessary for realistic machine translation and gives an  account of how knowledge structures might cope with one of the classic problems of machine translation: that of metaphor, or \"semantic boundary breaking.\" (AA)",

        "description":"This study examined the content of newspapers from six geographic regions of the United States during three time periods preceding the Civil War (1820 to 1835, 1836 to 1846, and 1847 to 1860). The news articles were coded in nine general categories and rank-ordered for each region. Results indicate that quite similar news sources and news values were employed by reporters and editors in the different areas of the country, in spite of widening social, political, and economic gaps that led to the Civil War. General political, general community, and intellectual/cultural news received heavy emphasis during all three time periods, while news concerning slavery and abolition, sectional differences, and education received relatively little emphasis. Since the results of this study  conflict with the contemporary theory of the press's agenda-setting function, further research exploring the processes of news selection and emphasis during the 1820-1860 period is proposed.

        "description":"Shakespeare's lifetime coincided with the consolidation of modern capitalism, and his plays reveal his interest in economics--defined as a rational system for calculating and comparing the value of commodities--and especially the economics of time. Shakespeare's plays offer a critique of the new capitalism by showing the extent to which it can and cannot be applied to time, the commodity people value most. In &quot;Henry IV,&quot; Hal acts as a kind of temporal financier, investing time according to sound economic principles in order to redeem it at a high rate of return. In &quot;All's Well That Ends Well,&quot; Helena teaches the king that the value of time is qualitative rather than quantitative, thereby transcending capitalism's assumption that a small amount of time, even if joyful, cannot be  more valuable than a longer time, even if of despair. Shakespeare's conception of the laws of economics delineates the outer limits of his romanticism: characters in his plays never reach the utopia of time standing still, but rather attain happiness only as the end product of enduring less desirable times and organizing time to their own advantage. In this way, Shakespeare's characters attain the theatrical illusion of enlarging the boundaries of life and momentarily suspending the tyranny of time. (CC)",

        "description":"According to one sociological model, news is a product of socially determined notions of who and what is important and the organizational structures that result for routinizing news collection; events that deviate from these notions are ignored. This report describes a study of crime news coverage in the media that used this model to examine the following: the determinants of newsmaking, frequency of presentation, prominence of placement, and source of news flow. The data for this study came from a year-long content analysis of six daily newspapers, one weekly paper, and nightly newscasts on three national and two local television stations. The analysis reveals that individual crime receives three to four times as much attention as other issues in all of the news sources  considered. The study then evaluated the vast amount of crime news coverage according to three norms: the hierarchy of social significance, the hierarchy of audience preference, and the mirror of society concept. Nine data tables and extensive notes accompany the report. (MAI)",

These taxonomies are compared to data from a survey of composition programs at fourteen colleges and universities, providing a critical analysis of each program's content, scheduling procedures, and evaluation/assessment methods. Although most of the programs emphasized the expository prose model, recent trends in program development reflect attention to contemporary issues: a shift from literary toward essay models, a shift from essay toward editing models, and increased  emphasis on conferences with individual students. The concluding section focuses on future research and assessment needs within the context of this study's theoretical framework and preliminary findings.

        "description":"Communication researchers have typically specified either cognitions or behaviors as the crucial units of analysis. This cognitive/behavioral dichotomy is evident in current conceptualizations of social relationship as a summative combination of separate behaviors, or a joint product that goes beyond the constituent parts. Choosing cognitive or behavioral data further implies epistemological choices between prospection/retrospection, conditional/stochastic probability, compositional/evolutionary explanation, and global/abstractive laws. In arguing that concomitant cognitive-behavioral research has been underutilized as a viable alternative for examining relational processes, this essay stresses the importance of being sensitized to those underlying epistemological assumptions  governing inquiry. Research on intimacy and on developmental, rules-based, reciprocal aspects of relational communication are highlighted as potential areas for cognitive-behavioral convergence within the communication discipline.

It then describes the use of the Delphi method in obtaining communication scholars' responses to the following questions: Which societal problems are perceived as having a high priority? Are priority assessments changed when problems are viewed interdependently instead of independently? Does the communication field have current or  future resources that can be applied toward the solution of priority problems?

It then proposes definitions of situation, genre, and movement together with axioms detailing the connections existing among the three concepts.

Post-Civil War songs and dances defy the degradation of the slave experience and convey a buoyant hope for a better future. The contemporary games of black children, selected from a sample of children in the Buffalo (New York) black community, comment on sexuality, health, looks, and parental influence. Some games teach cause and consequence concepts or emphasize counting and learning the alphabet; others act out nonverbally the awareness of social roles and  behavior. All of these games demonstrate the creative energy that black children exert in meeting the oppressive conditions that exist in their lives. (MAI)",

Analysis of the data revealed that correlations for the three measures were statistically significant and that, with the effects of innovation removed, the correlation between open communication and perceived success was no longer statistically significant.

Among the most evident findings was the importance of teacher perception of administrative support. The presence of a well-defined agreement and understanding between teachers and principals regarding the locus of responsibility and authority at higher-achieving schools  was noted. The study also noted very different classroom behaviors exhibited by teachers in higher-achieving schools and different grouping practices between higher- and lower-achieving schools. Furthermore, higher-achieving schools reported spending more time on social studies instruction and less time on mathematics. (Author/JG)",

It focuses on the process of planning, rather than on the process of writing a plan, and therefore does not include any planning forms or instructions for using such forms. Separate sections of the handbook examine the planning process in general, describe three different planning models that are applicable to schools, and discuss what school improvement is and what the planning process should accomplish. Most of the handbook describes in turn the three planning models, which include the component development model, the integrated program model, and the u-do-it model. (JG)",

Nichols that was held in Austin, Texas, June 17-18, 1976. The conference was designed around eight panel discussions that focused on the following topics: 1) analysis of performance variables affecting use of dominant language in bilingual settings, 2) review of research on culturally based learning behaviors, 3) analysis of the nature and importance of culturally responsive programs, 4) analysis of the dynamics of first and second language acquisition in the context of general cognitive development, 5) review of current bilingual/multicultural programs and models, 6) analysis of culturally based process variables, 7) discussion  of potential administrative problems and solutions in implementing bilingual/multicultural programs, and 8) review of statutory and judicial bases for bilingual program implementation. The report is divided into separate sections for each panel discussion. Each panel report begins by identifying the panel participants, then presents in turn the text of the investigators' papers, excerpts from the discussants' remarks, and a brief synopsis of the floor discussion.

WIS-SIM is a management information system designed to support management processes in Individually Guided Education programs. The evaluation design, which is based on perceptual and judgmental information from users as well as objective data on system operation, examines the functioning, utilization, and effects of the system. Inservice training for computer-terminal aides, teachers, principals, and school-level coordinators was found to be essential for effective system functioning. System utilization varied greatly from school to school, and those schools that used WIS-SIM most frequently appeared  to be most satisfied with it. Evidence on effects of the system suggests it reduced the amount of time required for clerical tasks. Teachers reported that the hours spent on planning did not change, but the effectiveness of time spent on planning increased. Student achievement showed an increasing trend, but these changes cannot be directly attributed to WIS-SIM implementation. WIS-SIM was found to be more cost-effective as a management tool than as a recordkeeping system. (Author/JG)",

Damage to these buildings from the tornadoes was examined by teams of specially trained architectural and engineering faculty, the various building administrators, and representatives of the architectural firm that designed the buildings. From these studies, guidance has been developed on selecting best-available shelter from high winds in existing buildings. Information in the brochure can also be useful to architects and  engineers in designing new buildings that would offer protection from high winds. (Author/MLF)",

Specifically, three major issues are addressed: Are school districts adequately compensated for federally imposed burdens? Are impact aid funds equitably distributed in terms of district needs and federal impact? Does impact aid interfere with state equalization programs?

It examines the effectiveness of school finance reform solely in terms of results--the resource levels made available in the school districts of a state and the relation between resources and local wealth. The section dealing with the changes in disparity is organized around three questions: What changes have taken place between 1970 and 1975 in overall disparities in the states? What kinds of districts have gained and lost from those changes? What are the costs of further equalization? The section discussing the reform states summarizes the results in all twenty states and then discusses the  characteristics of the reforms in each state. Although reform efforts appear to have been swimming against a national tide of increasing disparity, most of the states in which disparities showed substantial increases were nonreform states, most of the states in which disparities were substantially reduced were reform, and most of the states in which resources to low-wealth and urban districts decreased were nonreform.

The results of the study provide evidence supporting the theory linking the complexity of a school district with electoral competition and with open conflict on the board and between the board and the superintendent. The two board members elected in 1977 formed a majority with the dissident board member, and the superintendent resigned as the board made policy changes. Conflict and competition helped the winning candidates resist socialization pressures and maintain an independent posture, since they believed that they had a mandate from the entire community, not just from specific constituencies. It appears that the relationships  identified in political theory may not necessarily represent democratic influence on policy formation at the school board level. (Author)",

The dilemmas of social policy (family autonomy versus coercive intervention) and professional response (compassion versus control) are explained and discussed. Problems with the medical and legal responses to child abuse are reviewed. Outlined are several areas for potential conflicts between medical and legal perspectives, including the importance of the abuser's mental state and the seriousness of the injury. The selective ascertainment of marginal families for the attention of child protection professionals is  discussed in relation to the social construction of medicine and law. Guidelines are offered to minimize the abuse of power of the professional definers. (Author/SBH)",

This report is the first stage in a research project into the social dimensions of language use within the Chicano speech community, and the first phase of a cumulative research strategy in Chicano sociolinguistics. The central concern of the report is to examine the association between the reported language use of these adolescents for given social situations and their language dominance. A total of 75 students, 33 males and 42 females, in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh grades participated in the study. The relationship between linguistic proficiency and language use was investigated by means of the Bilingual Syntax Measure  II, and language usage was investigated by means of a sociolinguistic questionnaire. Maintenance of and loyalty to the Spanish language were found to be very high for the subjects. Specifically, results show that: (1) linguistic dominance and language use are closely associated; (2) there is a high level of Spanish language use in the family; and (3) there is widespread use of Spanish language mass media.

Problems also arise when an attempt is made to extend observed foreign behavior to situations which a native speaker would avoid. A &quot;small c&quot; cultural presentation should be part of language teaching from the beginning level through the civilization course. Recent  methodological innovations, such as the audio-motor unit, can be useful in setting a context for sociocultural information. (Author/CFM)",

These commercials can be used initially as comprehension exercises and, later, as the basis for discussion about American culture. Simple comprehension questions can be followed by a cloze-dictation exercise, and then by role-playing, values clarification exercises,  discussion questions, and contact assignments. A sample classroom technique is appended. (Author/AM)",

The basic assumption of these materials is that effective writing demands a clear sense of why something is being written, and for whom it is being written. The materials are organized according to the language functions that typically occur within academic papers, such as: focusing, substantiating, recommending and predicting. Within each function, students are presented with a variety of voices and audiences. The main advantage of this approach is that it provides the teacher and the students with a framework in which to judge whether or not the writing is effective in terms of a specific purpose, and appropriate in terms  of a specific situation.

Four monolingual children were recorded at two week intervals, beginning when the children were about 1;6. Data provided evidence for three general stages: (1) the child has no contrast; (2) the child has a contrast but one that falls within the adult perceptual boundaries of one (usually voiced) phoneme and thus is presumably not perceptible to adults; and (3) the child has a contrast that resembles the adult contrast. The rate and nature of the developmental process are discussed briefly in relation to two competing models for phonological acquisition and two hypotheses regarding the skills being learned.

The first, \"A Shopping Game,\" by Gordon Hartig, is played on a game board in the German classroom and provides practice in producing sentences with the preposition \"in,\" which in some instances takes the dative and in others takes the accusative. A diagram of the game board is included. The second game, by Pat Morrison, is called \"Donde Iras -- Donde Estas?\" and is designed to provide the student with a form of \"survival Spanish.\" Students, for example, must answer a question which proposes a \"problem,\" such as, \"You have the flu -- where will you go?\" On another occasion the students themselves may make up the problems to be answered. The third game, \"French Game: Variations on Vocabulary,\" describes ways of  drilling vocabulary. One of the variations is to give the students a list of French words (such as those for \"cloud,\"\"rice,\"\"cotton,\"\"paper,\" and \"lily\") and they must say in French what these words have in common (in this case, they are \"all white\"). The final game, \"Game Time in Italian,\" by Georgiana Augulli, is designed as a review of verbs that have been taught and drilled. Each student is given a game board (an empty verb chart) and an envelope containing various verb forms written on slips of paper. The object of the game is to put the verbs in the correct places on the chart as quickly as possible. (CFM)",

Groups of intermediate and of advanced EFL students listened to tape recordings and rated each sentence in terms of prescriptive grammaticality and social acceptability. Listeners were then presented with the subset of deviant sentences. They were asked to correct the errors and to indicate the extent to which each of the errors bothered or irritated them. Thus, it was possible to examine listeners' reactions to various types of errors and to map out the hierarchy of acceptability of  various deviant utterances produced by native and non-native speakers.

The first, and most predominant, is the unit microwave cycle. These cycles divide the learning process into two basic phases, the first of which involves mimicry, memorization, and manipulation. The second phase involves the conversational application of the first phase. The second type of learning activity consists of various kinds of drill exercises: substitution, repetition, transformation, conversation and question-and-answer drills. The third type of learning activity is analysis of the language. Simplified explanations are given of structural items in previous lessons. The fourth type of learning activity involves  task-oriented situations, model village and slide exercises, and role plays, to help the student gradually become accustomed to combinations of sounds and phrases. The text is divided into five sections, each consisting of cycles, drills and grammar notes that concentrate on a limited number of sentence patterns and structural items. Suggested supplements follow each section. Effective use of the materials presupposes the use of language props to teach vocabulary. In addition, the units are designed to be used as a basis for conversation between student and instructor and between students. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"A survey involving 125 students who voluntarily withdrew from the State University College at Oswego, was conducted to determine student characteristics and their reasons for withdrawing, as well as to examine suggestions for reducing attrition. Examination of the data suggests that seniors withdrew less frequently than did members of other classes, males and females withdrew at approximately the same rates, and students in Arts and Science tend to withdraw more frequently than did students in Professional Studies. The relationship between the student's major or concentration and the decision to withdraw was weak when enrollment was taken into account. It was found that students most frequently withdrew because they were not satisfied with their academic program, had changed  their career goal, or had insufficient financial resources. On the basis of a PATH analysis (a specialized regression procedure), it was concluded that there was a weak but significant relationship between student characteristics, the underlying reasons for withdrawal, and the student's plans for the future. Suggestions from students on ways to reduce attrition include: (1) increasing programs offered; (2) increasing financial aid; (3) shiftinq emphasis of colleqe; (4) offering educational counseling or assistance; and (5) changing housing accommodations.

It outlines a method by which foreign student advisers and others working with foreign students can provide such learning opportunities for college credit, thus establishing themselves as persons who provide direct education for students in addition to supportive services. A massive expansion of existing programs is advocated so that intercultural learning can be available to a large group of students and faculty. The program &quot;Learning with Foreign Students&quot; was developed at the University of Minnesota and is described as an example of an intercultural learning  program.

Information about approvals terminations, and adjustments in doctoral programs from July l, 1974 to June 30, 1977 was compiled from a survey of State Higher Education Executive Officers in the 13 western states completed in December 1977. From program changes between July 1, 1974 and December 13, 1976, only the program titles and HEGIS codes are requested. For programs undergoing changes after January 1, 1977 data concerning location, description, enrollment, and degrees conferred were gathered. Data provided by the State Education Agencies are presented with no attempt at  analysis or conclusions. The ratio of approved doctoral programs to terminated programs in the West is approximately 3.4 to 1 (from this survey for 1974 to 1977) as compared to the national ratio of 5.9 to 1 (for 1971 to 1976). Other than this observation, no clear patterns of changes in doctoral programs are evident from the summary table. (Author)",

Six issues can be isolated in the question of one-year salary increase policies: (1) What should be the overall percentage or average dollar amount increase in faculty salaries?; (2) To what degree should the academic salary policy be based upon market considerations, and what is the appropriate market?; (3) Should the policy differ by academic rank or discipline?; (4) Should the academic  policy and the nonacademic policy be uniform?; (5) To what degree will increases be based on merit, cost-of-living, and equity considerations?; (6) How is merit to be determined?

The results are preliminary since more data are still being collected. A total of 176 institutions were surveyed, ranging from two-year colleges and specialized professional schools to major doctoral-granting universities, and the preliminary response rate was approximately 50 percent. Areas surveyed included: production/use of educational materials; patents and inventions; paid sabbatical leaves; continuing education/extension; conflict of interest; and internal load and overload. Across all policy areas surveyed, board knowledge, current involvement, and future involvement tended to be moderate or less, although  anticipated future involvement was significantly greater than current involvement ratings. Chairpersons indicated that relatively little of their responsibility for any of these areas should be delegated to faculty, administration, or students. It is concluded that the governing boards often have legal responsibility for these policy areas and are unwilling to delegate responsibility for them, but have only limited knowledge of what policies exist at their own institutions and are not planning to become heavily involved with them.

The major fringe benefits included in the survey are: (1) social security; (2) retirement; (3) medical insurance, life insurance, guaranteed disability income protection, unemployment  compensation, and workman's compensation; (4) tuition for faculty children; (5) housing benefits; and (6) other benefits.

The data used in this study were derived from anonymous questionnaires completed by a representative national sample of 7,261 medical students.

Income variables used in the analyses are the student's sources of income and type of income. Comparisons of these incomes variables (as well as expense variables) were made across quartiles. From the findings, two basic patterns  emerge regarding medical student financing, each associated with a certain type of medical school. Students enrolled in private, high-tuition, research-oriented schools tended to depend more on scholarships/non-repayable funds, loans, and contributions from parents. Those attending schools that were public, low-tuition, and less research oriented depended more on funds contributed by their spouses. (Author/SPG)",

        "description":"To test Tinto's theory of college attrition, a longitudinal study involving 766 students enrolled in Syracuse University in September 1975 was conducted to determine whether freshmen persisters and voluntary dropouts differed on certain attitudinal and behavioral measures of academic and social integration once selected background characteristics had been statistically controlled. Multiple regression was used to assess the relative importance of four sets of variables: pre-college characteristics; level of academic integration; level of social integration; and interactions between sex, major, and racial or ethnic origins and each of the social and academic integration variables. The results indicate that pre-college traits are not significantly related to attrition, but that the  other three sets are, with the interactions explaining the largest proportion of the variance, followed by the academic and social integration sets in that order. These findings suggest that Tinto's theory may be conceptually useful in studying attrition, but also that certain revisions in the model may be needed. (Author/SPG)",

The POMR is a system for the documentation of patient care consisting of four related components: a data base, problem list, initial plans for each problem, and progress notes, including information assessment and any revisions of the plan. The bibliography is designed to assist in determining the areas in which the problem-oriented record can assist, and the areas in which further development is required. The literature is reviewed in five categories: (1) the nursing process; (2) the POMR; (3) nursing and the POMR; (4) the computerized POMR; and (5) nursing and the  computerized POMR. The bibliography of 680 items is divided into two sections: the nursing process and the problem oriented record and/or system. Access is provided by content area and an author index. (Author/KP)",

The unique quality of the computer that makes a revolution possible is that it can serve not only as a cognitive tool but as an active agent, in a way that books and television cannot. In this context, a new paradigm is emerging that will provide computers with an ability to understand the learner by representing problem-solving expertise within the computer, building models of the learner's skills, and communicating in English rather than programing languages. Three prototypes are discussed which manifest some of the capabilities that could be  realized in tomorrow's learning environment. The first explores a potential transformation of technical education through the computer acting as consultant; the second explores the potential for a fundamental change in educational evaluation through the computer acting as assistant; and the third explores the potential for a renaissance of education in the home through the computer acting as coach.

From a developmental point of view, the modular design of BLOCKS provides a working framework within which to explore different monitoring functions and various tutoring strategies. From an educational viewpoint, BLOCKS provides a dramatic example of the potential of a computerized intelligent tutor in a laboratory environment. By monitoring the student's behavior, the system can notice interesting situations and direct the student's attention to them. In this way, the computer can provide  conceptual structure and guidance to a student's otherwise undirected experiences. (Author/VT)",

An attempt to replicate these correlations on the same population of university undergraduates in the present study yielded markedly lower correlations. Nonproportional sampling techniques may have spuriously inflated the earlier reported correlations. Subsequent attempts to correct these correlations for the biases introduced by nonproportional sampling led to the development of a new technique to correct an inflated correlation. This procedure empirically modifies the distribution of scores to reflect the normative distribution, and has implications for correlational research using nonproportional or extreme groups designs. It appears that there is a relationship  between hypnotizability and speed of closure, though not of the magnititude suggested by Crawford. (Author/VT)",

The format of the course include each week one lecture session and one library practicum. The lecture is both informational and motivational; it provides the student with an overview of (1) the research procedure to be used that week in the library, (2) the library resource to be  accessed and utilized, and (3) selected critical thinking skill exercises which will support the research procedure and use of the library resource (e.g. making classifications, producing analogies, paraphrasing, summarizing). The practicum, which is designed to allow the student to pursue self-paced learning, begins with modelling by the instructor of the research procedure and use of the library resource. Students are then guided by a carefully structured worksheet. An outline of the lecture and practicum components and examples of the worksheets are included. (Author/JAB)",

        "description":"The goal of the present project was to identify the types of knowledge necessary and useful for competent troubleshooting/debugging and to examine how new approaches to formal instruction might influence the attainment of competence by students. The research focused on the role of general strategies in troubleshooting/debugging, and how they might be represented and taught explicitly and directly in order to avoid the cost and other drawbacks of learning indirectly by observation and practice. Related work on troubleshooting/debugging was examined, and in conjunction with a logical analysis, contributed to a characterization of troubleshooting/debugging problems that emphasizes their generality across a number of technical fields and informal contexts. Further data gathered from  students learning computer programming suggest that expert debuggers do not necessarily have superior general strategies; rather, their expertise derives from specific and sometimes idiosyncratic knowledge acquired through experience. An attempt to obtain a rigorous characterization of the differences and defects in the debugging strategy of students by applying a model-oriented data analysis method was unsuccessful. Another study was conducted to determine the effects of presenting a tutorial text which describes a few general heuristics designed to correct strategy deficits; results indicated a marginal increase in the apparent use of some of the heuristics by those who studied the text compared to a group who did not. The several methodological limitations and problems encountered  suggest that, if the causes of differences in ability are to be specified in detail, and if the effects of direct problem-solving instruction are to be assessed, then it will be necessary to perfect model-based data analysis methods.

The reformulation measure provides the problem-solver with new ways of looking at the goal or task, and is mediated by the closeness measure. These two ideas are applied to several traditional problems. (Author/DAG)",

An introductory essay enumerates the major elements of IC; provides a definition of IC as it is used in the context of the bibliography; reviews various approaches to IC in the professional literature; and discusses the interdisciplinary perspectives with which IC can be identified and the three primary areas where IC occurs--information and referral service, adult education counseling, and library reference interview. This is followed by a list of references cited in the  essay and a bibliography of ERIC documents together with selected journal articles cited in the Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE). Entries were selected for inclusion by the following criteria: (1) programs or experiments described were characteristic of the diversity of new trends and practices; (2) each study illustrates some of the elements that are common among these trends and practices; and (3) each fits into an interdisciplinary framework. Sources included range from research reports to subjective descriptions of programs.

Students' ACT Social Science scores were found to be closely related to GPA's. For transfer program students, it was found that high GPA was positively related to high school class rank and negatively related to age, time  elapsed since high school, marital status, and full-time employment; the contractual institution where students took a majority of their classes did not seem to be a determinant in final GPA at JWCC; and JWCC transfer program students were much like their traditional college student counterparts. For occupational students, it was found that GPA was positively related to high school rank, father's educational level, being female, and being employed part-time. Differences between transfer and occupational students were indicated: transfer program students had significantly higher high school GPA's and class ranks and came from families with significantly higher incomes.

Consortium goals were to provide in-service, staff development opportunities for the instructional faculties of the consortium's member colleges (three community colleges and a state university) and through these activities to become an integrative resource focusing on regional developmental needs. The consortium chose to concentrate on three dimensions of the development process: professional, curricular, and institutional. A competitive &quot;mini-grant&quot; proposal procedure was selected to effect the development process. The first competition round took place in December 1977 and the second in March 1978. Seven proposals were approved  covering such subjects as reading, art, political science, education, mathematics, nursing, and biological science. The consortium coordinator initiated a series of processes necessary in realizing consortium goals; these included publishing a quarterly newsletter, residential consultation, and opening a consortium office. The first year of the consortium seemed to support the validity of the concept in engaging staff development needs. A staff development proposal format is appended. (TR)",

Data on the disproportionate incidence of accident involvement among young cyclists include statistics on fatalities, injuries and cyclist behavior. A general description of the cognitive development process in children is presented, with specific discussion of the development of concepts of speed, time and distance, and the concept of rules. Results of a survey of 1,373 parents of 2,764 children, aged 5 to 13, in which parents selected an average minimum age of about 11 years, indicate good-to-enthusiastic parent  support of the minimum age idea. The report concludes: (1) that the cognitive deficiencies associated with the incompletely developed child justify a mimimum age of 13 years or older for cyclists using public roadways and (2) that registration of bicycle operators using public roadways is the best way to enforce this minimum age requirement. An introductory statement by the project director suggests a minimum age requirement of 9 years and presents additional opinions on licensing and bicycle safety education. (BF)",

        "description":"This thesis reports a study of the effects of two types of advance organizer instruction, expository (EO) and guided self-discovery (GSDO), in teaching hierarchical classification or relations to preschool children. In the study, four experimental and one control group received three 25 minute instructional sessions. Using the same materials, experimental groups received either EO or GSDO instruction in classification or relations. Straightforward statements were made in EO instruction, and guiding questions were used in the GSDO lessons. In the control group, teachers used the same materials without the EO or GSDO teaching methods. Eight pre and posttests measured spontaneous classification, class inclusion, additive seriation, and one-to-one correspondence. Transfer tasks,  administered six weeks after training, consisted of cross classification and cross seriation in a 3 x 3 matrix, spontaneous classification and one-to-one correspondence problem solving tasks, and conservation of area and number. Results indicated that both organizer groups outperformed the control group, and performance by EO groups was significantly superior to GSDO groups. The effectiveness of the EO method of instruction with preschool children was evidenced by the duration of training effects up to 10 weeks, and transfer task performance at 14 weeks after instruction.

The first section defines some of the terms frequently used in discussions of mainstreaming. These terms include mainstreaming; normalization; P. L. 94-142, the law providing for education for all handicapped children; and IEP, the Individualized Education Plan. The second section presents a discussion of both the legal and legislative arguments used in favor of mainstreaming and the potential benefits of mainstreaming for handicapped and nonhandicapped children. The third section reviews research related to social interactions in integrated preschool settings. This review includes research on spontaneous interactions, the facilitation of  interactions, and recommendations for future research in this area. The fourth section of the paper describes preschool programs which have successfully integrated handicapped and nonhandicapped children. The programs described include center- and research-based programs, transitional programs, and open education approaches. The final section of the paper discusses some of the issues involved in preschool mainstreaming. This discussion focuses on the training of personnel, the identification of the components of successful programs, the mainstreaming of severely handicapped children, the arrangement of the environment, and criteria for the evaluation of integrated programs.

The paper suggests that many of the problems inherent in the design of both the program and the evaluation stem from the underlying assumption that one educational model could be found which would best alleviate the educational problems of the poor. The paper suggests that even when the original evaluation design was modified, substantial problems remained. The major issues and problems discussed in the paper include: (1) the belief in the existence of a best program; (2) the problem of relying on test scores; (3) the issue of program staff knowing the content of evaluation instruments and teaching to the test; (4) problems involved in designing or choosing  valid instruments; (5) the existence of large intersite variations within the same models; (6) problems involved in implementing a particular model in varying sites; (7) statistical problems, particularly in the use of the analysis of covariance and the use of individual rather than class scores in the present evaluation; (8) problems involved in large scale experiments; (9) the fairness of the evaluation in terms of original intentions and later changes; (10) press coverage which tended to distort evaluation results, especially the invalid assumption that the basic skills programs were the most effective; and, (11) general questions of government policies which shaped the evaluation procedures and led to many of the subsequent problems.

A family day care agency is an organization which assumes responsibility for administering and operating several family day care homes. Generally, the agency is responsible for establishment of policy, recruitment, and screening of day care homes, and ongoing training and supervision. In most cases an agency is also responsible for recruitment of children, payment of caregivers, providing information and referral for parents seeking placement for their children, and furnishing social services to parents. The program descriptions in this booklet focus on the following program aspects: (1) history and development of  the organization; (2) description of the ongoing operation; (3) role of the staff; (4) role of the family day care provider; (5) program accomplishments and (6) program concerns.

The first section of the paper reviews developmental changes in children's play behaviors from infancy through the preschool years. Observational and experimental studies of children's play and the concomitant use of symbols during this period are presented and discussed. The second section of the paper discusses some of the theoretical issues and controversies involved in the interpretation of pretend play. This section describes and compares functional and structural approaches to the study of  play behaviors.

Four preschool children served as subjects, with four others serving as cross-sex companions. The companion child was never involved in any experimental manipulations but was included to reduce situational demand characteristics. Two male undergraduates established histories of nurturant or nonnurturant interactions with the subject children. Each child was asked to choose which of the two adult males he or she wanted to work with, to sort colored tokens into a box, and to draw something with one of four colored crayons after  observing the two adult males drawing with the crayons. Results showed that the positive (nurturant) adults were consistently able to develop and maintain higher response rates on the sorting task than the neutral (nonnurturant) adults and that their nurturance was reciprocated by social preference. However, clear incidental imitation of the adult's crayon choices was shown by only one child, while picture content imitation was even more weakly displayed. (JMB)",

The primary measure used was the Barclay Classroom Climate Inventory (BCCI). The scales of the BCCI dealing with overall self-competency, group interaction, career development, teacher ratings, and attitudes toward school were used in this analysis. Data from self, peer, and teacher were scored for each child and merged by computer for the BCCI report.  Data were analyzed by year, by sex, by school and separately for children who were in attendance only part of the year. Results indicated that the experimental and traditional school children differed in three significant ways: the experimental children were higher than their traditional school counterparts in overall self-competency, positive teacher ratings, and attitudes toward school.

The curriculum was designed so that tribal girls could see the many career options they have, that they realize that preparation for many careers starts in high school, that each girl has special talents and characteristics, that there are disadvantages in being a teenage mother, and that there are some skills which enhance one's choices and some barriers which reduce one's choices. The project design and curriculum could be used by tribal groups in an effort to assist young tribal women to develop their potential and abilities. However, there are some  general factors to consider when planning and implementing the program. This paper gives various ideas for implementing the program in other tribal communities. Topics covered are planning and implementing the program; needs for the program (i.e., space, program length and timing, resource people); staffing (i.e., part-time, full-time, selection of staff, training); programming with girls and adults; curriculum for girls; and career conferences.

The sample was limited to heads of households who had lived in their present location from one to five years. Males accounted for 84% of the sample. Characteristics measured were family size, level of education (the majority had less than a fourth grade education), age, and age at migration. Better employment was found to be the biggest factor in interanl migration, having motivated more than 50%. Change of occupation had occurred for one-fourth of the migrants, with a significant increase in percentages of heads of households employed in government,  semi-skilled occupations, food processing, personal services, community sales, and unskilled work. Though recent migrants greatly improved their work opportunities by moving, employment of these unskilled migrants as rural-urban migration continues would seem to hinge on growth of traditional sector jobs in urban areas. Further implications were for more rural educational opportunities, the need to create rural farm and nonfarm employment opportunities, and increased investment in rural infrastructure. (RS)",

        "description":"Problems unique to social workers in rural areas prompted the Southern Regional Education Board to set up a task force to focus on an educational program specifically for rural social work practitioners. The task force report (encompassing differences in rural farm, rural nonfarm, and rural industrial areas) includes educational objectives, special competency areas, curriculum models, and teaching resources necessary to provide education for social workers in the rural South. Summaries of two meetings on rural social work held in New Orleans, La., and Atlanta, Ga., in 1971 outline differences in urban and rural social work as well as curriculum content needed for rural practice. Statements developed on educational assumptions and objectives and a guideline for doing a rural  profile (analysis of services, geography, size, and people) are presented. Two papers describe rural social work programs at West Virginia University and University of Tennessee at Martin, and another covers the philosophy of an Appalachian Studies Program, along with its syllabus and reading lists. Remaining papers deal with rural field experience, education for rural program development, social service needs and delivery, and a proposed course in rural human services, including bibliography. There is a three-page list of additional reference material and resources on rural topics. (RS)",

        "description":"Longitudinal changes in satisfaction with selected community services were examined in three nonmetropolitan counties in central Alabama, focusing on variation in changes across three groups (government officials, business leaders, household respondents) and on the relation of changes in satisfaction for individual services to overall community satisfaction. Interviews were conducted in 1974 and 1977, with longitudinal data available for 110 business leaders, 92 government officials, and 101 household residents. Services rated were water, sewage, garbage, telephone, fire protection, health care, public schools, and recreation. In general, levels of satisfaction of officials and business respondents toward services increased, while those of household residents declined. However,  households showed a greater increase in overall community satisfaction, indicating a relative absence of relationship between change in satisfaction with services and change in overall community satisfaction. As for influence of community group membership, government officials held consistently more positive views of services over time than either business leaders or household respondents. Dissatisfaction was greatest for all groups with recreation. There was little support for the thesis that increased movement to rural areas is tied to greater satisfaction with rural community services. (RS)",

        "description":"In the summer of 1970, ten projects served a total of 1,200 migrant students ranging from pre-school toddlers to teenagers in the 8th grade. The greatest concentration was in the early elementary grades. Most of the students were of Mexican descent and from the lower Rio Grande area of Texas. Program objectives were to: improve the child's language and communication skills; increase active participation in the total learning environment; increase pride in the child's cultural heritage; provide an environment promoting active communication and exposure to work alternatives which encouraged socially and economically self-sufficient citizens. Major emphases were language arts and the improvement of the student's self-image or self-concept. Project aides were used to give students  more individualized attention. Music, art, physical education and recreational activities, and health and nutrition activities were also provided. Most of the projects made an effort to encourage community and parental involvement. The program was evaluated using some 15 instruments (i.e., parent and community interviews, achievement tests, and questionnaires) and participant observations. Evaluation findings indicated that the program was successful in achieving active student involvement in the total learning environment, in contributing to student competence in English language communication, and in maintaining the interest of students in school.

        "description":"The Food Stamp Program allows low-income households to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet through normal channels of trade. Because of the generally low income of hired farmworkers, food stamp assistance is an important addition to the economic and nutritional status of these workers and their families. This report presents a socioeconomic profile of approximately 207,000 hired farmworker families (including 9,000 migrant families) participating in the Food Stamp Program in November 1975 and identifies various factors related to program participation. Family income and size, ethnicity, and region were examined through comparative analyses of farmworker families, farmworker food stamp families, and U.S. food stamp families. Data were obtained in December 1975 from the annual  Hired Farm Working Force survey and from the December 1975 Current Population Survey. These families contained approximately 1.1 million family members, averaging 5.3 members per family. Hired farmworker families were almost twice as likely to participate in the Food Stamp Program as all U.S. families. Family income and size, ethnicity, and region were highly associated with farmworker family participation. In addition, the socioeconomic characteristics of farmworker food stamp families differed considerably from those of all hired farmworker families and all U.S. families receiving food stamps.

        "description":"This report summarizes the major findings and recommendations of the 1977 British Columbia Mathematics Assessment which was designed to inform the public of some of the strengths and weaknesses of the British Columbia school system. Over 100,000 students from Grades 4, 8, and 12 were given tests designed to measure mastery of a limited number of important mathematical skills and concepts. Approximately 3,500 teachers of mathematics at seven different grade levels (1,3,4,7,8,10,12) completed comprehensive questionnaires dealing with numerous aspects of the methods and materials in the teaching of mathematics in the province. A more complete rendering of the results of the Assessment may be found in the three other reports in the series. (MN)",

Career achievements of these individuals are discussed in terms of the following criteria: doctorate attainment, postdoctoral fellowship awards, faculty membership, dissertation adviser status, migration from Ph.D. institution to employment, research grant awards, postdoctoral employment, and publications and citations. Data on career outcomes are presented in tabular form and occasionally interpreted in graphic displays. Where feasible, comparative data on the corresponding base population of Ph.D.'s is presented. Among the major findings were: (1) 84% of the Fellows of the 1950s had attained doctorates by 1974; (2)  the mean time lapse from B.A. to Ph.D. degress for NSF Fellows was about 30% less than for the comparable Ph.D.; and (3) former NSF Fellows are much more frequent contributors to the scientific literature than the typical Ph.D.'s are.
