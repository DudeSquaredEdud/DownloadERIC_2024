        "description":"This publication presents an analytical summary of theories and problems of the honors approach in relation to programs for superior students who plan to enter the teaching profession. It describes some of the problems encountered with the establishment, operation, and evaluation of such programs, and suggests what their impact may be upon the quality emphasis in individual schools and in education as a whole. The proceedings transcripts upon which it is based are the verbatim account of the \"Honors and the Preparation of Teachers\" conference, April 8-10, 1962, held at the University of Wisconsin. Areas discussed include: the significance of honors programs for teacher education, their place in preparing elementary and secondary education majors, discussions of content, method,  cooperation, selection procedures, guidance of participants, and program evaluation. The impact of honors programs on education in the schools is examined from the viewpoints of teacher recruitment and retention and program costs. Appendixes include the verbatim transcripts of five conference sessions and a list of participants. (MB)",

        "description":"A multi-media instructional program in educational research was designed to add structure and uniformity for the presentation of course content both on- and off-campus. It was hypothesized that the program would encourage equivalent performances from the on- and off-campus students and alleviate such problems as: (1) lack of uniformity in the presentation of course content on- and off-campus; (2) four-hour class sessions; (3) lack of supporting media materials; and (4) inability of students to grasp the more abstract aspects of the course content. After one year of the program's implementation, evaluation of student performance indicated little or no difference between the on- and off-campus sections. (MM)",

This study reports on the formal evaluation of a technique (developed at Clark University) of sharing personal biography which aimed at building self-image, developing bonds of solidarity, and improving in-class performance. Matched treatment and comparison groups of 10 pairs each of students and teachers were administered FIRO-B and COPE, pre and post. Student in-class performance was also rated by disinterested observers at the same times. The results support the effectiveness of the treatment in meeting its goals. (Author)",

        "description":"Guidelines on how placement should fit into the total school setting and in particular into career education as it becomes better established are discussed in this paper, one of a series on critical issues in vocational-technical education. The school counselor is viewed as the coordinator of the total career guidance, counseling, and placement program as well as having a major role in working directly with students. Career guidance, counseling, and placement functions are grouped into three categories: Curriculum based functions, individual facilitation functions, and on-call functions. Traditional processes and resources of career guidance, counseling and placement functions are discussed. Implementation strategies for career guidance and placement programs are outlined to  provide an approach to a sequential system for program implementation, which consists of three stages: Precommitment stage, commitment stage, and implementation stage. The model-comprehensive approach to establishing a career guidance and placement center described here is specifically for the secondary school (7-12), although the concept can be modified and made applicable for either elementary or post-secondary education. Activities and community resources use are suggested, and a floor plan for a placement center is included. (TA)",

Noting that the report summarizes hearings held in five different cities (Washington, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Houston, and Los Angeles) providing testimony about some innovative and exemplary programs, he notes the common concerns: (1) The development of career education, K-12, (2) the expectation that schools address broad social problems which do not have simple solutions, (3) the high unemployment rate among youth in cities, intensified by racial discrimination which is more serious in  large cities, and by the flight of businesses to suburbs, (4) the low range of occupations offered by school vocational programs, (5) too few students being reached by vocational programs, (6) inadequate preparation of students in basic English and math, (7) females being kept out of high-paying fields, and (8) programs not meeting the needs of local employment markets. Recurrent themes from the testimony are said to indicate areas of special concern for improving urban vocational programs: Program expansion, funding, relevance of courses, coordination among employers and unions and schools, counseling and placement, image of vocational education, private schools, discrimination, and needs of handicapped students. Specific recommendations based on information gained through the hearings,  substantiated by information from the reports of the state advisory councils, are listed for federal, state, and local levels.

        "description":"Questions concerning academic and vocational questions were answered by examining how legislation affects and corrects sex role stereotyping, societal attitudes and sex bias, and employment patterns of men and women at present and in the future. Educational practices that promote sex discrimination were investigated in the following areas: Enrollment in particular educational programs, counseling bias, teacher attitude, instructional materials, and educational leadership. Sex role stereotyping in vocational education was found to occur in all program areas and on all levels ranging from administrators to students. Through the identification of societal and attitudinal factors that contribute to sex role stereotyping in employment and educational practices, it was discovered that  not one set of elements existed, but an interwoven set of circumstances, which are tolerated if not accepted by society. For vocational education to act as an example for change for other areas of education, leadership must be willing to initiate changes starting with their own attitudes. (TA)",

The major data source was the ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) collections for the time period between 1960 and 1975.

The focus is on the potential alliance of career education and human services as current national movements which are considered to be organically and systematically interrelated in their basic concepts, purposes, span of concern, and breadth of potential influence on societal change. The authors suggest that if professionals in both areas are to recognize the potential of mutual gains by formal and informal alliances, collaboration, and integration of efforts, both movements will benefit. Conceptual issues in  the development of education models for career education personnel are identified and basic questions and issues concerning tradition are addressed. The nature of human services education is discussed, followed by an extensive content model for human services education. This model is discussed in terms of relevance for career education training, differentiating program features, and problems associated with the nature of the program. Concepts of prevention and problems of program development are also discussed. The paper concludes with general recommendations for national planning. (TA)",

From an analysis of the rankings, students were labeled Traditional (N=73) and Non-Traditional (N=74) and were then compared on demographic and attitudinal variables. Non-Traditional students tended to rank the skilled trades higher in prestige than did Traditional students. Analysis of variance indicated that Traditional students, compared to Non-Traditional students, were more interested in career advancement and high initial and anticipated future earnings, but were less concerned with (1) having an impact on society, (2) the need for intellectual challenges or interactions, or (3) financing their  education. No significant main effect or interactions due to sex were found, nor were there significant demographic differences between the two groups. The implications of possible shifts in what has been an extremely stable occupational prestige hierarchy and related issues are discussed.

Focus is on recognizing and utilizing community resources that now exist and moving actively toward building new community resources. To this end, the monograph describes the principle of collaboration in career education and delineates the major kinds of career education activities calling for collaborative efforts between educators and the business/labor/industry community. Eleven current major national programs involved in career education are described; it is suggested that if these national efforts can be made an integral part of a total community career education effort, the goals of career  education will be enhanced. Examples of how local community resources are used for career education are presented, based on the recognition that local, not national, efforts will determine the effectiveness of implementation of career education. Further issues on policy and directional questions are discussed. Lists of the two mini conferences' participants are appended. (TA)",

Methodology involved in-service seminars and summer institutes for a total of 107 teachers. Regression analysis of the training program data indicated that pupils of the trained teachers experienced greater increases in knowledge and developed more positive attitudes toward nonprofessional work modes than did pupils of teachers not participating in the in-service training. However, analysis did not show that pupils of participant  teachers experienced a significantly greater increase in realistic attitudes toward nonprofessional work modes. From these findings, it was concluded that the program objectives had been actualized. Development of a delivery system utilizing multimedia technology, with a software support system, was recommended.

Procedures and activities for the two project phases are described in the report. Phase l involved the development of the pilot delivery system while Phase 2 was concerned with the implementation and evaluation. A quasi-experimental  research design was employed with a sample of 30 teachers. It was found that pupils of teachers participating in the program did not evidence more understanding of the world of work, but did experience a greater increase in positive attitudes toward productivity and motivation than did pupils of nonparticipating teachers. These findings suggest that project objectives were met and that an effective delivery system can be developed. Appended to the report are materials related to the in-service program. (Author/NJ)",

A career education questionnaire was administered as a pre-test and again as a post-test to students in the third and sixth grades. Ninth and twelfth grade students were given the Career Interest and Information Survey, developed by Texas State Technical Institute, as well as the Career Maturity Inventory. Although test results were not as favorable as might be desired, the evaluators felt that the project had a significant impact on grades K-12. Results of teacher interviews showed that the teachers hold positive attitudes toward career education and accept its importance in the curriculum. The evaluators  recommend that staff be maintained to continue the career education effort. (RG)",

A decision-making model of career choice similar to the scientific method is presented with suggestions for counselor implementation. From the viewpoint of the counselor's role as one of helping clients to engineer their own decisions, some practical knowledge requirements are identified as guides to needed research. The kinds of questions and methods currently pursued in career research are briefly reviewed and their limitations and possibilities are examined. The career development theories of  Holland and Super are described along with typical research questions, methods, and overall results. The social learning model of career selection formulated by Krumboltz is outlined with suggestions for counselor implementation and research possibilities. As a conceptual basis for experimental studies on career relevant behavior, a self-control framework is proposed and the four areas of commitment, awareness, environment, and consequences are discussed as each relates to career issues. A discussion of research needs poses questions about self-control techniques which merit further investigation. (NJ)",

The author's ideas are offered from different perspectives: As an educational administrator, a federal program administrator, a consultant to local school districts, and professor. Legislative and administrative policies are reviewed and objectives of the Office of Education for Vocational Education Research and Development are discussed. An analysis is made of vocational education research and development program goals addressing the questions of priorities, priority establishment, problems, voids, and sustained inquiry. Also discussed is the impact of federal  policy and funding for vocational education research and development on state organization, state administration, state policy, state priorities, and state program and project funding. Several specific conclusions are offered to support the position that vocational education research and development has not caused major changes in education to any great degree. Recommendations include specific procedures and processes for application of research and development, dissemination of results to policy makers and administrators, and greater expenditure for dissemination of evaluated results.

The actual contribution of these projects to vocational education is examined in two aspects: The characteristics of research and demonstration projects that satisfy the ideal criteria in actual implementation are discussed, and the extent to which educators and policy makers have made use of the research  and demonstration projects is evaluated. The general conclusion is that although some demonstration projects have helped modify or improve instruction techniques, limitations still exist: (1) Lack of adequate research design or evaluation methodology, (2) abundance of descriptive studies, (3) weakness in survey technique, and (4) weakness of impact due to small sample size, limited population, or triviality of problem tested.

Following a brief summary of vocational education legislation, the general efficiency and ability of the research and development program is critically reviewed in terms of policies, personnel, and coordination. Factors that inhibit optimum research and development are: (1) Lack of adequate numbers of trained vocational education researchers, (2) lack of confidence in vocational educators by the U. S. Commissioner of Education, (3) problems in developing an organization structure for research, (4) lack of long-range priorities and planning mechanisms, (5) continuous reorganization  within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, (6) magnitude and continuity of funding, (7) lack of &quot;hard money&quot; research positions, (8) expectations of research, and (9) money siphoned off to support other activities. Five conditions are described which, if met, would contribute substantially to a more effective research and development program. (Author/RG)",

The administration of vocational R&amp;D is briefly described and a historical overview is presented of federal efforts from the passage of the vocational act of 1963 to the present status of funding. In addition to the administration's major accomplishment of providing visibility for vocational R&amp;D, several specific accomplishments are enumerated, most of which indicate that the emphasis has been on developmental rather than on basic research. In speculating on possible alternatives to past directions, the change in emphasis from research to developmental  priorities is traced from the point of view that the haste to operationalize has seriously decelerated vocational research efforts, channeling research monies into programmatic efforts and failing to engage in interdisciplinary research for a long enough period of time. In addressing the problem of how best to utilize the existing vocational research and development system for improvement, the author argues for more basic research to solve the sociological, psychological, and economic problems encountered in vocational education. An appeal is also made to the two national centers to return to their original mission of vocational R&amp;D, and to the research coordinating units to focus more on research coordination. (NJ)",

Several criteria are suggested for policy research, which is defined as the study of empirical relationships between dependent variables of high policy relevance and independent variables amenable to manipulation and control. Current socio-economic developments considered important in planning for vocational education programs are described. These involve the change in the role of workers and in work values, the rise of job competition, dehumanization of work,  and unequal distribution of wealth. The employment outlook through the 1970's is briefly reviewed and major trends are identified. The potential effect of such developments on vocational education is traced through the various legislative programs and decision-making structures of the past, and the application of various evaluation strategies to policy recommendations is analyzed. In examining how social and economic changes are reflected in vocational education policy, the recent emphasis on educational equity is traced as a take-off point for discussion of vocational education policy deliberations at local, state, and federal levels.

An overview of research conducted since the Vocational Education Amendments of 1963 is presented, with a subsequent description organized according to the needs of ethnic students at different educational levels. Among the conclusions resulting from this review of research are these: (1) The little research directed to needs of ethnic minority students has been underutilized; (2) the research was based on a social pathology model of cultural deficit and on stereotypes of cultural disadvantage without identifying positive attributes; (3) a negative self-concept was seen as the biggest block to  motivation; and (4) staff attitudes and behaviors are critical variables in providing effective training. The paper reviews some discernible research trends with positive directions for the future of ethnic minority students, particularly research based on the concept of bioculturalism. Finally, eight questions are presented which need to be addressed by future vocational education research targeted to minority needs. These questions involve interdisciplinary research, equal access to higher education, teacher expectations and effectiveness, the use of paraprofessionals and tutors, and community involvement.

Suggestions are offered for ways to narrow the gap between vocational guidance and vocational education by  broadening the view of guidance to include a concern for decision-making, self-concept, life styles, values, and leisure. Some of the significant research and development efforts of the last decade are discussed including career development theory, computer-based systems, specification of goals and objectives, measurement of career development, and exemplary projects and programs funded under Part D of the Vocational Education Amendments.

The need to develop an interdisciplinary approach to research in the human resources field is discussed from the point of view that vocational education has tended to ignore the need for and contributions of other social and behavioral sciences in the development of a vocational education curriculum. Certain structural changes taking place in the labor market are  discussed--changes to which, in the author's view, vocational education has not satisfactorily responded.

        "description":"With particular attention to vocational research and development, this study reviewed the literature to obtain information on the factors or influences causing teachers to change practices. Research and development in vocational education was treated as an independent variable in an experimental research design with moderating variables of product characteristics, dissemination efforts, teacher education, work context, and teacher characteristics. The sources of information included a number of reviews of research, research monographs, and expert opinion statements. Very limited empirically derived evidence was found regarding the extent to which vocational research and development has influenced teachers to change practices. Speculation based on informed opinion concluded that:  (l) The influence of curriculum development and distribution on teacher practice is relatively insignificant; (2) use of dissemination through institutes, workshops, and conferences is inadequate as an influence on teacher practice; (3) teacher education as a mode of dissemination is of negligible influence; and (4) teacher educators as disseminators of research and development are limited in influencing teachers to change practices. Possible explanations for the low return in terms of actual change of teacher practice are offered pertaining to organizational factors and to systems for analyzing the characteristics of educational innovations.

Following the classroom visit, small groups of students visited the job sites of those who had visited the classroom.

The instruments were then field tested at four geographic sites in vocational service areas which have traditionally been in high demand. Data collected produced findings in four areas: (1) Correlations between the instrument's prediction and instructor's prediction of student job placement, (2) correlations between the instrument's prediction and guidance counselors' prediction of student  job placement, (3) correlation between two similar career counseling instruments and the instructor's prediction, and (4) results of field testing the counselor handbook. Based on the correlation scores, it was concluded that the instruments are excellent predictors of student job placement. Guidance counselors also appeared to have very little difficulty in using the handbook to develop instruments. A bibliography, correspondence, the 15 revised career counseling instruments developed, and sample forms are included in the document. (RG)",

A behavioral contract is a means of scheduling the exchange of positive reinforcements among two or more persons. The use of behavioral contracts is predicated upon four assumptions: (1) receipt of positive reinforcements in interpersonal exchanges is a privilege rather than a right; (2) effective interpersonal contracts are governed by the norm of reciprocity; (3) the value of an interpersonal exchange is the direct function of the range, rate and magnitude of the positive reinforcements mediated by that exchange; and (4) rules create freedom in interpersonal exchanges.  Behavioral contracts consist of five elements--precise statements of the privileges, responsibilities, sanctions and bonuses of each signatory as well as a means of monitoring events relevant to the agreement. The use of a behavioral contract with one delinquent girl is described and analyzed using Markovian methods. (Author)",

There are numerous and different demands placed on the blue collar worker in our changing society which are not understood or experienced by the white collar professionals, such as counselors. For example, the force of technological change is more severely felt by the blue collar worker than by the white collar professional. The typical systems of delivering counseling to the blue collar worker are oriented towards solving present problems of unemployment or the threat of such.

Groups were matched on the degree of approach to snake, and subjective report of snake-fear. Therapy was conducted in small groups and lasted 3.5 hr. spread over four sessions. There was no statistically significant difference among groups, but all groups improved more than  would be expected from no treatment of any kind. Implications of the surprising improvement of the expectancy groups were discussed. The failure to find differences among the treatment groups suggested that distraction may be an alternative to relaxation in desensitization. (Author)",

Subjects were 40 primarily Black children enrolled in special education classes at two inner city junior high schools. Four treatment conditions were established, varying as to conditions of overtness of verbalization in the task. All groups were instructed to use imagery elaborations to learn two PA lists. Results yielded a significant difference between the  experimental and control groups, with no significant differences between the two experimental or the two control groups.

        "description":"This study examines the effectiveness of an open classroom socialization process employed in an experimental compensatory education program in terms of one of its objectives. The five-year Education Improvement Program (EIP) used behavior modification treatments to promote a style of pupil behavior described as self-directed, independent, and problem-solving. It was hypothesized that enabling pupils to develop an individual style of learning would result in greater knowledge of academic subject matter than would the conforming style of pupil behavior typcial of traditional school environments. The study was guided by the question of the effect of an open educational environment on academic achievement of culturally disadvantaged elementary school children. The measure of open  classroom behavior was gathered using CASES (the Coping Analysis Schedule for Educational Settings). The results suggest that for three of the four academic areas studied, the traditional classroom environment (teacher-directed) may be inappropriate with the culturally disadvantaged. Open classrooms seem to be appropriate for learning reading and arithmetic. Caution should be exercised in generalizing the findings. (Author/NG)",

Two studies evaluated this program with depressed female volunteers. The first study compared the program to non-specific group therapy and a waiting list control condition. Both Self-Control and non-specific group subjects improved from pre- to post-testing in comparison to Waiting List subjects. Greater improvement was shown by Self-Control subjects on both cognitive and overt-behavior measures of depression and experimental measures of self-control functions. In the second study the experimental Self-Control Therapy program was compared with a behavioral Social Skills training program. While subjects in both conditions  improved with therapy, the Self-Control group showed greater improvement on cognitive measures of depression and self-reported activity level. Groups improved equally in direct observation measures of verbal activity. On measures of self-control functions the Self-Control group showed greater change, whereas measures of social skills did not indicate differential change. Overall, the two studies showed that a behavioral self-control program of psychotherapy aimed at modifying cognitive and overt-motor behaviors can have a significant impact on depression. (Author)",

This brochure provides the requisite practical information for those who wish to test or consider testing the ward grievance procedure. The program was developed as a way of dealing with the questions raised by the issues of whether an inmate has the right to make suggestions about the way his life is regulated during incarceration and what kinds of grievance procedures are possible and permissable to prisoners. The program attempts to adopt the open collective negotiations and independent arbitration tradition to the prison environment. The program illustrates that prison tensions can be eased through a grievance procedure such as that  described. The procedure has two formal features which are considered to have promoted its success: (1) grass roots problem solving by line staff and inmates who conduct hearings together and with equal decision-making authority; (2) inmate appeal to outside arbitration. The procedure deals mainly with individual problems, policy issues and ward vs. staff confrontations. The proces has three stages: ward-staff committee hearing, appeal, and arbitration. Almost half the grievances are settled at the first stage, while only two percent require outside arbitration. (NG)",

The degree of impairment, sex of stimulus persons, and sex of subjects were the independent variables. The subjects consisted of 120 psychology students from Kent State University, Ashtabula Regional Campus. Each subject viewed one of six videotaped conditions depicting a job interview situation in which the person being interviewed was either a male stimulus person or a female stimulus person displaying either no disability (control situation), a mild physical disability, or a severe physical disability. The findings in this study were unexpected. The results indicated a more favorable attitude toward a physically disabled person than toward a normal person.  This implies that a sympathy effect is operating. The sex of the stimulus person and the sex of the subjects did not yield significant results. It can be concluded that the favorable attitude exhibited toward the stimulus persons in the present study tends to indicate that the physically disabled, when they are attempting to fulfill the expectations of the non-disabled, are met with sympathy rather than rejection.

Its purpose is to provide a recognized role in the community and a meaningful life in retirement for older adults through significant volunteer service. Senior volunteers must be age 60 or over; there are no eligibility requirements for volunteers based on income, education, or experience. The RSVP program through its policy of reimbursing the volunteer for out-of-pocket expenses, enables the person who otherwise might not be able to volunteer to do so. Today, ACTION supports 660 RSVP projects. This program operates in all of the conventional volunteer stations throughout Lake County,  Ohio, and has, in addition, an intensive recruitment of volunteers for an RSVP School Pilot Program which was developed during its first year of operation. The Lake County program has worked very closely with the Career Education Department of the school. This manual provides the information for any school guidance director or principal who desires to introduce a volunteer program incorporating elderly persons into a school. (Author)",

The social systems are: medical clinics, public schools, governmental and semigovernmental agencies, civic organizations, and families and neighbors. The objective is to compare the developmentally disabled persons nominated by these social systems in terms of degree of help sought from others, and dependence on public and private welfare agencies. Data were gathered from 364 disabled persons whose disabilities were mental retardation, cerebral pasly, and/or epilepsy. Statistical analyses revealed that characteristics of the disabled varied from one social system to another. Furthermore, the  labeling process itself was mainly \"reputational\" in certain social systems and more \"technical\" in others. This research project, although only a beginning, speaks to the mislabeling that can occur when persons vary from the \"norm\". (Author)",

The paper focuses on the attempt on the part of the women to bring their abortion-seeking behaviors in line with opposing cultural standards. The existing literature suggests that alignment can be accomplished through reducing the negative quality of the act (justification) or by rejecting personal responsibility (excuses). The researcher interviewed 40 women subsequent to their abortions. Those interviewed (with one exception) generally believed that the community disapproved of abortion, and almost half of those interviewed disapproved of abortion personally. The interview results indicate that while only a few (15%) of the women used alignment strategies to account for  their pregnancies, most used them in accounting for their abortions.

Bargainers induced to trust each other exchanged high levels of information about their profit schedules, but only when instructed to achieve high profits. Low trust led to high levels of competitive behavior under the same high aspiration conditions. A general conclusion of the study is that in mixed-motive situations, people tend to match each other's levels of cooperation to the extent that they feel mutually dependent, and to mismatch levels of cooperation to  the extent that they feel independent.

The report offers guidelines to help education policy makers formulate child abuse policies. In line with these two purposes, the body of the report is divided into two main sections. The first deals with various aspects of education's role in child abuse programs: why education should be involved, why its involvement has been limited to date, why this study was conducted and what the findings imply. The second section contains guidelines for policy development--suggestions that policy makers should consider before developing child abuse policies for education groups and institutions. In addition, four appendices are included: a  description of the method, scope and selected findings of the study; samples of the study instruments; tabulated findings of the study; and several samples of child abuse policy statements.

There was no significant relationship between proximity and international attitudes. American students in the proximity group interacted with foreign  students to a significantly greater degree than did those in the non-proximity group. American students who roomed with foreign students were involved in a significantly greater number of international activities than either those in the non-proximity group or those in the proximity group who did not room with foreign students. An additional finding was that, regardless of proximity, there was a significant correlation between interaction with foreign students and international activities.

The members of a group in the collective-project condition completed a single art project as a group. Each member of a group assigned to the individual project condition completed an individual art project. In the therapy session which followed, groups in the collective-project condition showed a decrease in physical distance between group members relative to a baseline therapy session and relative to groups in the individual-project condition. These groups also scored higher on a questionnaire measure of cohesion. The questionnaire and intermember-distance measures of group cohesion correlated highly.  Intermember distance returned to baseline during a follow-up therapy session. No differences were found during the therapy sessions in the frequency of three types of verbal behavior. It was concluded that collective art projects may be used to increase cohesion in ongoing therapy groups. Further exploration of intermember distance as a measure of group cohesion was suggested.

Original data for the paper came from locus of control scores on college students in four nations (U.S.A., Mexico, Ireland, and West Germany) and from Anglo and Chicano high school students in southern California. These data show the Mexican business administration students to be more internally oriented than is true for students from each of the other nations. Chicano high school students planning to enter college are also internally oriented, and match Anglo high school students planning to attend college. Only Chicano male high school students not planning to enter college showed any tendency toward a more external locus of control. The  authors also look at locus of control data collected by Garza (1974) and by Reitz and Groff (1973) and find that these also fail to portray either Chicano university students or Mexican factory workers as fatalistic in outlook. The paper concludes that to the extent that a perceived external locus of control would be indicative of a fatalistic outlook, such perception is lacking in most data on Mexican or Chicano subjects.

        "description":"This document is comprised of papers presented at a symposium on Adult Development in Women. A paper entitled \"Women in the Middle Years\" reviews the major findings on adult women, and describes what an adequate theory of women in the middle years should account for. Mental health, effects of marriage, children and work, and the interrelationships of these factors are discussed. In elucidating critical stages, the authors consider a developmental framework focusing on women's role patterns and life stages within the cultural context would be appropriate. The traditional consideration of chronological age, and stereotypes and myths about women, especially the mind-body relationship and the need for marriage and children have impeded model development. Power, and its relationship  to a sense of personal control, are central considerations. A paper, \"Some Sociological Perspectives on Adult Women\" discusses personal roles, multiple roles, and coping and support systems. The conclusion reached is that theories based primarily on data from men do not apply to issues confronting women, and that life tasks, including the \"marker events\" which trigger a person's concerns with each of these tasks, serve as a focus from which to study the middle years.

        "description":"This study compared the career choices of high school seniors to the actual occupations they entered four years after graduation, to determine the extent to which high school seniors can predict career choices. The Indiana Vocational Technical College (IVTC) Questionnaire, Post High-School Educational and Career Plans of Senior Students was used on a population from three central Indiana public schools. It was found that individuals frequently changed their career choices after graduation. Their occupational grouping perception (white-collar versus blue-collar) and the geographic employment locale were predicted inaccurately. Though more planned post-secondary education than were ultimately involved in it, the plans of those who entered post-secondary education did not change. In  view of the poor predictive ability of high school seniors in regard to their careers, it is recommended that: (1) schools should provide activities and experiences that promote viable career choices; (2) attention should be given to providing post-high school occupational training; (3) state level education programs should explore the career education concept; (4) research should be done on the role and influence of economic and cultural conditions in career choice; and (5) longitudinal research studies should be undertaken to shed light on career choice.

Faculty from the Department of Mental Health Sciences are videotaped in initial evaluative interviews with clients who volunteer from the psychiatric facilities of Hahnemann. Client and therapist fill out questionnaires on their experiences of the sessions, and clients are given psychological tests. In future stages of the project, these will be correlated with movement assessments. The present paper deals with observer and repeat reliability on parts of the extensive inventory of patients' and therapists' body patterns. The Individual Movement Patterns Inventory used deals  with individual style assessment, pathological features of movement, sex-role stereotypic nonverbal behaviors, interpersonal variables, and items believed to relate to cultural differences. Initial results suggest that individuals have consistent movement patterns over time, and those can be reliably assessed by trained observers. Therapist expressive movement patterns are focussed on, with descriptive examples of individual differences presented. The paper concludes with therapist role-specific nonverbal patterns, preliminary observations of patterns of eye contact, facial expression, gesturing and interacting nonverbally which appear related to the therapy context.

JSAS disseminates information on three complementary levels: (a)  descriptive abstracts of documents accepted by the service, (b) individual full-text copies of these documents in either paper or microfiche format on demand, and (c) complete collections of accepted documents on an annual subscription basis. Diverse materials in all content areas are actively solicited, and undergo editorial review. Abstracts of accepted materials are published in this quarterly JSAS Catalog of Selected Documents in Psychology, which serves as a vehicle for identifying and ordering only those full-text documents which are relevant to one's interests.

All schools sampled displayed large or consistent gains for sixth-grade reading achievement, had predominantly minority-group student bodies, and were located in low-income neighborhoods. Data on school and classroom practices were gathered by interview and questionnaire from principals, reading specialists, and classroom teachers in the target schools. Background and demographic information and reading test scores for grades three through six were recorded for members of the sixth-grade classes of 1974 and 1975 from their  junior high school records. Background factors and reading test scores in earlier grades were found to account for the largest part of the variation in sixth-grade achievement, but variables reflecting particular school experiences also had significant influence. These factors are described and illustrated in the report. Overall, the results are interpreted as supporting the continuation of the School Preferred Reading Program. (Author/AA)",

Students who received this extra assistance tended not to fall further behind their peers in reading skills, in their liking for reading, and in their feelings about themselves as readers. On some of the reading tests used, compensatory students tended to catch up slightly. These results can be contrasted with those from earlier studies which showed that disadvantaged students without compensatory assistance  fell progressively further behind in reading skills and attitudes.

        "description":"This report of remedial education at University of California--Berkeley assumes that students should be given adequate information about academic demands and their own capabilities, that they have the responsibility to prepare themselves in advance for these demands, that they should have access to academic support services on campus, and that reading and composition skills are developmental in nature, requiring academic support throughout a student's educational career. From this perspective, the present furor over students' lack of basic reading, writing, and mathematics skills is considered in the context of changing grading practices; the heterogeneity of Berkeley undergraduates; the proportion of Special Action Students--many of whom have severe academic problems; students'  expectations about their college experience; and the general structure of remedial programs on University of California campuses. The advantages and limitations of several administrative alternatives are discussed. (Author/AA)",

This publication is the first attempt to disseminate information about volunteer programs in Illinois and to help local school districts interchange resources about their programs. Chapters focus on a rationale for using volunteers, potential problem areas and recommended solutions, orientation and evaluation, volunteer resource people, volunteers in career education programs, senior citizens as volunteers, the volunteer tutor, and specific volunteer  programs in Illinois.

        "description":"In order to determine whether bilingual (Spanish/English) readers of English are less efficient in using language cues than are monolinguals (English), the Reading Miscue Inventory (RMI) was used to analyze the reading performances of 60 subjects--ten bilinguals and ten monolinguals each in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. Subjects read orally at their instructional and frustrational levels, in basal readers and from a science text. Each subject's word attack errors or miscues were analyzed according to the diagnostic concepts in the RMI. Results showed that the monolinguals demonstrated more sensitivity to grammatical and semantic cues and that the relationship between miscues and comprehension is different for monolinguals and bilinguals--miscues are less apt to result in a  comprehension loss for monolinguals. This research supports Loban's conclusion (1966) that language ability is necessary for competence in reading. (Tables of findings are included.) (JM)",

Analysis of more than 15 introductory texts used to teach reading indicated that interest measurement is based on certain unquestioned theoretical assumptions. Students in 27 first- through third-grade classes from a southeastern metropolitan school system were given individual-interest interviews and were exposed to group-interest measurement techniques. In addition, primary-level classroom teachers were observed in the effort to interpret their inferences concerning student interests. Data suggest that pupils' expressed interests did not reflect their reading interests; that, although teachers could interpret general student  interest with a fair degree of accuracy, this accuracy did not extend to reading interests; that, in more than 60% of the cases, teachers could not recommend a book for pupils on the basis of interest; and that retesting after a four-month interval indicated a significant change in students' expressed interests.

An attempt is made to isolate and describe experiences which, according to research, enhance reading achievement. Since 1960, many different early childhood education programs have been developed for educationally disadvantaged children. An analysis of the three basic types of curricula for these programs--programmed, open framework, and child centered--reveals that structured prereading programs elicit greater reading gains than the other two formats. Generally, however, research indicates that perceptual, intellectual, emotional, experiential, and language factors have varying degrees of importance with regard to childrens' ability to learn to read.

The verbal-complexity hypothesis was supported by significant differences among the tasks on words per phrase, phrases per clause, and clauses per sentence.

Results indicated that for a majority of students, first-draft expressive writing is unstructured and lacking in coherence. The tendency to integrate feelings and to organize them in coherent expressions develops between the ages of 9 and 13, with some further development between 13 and 17. The proportions of good, expressive papers written by females, by students whose parents have post-high school education, and by students from relatively affluent communities are greater than the proportions for males, blacks, children of the poorly educated, and children who live in relatively impoverished areas. The capacity to enter into an imaginary situation with a  controlled and consistent point of view grows steadily with age, though even at age 17 almost half the students are unable to do this competently. Sample papers and a copy of the revised National Assessment of Educational Progress writing objectives are also included in this report.

Our textbook community has moved through a series of ineffective fashions, from those of Fries to post-Chomsky. All have presumed to replace prescriptive rules with realistic explanations. But all have fallen, like the worst of traditional grammar, into abstraction. Instead of adhering to pedagogical and theoretical faddism, the teacher of composition needs to formulate practical standards for the effective expression of our language. The use of the language is best studied in, and through, writing. A practical study of grammatical practice needs to be both historical and literary. In stylistics or rhetoric, the larger grammar needs to be existential:  not a system in itself but an aid to making judgments about expressive, often traditionally ordered, variables. (Author/JM)",

Until research can provide a firm base for the structure and content of methods courses, professionals must rely on their own judgment as to the placement of emphasis. An adaptation of Lee J.

Results indicated that there is a traditional language used by women which is more &quot;evaluative-flowery,&quot; more polite, more tentative, and more qualified than the language used by men. Some of the women interviewed resorted to a sterile, neutral language. The men interviewed spoke in absolutes, without qualifiers and with few tag questions. The fact that language reflects women's place in society was manifest not so much in word choice as in calls for validation, the use of qualifiers, and the  attitude that women's work outside the home is less important than men's. The traditional language used to talk about women defined women and their expected role; the traditional language used by women reinforced these definitions. These two factors seemed to result in a low self-concept which may be part of the accepted image and role of women born in Maine around 1900. (Author/AA)",

The psychology of reading and response is conceptualized in a way similar to the psychology of language acquisition and is related to various developmental stages. Because language use, literary response, and interpretation are seen as always motivated rather than motiveless, studies which screen out &quot;irrelevant&quot; motives and other emotional factors are seen to create new motives for language use and literary response,  replacing the ones of primary interest: those attached to normal speech and reading contexts.

Since it is impossible to grasp the essence of daily newspapers without understanding their unique economic principles, this study draws data from the yearly financial reports (1971-1974) of 13 publicly owned publishing companies which are used by newspaper executives and analysts as industry indicators. The three major components in a company's financial statement--revenue, costs, and net income--all increased throughout the period. Strongest economic conditions were evident in the first two years studied. Costs escalated throughout the period, with newspaper companies trying to reduce expenses whenever possible. In many cases, advertising and circulation-rate  increases enabled newspaper companies to increase revenue and to offset rising costs. As a group, newspaper companies are highly profitable, with profit margins outpacing the return on sales at all newspapers. Publicly owned newspaper companies are surviving a weak national economy better than is industry in general, and they can expect to do well in the future. (Author/JM)",

These three major metropolitan dailies represent different geographical areas and political orientations. It was hypothesized that bias was shown in the use of inflammatory headlines, anticommunist labels, and stereotypes; the lack of coverage of actions by defense attorney Bloch; and the more frequent reference to government officials and prosecuting attorneys than to defense attorneys and Rosenberg supporters. The study found that all three newspapers reflected some anticommunist bias, the &quot;New York Times&quot; most subtly. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; made much use of labels and  inflammatory headlines, appearing to reflect the strongest bias of the three papers. The &quot;New Orleans Times-Picayune&quot; obtained most of its material from the wire services; little bias was reflected in its news stories.

The statements were condensed from stories selected from Philadelphia newspapers over a six-and-a-half-month period. Each statement contained a combination of two factors: content in one of four categories (biomedicine/health and disease, biomedicine/policy, physical sciences/research and application, and physical sciences/policy) and emphasis on one of four content-free categories (conflict, impact, prominence, and proximity). A total of 200 questionnaires was mailed, of which 128 were returned in usable form. Factor analysis of responses  indicated that respondents based their preferences for newspaper science news primarily on content, with content-free criteria apparently serving as secondary bases for selection. Such results suggest that reader preferences for news are probably based on complex mixtures of criteria rather than on just content or content-free components, as some earlier studies suggest.

        "author":["Watkins, John J."],
        "description":"This paper focuses on the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and analyzes the possibilities for interpretation or amendment of the act in order to secure preferential treatment for the press, with regard to access to information. After briefly examining the manner in which special-access claims have been treated by the courts, the paper considers the implications of the release of information &quot;in the public interest.&quot; Suggested amendments to the act include making documents available to the press without charge (thus eliminating agency discretion in the matter); awarding attorney fees and other litigation costs when the press's case prevails in an FOIA suit, with the cost to be borne by the recalcitrant agency; shortening the time during which agencies must act on requests  for information; and treating the press differently than other requestors. Overall, however, interpretation of the FOIA to afford special status to the press seems unlikely on any large scale. Amendment of the act to achieve such ends is equally unlikely, since the FOIA was overhauled in 1974, with the needs of the press in mind. In any case, constitutional recognition of a right of special press access is preferable to any statutory privilege. (Author/KS)",

This paper reviews the major cases in the evolution of the &quot;fair trial/free press&quot; controversy from the &quot;Irvin vs. Dowd&quot; decision in 1961 to the Blackmun decision in 1975. The attempt is made to answer the question of when, and if, direct restraint of the press is necessary in a criminal proceeding; alternatives to this course, which can ensure protection of both First and Sixth Amendment rights, are examined. The analysis concludes with the recommendation of an unrestrained press in coverage of criminal trials, with the right to pursue information regardless of restrictions placed on sources. Control of sources within the criminal judicial system is advocated.  Protecting individual rights under both constitutional provisions is, however, perceived as the responsibility of both the press and the judicial system. (Author/KS)",

From their various perspectives emerged a consensus that provides an overview of the domain of the language arts and that enumerates the skills essential to success in college writing experiences. Tackling the distinction between the traditional \"basics\" and other goals that have more to do with intellectual competence suggests some guidelines for defining \"basic skills,\" for assigning classroom priorities, and for assessing language. The  report includes summaries of the responses of the eight participants to detailed questionnaires about goals and processes in the language arts, as well as the texts of position papers prepared by each participant.

It was hypothesized that the monitoring program itself would effect a significantly higher rate of innovative ideas and attitudes in subjects and generally reduce group resistance to innovation. In fact, 20 company managers who participated in the program reported more frequent communications, concerning innovation, with supervisors, coworkers, people in different units within the company, and individuals not employed by the company. Similarly,  managers' self-reported increase in the reading of technical and professional journals was substantiated by their improved recognition of the titles of such materials. Participating managers also attended more seminars, workshops, and other forums where technical information was presented than did those managers not involved with the program. (KS)",

Various scholars have assumed that the study, description, and definition of various systems have led to an understanding of the processes which underlie, or generate, human communication behavior. In effect, two levels of analysis and study are proposed: level one, which allows for the development of an unlimited number of systems and their description in the observable environment of human beings, and level two, which is a set of fundamental communication rules innate in human beings. If we consider the differences between these generative mechanisms, or rules, we will take a major step toward the development of a variety of methodologies to empirically identify human  communicative activity on both levels, without confusing the two.

Measures of rate of speech, number of long pauses, shoulder orientation, and physical distance between the child and the experimenter were also obtained. Results failed to establish any relationship between cognitive style and the linguistic measures, or between cognitive style and the measures of nonverbal behavior.

It was found that television was the most generally satisfactory medium, averaged over the ten needs, and that film was the most need specific. Television and radio paralleled each other in their ability to satisfy the ten needs, as did newspapers and magazines. Three mass media--books, films, and recorded music--showed parallel patterns of need satisfaction with friendship. Two groups of needs were discovered from a cluster analysis of the ten need statements. Cluster one was composed of needs related to the individual's desire to remain in contact with society. Cluster two was composed of needs that were more individual in nature. Finally,  comparisons with the results of the Israeli study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) indicated that similarity between the two studies was high. (Author/AA)",

Semantic differential ratings of the speaker were obtained from 176 college students randomly assigned to high- or low-camera-angle treatment groups. Factors identified as dynamism, competence, and sociability emerged from analyses of the semantic differential ratings, but high- and low-camera-angle groups differed only in their ratings of the speaker's sociability. These results are interpreted as supporting the argument that theoretical concepts of power and dominance are not highly similar to the construct of source credibility. (AA)",

Contents are organized under the following topics: introduction and summary of recommendations, the public responsibilities of  commercial broadcasting, a policy for public broadcasting, the potential of cable, and organizing for change. Also included are memoranda of comment, reservation, or dissent; appendixes (a brief regulatory history of cable television and a table charting the cable regulations in the states); and the objectives of the committee for economic development.

The purpose of the report is to determine the impact of the new staffing plan on the staff size and programs of each district school. The first section of the report presents a brief history of the new staffing plan and is followed by a section describing the methods used to carry out the evaluation study. The third section focuses on the number of district staff members affected by the new plan. It lists staffing totals by school for 1974-75 and 1975-76, notes the differences between the two years, and then determines how much of the change is due to the new staffing policy. The next three sections attempt to isolate program changes  resulting from the new plan at the elementary, junior high, and senior high school levels, respectively. The summary section outlines the report's major findings, and the last section presents several recommendations from the district's evaluation department. The appendix lists and describes the data sources for all major tables in the report and presents a complete list of staff members for each district school, including the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) staff members at each school and the FTE of each individual staff member.

Current New Jersey law requires districts to establish pupil proficiency levels in basic skills, to identify children who fall below them, and to provide those children with remediation services. Statewide pupil proficiency levels would be used to set a floor on those levels. The major purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the research evidence on mastery learning theory provides ample assurance that the goal of having virtually all normal children achieve mastery over basic skills in communication and computation set at meaningful levels is attainable. Mastery learning strategies require  teachers to decide what they want children to learn and then to teach them, to test them to see what they know, and then to help those who do not know by providing time, methods, and materials suitable to the learning style of the particular child.

Priest case and federal revenue sharing as precedents, it is proposed that the federal government furnish (on a regionally adjusted per child rate) 50 percent of the needed school revenues directly to the state through an earmarked \"special revenue sharing\" package. This would be granted only if the states would raise and disburse the other 50 percent based on a per child rate. These amounts would be adjusted only for special educational needs on an \"area needs\" basis offset by a reduced state tax. Since it would be disbursed equally throughout the state on a per child basis, such an educational tax could be based on a property tax as well as on other forms of tax. A condition of this arrangement would be the elimination of any provision for the collection of  any sort of community-based tax that would enhance its educational opportunity position over other communities within the state.

Interviews and questionnaires were used to gather data regarding formal and informal modes of learning the roles of a school administrator. A pilot study led to the larger research study. It was concluded that university training is embarrassingly deficient and ineffective; that informal models of  learning, anticipatory and developmental socialization, are a more puissant manner for competency development; that the best characteristics of formal and informal modes of development must be merged--classroom techniques and theory must be supported by field internship experiences; that more university attention must be given to competency development in areas of individual improvement and human relations; and that more study must be completed for defining administrative competencies as curricula are developed.

In developing the program, five steps were followed.(1) Competency was defined at a relatively high level of abstraction as the school administrator's demonstrated ability to identify and solve high priority school problems and to do so in terms of observable outcomes. (2) A theoretical framework for developing competency was selected. The framework involves initiating structure for school problem-solving, developing a problem  definition, charting alternatives in terms of their consequences, stating objectives, and intervening for problem-solving. (3) The observable consequences of competency were identified. (4) Functional alternatives for the production of the observable consequences of competency were developed. (5) Operational definitions to substantiate the existence of these observable consequences in the field were specified. (Author/IRT)",

Previously, most educators had sought to make a sharp distinction between intellectual and personal/social development, assigning the first to the schools, the latter to home and community. This distinction has been abandoned by many educational innovators who contend that the development of such attributes as positive self-concepts, self-management, interests, values, and interpersonal competencies is at least as important in the education of the individual as the development of intellectual skills and knowledge. There has also been a fuller realization that intellectual and emotional/social development are closely interwoven. Intellectual  development depends heavily on the student's adjustment to self and others and on his interests and values. Correspondingly, personal/social development has essential intellectual components--thinking, planning, valuing, and choosing. This unit focuses on such goals as describing how traditional curricula foster negative self-concepts in girls and minority-group members, and how this can be corrected; describing instructional approaches that foster positive self-concepts; and describing how the group-project approach can be used to teach students interpersonal competencies.

Some are relatively simple cooperatives created for a single purpose such as provision of vocational-technical or special education. Others are rather sophisticated organizations offering everything from inservice education for teachers to mass purchasing and data processing. Efforts range from low-key voluntary efforts aided by permissive legislation to complex agencies supported by mandatory acts. Those looking for the &quot;best&quot; system have many models from which to choose. To better understand the diverse approaches used in various states, the author has chosen to employ four categories: permissive (those states with specific legislation encouraging the development of  educational service centers on a voluntary basis); mandatory (those states with legislation mandating the formation of centers and that also make membership mandatory); mandatory/voluntary (those states with legislation mandating the formation of centers, but that leave membership voluntary); and no legislation (those states without legislation regarding the formation of educational service centers). Chapters are arranged according to these four categories and are internally structured according to historical development.(Author/IRT)",

Section I provides a description of the program during the second year of operation and compares it to the program's first year in terms of the program as a whole, the teachers, and the children. Reviewed in sections II and III are the methods and results of the analyses of student characteristics, teachinq methods, and instructional materials. Among the conclusions listed in section IV are that children who were perceived as successful did not differ from those who were perceived as unsuccessful in either chronological  aqe, ability level, or academic attainment when they entered the program; that teachers perceived that 26% of the successful outcome group were misclassified, of which the majority would have more appropriately been placed in a reading program; and that teachers viewed their teaching methods as the biggest contributor to success for the successful outcome group. Four questions to be explored in future research are proposed which deal with such areas as the impact of special education services and the relative cost/benefits of alternative delivery systems. Among appended materials are a sample screening questionnaire, a list of the participating programs, an outline of methods and materials used with most successful cases, and the 1974 executive summary.

Analysis showed that LQ distributions differed among grade levels, subject areas, and gender-by-ethnicity subgroups. The LQ distributions showed reasonable normality in many cases, but selected distributions deviated from normality. Results showed that the use of a single cutoff value, as has been recommended for selection or classification of students, is inappropriate.

        "description":"Presented is the Illinois Regional Resource Center's Manual for Diagnostic Teachers which is designed to provide a model for assessment, individualized educational planning, optimal placement, and short and long range follow-up of children (3-21 years old) with unexplained learning problems. Section 1 provides an introduction to the Illinois-Regional Resource Center Diagnostic Teaching Model (IRDTM) with sections on the model's purpose, target population, and 11 features of the IRTDM (such as the emphasis on diagnosis rather than remediation; the delivery of both on-site and in-classroom services; and a holistic approach which covers the motor, sensory-perceptual, academic, speech/language, social-emotional, and self-help domains). Section 2 makes up the bulk of the document with  flow charts on the five phases of the model--initial information gathering, on-site or in-classroom diagnosis, program development and testing, transition, and follow-up. Among the exhibits presented in section 3 are samples of a referral form; follow-up form; case contact record; formal and informal test score worksheets; teacher, parent, and child follow-up records; informal and formal evaluation data summaries, and federal reporting form. A hypothetical case study for the IRDTM is given in section 4 which provides examples of the written materials produced by the diagnostic team during the diagnostic, program development, and testing phases. Among appended materials in a final section are regional resource center job descriptions; suggested qualifications for diagnostic teachers; a  list of consultants available to the regional resource center team; and bibliographies of diagnostic tests, instructional materials and equipment, and behavioral checklists.

Information on the coordinator job came from three major sources: the state Plan for Vocational Education; a questionnaire survey of position and background, in which all 33 Minnesota coordinators of special needs participated; and the performance referents contained in 44 statements of required competencies as rated by job incumbents. State plan certification requirements were summarized as calling for a high degree of competence in special or vocational education, but allowing for exceptional instances in individuals  who were qualified by some other route. Findings from the questionnaire sent to state coordinators were divided into three areas (sample findings are in parentheses): organizational variables (most of the coordinators were employed in Area Vocational-Technical Institutes); program variables (most programs were not restricted to a single age range); and incumbent variables (experiential backgrounds of incumbents were heterogeneous within education). A job description uas derived from rated competency statements and included the supervision and evaluation of the performance of staff personnel.

In elementary school (ages 6-12) about 1/3 of the instructional time is allotted to teaching Arabic. It aims to provide the child with basic skills in reading, conversation and writing. The speech taught is that of modern Arabic used by educated speakers. Reading instruction combines the global or sentence method with the analytical or alphabet method. The preparatory or intermediate school covers ages 12-15. Teaching of Arabic at this stage aims at enabling the student to master the language as a tool for oral and written communication, to read a wide variety of materials of various types and for different purposes, and to start exploring the literature of the Arabic language. Oral and written  expression are emphasized and grammar is studied intensively. Secondary school students are aged 15-18, and most go on to the university. This school serves to complete the education of the good citizen and to prepare him for fields of specialization at university level. Mastery of reading and writing skills is sought and past and present Arabic literature is studied. Teacher education and trends in teaching Arabic are also outlined. (CHK)",

This report is divided into four sections. (1) The American role in ESL programs here and overseas is fragmented among several government agencies, private foundations and professional associations. The U.S. must reassess its world role and cooperate with other English-speaking nations in training foreigners to produce their own English teachers. (2) The major factor in program planning is the state  of the individual nation - educational atmosphere, degree of linguistic unity, position of English, geographical conditions, institutional rivalries, traditional attitudes and living conditions. Thorough country surveys and coordinated educational efforts are necessary. (3) Manpower needs for such programs are considerable: teachers, teacher trainers, linguists, audio technicians and administrators. (4) ESL materials and research are urgently needed, especially textbooks for schools and universities and technical texts at reasonable cost. Research is needed on linguistic and area studies, instructional materials, methodology and the psychology of learning. (CHK)",

        "description":"This collection of twenty-six papers is the fourth resulting from the Polish-English Contrastive Project. The overall purpose of the project is to prepare a Polish-English contrastive grammar and to develop pedagogical materials. The basic model used for research is the transformational generative one. Among the papers on phonology, topics such as stress, intonation, distinctive features, and consonant clusters are discussed, as well as issues in contrastive phonology and phonetics. Clitics, nominals, ellipsis, and comparative constructions are among the topics discussed in the papers on morphology and syntax, while modal auxiliaries, verb complementation, transitive verbs, and the derivation of infinitives are the focus of papers concerned directly with verb syntax and  morphology. Syntactic ambiguity is discussed as it relates to teaching written English to Polish students, and exercises for intermediate and advanced Polish learners of English are provided. A bibliography of English-Polish contrastive studies in Poland follows the papers. (CLK)",

        "description":"This study was prepared to provide a convenient compendium of data for those participating in a conference on &quot;Russian and Soviet Studies in the United States&quot; held at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey, in May, 1972. The purpose of the conference and of the study was to assess the state of teaching and research on the U.S.S.R. in the United States and to suggest means of improving them. The study is based on extensive interviews with leaders of the field of Soviet studies, on a review of the files of leading funding agencies, and on quantitative data on the field compiled by scholarly organizations in the field. Sharp declines in both Russian language and area studies have been registered during the last four years, and these declines are greater than the  general decline in language enrollments. The broad picture revealed by the study includes two basic features: (1) the increasing concentration of major libraries and documentary resources in a few leading centers after a period of expansion at dozens of libraries and archival collections around the United States; and (2) the increasing decentralization of scholarly expertise on the U.S.S.R., to the extent that competent researchers are located at dozens of institutions in the United States. In addition to calling for a general renewal of support for training and reaserch in the area, the study stressed the need for a greater degree of coordination of scholarly efforts. (Author/CFM)",

The college or university which admits foreign students has the responsibility either to require a certain level of English proficiency or to provide the means for the student to get the special training in English which he needs to survive and succeed in school. The sentence and the paragraph are basic to teaching composition, to both foreign students and native speakers. Two sample compositions from international students enrolled in a freshman composition course reveal similarities and differences between the two groups and show some of the special needs of international students in these two basic areas. Grammatical and  stylistic problems revealed in the two compositions are discussed in detail. (Author/CFM)",

This fact and that of negative attitudes towards Creole are the principal problems encountered in teaching Creole. The lessons in this course on Jamaican Creole are based on the variety spoken by rural or working-class people. The basic component of the course is the cycle, which consists of two phases. In the &quot;M&quot; phase of each cycle, students mimic the teacher's pronunciation, manipulate grammatical elements, and learn the meanings of words and sentences and memorize them. The &quot;C&quot; phase concentrates on connected discourse and communication. Cycles 1-20 deal with significant phonological correspondences  between Jamaican Creole and English, while cycles 21-29 concentrate on the meaning and use of particular lexical items. Intonation is handled in cycles 29-40, and grammar in cycles 41-70. Cycles 71-126 include the expansion of vocabulary, story telling and story reading, and the singing of Jamaican folk songs. (CLK)",

Data on respondents' role on campus, faculty rank, age, and so forth are also recorded. Findings indicate  that Frostburg State sees intellectual orientation as the highest priority, is a rather traditional kind of institution, is reluctant to express educational outcomes in dollars and cents, and has a need for planning, goal-setting, and articulation of college goals and objectives. Students place much more value on the importance of graduate education than do faculty or administration. (Author/KE)",

A distinction is made between the basic concepts and legal rationale of affirmative action and the many specific laws, regulations, and practices that have developed under this label. The magnitude of the problem that affirmative action programs were intended to solve is measured in some general terms. The actual results achieved and the general trends set in motion by these programs are considered. Finally, the implications of affirmative action policies for those directly affected and for society in general are weighed. The study deals with race and sex differentials in employment, pay, and promotion prospects. In this study of the effectiveness and necessity of affirmative action programs the academic profession is  used because it is an area in which crucial career characteristics can be quantified and have been researched. The study concludes that between the original concept of affirmative action and the goals and timetables actually imposed there is an ill-conceived mixture of unsupported assumptions and burdensome requirements that remain ineffective because of their indiscriminate nature.

A systematic comparison of the problems and procedures reveals important implications for programing from the older field of testing. Theory and experience in test construction can be especially useful in the selection of valid criteria for assessing the effectiveness of a program, the ordering of instructional subject matter, the writing of instructional frames, and the formal evaluation of a program. Adaptive programing implies measurement of both aptitude and achievement in order to assign trainees to appropriate individual sequences of instruction. Possible applications resulting from examination of  these and other issues are explored, and necessary further research is suggested. (Author)",

Each season of productions has been evaluated, and results have been used as formative input in the following year's productions. Research efforts have measured attention, comprehension, attitudes, and national impact. The program has been  viewed extensively, and it has received wide acclaim. (EMH)",

In experiment one, the multitracking consisted of providing additional cues at each frame for use by those students who felt unsure of their response. Results indicated no significant difference in efficiency between the regular linear program and the multitrack program. In experiment two, the multitracking consisted of large frames followed by more detailed frames whenever the student made an error. Large frames were developed by combining an average of three small frames. Again, the results indicated no difference in instructional efficiency between the regular linear program and the multitrack program. Although more errors were made on the large-step branching program, performance on  criterion tests was as good as for the regular small-step linear program. Although branching seems a reasonable way to accommodate individual differences, the two methods attempted in this research did not show an advantage. More promising methods of branching might be (a) less frequent branches at critical points in the program, and (b) large-step frames followed by special remedial frames, rather than by mere repetition of parts of the original large frame.

Some 120 junior high school students, who had never used programed learning materials, were divided into two groups matched on IQ test and achievement test scores. Three chapters from a linear program in general science were presented in alternate order to the two groups. Scores on the multiple choice chapter test given after the first  chapter exposure for group one and after the third exposure for group two were compared.

Fourteen male college students were each asked to construct two tree graphs from a list of 24 adjectives. For the first tree, the subject selected a pair of similar adjectives from the list and connected them with a line. He then sequentially connected the remaining adjectives to the pair according to their degree of similarity. Using the second method, subjects sequentially added single adjectives to the  original pair, as in the first method, or started a new tree with a new similar pair or connected two trees together until all 24 adjectives were connected. Comparison of the formal structural distributions investigated showed no difference between the two methods. The methods did differ, however, with respect to their ability to yield the true ordering of the strength of association between paired adjectives. (KB)",

It discusses the importance of developing an image for the district and briefly surveys the history of community-junior colleges in Kansas City since 1915. The Sanford-Greendahl Copy Value Rating Scale was applied to all printed coverage by the major Kansas City newspaper for two years, 1965 and 1975, selected because they represent the years in which the district submitted bond issues to the public; bond issues which passed in 1965 but failed in 1975. Results of the study indicated: (1) a drastic decrease in coverage in 1975 from 1965; (2) a marked decrease in the judged value of 1975 articles compared to 1965 articles; and (3) a 70% decrease in institutional  and individual human interest stories from 1965 to 1975. Recommendations include: in-service training for district personnel in the area of district image and the media; better communication with the media concerning the day-to-day operation of the district; communication of the community college story in understandable language; cooperation with the press in obtaining coverage; and communication to the press of how well the college is meeting its goals and objectives.

The authors recommend that trustees become more aware of the legal problems inherent in their jobs; that they become skilled in working with state and federal legislators in achieving institutional goals and in curtailing the ever-increasing state domination of community college decision-making; that they engage in continuing self-evaluation; that they work with the  president as a management partner, rather than as an adversary; and that they eschew written policies and allow the president maximum flexibility. Also presented are: (1) predictions of the future course of undergraduate education, (2) a cost/benefit analysis of appointing trustees versus electing them, (3) a self-evaluation instrument for trustee use, (4) guidelines for achieving financial stability, (5) suggestions for improving the effectiveness of board meetings and of female board members, and (6) a review of additional pertinent literature and a bibliography.

Although the first courses were offered at MCTC in 1969, it was not until late 1969 that cooperatively prepared guidelines were adopted by HJC and MCTC. An inmate screening committee, on which both the college and the correctional facility are represented, screens and selects applicants to the program. Currently, funding for the program is provided by Basic Educational Opportunity Grant funds and by the Maryland Department of Corrections. The actual educational program is designed to serve the wide range of individual inmate differences; several instructional strategies involving varied lengths of classroom work, size of courses,  and instructional delivery techniques are utilized. Individual counseling and testing allow the college to address individual student needs and goals. Students agree to contract with the program to exhibit acceptable behavior, and continuation in the program is dependent upon successful execution of the contract. A campus-release program has been implemented, with an 84.5% success rate. While evaluation of prison programs is difficult it is noted that recidivism rates are lower for program participants, and that, overall, many inmates have acquired previously lacking basic skills.

If a student, counselor, or instructor feels a student needs tutoring, the student applies for tutorial assistance. Upon approval by his instructor, arrangements are made for the student to be tutored. Peer Tutors are selected from among applicants who received a &quot;B&quot; or higher grade in the course(s) they tutor and who have received appropriate approval from the college. Each accepted applicant is designated a Peer Intern and engages in in-service training which includes orientation, instruction in tutoring strategies, followed by periodic training sessions and trouble-shooting meetings. Subsequent to completion of such requirements, and after having tutored for 100 or more hours during a minimum of one  semester, the Intern is designated a Peer Tutor. Analysis of the college's tutorial service shows that courses in Mathematics, Computer Science, and the Physical Sciences create the greatest demands for tutoring, followed by Humanities, Communications, Business Education, and Fine Arts. Between 1973 and 1975, both the number of Peer Tutors and the number of hours tutored have doubled; 75 Peer Tutors provided 1,142 students with 9,895 hours of tutoring in 1975.

Pilot programs were established at three community colleges--Central Piedmont Community College in North Carolina, Florida Junior College at Jacksonville, and Community College of Denver. Each college was free to establish its own model program, consistent with the overall AACJC project objectives. Goals of the program included provision of educational and human service assistance to offenders, development of collaborative relationships between the college and criminal justice and public service agencies, and development of nationally appropriate  program models. The target population was first-time convicted felons who were on probation; non-target offenders were accomodated at the request of justice officials. Of 712 offenders served by the program, 445 were target offenders. Per student costs for the total group and for the target group only were $292 and $467, respectively. Approximately 25% of the target group enrolled in Adult Basic Education, 20% in General Educational Development courses, 27% in academic curricula, 20% in occupational courses, and 8% in other areas. Of the target population, 27 (6.1%) were charged with new offenses, a far lower rate than the national average.

Significant differences between respondents and nonrespondents were found; generally, respondents were more academically successful and more likely to have transferred than were nonrespondents. Five main areas were addressed by the study: student academic and demographic characteristics, educational goals and goal achievement, employment experiences, college transfer experiences, and satisfaction with the community college. Results  indicated that: (1) transfer was the primary educational goal of half of the respondents; (2) half listed an associate degree as their goal; (3) 60% reported primary goal achievement; (4) Blacks achieved educational goals significantly less frequently than whites; (5) no differences in goal achievement were found to exist between males and females; (6) 74% were employed full-time when career development was a primary goal; (7) 68% transferred when their goal was transfer; (8) Blacks achieved transfer goals at a significantly lower rate than whites; and (9) 80% were satisfied with instructional quality.

        "description":"Although some educators have advocated eradication of Black American English and other non-standard American English dialects in formal school training, it is recognized that many dialects are effectively used to a great degree by many Americans. Black American English, like other dialects, is a legitimate linguistic system that has logic, coherence, and grammaticality. A survey of its development shows it to be the result of a pidginization-creolization process that started with the West African slave trade, progressed through the development of the Gullah dialect, to Black American English. Notable contributors to this dialect have been West African and peasant English influences. A review of the literature indicates that there are desirable and advantageous features associated  with use of Black American English; in certain situations it enhances the individual's ability to communicate effectively. Further, great value can be derived by both blacks and whites from use of this dialect. The Black American Code-Switching Technique is a strategy for teaching the utility of both standard and non-standard English forms and of enhancing student facility with each. Its use in the English composition classroom is discussed and a suggested curriculum outline is presented. An extensive bibliography is attached. (JDS)",

Students' attitudes about the relationship between language and cultural background have been neglected and many Non-Standard English users have developed negative attitudes toward their own use of language. The central thrust of this document is to provide some positive teaching strategies for the English instructor in order to address this problem, and to enhance student awareness of varied rhetorical strategies, dialect interferences, similarities between Standard colloquial oral English and Non-Standard dialects, the relationship between and the diversity of American English dialects, the levels of  language usage, and appropriate dialect usage for particular situations. Among the teaching strategies that can be used to the benefit of all students in changing attitudes about language and dialects are: code-switching drills and conversations, word games, oral fluency drills, discussion of the lexical features of American dialects, dictionary consultation, verbal contests, and examination of folk literature.

A planning committee sought input from faculty and students in order to determine what needs were not being met by current general education requirements and to determine how an integrated program could be developed involving a mixture of cognitive, affective, and experiential learning. A pilot program was developed, requiring ten hours of class time per week, and offering a variety of learning activities such as films, lectures, seminars, workshops, readings, and independent studies. The one-semester pilot course consisted of three segments: (1) Bases of Human Relationships, (2) Alienation, and (3) Love and Friendship. The last week of the course,  Celebration Week, provided students an opportunity for presentation of projects and performances. For each segment of the course, the document provides a listing of suggested lectures and panel discussions, suggested media, questions for seminar discussions, and workshop topics. Also provided is a general description of the program's purposes, goals, interdisciplinary mechanisms, learning activities, individual activities, administration, and evaluation.

        "description":"Using the book &quot;Fostering Intellectual Development in Young Children&quot; by Kenneth D. Wann and the book's impact on education as a point of departure, this paper presents a way of looking at the early childhood curriculum that goes beyond the book but is in keeping with its concerns for the education of young children. The book was a forerunner of the new period in early childhood education where the focus began to be on the intellectual as well as the social domain. A 3-dimensional model is suggested that can be used in judging programs for young children using the value framework of liberation. An analysis of many current programs would suggest that they operate against children's liberty because judgments of what is good, true, right or possible are kept out of their hands.  Approaches that help children test the validity of what is taught in ways that are independent from the teacher need to be a part of any curriculum that is liberating. Different forms of knowledge require different methods of validation as well as different methods of teaching and learning. (Author/MS)",

One hundred infants and children ranging from 10 months to five years of age were observed for two 15-minute periods, one with toys present and one with no toys in the playroom. The playroom was modified from a previous study on children's activity level development by replacing tables and chairs with braided rugs on the floor. The child's mother sat in a closet in the room with the door half open so her child could have access to her. Locomotor activity tended to rise from age 10 months up to a peak at 18-23 months; it then decreased from that age group to  24-29 months. Unexpectedly, after that age there was a steady increase with age in amount of activity up to five years. When toys were present, time spent in conventional play increased with age from 15 months up to four years; there were sex and age differences in preferences for particular toys. Vocalization and talking increased steadily with age. A discussion focuses on procedural differences between this study and the study by Routh, Schroeder, and O'Tuama (1974) which might account for the present findings a developmental increase in activity rather than a developmental decrease.

The curriculum innovations and the evaluation from Year I were continued during Year II. A multivariate analysis of the Year I and Year II data indicated a significant Year X Treatment interaction. The differences between test performance of experimental and control group  children found in Year I disappeared, due to the increase in the control group's performance. Test items for which normative data were available suggested that both groups were approaching national averages. Also included is an observational study of the effects of a program for training day care workers based in part upon the teaching strategy developed for the IVY program.

        "description":"The relationship between Piagetian theory and its application in three early childhood programs is discussed in two papers with differing points of view. The first paper discusses Piaget's epistemology and presents a critical analysis of the three programs, concluding that only one of them is consistent with Piaget's epistemology. A rejoinder, challenging the first paper's analysis, suggests an alternative approach to examining the relevance of Piaget to early childhood education. The programs under discussions are: (1) Weikart's Cognitively Oriented Curriculum, (2) Lavatelli's Early Childhood Curriculum: A Piaget Approach, and (3) Kamii and DeVries' Piaget for Early Education. The programs are examined in the first paper in relation to (1) nature of subject-object relationship,  (2) construction of operations, (3) nature of physical and logico-mathematical knowledge, and (4) representation of knowledge. Conclusions emphasize the conflict between constructionalist epistemology and empiricist tradition. The second paper questions whether sophisticated knowledge of Piaget's epistemological theory is necessary for teachers and criticizes the distinction made in the first paper between psychological and epistemological perspectives. Recognition of what Flavell calls Piaget's stage-independent and stage-dependent theories is urged, with emphasis on the latter to provide a specific framework for teachers and parents. Questions to be addressed by teachers and researchers in early childhood education are proposed. (BF)",

Age was found to be an important factor: 4 1/2-year-olds, as contrasted with 6 1/2-year-olds, failed to adjust their speech to make it audible over noise when talking about complex stimuli. Difficulty of material was also important: younger children adjusted their speech to the background noise level better when the materials spoken about were simple and familiar rather than complex and strange. Results are given for four studies comparing performance of preschool groups and older children from second and fifth grades. It is suggested that results be viewed in a kind of attentional model. The child properly gears communications  to others only when reasonably at ease with the information being communicated. When material is more difficult, he can no longer interpret the greater complexity and also attend to the task of gearing his communication to his audience. (Author/BF)",

        "description":"This study was based on the following assumptions: (1) functioning of the brain's left hemisphere, because of its logical, verbal mode, facilitates conservation reasoning; (2) functioning of the brain's right hemisphere, because of its nonverbal, spatial mode, inhibits conservation reasoning; (3) visual input from the left eye will reach the left visual cortex before it reaches the right visual cortex, thereby giving the left hemisphere priority and vice versa; and (4) eye dominance is caused by hemisphere dominance. In order to test the validity of these assumptions, a series of conservation tasks (number, substance, continuous quantity and weight) were administered to a group of 82 children. The following predictions were made: A group of children who view the conservation  materials with their left eye and are left eye dominant (LL) will demonstrate a greater frequency of conservation responses than a group of children who view the materials with their right eye and are right eye dominant (RR). A group of children who view with their left eye and are right eye dominant (LR) and a group of children who view with their right eye and are left eye dominant (RL), will demonstrate an intermediate frequency of conservation responses. The predicted sequence of LL.gt.LR approximately equal to RL&gt;RR was found. LL and RR group differences were significant (z = 2.01, p = .02). (Author/MS)",

The LEA and the components of the lesson are briefly reviewed. Imaginative play and its descriptive components are identified and explained. The procedure for combining the two elements is roughly as follows: The children interact in an imaginative play situation while the teacher observes them. After the episode, the students are encouraged to verbalize their roles, and as they relate what happened, the teacher transcribes the language used by the children. The teacher then reads the story to the children and then has the children read it. Major words are reviewed, and the story is retyped into more permanent form and reviewed and reread by the  children. Then another story is begun. An example is given of an imaginative play episode and its subsequent incorporation into a LEA lesson. (MS)",

The only hypothesis that held up was that only children appear to be more autonomous. The second study interviewed 76 mothers of college undergraduates through a mail survey, providing information as to why mothers of only children have one child.

        "description":"This paper describes two experiments in which children in grades 1, 3, and 5 were given three kinds of spatial perspective-taking problems to solve as quickly as they could: (1) C problems, solvable only by computation (that is, noting which features of a particular object array were closest to another observer in order to estimate how the array appears from that observer's position); (2) R problems, solvable only by applying a rule (such as the generalization that two observers will have the same view of any object array if in the same viewing position and different views of it if in different viewing positions); and (3) RC problems, solvable either by computation or by rule. The task conditions were such that computation-based solutions ordinarily required several seconds to  execute whereas rule-based solutions could be achieved with zero-order latencies. Older children proved likelier than younger ones to solve R problems correctly, solve them with zero-order latencies, and verbalize rule use in inquiry. Latency and inquiry data suggested that the children who used the rule to solve R problems also chose to solve RC problems by rule rather than by computation. It was concluded that a number of subjects possessed the rule, consciously and deliberately used it in solving concrete perspective-taking problems, and believed in its general veracity enough to rely on it when they did not have to (RC problems).

        "description":"This report presents data on daytime care arrangements for children aged 3 to 13 of working and non-working mothers. Presented by age, race and school enrollment of the child, marital status of the mother and family income, data were collected through two surveys: one of day care arrangements for children aged 3 to 6 and another for children aged 7 to 13. About one half the report consists of statistical tables and charts. Data indicate that, of the approximately 41 million children aged 3 to 13 in the United States about 33 million are usually cared for by a parent while not in school. For the additional eight million, other arrangements are made for daytime care. The most common arrangement is care in the child's home by a relative, with 2.1 million children aged 3 to 13 cared  for in this way. An additional 1.8 million (mostly in the 7 to 13 age group) care for themselves. Fairly small proportions are taken to an outside home for care, either to a relative or non-relative (about 1.2 million to each), or to a day care center (326,000). The use of a day care center is thus the least often reported child care arrangement in the United States, involving approximately 2 per cent of children aged 3 to 6. Approximately two-fifths of all children from 3 to 13 years of age have working mothers, with three-fifths of these reported under parent care when not in school. Type of care provided for grade school children was found to vary only slightly by income level of the family. (BF)",

Presented is a composite of responses from officials in state departments of education and human resources, governors' offices, and governors' legislative liaisons. In most cases, major concerns of governors' offices reflected similar concerns in state agencies. From one to three persons were interviewed in each of the states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Officials seemed to concur on certain factors impeding improvement of state performance in meeting children's needs. Included were factors connected with: service delivery systems; minority and impoverished target  populations; administrative coordination; staffing shortages; training and public education needs; federal paperwork demands; and data collection deficiences. Among top priority areas listed by respondents were: abused and neglected children, the handicapped, day care and kindergarten screening for developmental disabilities, upgrading of basic learning skills, and maternal and infant care.

The cities and towns which are analyzed range in size from less than 100 to 50,000 population and, as of 1970, include over 30 million people or about one-half of the total population living outside metropolitan places. For this study, a constant geographic boundary is maintained, and the research relates to places outside metropolitan areas as defined in 1963. Variations in population growth are examined by size groupings and other variables such as regional location, presence of an interstate highway, distance from a metropolitan central city, and annexation. Results  from both the 1950's and 1960's indicate that any general view of small towns as dying is grossly inaccurate, for nonmetropolitan areas grew in population 14% in 1950-60 and 10% in 1960-70 (a rate of growth which was less rapid than that of urban areas, but more rapid than that of the nonmetropolitan population outside incorporated places) and while there were growing and declining towns in all size classes, only the very smallest of village classes experienced population loss more commonly than growth between 1960-70.

Three teaching models are discussed: the Impression Model, which depicts the mind of a student as receiving and storing external impressions; the Insight Model, which denies the possibility that ideas or knowledge can be conveyed by language, and describes knowledge to be the result of insight into meaning; and the Rule Model, which describes the intent of teaching to be the acquisition of knowledge. The characteristic features of these models constitute the analytical scheme which is used to identify the teaching models in transcribed chemistry and physics lessons in grades 11, 12, and 13.

Two analyses of the concept of teaching are examined and the emphasis upon rationality in Western culture is placed in historical context. An analysis of the form of arguments is presented, including an argument-pattern that facilitates the identification of the kind of authority conveyed by an argument. Episodes selected from a set of twelve secondary school science lessons are examined. Analyses of three teachers' arguments illustrate the considerations involved in determining the kind of authority a classroom argument suggests. (MH)",

In fiscal year 1977, Federal R&D obligations are expected to total $23.5 billion, a record high and an increase of 8.6% over 1976. This upward shift occurs despite the fact that more than one-half of the R&D functional areas reflect declines or only nominal increases. Of the 15 functions that categorize Federal R&D programs in 1977, four reflect significant increases: energy development and conversion - up 24%; education - up 15%; science and technology base - up 14%; and national defense - up 13%. The largest dollar decrease - $100 million - is scheduled for health, and the next - $19 million - is represented by crime  prevention and control. Data are graphed to show R&D funding trends for 1969, 1976 (est.) and 1977 (est.), and for the period 1969-1977 R&D functions are tabulated by function. (Author/MH)",

In four surveys, data were collected to determine critical parameters affecting clientele usage of the facilities, so that recommendations could be made to rectify problem areas. The data indicated that both centers attract a young, highly educated segment of the general population. Many of the non-grouped clientele come to the centers in small family units and are regular visitors. It was also found that nearly all of the grouped clientele consist of preschool through intermediate-aged children. On the basis of the collected data, the recommended  actions include: (1) investment of a greater amount of resources in programs and facilities for non-grouped children, (2) acceptance of certain modifications in nature center programs and facilities to attract the elderly, the handicapped, and upper-level academic groups, and (3) alternation of internal and external facilities and programs to comply with standards noted in the literature and clientele requests.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to establish baseline data relating to the environmental knowledge and beliefs of fifth-year secondary students in England. The instrument developed for the survey consisted of three questionnaires, each containing a total of 45 cognitive and affective items. All items were pilot tested in nine English secondary schools. A random sample of 500 secondary schools, representing the major types of schools in England, was mailed packaged instructions including the instrument. A total of 383 schools responded, providing information from over 11,000 fifth-year students. Although the students appeared to have a poor command of factual environmental knowledge, they demonstrated a greater understanding of environmental concepts and generally expressed positive  attitudes toward the environment. Significant differences in environmental knowledge were found with respect to sex, school type, sex composition of the school, school size and region. Significant differences in environmental attitude were found with respect to school type and sex composition of the school, but attitudinal differences could not be attributed to sex, school size or region. The computation of correlation coefficients revealed relationships between conceptual knowledge and attitude (r = 0.48), factual and conceptual knowledge (r = 0.44), and factual knowledge and attitude (r = 0.38).

Results indicated that 74% of physics students were at the formal level of operation and 40% of the potential physics students were at the formal level; all 130 major concepts analyzed from six physics textbooks required a formal level of operation.

        "description":"Dimensions of scientific literacy with regard to a theoretical definition were inferred for a group of science oriented persons, a group of nonscience oriented persons, and the two groups combined. Comparisons of the strength of agreement of the two groups, and of subgroups of the two groups, with the inferred dimensions were made. The sample consisted of five subgroups comprised of 37 university pure science, 38 university applied science, 75 university nonscience, 100 public science, and 100 public nonscience persons. A theoretical model of scientific literacy was developed and used to develop a 45 statement Q-set. Each person was asked to sort the Q-set in terms of &quot;What should be expected of most high school graduates with regard to science?&quot; A forced sort, five cards per  nine piles, was required, representing a continuum from +4, MOST IMPORTANT, to -4, LEAST IMPORTANT. A questionnaire was administered to collect predictor variable data. Relationships between the inferred dimensions and the predictor variables, (a) educational level, (b) amount of science education, (c) educational level of parents, (d) age, and (e) sex, were investigated. It was found, among other things, that membership in subgroups was more related to respondents' perception of scientific literacy than was membership in the two groups; and, in general, that an inverse relationship existed between educational level and valuing of inferred dimensions.

The purpose of the conferences was to elicit ideas for developing a research agenda from individuals with diverse backgrounds, all of whom had expertise in working with bicultural or bilingual students. Recommendations in the conferences were for the National Institute of Education to support a variety of activities that were grouped under the following areas: (1) professional participation of minorities in policy formulation and research; (2) research themes and investigations related to cultural pluralism; (3) specific research studies in policy, language acquisition, and assessment; (4) research on curriculum; and (5) research on  teacher preparation. The most pervasive theme to emerge from the conferences was that education should acknowledge and promote the pluralistic reality of American society.

        "description":"This paper presents a review in phenomenological perspective of the diagnostic and prescriptive literature that asks why and how educational reforms occur. The work has three objectives. The first is to search the historical and current international literature for educational reform theories and to demonstrate how these theories are rooted in systematic orientations concerning social reality and the social change process. The second objective is to demonstrate how the major educational reform theories lead to logically consistent assumptions concerning necessary preconditions, rationales, processes, and the like. The third objective is to stimulate a greater awareness among educational planners of how their biases constrain their ability to explore the full range of potentially  effective strategies for reform. Findings include the following: (1) systematic attempts to explain and predict educational reform phenomena are fairly numerous but lack analytical rigor and testability; (2) a number of theoretical orientations can be identified; (3) these orientations are not random or eclectic but, rather, follow from personal bias concerning theoretical and ideological orientations to social reality and social change process; and (4) the literature is deficient in work that acknowledges personal bias in attempts to conceptualize reform causes and effects. An extensive bibliography is included. (Author/RM)",

Written primarily for an audience of Catholic priests, the report aims at spreading understanding about the legal parameters of religious studies in public education and at increasing religious literacy of public school students of all faiths. Information is given on specific models of religious education, values clarification models, the role of the clergy, the role of the public school teacher, teaching and learning aids, and steps which individual priests and priests' councils can take to encourage religious literacy. The authors conclude that clergy of all faiths must realize that millions of young people are not reached by church programs and,  consequently, are growing up to be religious illiterates. In response to this situation, they recommend that clergy encourage public school educators to provide religious literacy opportunities for students. Included in the document are a listing of Supreme Court decisions regarding religion and public education, a copy of the budget of the Task Force on Religious Studies in Public Education, and addresses of organizations to contact for further information.

The purpose of the project, intended for use on the elementary, intermediate, and secondary levels, is to help students develop skills to deal with mobility from community to community and from one life-style to another. The interim report on the project is presented as three papers and four appendices. The first paper describes the social profile of a community as a mirror with six dimensions: physical environment, history, people, economic base, political structure and process, and cultural view. The author classifies all American communities as either urban, rural nonfarm, or rural farm. The  second paper discusses the relationship between the Colorado project, which encourages local autonomy in education, and the accountability movement which favors state control. The third paper explains how to construct a community social profile congruent with social science concepts. The appendices present information on social science disciplines, knowledge objectives of the curriculum, newspaper coverage of the project, and proceedings from meetings of the project members.

Designed to teach children about themselves and their air, water, and land environments in an increasingly interdependent world, the units focus on natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, weather upsets, pollution, and scarcity of natural resources. Each unit specifies objectives, materials, grade levels, and teaching procedures; supplies history briefs of related materials; defines terms where necessary; and provides a summary and footnotes. Activities include simulation of an earthquake and a simple watershed,  class discussion of environment-oriented articles from the newspaper, cutting out natural objects from construction paper, testing for bacteria, making models of geographic areas, and listening as the teacher reads stories of natural disasters.

Students examine the cultural traits of the Indians who live in 12 cultural areas to note the cause-and-effect relationship of traits to the environment and to make comparisons between cultural areas. The materials consist of 12 student booklets and a teacher's guide which contains learning activities, library research topics, discussion questions for each cultural area, and a six-page selected bibliography of student and teacher books. There is a student booklet on each of the following 12 areas: arctic, subarctic, northwest coast, california, plateau, great basin, southwest, plains, prairie, northeast, southeast, and  meso-American. Short readings provide students with background information on the area's geography and climate and on the area's Indian society, including a description of its food, clothing, shelter, arts and crafts, and leaders. Responding to questions asked by the teacher, students discuss and examine their findings. They also participate in many class activities such as writing short stories, drawing maps, making sketches of Indian artifacts and jewelry, drawing a floor plan of the inside of a longhouse, and doing library research. Although the teacher's guide and student booklets are available on microfiche, 12 portrait drawings for display and a chart which outlines the cultural traits of each area are available only in hard copy from the publisher.

The main purposes of the guidelines are to specify proper goals of school reform efforts and to designate the relationship which should exist between the school and the ethnic identities and attachments of students. The boundaries of the guidelines are set upon five basic principles: (1) school sensitivity to ethnic diversity, (2) ethnic pluralism, (3) teacher responsibility to incorporate ethnic material into lessons, (4) modification of curriculum and teaching strategy to reflect ethnic diversity, and (5) the necessity of ethnic studies for all students. The guidelines are  divided into three sections. Section I, A Rationale for Ethnic Pluralism, describes society, the nature of the school and the learner in an ethnically pluralistic society, and goals for school reform. Section II, Curriculum Guidelines for Multiethnic Education, describes the ideal characteristics of school environments which are consistent with ethnic pluralism. Section III, Multiethnic Education Program Evaluation Checklist, provides a seven-page checklist for assessing specific school environments. (Author/DB)",

The problems of providing quality education in India after 190 years of British rule, which left only l3 percent of the Indian population literate at the time of India's independence in 1947, are discussed. India's postcolonial attempts at modernizing its educational process through successive five-year plans of development are reviewed. Two aims of educational development are specified: to broaden access to education and to develop a national system of education which is rooted in the basic values of the Indian nation. A background history on India is provided which discusses the positive and negative aspects of British educational administration in  India, the four Five-Year Plans and the three annual plans, the Kothari Commission Report and its recommendations, and postcolonial development of facilities at each educational level. Educational failures of the Indian government are reviewed. Most failures have been due to financial problems. The recent Five-Year Plan appears to be avoiding many of the failures of the past plans. References are included. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"A simulation game of strategy relating to alternate confession choices of two prisoners is described. The game, Prisoner's Dilemma, is designed to help participants learn about trust, cooperation, competition, intergroup dynamics, and their own life role and feelings. Three choices are offered at the beginning of the game to two prisoners, held incommunicado, each charged with the same crime: (1) both prisoners confess and can be convicted, (2) neither prisoner confesses and neither can be convicted, and (3) one prisoner confesses and one does not, allowing the first to go free and the other to receive a more severe punishment. Each choice relates to the central dilemma of whether a rational prisoner should confess, and it is plotted along a two-by-two matrix indicating the  outcome. A postgame analysis is recommended. Seven discussion questions concerning individual players' reactions during the game and their feelings about other players are suggested. Problems of assessing what people actually learn in games of this type are recognized. Game instructions, references, and a matrix and tally sheet are included in the paper. (Author/DB)",

Three papers in section two discuss the application of anthropology in three undergraduate programs. These papers are concept-oriented and deal with ways of improving anthropology teaching so that students will gain understanding of social complexities. Section three contains two papers dealing with the problems of teaching anthropology at the community-college  level. One of the papers proposes a structural solution to the problems of teaching a traditional introductory course. The second paper reports on a workshop for inservice training of anthropology instructors at all levels. The fourth section contains a paper in which the contribution of mass media communication to anthropology teaching is discussed.

Intended as an exploration of the relationship between funding agencies and the individual anthropological researcher, the articles generally question the degree of control which the anthropologist can exert on research. The basic premise of the papers is that anthropology possesses a methodology and a conceptual framework which can contribute to a better understanding of the cultural process of education within a society. The first two papers explore the political considerations of research by investigating federal-agency programs and by measuring the involvement of anthropologists in federally contracted evaluation. The third paper discusses the relationship between educational policy and  anthropological fieldwork and concludes that policy makers might be more receptive to research if it is related directly to the premises of a particular policy. The research methodology that has developed in the field is discussed in the last paper. Its author relates that the conceptual framework of educational anthropology possesses a comparative orientation, places a high value on situational variables, and values intensive field study.

        "description":"Four aspects of national identity are investigated that seem relevant to an understanding of the complex sociopsychological ties which bind individuals to the nation-state. The four aspects of national identity are self-identity, consciousness of national identity, perception of nation-state, and citizenship role within nation-state. Two parallel case studies of national identity in Brazil were performed to investigate the four aspects. A questionnaire was administered to 178 undergraduates at the Universidade de Sao Paulo in Sao Paulo and to 193 undergraduates at the Universidade Federal do Para in Belem. Findings indicated that Belem respondents appear to place more emphasis on nationality than the Sao Paulo respondents. How strongly a person in Sao Paulo identifies with the  nation-state has implications for how politically active one is likely to be and how one is likely to perceive Brazilian society. In contrast, in Belem identification with the nation-state is a more general phenomenon, thus revealing little about the individual's perceptions and behavioral dispositions. The difference may exist because national identity in Belem seems to assume a religious, other-worldly cast or because people in Belem simply are further removed from detailed information about Brazilian society and from channels of political change. It was concluded that, although further research must be done, psychological survey research techniques are useful for examining national identity. (Author/ND)",

Issues raised include evolution, arctic survival, population pressures, limited resources, species survival, starvation, and cultural myths.

First, the author examines the range of teaching methods from formal lecture to open discussion and identifies commentary-discussion as the most widely used technique. In this technique, the teacher summarizes, interprets, or clarifies information, while giving cues for verbal interaction with students at the same time. Four categories of technical teaching skills are seen to be effective in instructional behavior. \"Organizational class moves\" occur when the teacher builds into the lesson a segment of time whereby the major focus of the lesson is outlined or reviewed. When the teacher establishes a context  to which additional information will be related, a \"structuring class move\" occurs. This is useful before posing a question, for example. \"Conditional class moves\" involve statement of a premise and immediate linking of the premise to consequent statements or questions. Provision of silence to allow students time to think about a response or to complete a task comprises a \"wait-time class move.\" These skills should help students attain instructional goals. (AV)",

She explains how her sociological training provided many skills particularly suited to the role, including quantitative and qualitative research methods, ability to detect adverse effects (latent consequences) of employment policies, and innovative management techniques. Her conclusions are that the sociology practitioner can help factor out the universals from the personal and  institutional characteristics with which effective affirmative action is associated. Insight gained from serving in the role can contribute to more viable solutions to institutional sexism and racism. (Author/AV)",

The focus was on news about local international involvement. The teachers who developed the unit believe that study of local newspapers enriches information about the world and that articles about community ties to the world provide a springboard for research that enlivens international studies and relates the local scene to a world picture. In a particular Sunday paper, students identified articles about a typhoon in Japan, oil investors, closing of the post exchange in Turkey, and European-bred cattle which won awards at the Illinois State Fair. Students looked up relevant information about each  country and learned how each foreign event could influence life in Peoria. Specific activities and discussion questions are provided, based on articles about sports, industry, agriculture, culture, immigrants, science, government, careers, population, and education. All activities and discussion questions can be used in the study of any community. (AV)",

        "description":"In a review of research, inhibited career and achievement motivation in women is analyzed and a humanistic goal for both sexes is proposed. The author believes that women have not caught up with the opportunities available to them to contribute to society through their careers. They do not contribute as much as men do to the humanities, arts, and sciences, and they do not contribute commensurate with their talents and potential. Factors related to inhibited career and achievement motivation include reduction in academic self-confidence, fear of success, vicarious achievement motivation, home-career conflict, work discrimination, low risk-taking behavior, and sex-role orientation. The author is presently studying the potency of these factors to predict achievement and career  motivation in various samples of women. Results might be useful in developing diagnostic measures to prescribe change strategies in cases where low motivation is identified. A humanistic goal of sex-free roles is proposed, based on bicultural school curriculum, career guidance in schools, and individual open-mindedness toward shared responsibilities. (AV)",

The main focus is on the experience of blacks, Jews, Chicanos, Puerto Ricans, Italian Americans, Asian Americans, and native Americans from 1880 to 1920. Four themes characteristic of the period are studied: immigration and minority groups, industrialization, urbanization, and imperialism and the rise of the United States to world power. In developing each theme, the unit suggests an outline of the subject, discussion questions, student activities, and appropriate audiovisual materials. Students perform comparative analyses of famous novels of the period, do research on stereotypes in the media, visit local city or state museums, and identify class ancestry on a world  map as \"new\" and \"old\" immigrants. A selected annotated bibliography for teachers lists 14 books and journals. Another annotated bibliography for students contains over 200 references in categories of Ethnic Groups and Ethnic History, General History, and Social and Behavioral Science Reference. A glossary defines concepts or terms relating to social sciences or particular ethnic groups. (AV)",

Results show that the program improved student reading and writing skills to a greater extent than other classes. Students also gained a greater ability to analyze and  verbalize problems and issues in a logical, consistent frame of thought. Student test results also show marked improvements in academic achievement.

Siegfried argues that a semester of proctoring teaches a student more than a one-semester, upper-level economics course and that credit should be given. Tietenberg disagrees. When two groups of students, comprised of proctors and students in an upper-level course, were given the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), the proctors scored highest. However, Tietenberg claims, the proctors had been exposed to an introductory course which the CLEP content focuses on, while students in upper-level courses dealt in-depth with specific  areas of economics which the CLEP is not designed to measure. The educational outputs of the two types of courses are different, and it is difficult for a single instrument to adequately measure the outputs on a one-dimensional scale. In terms of costs and benefits of proctoring, Tietenberg notes that proctoring takes more of a student's time than taking an upper-level elective. His research shows self-pacing effects and workload effects from increased time requirements on Personalized System of Instruction (PSI) students. (AV)",

Two major questions addressed by the group are identified. First, is there sufficient research information to guide precollege economic education development?

The general conclusion of the conference was that precollege economic education would benefit from increased research and development of a coordinated nature. The following six recommendations were made: (1) an operational definition of economic literacy must be developed; (2) a number of new instruments must be created at all grade levels to test the  level of student understanding of and attitudes toward economics; (3) research is needed on why people do or do not wish to learn economics; (4) a more extensive program of materials development should be initiated; (5) teacher inservice programs must be continued and improved; and (6) the services of the Joint Council on Economic Education should be fully utilized.

Methods and results of a study are described in which four questions were explored: (1) does instructional intervention or increased  maturity over time promote a child's success in economic decision making and analysis; (2) to what extent does instructional intervention allow children to master concepts that they are considered too young to learn; (3) what types of school, home, and personality variables predict success in economic understanding; and (4) what are parents' attitudes toward primary-level economic education. Results showed that instructional intervention and positive parent attitude help children master economics. (AV)",

        "description":"The labeling theory of deviance is used as a basis from which to comment on the dynamics of the labeling process in schools in general. Several research studies have demonstrated the self-fulfilling prophecy of labeling techniques. Four types of behavior can be distinguished: behavior that breaks a rule and is labeled as deviant; behavior that does not break a rule and is not labeled as deviant; behavior that does not break a rule but is labeled as having done so; and behavior that breaks a rule but is not labeled as deviant. IQ tests, personality tests, and categories such as \"slow learner\" and \"hyperactive\" are seen to be guilty of attaching stigmatic labels and, in some cases, mislabeling altogether. The effects of being labeled appear to encourage behavior conforming to the  label; the individual is treated by others as being deviant and, consequently, identifies with the traits inherent in the deviance. Analysis is made of the active/passive role of the student in the labeling process and of the conditions under which and processes through which students are stabilized in deviant careers.

        "description":"This study investigates the level of agreement among four groups--students, parents, teachers, and administrators--in reference to a particular set of school objectives: the teaching of social studies in secondary schools. Twelve objectives for social studies teaching were given to the four groups for rank ordering on a five-point scale of importance. A comparison of the rankings shows that students tend to rate all objectives except environmental studies lower than the other groups and that students tend to take extreme stands (highest or lowest rating among the four groups) on objectives. In general, the study shows that students and teachers tend to disagree on their ratings and that administrators tend to align themselves with the view of teachers while parents generally  agree with students. The picture is one of polarization between school personnel and those who benefit from the school program. This contrast may be a partial explanation for conflict between the school and those whom it seeks to serve, and may also provide a reason for parental discontent. Further research should be directed toward verification of these findings and to resolution of the differences among the four populations represented in the study. (Author/AV)",

The evaluation shows that the museum is serving the community successfully and has met its broad goal of giving children an opportunity to develop positive self-concepts and to grow cognitively through manipulation of a responsive environment. The museum has developed high involvement activities that need low supervision. The activities have been most successful with children ages three through eight. In an ethnic kitchen children learn to measure ingredients, churn butter, and use similar ingredients to produce a variety of breads from different cultures. They are involved in role play and language development through the use of  hand puppets and a grandmother's attic exhibit. Other exhibits include a stream table, where children build terraces and dams, and a wildlife exhibit of stuffed animals, which allows the children to touch and feel the animals that live in Colorado. Children play games on a computer terminal, look at familiar objects with microscopes, and &quot;see their voice&quot; with oscilloscopes. The museum schedules time for Denver public school students to visit the exhibits and, through its outreach program, places exhibits in places such as Day Care and Head Start centers for a week or two at a time. The museum serves as a training facility for people interested in pursuing child development as a career by working with education departments of nearby universities and with high school students. It also  offers parenting workshops. (Author/RM)",

A questionnaire was mailed to 289 scholars and course instructors who responded to questions relating to the teaching and researching of African politics. Findings show that most respondents had conducted research and felt most familiar with Anglo-speaking countries. In regard to texts, the most popular work on African politics is &quot;Creating Political Order: The Party-States of West Africa&quot; by Zolberg, but a list of &quot;great books&quot; cannot be determined. Almond and  Powell, Apter, and Huntington were named for contributing approaches to political development that are useful in planning courses, but it was emphasized that no one approach is sufficient. The teaching technique mentioned most frequently was fiction reading assignments, and Achebe's novels compete with scholarly works as assignments. Finally, enrollment in African politics courses is declining, possibly due to socioeconomic interests of students in other areas. (ND)",

The purpose of the survey was to collect and disseminate information about techniques used in teaching political parties, books assigned most frequently to students, works viewed as most important in the field, and current level of student interest in American political parties. Information obtained from 368 faculty shows that classroom methodology is fairly traditional and relies heavily upon the lecture or Socratic lecture method. Student discussion panels, formalized class debate, simulations, audiovisual materials, works of fiction, and Socratic lecture were reported to be effective by almost 75 percent of the respondents. Three works by V. O. Key were selected among the ten  most important works in the field, while Frank Sorauf's \"Party Politics in America\" was an overwhelming choice for use in the classroom. Survey data indicate that student enrollment and interest in the political parties area are increasing despite the general political malaise of that age group and the mediocre performance of the economy.

Activities relate to food, clothing, communication, and tool production. They use a range of skills and abilities and can be performed on an individual basis, in groups, or as class projects. The first three chapters suggest activities to clarify the meaning of &quot;bicentennial&quot; and America's Bicentennial; review events of the Colonial period and the historical years, 1770-1782; and provide field trips to museums holding Colonial collections. Four chapters on Colonial occupations contain a total of 24 activities with explicit objectives, lists of materials needed, and directions for  each activity. Students make beef jerky, maple syrup, and soap; dye thread; make ink by boiling maple bark, then use a quill to write letters; and fashion corncob pipes, cowbells, and candleholders. In order to compare Colonial and modern production methods, students visit textile mills, food processors, and radio stations. Separate bibliographies of children's books and teacher references are provided, as well as a list of 10 films and filmstrips. (AV)",

The Association of Chinese Teachers (TACT) has received a grant for 1976-77 to develop secondary-level curriculum materials. This publication is one product of that effort. Other products will be sound filmstrips about Chinese Americans; a teacher's guide and an anthology of selected writings by Chinese-American authors; inservice training for teachers; and a public affairs TV program on multicultural education, project activities, and instructional materials. Another grant will enable TACT to develop Chinese-American short stories and to produce curriculum materials for grades 4 through 6 on the Chinese-American  experience in the United States. Suggestions are made for teaching about Chinese Americans from their own perspective, not from the Euro-centric viewpoint. A section titled \"Facts and Figures about Chinese Americans\" explains the origins of Chinese Americans and the pattern of Chinese immigration to the United States from 1857 to 1973. Several maps illustrate the distribution of Chinese Americans in the United States by state. A report on income and occupations shows that Chinese Americans in the job market today are either highly educated professionals or menial workers. (AV)",

        "description":"The contribution of education to social protest movements within the United States and Canada is analyzed. The purpose of the study was to call attention to educational programs which have succeeded in facilitating social change. The method used was evaluation of advantages and limitations of education through case studies of 28 social movements. Research focused on origins of the movement; educational response and rationale; and evaluation of the perceived contributions of education to movement objectives. Results of the 28 case studies indicate that education developed within a movement context increases the capacity for collective action and augments movement opportunity and solidarity. Detailed analyses of a United Farm Workers case study and a Feminist Women's Health  Movement case study are presented. Results of these analyses indicate that the key to social movement organization development is increased individual, group, and organizational competence. The authors conclude that development of organizational competencies over time is the most obvious evidence of the influence of educational programs on social protest movement organization.

A series of ministudies is included which enables the teacher and student to evaluate progress promptly, eliminate bad habits, and establish new procedures quickly, in order that specific skills can be developed. The guide stresses absolute accuracy in all technical details and suggests perfecting pedal techniques before combining hands and feet. Various musical styles are explored, ornamental trills are explained, and construction of the organ itself is discussed. If the work is completed under  the guidance of a competent teacher, the student should be able to pass the American Guild of Organists examination for the service playing certificate or go on for further study. An appendix lists addresses of 66 American music publishers. A selected bibliography of 36 books and essays is included. (Author/AV)",

A series of lectures provided information about contemporary East European societies and broke down preconceptions of Eastern Europe as a monolithic block. Workshop sessions enabled groups of participants with common teaching interests to construct their own outline syllabi and units of course work. In these sessions, participants stressed a need to avoid generalizations about life and work in Eastern Europe, and suggested themes such as &quot;the peasant&quot; by which comparisons could be made across various states. Sample studies were also seen to be instructive. A plenary session allowed working groups to report on  the units they had designed. There was agreement on ideas of integrating knowledge and experience of teachers and learners, and disagreement on the use of &quot;topic&quot; approaches and &quot;general sweeps&quot; of information. A workshop objectives section provides five sample units, including course framework, use of resource materials, and student activities. (AV)",

Questionnaires were administered to randomly-selected respondents, and parents were interviewed as well. Interpretive findings are summarized for 18 question areas concerning textbooks, homework, other reading material, invited guests, community experiences, resource aids, individualized programs, leadership, United Nations, human relations, deciding what is to be taught, parental inclusion, home values, comparing social studies classes, social studies emphasis,  whether social studies should be required, rating social studies usefulness, and identifying what social studies classes are doing best and how to improve. Findings show that all groups agree that invited guests and resource aids should be utilized; many teachers and students are unaware as to whether the community is used as a base for social studies learning experiences; teacher opinions prevail in deciding course content; and parents feel most strongly that teaching home values is important. Among recommended improvements are better teaching, individualized instruction, and out-of-classroom learning experiences. (AV)",

First, the manual presents a background discussion of the materials. The materials resulted from an ethnic education project based on a course for teachers on Community Policies in Ethnic Education at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle. One of the main goals of the project was to develop materials in ethnic studies for grades 5-8 that deal with Greeks, Jews, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians. Two main themes selected for the materials are (1) contributions of an ethnic group to American life and (2) the relationship of an ethnic group to its homeland. The materials concentrate on the following five topics: early settlement of America, mass immigration,  cultural patterns in Europe and USSR, conflicts within the nation, and challenge of an interdependent world. The ways that the themes in the materials can be integrated into an existing curriculum are listed and matched to one of the five topics of ethnic studies. Finally, two short papers are presented that deal with teaching ethnic studies. They are &quot;Problems in Maintaining Ethnic Group Identity and Cohesion&quot; by Thomas Kochman and &quot;The Name of the Game Is Democracy: Transmitting the Concept of Ethnicity and Cultural Pluralism of American Society in a Classroom Setting.&quot; (ND)",

Social prejudice against these groups began in the late 19th century when the demand for Chinese labor in California lessened but the immigrants remained and were seen as a threat to American laborers. Japanese immigrants who were successful in small farming were seen to be a source of economic competition. Segregation in schools and legal abuse of Asians ensued. Press statements and other media contributed to prevailing stereotypes. American-born children of Asian parents suffered double problems of racism and acculturation. The publishing industry conformed to local prejudices in order to sell textbooks; thus, American public education did not help to correct  misinformed discrimination. Many readers and teacher's manuals omitted the existence of other cultures in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Anglo-American values were stressed. History books skimmed Japanese and Chinese history and avoided the topic of immigration. Geography texts gave inaccurate descriptions of China and were more favorable toward, but patronized, Japan. This narrow, ethnocentric approach prevailed in curricula used until the 1940s. (AV)",

The author points out that findings of a survey of the 1950s and early 1960s textbooks reveal limited inclusion of references to anything Asian. This lack of interest can be seen, also, in American society, as represented by current difficulties of assimilating Vietnamese refugees into schools and community life. In terms of schools, there are some positive developments: little overt discrimination, bilingual instruction, and increasing recognition of cultural differences in general. Negative points include continued omission of Asian references in texts and curriculum; continued ethnocentrism and evaluation by Western standards; need for  teacher education to include Asians; and overemphasis on blacks and Spanish-speaking groups to the exclusion of other minorities. The urgency of integrating multicultural studies into the elementary curriculum is confirmed by research showing that children's attitudes toward other nations and peoples stabilize by grade 8. Ideas are offered for developing multicultural curricula. (Author/AV)",

It capsulizes research and writing about meeting individual student needs. Individualized instruction requires that the teacher vary classroom teaching strategies so that students can engage in learning activities that are most appropriate for each as an individual. In order to set up an individualized program, a teacher must organize the program through diagnosis of students' needs, planning activities and methods, remaining flexible to allow for change, and maintaining recordkeeping of student diagnoses and student work. Some possible organization strategies are described: units, inductive approach, learning packets, contracts, independent study, programmed  instruction, case studies, problem solving, group work, research seminars, simulation, sociodrama, and oral history. Recordkeeping, record of needs, activity sheet, student worksheet, and record of achievement are also described. Some models of parts of units are presented for teacher use, such as an inductive exercise and a simulation game.

It identifies priority content and teaching methods for program content, planning, implementation, and evaluation. A rationale for developing a 4-H consumer education program is given which emphasizes the need for such education in a dynamic, changing society. Consumer education is defined in several ways. One definition is that it is related to consumption of private and public goods and services for personal and household use. A curriculum guide for developing a consumer education program in four areas of consumer concern is presented: the consumer as an individual; the consumer as a member of society; the consumer in the  marketplace; and the consumer's business rights and responsibilities. Concepts and generalizations needed to master the competencies are outlined in each area for three age levels--9 to 12 years, 12 to 14 years, and 14 to 19 years of age. The guide concludes with some aids for teaching 4-H consumer education, such as examples of learning experiences, teaching techniques, and learning characteristics of different age groups.

        "description":"The history of sports is closely tied to the larger history of the society in which they are played. Baseball in the United States in the 1920's and l930's assumed a major role in spreading the ideals of fair play, sportsmanship, and democracy to the Far East, with tours by amateur athletes and professionals such as Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth. Even after the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, it was felt that Baseball Diplomacy should continue in order to lessen Japanese resentment at American racial prejudice. The ideals of the early thirties, both in sports and diplomacy, were slowly dispelled by activities in the European sphere, where nations were preparing for war. The major baseball-related news from Japan, after successful tours in 1934, 1935, and 1936, came in 1940,  when radio broadcasting of professional games ceased, and English playing terms and team names were replaced by Japanese words. In August of 1940, baseball was abolished in Japan, and on December seventh, Pearl Harbor was attacked. The sports world tried to explain the deed as a weakness in the Japanese national character, rather than as a failure of the civilizing role of baseball, and threw itself fully into the war effort. A period of idealism and naivete was coming to an end, and sports slowly came to recognize the fact, just as did the rest of society. (MB)",

The first section summarizes the extent of the problem and outlines the philosophical and programmatic approach to VD education formulated by the staff of the Venereal Disease Education Project. In its first three years, the Project offered training and technical assistance to some 10,000 administrators, teachers, health professionals, parents, and students. The staff also  developed publications and audiovisual materials to assist VD educators. The second section focuses on actual VD education programs and highlights four exemplary efforts. Following this, reflections and opinions on VD education from concerned legislators, educators, public health officials, school board members, and students are offered. The booklet concludes with suggestions for classroom activities and other resources that will be helpful to those charged with implementing VD programs, including a sample of classroom activities, techniques for evaluating VD education programs, and discussion of laws affecting VD instruction.

        "description":"The Standing Committee on Teacher Training, Advisory Council on Educational Planning, asserts in this report that the institutions at present engaged in tertiary education--teachers colleges, technical institutes, and universities--despite some degree of overlap, have distinct areas of concern. The content and range of courses as well as methods of teaching vary according to the objectives of each and the people for whom they are provided. Although in some countries, the lines between these differing institutions have become blurred or have even disappeared, the Committee believes the interests of the New Zealand community will be served best by developing each to its fullest potential. The Committee suggests that there is sufficient reason to justify the continued development of  colleges for teaching and teachers for some time, and that to develop teachers colleges into colleges of higher education or liberal arts would tend to hinder them from catering adequately to the needs of teaching. The Committee therefore sees the future role of teachers colleges as being, first, to offer preservice training which, if statisfactorily performed, will give credit for a degree and, second, to undertake increasing responsibility for teacher education beyond the period of preservice training, and for the benefit of people who will not all teach in schools, but will make a significant contribution to the education of New Zealanders.

The Committee in its report investigated the nature of preservice education, the general progression of teaching careers, the need for coordinating pre- and inservice education (to keep abreast of professional developments, to prepare for positions of greater responsibility and leadership, to specialize, to cope with new approaches and unfamilar situations), the question of teacher qualifications, study leave allowances, and the education of teacher educators. The problems of organization and  administration of new inservice programs in view of present resources were also examined. The Committee attached importance to two basic concepts: (1) that the education of teachers should be seen as a continuous, integrated process and (2) that periodic leave for professional renewal should be provided. The Committee also saw three areas requiring urgent action: (1) the support of teachers during the first three years of teaching; (2) thre retraining of senior teachers; and (3) the expansion of courses for secondary teachers.

This report to the Congress by the Comptroller General's Office determined that the Experimental Schools Program will provide information to educators and researchers on the implementation of comprehensive educational change. It will not be able, however, to provide complete data on (1) the ability of school districts to plan for and to implement comprehensive educational changes and (2) the impact of these changes on students, teachers, administrators, and the community. In addition, the program does not insure that projects could provide the type of cost data necessary to determine  compliance with special program financial regulations. The Comptroller General's Office recommended that: (A) project plans approved for funding include (1) documentation of the need for the educational changes sought through the research, (2) specific instructions on how to conduct the research, and (3) specific, measurable objectives in terms of output or impact; (B) evaluations be planned and implemented to provide necessary impact and cost information over the entire life of the project; and (C) procedures for requiring program offices to verify that grantee accounting systems are adequate provide the type of data necessary to insure compliance with financial regulations.

While public education is a state function, governed by laws, authority is delegated to local school boards. Areas in which a teacher may come in conflict with the governing body of the school are described. Freedom of speech, in and outside of the classroom is examined, as well as freedom of association and political activity. The rights of teachers as citizens with constitutional protection are pointed out in the light of where those rights may be limited because of the sensitivity of the teacher's position. The private lives of teachers, their religion, sexual behavior, or manner of dress may conflict with the bias of the local school authority. In most of  these cases the law is vague, and such issues are usually resolved on the basis of discretion rather than clearly defined legal points. The author discusses the issues in teacher employment: collective bargaining and strikes, mandatory retirement, tort liability, tenure, termination of employment, and teacher contracts. On many of the subjects covered in this book examples are given of challenges that were decided in state or federal courts. The legal issues involved in each case are clarified, and the reasoning of the court in making a decision is described. (JD)",

The project proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness of techniques for training senior citizens as remedial tutors, increasing the academic skills of the students, improving the psychological well-being of the students, and providing the classroom teachers with materials developed by the tutors and adolescents. The validation team examined the program, and found it satisfactory in three general areas -- (1) Effectiveness/Success: the project demonstrated success in training senior citizens to act as tutors of the learning disabled student,  academic achievement of these students as well as their attitudes toward school have improved, and positive behavior changes and attitudes were reported by parents; (2) Cost Information: the program followed standard budgetary procedures, expended money in an appropriate fashion, and reported fiscal matters in a fashion easily adoptable or adaptable by other interested school districts; (3) Exportability: the project as written and developed can be exported to other systems. The validation team noted three areas of innovation--the use of senior citizens as tutors for learning disabled students, the use of a game approach rather than a traditional didactic relationship, and the stress on affective as well as cognitive behavioral change on the part of both tutor and tutee.

(3) \"Alternatives and Constraints\"--colleges should strive to attract the best candidates, provide complete evaluation of all phases of their education product, enhance curriculum flexibility,  deploy and fully utilize all existing resources, and develop new programs. (4) \"Laboratory Schools\"--the laboratory school has evolved from facilities for observation and student teaching into teacher training centers designed for child study, program development, technique dissemination, and preservice and inservice implementation of programs; recommendations were made to develop and expand center role and to facilitate interaction between centers. (5) \"Certification and Accreditation\"--the certification procedure should be amended to include periodic reevaluation based on continued professional growth, and inservice programs should be expanded. (6) \"Partnerships for Teacher Education\"--preservice and inservice should be viewed in a continuum, and a collaborative effort of training  institutions and school districts should be developed.

Areas discussed include: What research tells us regarding the contribution of exercise to the health of older people; exercise and the aging process; activity and older Americans; staying youthful and fit; importance of physical activity for the elderly; physical activity and aging; psychological importance of physical fitness; value of regular exercise programs for senior citizens; and a fitness program for senior citizens developed by the National Association for Human Development with quotes from various leaders of physical fitness. A statement by C.  Carson Conrad, Executive Director, President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, is representative of much of the testimony: Regular exercise can significantly delay the aging process by inhibiting the losses of vital capacity, muscular strength, and joint flexibility, which are characteristic of the middle and later years. It is a fundamental law of physiology that the functional efficiency of an organ or system improves with use and regresses with disease. Regular exercise may deter the onset of degenerative diseases, which are among today's major killers, and it may improve the ability to survive and recover from heart attack by promoting the development of collateral circulation in the heart muscle. A state of physical fitness enhances the quality of life for the elderly by  increasing their independence. The ability to go places and do things without being dependent on others provides a strong psychological lift that is conducive to good mental health. (MM)",

Chapter two investigates the salient features of three nationwide programs (Program for Learning in Accordance with Needs--PLAN*, Individually Prescribed Instruction--IPI, and Individually Guided Education--IGE). These three programs are the most highly organized, widely disseminated efforts in public elementary school  individualized education, and together contain most of the elements in any individualized system. Chapter three describes the programs of nine selected schools, some of which were locally developed, and some of which were a mixture of local and national programs. Chapter four lists and describes critical aspects of planning, implementing, and evaluating systems of individualization. Chapter five examines problems involved with the individualization process--problems of individual schools in a system trying to &quot;go it alone,&quot; problems of record keeping, community support, scheduling, team teaching, learning environments, and funding.

The subjects for this study were l9 novice TAs and 705 students enrolled in the introductory psychology course at Cornell University during the fall of 1975. The independent variable of this experiment was defined as TA participation in either an experimental or a control version of a seminar entitled, \"The Teaching of Psychology.\" At random, ten TAs were assigned to the experimental group, and the other nine TAs were assigned to the control group. The  experimental version of the seminar consisted of scheduled reading assignments on college teaching, at least two individual conferences for each TA with the course instructor, an individual video critique session for each TA, one unstructured group meeting with the course instructor, and five formal workshop sessions. The training program was designed by the investigator to encompass a broad range of teaching competencies. Several general skills related to overall course design were emphasized: (1) specifying instructional objectives; (2) utilizing objectives in the design of instruction and tests; and (3) making the cognitive levels of objectives congruent with the cognitive levels of instructional activities and tests. Specific skills were emphasized for facilitating student-centered  discussions. The control version of the seminar consisted of fewer and unscheduled reading assignments, two unstructured group meetings with the course instructor, and the opportunity for each TA to view a videotape of his or her teaching, but alone and without any critique.

Factors in the children's immediate environment, presumed to influence interest in physical activities, were also investigated. These include: the children's attitudes toward sport and gymnastics; the children's knowledge of and participation in sport; the children's physiological status; and the influence exerted by family, friends, and the local community on the children's attitudes towards physical activity. Information was acquired by several different methods. Motor capacity was explored by means of a test battery incorporating several different tests of strength,  coordination, and circulation. Interests, attitudes, and experiences in physical education were determined by questionnaire and interview responses. The cognitive dimension of the children's conceptions of sport was tested with the aid of a specially constructed test that required the children to look at pictures of different sports and then identify the sport, its characteristics, and the rules of play. To supplement the information gathered from the children, parents completed questionnaires concerning the parents' leisure and sporting pursuits, sporting interests, attitudes towards their children's sporting activities, and appraisals of their children's physical status. The children's teachers completed a similar questionnaire. Final results are not reported in this document.  (MM)",

The investigation involved a chemistry learning sequence with 53 eleventh- and twelth-grade students for which tests were administered to measure both progress during the sequence and achievement and retention after the sequence. One of three types of remedial work was prescribed for those achieving less than mastery. Group one received treatment modeled after the Learning-for-Mastery System (small  group study, peer tutoring, self study, discussions with the teacher). Group two received Personalized System of Instruction remediation (repeating reading and problem assignments, review notes, and laboratory reports). Group three received no further instruction on the objectives but was given optional assignments to improve grade level. An unannounced, delayed-achievement posttest was given 13 weeks later to elicit the retention data upon which the report was based. (MB)",

It was planned for several audiences: the staff of the National Institute of Education; other personnel in federal, state, and local governments; members of Congress; researchers and developers; trainers; administrators of R&D programs; and interested members of the general public. The databook has seven chapters, beginning with the introduction. Chapter 2 presents a statistical overview of the status of American education which provides a context for the subsequent discussion of educational research, development, dissemination, and utilization. Chapter 3 describes the complementary sponsorship roles of federal, state, and local governments; federal  coordination efforts; and foundation and commercial sponsorship of R&D in education. Three chapters dealing with the structure and process of educational R&D follow. Chapter 4 deals with the conduct of R&D; Chapter 5 with the dissemination of R&D products; and Chapter 6 with the utilization of R&D products. These three chapters focus on organizations and personnel that provide capability for each R&D function, as well as on activities encompassed by each function. Chapter 7 begins a discussion of emerging factors that will affect educational R&D in the future. Tables are provided throughout for users who need quantitative details, and at the same time, the narrative highlights the major points supported by the quantitative information. Descriptions of many R&D products are included, and  for those seeking greater detail, the bibliography identifies sources in which more extensive descriptions and tabulations appear. (MM)",

This paper describes the process that was used to identify the competencies. A number of different approaches have been advocated by various educators for identifying the competencies required for a given role--all of these approaches include some type of role or task analysis, review of research related to role functions, and an analysis of literature advocating new functions for the roles. The competencies presented in this paper were identified through the following process: (1) a comprehensive review of the literature related to inservice and preservice education which provided the basic  information on the functions and tasks of the school based teacher educator's role; (2) interviews conducted with 19 supervisory personnel representing five school districts provided practicing professional's perceptions of the school based teacher educator role; (3) an initial list of competency statements was drawn, and to further analyze and validate the list, an external expert review was organized and conducted; (4) competency statements were again reviewed and revised several times. This paper concludes with a list of 20 competency statements along with the remark that at the time of the paper's writing more specific competency statements were still being developed. (MM)",

To study this question, a series of related issues were posed and investigated: (1) Is there a need for credentialing? (2) What institution would award the credential, and should recognition be local or statewide? (3) To what extent should individuals and institutions be required to participate in the credentialing system? (4) Would the credential be permanent or renewable? (5) What is the basis for the credential? (6) What procedures would determine the award of the credential? and (7) What would be the form of the credential? In Section I, each of the above issues is discussed. Section II reports a study of professional  perceptions concerning each of these issues gathered from 152 educators. Texas teachers, administrators, and teacher educators in Houston, Galena Park, Abilene, Waco, and Tyler responded to a survey that was completed as part of a regularly scheduled professional meeting. The state Teacher Education and Standards Committee also completed the survey. Section III reports on the deliberations of 85 educators at a state SBTE conference in the spring of 1976. Twelve small groups worked independently to design a system for credentialing SBTE. Each of these proposals is described with general conclusions. Appendix A concerns the Credentialing/Recognition System for School Based Teacher Educators; Appendix B, the Recognition of SBTE; and Appendix C, a Recognition System for SBTE. (MM)",

The first section of this monograph examines the significant causes for this renaissance. It is pointed out that although great strides have been made in a relatively short time, it is erroneous to conclude that the bilingual/bicultural education movement is proceeding smoothly; there has been and will continue to be great opposition to its concept, philosophy, and practice. Both sides of the issue are treated in Section II, aptly titled, \"The Controversy in Bilingual/Bicultural Education: Melting Pot vs. Cultural Pluralism.\" Most administrators, counselors, teachers, and teacher educators, we  are reminded, have been trained under the melting pot theory, which is now being challenged. Section III discusses implications for bilingual/bicultural teacher training, including: guidelines for improvement of teacher training; teacher views of bilingual/bicultural education; and responses of teacher training institutions in training bilingual personnel. Section IV reviews ERIC publications concerning bilingual teacher training and presents recommendations based on an ERIC search. Seven appendixes offer: (1) approved bilingual education fellowship programs; (2) office of bilingual education grant awards; (3) location of Lau Centers in the United States and states served; (4) major U.S. Commission on Civil Rights hearings for various linguistically and culturally distinct peoples; (5)  guidelines for the preparation and certification of teachers; (6) random sample of institutions in the Southwest that have teacher education programs; and (7) bibliography of ERIC publications.

        "description":"The College of Education of the Cleveland State University opened its first graduate program in 1968. The purpose of the study reported here is to provide information for reflection about the college's past performance and for planning new directions in its graduate programs. The study uses information from college and university records, organized so that it shows what has happened in the college's graduate programs and to the students who enrolled in them. The findings are organized around four topics: (a) patterns of admissions; (b) student characteristics; (c) student performance and progress; and (d) predicting student performance. It was found that the College of Education, over the eight years reviewed here, admitted a very large, diverse group of students to graduate  study. It graduated, or is likely to graduate, only a small portion of those students. The reasons for most of the student attrition remain unknown; this study has only shown the magnitude of attrition and that the reasons for it are not academic. (MM)",

The papers, presented at a 1975 conference sponsored by the LTI to assess the federal contribution to administrator education, discussed the kinds of training and experience administrators need and what the federal government role should be in leadership preparation. No concensus was sought, but several themes emerged: (1) the nonpolitical, placid world of educational administration is now filled with turmoil and conflict; (2) the new activism by educational consumers suggests that educational leadership may be too narrowly defined; (3) traditional, university-based administration programs are out ot touch with the  reality of public schools, especially urban schools, and do not fully and properly prepare educational leaders for the world in which they must operate; and (4) because of its investment in education, and because of current and future needs, the federal government does have a role in the preparation of educational leaders. Discussion centered on concerns that should be taken into account in refining the federal role. (MB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this project was to evaluate the FEHR (formative evaluation and heuristic research) Practicum training model, a computerized simulation providing practical experience in decision-oriented educational research and evaluation. The report is organized into five chapters. Chapter one contains an introductory discussion of the needs and purposes served, a description of a practicum session, and specifications for each of the physical components of the system. Chapter two contains a description of the computer program which generates FEHR Practicum Data, and presents evidence of its portability and adaptability. Chapter three describes the evolution of the present set of simulation problems and provides evidence of the internal validity of each problem. Chapter four  presents the results of the empirical evaluation of the FEHR Practicum system in a variety of instructional roles. The fifth and final chapter provides a summary of the evidence regarding the system's effectiveness and discusses the implications for its dissemination and use. The findings provide evidence that, correctly used, the FEHR system can be useful in teaching research/evaluation skills. Its flexible form has proven quite effective for creative instructors who are willing to adapt their methods to the problem-solving mode that is most compatible with the FEHR system. The definitive finding of the evaluation was that FEHR projects are most effective when they are an integral part of a training curriculum teaching research/evaluation techniques and principles in a problem-solving  discovery mode.

A sample of 957 teachers were questioned on (1) alternative systems of transfer, (2) factors influencing the choice of teaching site, (3) factors exempting a teacher from remote area service, (4) incentives that might attract teachers to unpopular service areas. Factors influencing teachers in their choice of assignment site were the availability of educational facilities for their children, employment or tertiary education for children, cost of living, employment for  spouse, proximity to friends and family, cultural and professional facilities. Listed as exemption factors were ill health, sole support of parent, university attendance, education needs of teacher's children, and marriage of female teachers. Incentives thought influential were salary loading, housing, long service leave, travel, and family education concessions. (MB)",

Eight groups of eighth-grade boys were assigned to two teachers, four groups for each. Two hypotheses were under examination: (1) A task-oriented teacher will be more effective in terms of student learning in a situation that is unfavorable rather than favorable for being a teacher; (2) A person-oriented teacher will be more effective in a situation that is favorable rather than unfavorable for being a teacher. The test studied the interrelationship between teacher style and situational factors with student performance. The subject was word imagery. The task-oriented teacher gave directions one  step at a time, criticized and praised individuals, remained aloof from the group, and determined how the session should be conducted. The person-oriented teacher explained the subject, criticized and praised the group as a whole, and conducted the session democratically as a member of the group. While statistically accurate measurement of pupil achievement under the different teaching styles and situations were not obtainable, a general conclusion was reached. The implication was that teacher education students should be taught to vary their teaching style according to the favorableness of the teaching situation. Appendixes include the test given to the students after the teaching session; instructions to the two teachers; and a form for the students to use in evaluating the experience.  (JD)",

Subjects were 98 student teachers and 98 cooperating teachers. Responses were obtained from the student teachers on how they perceived the cooperating teacher performing his role and how they preferred the cooperating teacher to perform his role. Cooperating teachers were asked to indicate how they perceived their role in working with student teachers. Four descriptive models were used to gather these responses from the student teachers and cooperating teachers. Matches and non-matches of both the perception and  the preference of the cooperating teacher's role were compared. A nine-point rating scale was used by the cooperating teachers to determine the student teacher's satisfaction with the student teaching experience. It was concluded that how the student teacher preferred or perceived the cooperating teacher's role, when compared to how the cooperating teacher perceived his role, did not have significant effect on how the student teacher was rated at the end of the quarter. Further, comparisons of matches and non-matches did not show any significant differences in the effectiveness of the student teacher or of his satisfaction with the teaching experience. (MM)",

Two hundred ninety-five eigth grade students were assigned to groups of three to four to act as students in a teaching setting. Both students and teachers were given a communication to read as the basis for a twenty-minute lesson. After the lesson, teachers were tested on their ability to identify analytic questions, and students were tested on lesson content, identification of analytic components, and one week later their ability to analyze a different communication. A  one-way analysis of variance was used to test the effects of the treatments on the acquisition of analytic questioning skill by the teacher trainees and also on the analytic responses of the students. Performance of subjects in the treatment groups significantly exceeded those in the control group on: (1) the teacher and student identification of analytic questions; (2) teacher frequency, quality and variety of analytic questions; and (3) student frequency and variety of analytic responses. Multiple linear regression analysis showed a significant relationship between frequency, variety and quality of teacher analytic questioning behavior, the frequency and variety of student analytic responses and also student performance on the written identification of analytic questions. The best  combinations of teacher behavior for predicting student performance varied for different student learning outcomes. (Author/MB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to determine how recent elementary education graduates and their principals perceive, in terms of competencies, preparation for teaching. A poll was taken of a group of teachers in their first year of teaching in elementary schools. Their principals were asked to respond to a similar poll. The study was designed to provide answers to the following questions: (1) How do recent graduates of an elementary education program perceive their undergraduate preparation for teaching? (2) How do elementary school principals perceive the undergraduate preparation of their teachers? (3) Do principals and teachers perceive undergraduate preparation for teaching in the same manner? The results seem to indicate that principals and teachers view the preparation for  teaching in a different manner. Principals do not perceive the various components of preparing teachers, but rather view teacher education in its totality. Teachers view their preparation as being composed of several major elements and view their teaching programs as being somewhat more effective in preparing them to teach than did the principals. While both teachers and principals gave approval to undergraduate preparation, there were indications that program improvement is needed. (JD)",

The research was aimed at answering the following questions: (1) What full-time occupations have been pursued by the graduates of one, five, and ten years ago? (2) What factors influenced acceptance of employment in nonacademic fields? (3) What skills and competencies obtained in the teacher education program were used to secure and function in employment in nonacademic fields? (4) What skills and competencies needed in their current occupation and related to the teacher education graduate program do graduates wish they had? and (5) What experiences in the teacher education program have been useful in preparing graduates for their personal and civic lives?  Two instruments were developed to address these questions: a career profile card and a 69-item, follow-up questionnaire. (Both are appended.) Results show that: (1) the majority of the Iowa teacher education graduates currently reside in the state of Iowa or contiguous states; (2) teacher education as an undergraduate major is still a common choice for women; (3) over three-fourths of all the teacher education graduates studied are teaching or have taught full-time; (4) teacher education graduates are interested first in obtaining a teaching position, with nonacademic employment as a second choice; (5) sex role differences are evident in the reasons why teacher education graduates accept nonacademic employment; (6) the employment ambitions of teacher education graduates working in  nonacademic occupations are relatively stable; and (7) teacher education graduates find the special abilities and aptitudes developed in their subject matter majors to be of prime importance in qualifiying for nonacademic professions.

Quantification is presented as a language consisting of sentences (graphs and tables), words, (classificatory instruments), and grammar (rules for constructing and interpreting tables). More detailed examination of each of these &quot;language&quot; units is undertaken to explain other components of quantification systems and, using this basic vocabulary, sources of quantification and the combining of elements into charts and graphs are examined. The section concludes with a series of exercises in reading and constructinq percentage tables. Section three of part two discusses the concept of reason analysis, a  method for discovering and evaluating the causes of individual's dispositions and behavior in situations where findings from typical cross-sectional analyses are rendered insignificant by the gross difference between the number of actors and non-actors. Such situations would include consumer behavior, migration, occupational choice, marriage and divorce, voting, delinquency, and others.

Variables are taken into consideration, such as education level, employment, sex, religion, and qroup orientation. Reasons for changing opinions and for trends in thinking are analysed not only on the basis of the above variables but also in the light of the impact of recent events, economic changes, and exposure to different or new situations and ideas.

The first--Notes on the History of Interdisciplinarity--by Judy Rosen, brings together and outlines the general points and findings of the literature that has been generated in an attempt to evaluate the importance, success, and drawbacks of conducting research outside the limits of the traditional academic disciplines. It also places the notion of interdisciplinarity and the way in which it is now being discussed in historical perspective. The first two sections of this three-part essay discuss the central viewpoint and doctrine of the moral philosophers and the philosophy and history of the movement away from a unified social science  and toward the isolated academic discipline. The third section discusses and assesses the current debate about how and why the social sciences should or should not attempt a reunification. The second essay-- Alternative Approaches to Policy Making--by Merlyn Kettering, is an introduction to the study of policy-making. The framework developed in the essay dramatizes basic themes in policy-making by creating a controversy between rationalistic and incrementalistic approaches to policy-making. The third essay--Humanistic Evaluation-- was prepared as an internal memorandum for use by the committee on evaluation described in the body of the final report. It is intended as a foundation from which to generate a working image of humanistic evaluation. (MM)",

It was expected that the students had gained experiences and acquired competencies within their individual disciplines. The subject of education research was chosen as being broad enough in scope to encompass other disciplines and to aid the students in their explorations in their own fields. In the group participating in the program the following disciplines were represented: information sciences, clinical psychology, economics, social psychology, pediatric psychology, counselor education,  educational anthropology, sociology, educational psychology, and educational research. Under the guidance of experienced leaders, seminars were conducted; guest speakers contributed on different subjects; and there was frequent informal interchange between participants. Many students found that they gained an understanding of the strengths and limitations of their own discipline as well as those of other disciplines. At a future date the data collected from this program will be analysed, evaluated, and published. The methodology involved will be included for guidance of those who may wish to conduct a similar program. (JD)",

However, quality assessment data cannot be obtained in the majority of school districts nationally without federal or state budgetary allocations for Local Education Agencies (LEA) to conduct systematic needs assessments. State guidelines presently preclude funding of these locally determined priority needs in the affective or secondary areas with ESEA Title I money. There is an obvious credibility gap here. On one hand, there is the demand for needs assessment. On the other hand, there is the powerful external influence on local perceptions of needs resulting from requirements for programs under  categorical federal and state funding. Because of legislation, special funding, and other external pressures, schools may find it difficult to take a new look at their goals and their programs. Since it is obvious that federal and state agencies will continue to demand needs assessments, these agencies must also be realistic enough to provide the necessary assistance to insure that locally determined priority needs will be met. Changes in the ESEA Title I statute, guidelines, and funding must be made in order to achieve these ends. (Author/MV)",

The principal section reviews available types of instrumentation for measuring attitudes toward reading.

The findings of over 35 separate studies concerning  approximately 15 different instruments are included. In the concluding section, the authors recommend a multi-measure approach based on Rowell's (1972) observer-report instrument, and Estes' (1971) verbal report instrument.

Three procedures are briefly outlined for encouraging involvement by these audiences in the assessment: greater local participation in determining common assessment content; include reporting variables over which these people have more or less direct control (e.g., methods and materials, district reporting); and, adopt an hourglass approach to dissemination. These suggestions are offered for  consideration with the knowledge that in some states comparable procedures are being followed with some success, and with the belief that in other states, they could be achieved within the general framework of the current programs.

First used by Conrad in l948, deltas are routine statistics computed in all analyses at Educational Testing Service. Using this approach one would conclude no test bias if differences in resulting deltas are constant from item to item for the groups. Under a null hypothesis of no test bias, the sample delta differences should be distributed normally with some unknown mean and unknown variance. If evidence can be gathered to the contrary, the null hypothesis can be rejected and bias concluded. To test the hypothesis of normality, one plots the differences in item deltas on normal probability paper. First, one orders the delta differences.  Second, one pairs each difference with the value S/(m+1) where S is the rank of the delta difference and m the number of items. The purpose of S/(m+1) is to anchor the median difference to the 50th percentile. If the differences follow a normal distribution, the plotted points will be on a straight line. A statistical test has been developed by Lilliefors (1967) using the sample mean and variance as a basis for the straightness of the resulting line. That technique was adapted for use with probability paper and formed the crux of the technique. (Author/MV)",

The study was conducted in seven Follow Through sites and three Pittsburgh area schools. Standardized tests were used as input and outcome measures; questionnaires and videotapes were used to gather information about the classroom processes. The results indicate that over the three-year period the implementation of the program continued to move toward ideal goals. Extensive data reduction procedures were used and the rationale of usage discussed. Results also point to input as the primary explanation of student end-of-year performance, though classroom processes contribute a small but consistent  amount. The data indicate greater ease in identifying negative factors in successful classroom processes than in determining the positive factors. (Author/MV)",

        "description":"A number of different ways of ascertaining whether or not a test measures the same thing in different cultures are examined. Methods range from some that are obvious and simple to those requiring statistical and psychological sophistication. Simpler methods include such things as having candidates \"think aloud\" and interviewing them about how they solved the problem, and techniques such as using pantomime or moving pictures to give instructions. Another approach is to make the tests different in such a way that they measure the same construct--so that they are functionally equivalent. The variety of approaches that require statistical methods include analysis of covariance, comparing test performances at the level of the test items (e.g., comparing item difficulties), item  characteristic curve theory, factor analysis, and a construct validity approach. An understanding of the psychological processes involved in performing the tasks involved in taking a test item, or performing an experimental task in a laboratory, is prerequisite to making judgments as to whether a test is measuring the same thing in two cultures. The methods described provide ways to improve the understanding of such processes. (RC)",

        "description":"The Follow Through Expansion Program involved 46 schools in all eight districts of Philadelphia, Pa. The program was instituted at the kindergarten level in March, 1975. Five model options were proposed for implementation on the basis of previous evaluation findings regarding the original Follow Through Program in Philadelphia. Of these, four were selected by the participating schools: Option 1: a local adaption of the Behavior Analysis model, Option 2: a Behavior Analysis/ Bank Street combination, Option 3: a Behavior Analysis/Bilingual combination not selected by the participating schools, Option 4: a local adaption of the Bank Street model, and Option 5: a Bank Street/ Bilingual combination. Pre-program questionnaires were completed by principals, resource teachers, teachers,  and aides, and yielded background information on program personnel as well as pre-program attitudes. The majority of principals indicated that they were satisfied with the model assigned to them and that they expected Follow Through to have a strong effect on pupil achievement, parent participation, staff development and the motivation of instructional personnel. Sixty-seven percent of the teachers also evidenced positive reactions to the news of the expansion program. Option 4 teachers elicited the highest percentage of positive responses and Option 2 the lowest. Aides indicated increased clarity after training but somewhat lower enthusiasm, possibly due to previous training which emphasized a different instructional orientation at the kindergarten level.

        "description":"College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Tests were normed on a national basis, administering the test to nationwide samples of subjects. Norms appear in the booklet, CLEP Scores: Interpretation and Use, and consist of the test score means for groups of students receiving grades of A, B, C, D, and F in the relevant course, the proportion of students receiving each grade, the sample size, and the correlation coefficient between test scores and earned course grades. The validity of the tests for the purpose of selecting creditable students from the population of test takers is assessed through an examination of the systematic differences in test means across earned grades, and the correlation coefficient between earned grades and test scores. This paper supports the assertion that  the correlation coefficient is a misleading statistic for the purpose of validity assessment in this context. A decision theoretic procedure is developed which focuses on the likelihood of errors in test based decisions. The decision theoretic means of validity assessment was applied to the data of all CLEP tests discussed in the norming literature. The analysis showed a dramatically incoherent value system displayed among the tests, with wildly fluctuating error likelihoods and ratios. Further, the likelihood of each error type was found to be substantially greater than would be supposed based on an examination of the correlation coefficients between earned grades and test scores.(Author/MV)",

Due to budgetary and time constraints, it was decided to focus upon two crucial areas, the cognitive and affective impact of Project Concern on program participants. A basic decision was made to evaluate student cognitive growth using a standardized commercially available reading test.

The survey revealed that the majority of parents (66%) preferred the old forms on stiff paper in which progress in each subject area was reported in the traditional A-B-C-D-F manner, in which separate grades for English, spelling, and handwriting were given, and in which citizenship was reported on a check list of behavior. Only 23% of the parents who replied favored the new form. In only one respect was there widespread approval (86%) of the new form; that was  in the space provided for teacher comments. The survey also revealed that parents like to be consulted about the form in which their children's progress is reported. This was revealed both directly in the questionnaire when 74% of the parents indicated that both parents and teachers should decide on the type of report card used, and indirectly by the high percentage (85%) of replies from parents.

In Section II, the occurrence of remedial mathematics programs in the various types of institutions and some general characteristics of these programs (such as annual enrollment in both remedial and regular programs, the amount of college credit given, textbooks used, and the use of audio-visual aids and of tutors) are discussed. Section III presents a classification of remedial mathematics programs based on two aspects of instruction: the method used to present material to the students and the means of pacing the presentation. In Section IV, evaluations of the effectiveness of  individual programs are given, based on each respondent's judgment of that program's success along with the percentage of students successfully completing that program. Section V discusses both the process and the results of change in remedial mathematics programs. Finally, appendices contain lists of mathematics departments identified as having certain types of non-traditional instruction in their remedial mathematics programs. (DT)",

        "description":"Methods and resource materials are suggested for teaching elementary level students about the concept of interdependence in terms of the Bicentennial. The rationale lies with a belief in human interrelatedness and the universality of human rights for which the signers of the Declaration of Independence struggled. Students are encouraged to explore American history and find events and individuals that worked to unite Americans and foster peace among ethnic groups, races, religions, and the government and American Indians. For example, Benjamin Franklin is cited as a significant contributor to cooperation between the colonies. To celebrate the festival of the Bicentennial, activities are suggested which involve students in making collections of poetry and essays about their  reactions to life today and in making colonial costumes. Awareness of new horizons can be deepened by discussing basic human needs, writing poetry relating the past to the future, and studying critical global issues such as energy, population, and mass transportation. A bibliography of 14 books and journals provides resource materials for all activities described in the kit. (AV)",

Three objectives are to (1) provide a compilation of the literature on national educational change efforts; (2) stimulate nonbiased inquiry into causes, processes, and outcomes of educational reform; and (3) supplement the bibliographic work accompanying each national study in the World Bank Educational Reform and Economic Development Project. The annotations are presented in two parts. The first part cites theoretical, methodological, and general works relating to evaluation of educational reform efforts. The second part cites case studies that assess educational reform efforts in 57 developing countries and 26 developed  countries. The annotations contain data extracted from the studies. These consist mainly of direct quotes chosen for their relevance to questions of appropriate rationales for educational reform, ideal scope and process of reform, and ideal major outcomes. To illustrate value bias in the literature, the study identifies six ideological views and lists the studies in the casebook which represent the bias of each orientation. The six categories are evolutionary and neo-evolutionary; structural-functional; system analysis; Marxist and neo-Marxist; the cultural and social movement; and anarchistic and utopian perspectives. An author index and a subject index are included. (Author/DB)",

A reading is adapted from the autobiography of a Guinean youth who participated in the initiation experience with other boys in his village at the age of 12 years. A lesson plan, arranged in a question-answer format, directs the students to investigate the psychological impact of the initiation ceremony, the attitude of missionaries and colonial authorities in Africa toward such ceremonies, the essential elements common to all initiation rites, and the existence of similar initiation ceremonies in Western society. Detailed answers to all questions are provided. Students also discuss recognition of the signal  of when a man or woman attains adulthood. For example, initiation from childhood to adulthood is accomplished in some cultures by reaching a certain age, participating in a religious ceremony, graduating from high school, moving away from home, and supporting oneself financially. Three enrichment activities dealing with American and African adolescence and African initiation ceremonies are suggested. Five books on African children, religions, and philosophies are listed.

        "description":"The need to involve the whole American society in education is stressed in this monograph. Education in the United States has a history of constantly attempting to accommodate the circumstances and demands of the New World. Although American education owes much to the Old World systems in areas of curriculum and stages of education, it exhibited early and decisive differences. The American system performed many services which were performed in other countries by the church, state, guilds, and families. The American secondary school trained boys for work, college, and &quot;life,&quot; rather than strictly for university study. Often located in small towns, American colleges were small and simple, adopted open admission policies, and taught subjects which elsewhere were studied in secondary  school. In the United States, all levels of education have taught conformity to the will of the democratic majority--a majority which was until quite recently a white, middle-class majority. Educational reformers, particularly during 1890-1910, suggested philosophies which schools should follow and specified functions which schools should fulfill. Results were that schools were required to do far more than they could do and they were deflected from those things they had done well in the past. Now, there is a need to bring American schools and the entire educational enterprise into harmony with the profound changes occurring in American life. (Author/DB)",

The intent of the article is to prompt readers to remember their personal schooling experiences and relate them to the larger framework of national memories. The essay, focusing on schools at the turn of the 20th century, discusses urban-rural educational differences, field trips, social mobility, classroom activities, assemblies, hot lunch programs, and the relationship of schools to the American dream. The bulk of the album consists of 35 photographs culled from the collections of the Library of Congress and the Farm Security Administration. The photographs span the period 1890-1943 and picture life in numerous types of schools--modern city schools, rural one-room  schools, night schools for working boys, cooking schools for Negro girls, and an Indian school. Teachers and students are shown performing many types of classroom activities, conducting field trips, planting gardens, studying music, playing basketball, waiting for the school bus, eating hot lunches, and pledging allegiance to the flag.

        "description":"The potential use of anthropology for restructuring both the general curriculum and social studies is discussed. Anthropology could work as an organizer because it is a broad based discipline and relates to the natural sciences, fine arts, language arts, and humanities, as well as to the social sciences. By the beginning of the 21st century, major changes can be expected in public school curricula. Curricular organization will most likely be based on integrated models. As an organization model for the social studies, anthropology could integrate the social sciences into a balanced and cohesive, well-integrated curriculum. Due to its multifaceted perspective, anthropology can aid students in resolving issues by training them to better understand technology, the processes and  functions of society, social alienation, social conflict, value systems, processes of change, and knowledge of a variety of cultural patterns. Because the 21st century will undoubtedly emerge as a century of global relationships, this broadening influence on students is extremely important. Anthropologists will probably base curriculum organization on integrated models in which related disciplines play a significant part. Two charts illustrating the structure, concepts, and disciplines in an anthropology-centered curriculum are included. (Author/DB)",

Ninety-one volunteer pilot group teachers and their K-6 classes, representing a socioeconomically varied school district in Seattle, Washington, participated in the study. The teachers attended an introductory workshop. They were encouraged to examine and use nonstereotyped materials such as books and films, occupational simulation packets, and speakers, and participate in additional workshops. At the outset, the 91 teachers and 16 comparison teachers with no special background were given a Teacher Tendency to Stereotype Questionnaire in order to determine the effect of project participation on  attitudes and the relationship between teacher attitudes and amount of pupil attitude change. Pupil attitudes were measured pre- and posttreatment by paper and pencil tests asking about participation by sexes in various activities and occupations. Residualized gain scores were used in calculating average gain by classroom. These show that (1) pilot group and comparison group teachers were not significantly different in stereotypic attitudes; (2) teacher classroom behavior correlated positively with pupil attitude change for grades K-2, but not significantly for grades 3-6; and (3) pilot group girls in grades K-2 showed less positive attitude change than boys, but girls in grades 3-6 showed more positive attitude change than boys.

        "description":"Portrayal of racial minorities in textbooks is discussed and the practice of textbook publishers in their treatment of the roles of minorities during the 1960s to the present is traced. America transmits the dominant ideals and values of its culture to students through textbooks. Until the 1960s, racial minorities were generally ignored by writers and publishers of textbooks. Consequently, millions of American youth passed through schools without having read much about African Americans, American Indians, or Puerto Ricans. The social revolution during the 1960s encouraged publishers to venture into publishing textbooks that portrayed minorities fairly, but special editions of standard textbooks tailored to meet regional biases were still being produced. A 1975 study by the  American Jewish Committee focused a year-long analysis on African Americans, Mexican Americans, and native Americans and concluded that racism can still be found in social studies textbooks. Trade book publishers have been quick to realize the huge profits in minority themes and have often published or reprinted books of questionable quality. Minority publishing is improving, however, partly through the encouragement of groups such as the Council on Interracial Books for Children. Educators, textbook writers, publishers, parents, and other interested persons must not become complacent given moderate gains. They must encourage minority writers and publishing houses to select quality minority educational materials. (Author/DB)",

The dimension of affective learning is of increasing concern to history and social studies teachers. A wide range of experts, including game designers, classroom teachers, and simulation salespersons, maintain that simulation games can influence and alter the attitudes of the participants. Research findings on the significance of simulation games for affective learning vary significantly, largely due to methodological difficulties of simulations in general and to the extreme diversity of learning games. The majority of research findings indicate that simulation games have proven successful in generating positive attitudes about the particular issue a game treats, improving  participants' attitudes toward learning and the school system in general, and influencing student attitudes about their own effectiveness in their environment. Some research findings, however, indicate that neither cognitive nor affective achievement are influenced by participation in a simulation game. Educators and researchers should realize that simulations are not an educational panacea but, rather, that there are many situations and instructional areas in which social studies simulations are effective.

Intended as a program of faculty renewal which would affect the real lives and interests of faculty members, the program is based on the contributions of one education faculty member who joined and interacted intensely with a university political science faculty for two years. The first section of the report was written by an administrator. It discusses the nature of the subject matter taught in political science, its effect on faculty needs and interests, the structural realities of the classroom in the mid-1970s, student perceptions of faculty, reward systems within the university, and the dilemma facing administrators as they allocate funds. The second section, written from the  educator's point of view, describes the experiment. It discusses the attempt to gain legitimacy for the political science faculty; methods of dealing with student performance, teaching problems, and course structure; troubleshooting models; teaching improvement minicourses; evaluation of programs; and establishment of a clearinghouse to promote collegial support. Preliminary evaluation indicates that faculty members involved in the program have begun to diagnose problem areas, develop new teaching skills, and have experienced a resurgence of interest in teaching.

        "description":"This position paper discusses the general absence of law instruction at the elementary level and presents reasons for including it in the elementary curriculum. Two factors which hamper attempts to provide law instruction are limited economic resources and a general lack of understanding that law-related education could develop democratic participation skills in students. Most elementary students presently study in depersonalized settings where they are expected to develop high-level cognitive skills in many subjects. They are trained to be self-centered rather than socially aware and are not encouraged to develop self-discipline, independence, or responsibility, as are elementary school students in China. Educators should involve students in caring about the quality of life and  human interaction and awaken them to valuing democratic ideals at an early age. Efforts toward development of citizenship education programs must begin with clear statements of what we want to achieve in schools and the types of communal responsibility we intend to foster. Law-related education provides us with the broad concepts of democracy which are the building blocks for these efforts, and it should, consequently, be included in the elementary school curriculum.

An overview identifies seven key ideas of environmental issues, including the universal participation of all humans in the environment and the mistaken concept of \"growth equals progress.\" The main body of the booklet contains eight chapters which discuss identifying the problem, setting goals, justifying the goals, identifying community and public resources, building an effective group, identifying community forces, designing an action strategy, and carrying out the project. These chapters include sociological analyses of kinds of power inherent in  decision-making situations and processes of attitudes and social change. They help citizens appreciate the social forces and ramifications related to eco-action. Several resources are provided: names and addresses of 26 eco-organizations throughout the country; a bibliography of 11 references for action-oriented eco-skills; and a total of 153 sample projects for environmental education and awareness, community environmental service, and public affairs.

The main objective of the project is to demonstrate that the study of religion is a necessity in the social education and personal development of children. Intended as an aid for teaching a student about his own religion and other religions, the project materials stress developing a positive self-concept and an attitude of empathy toward others. The report describes curriculum materials for grades 1-6, teacher guides, and four teacher self-instructional kits. The lessons are sequenced within units and the units are graded in complexity to foster concept development. Each level centers upon one religious theme and specifies three or four key  concepts. The six major emphases are cross-cultural family studies, cross-cultural community studies, ethnic studies in an urban setting, religion and nature, religion in North America, and world religions. Each grade level set of three modules presents from four to six sequential learning encounters for students, a teacher's guide, and packets of multimedia learning materials. The project report includes information on summer programs for teachers, future needs, project financing, dissemination activities, and results from project pilot testing. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Economic literacy and economic efficacy are addressed by examining basic goals and assumptions of economic education and by suggesting areas that need systematic attention and investigation. To clarify goals, an operational definition of economic literacy must be developed and used in a criterion-referenced testing instrument. A definition of economic literacy should include a distinction between literate and illiterate persons, distinguishing behavior, minimum amount of knowledge, specific analytical skills, and appropriate values and attitudes. Some testable student competencies could include distinguishing economic issues from other issues, identifying the economic system, articulating basic economic concepts, and evaluating economic actions and policies and recognizing their  trade-offs. However, little study has been done on the cultural process by which people gain their economic knowledge and attitudes. Utilizing political science concepts and research, it is determined that efficacy influences knowledge and attitudes. Economic efficacy is a person's belief about his level of control over the economy. It is possible that (1) a low sense of economic efficacy correlates positively with disinterest in learning economics and (2) a high degree of economic literacy does not correlate positively with a high sense of economic efficacy. Examples of tests for economic efficacy are discussed. If researchers find that economic education programs do affect feelings of economic efficacy, then they must determine on what those feelings are based. For instance, efficacy  could derive from naive trust, group identity, or individual competence. (ND)",

        "description":"The American educational system increasingly shapes individuals to fit a production-consumption system. Most educators believe that education should provide career training and the basis for economic advancement, rather than reflect on past events. The questions--who we are, why we are here, and where we are going--are seldom discussed in public education today. Continued technological development has resulted in global concerns, including accelerating industrialization, rapid population growth, widespread malnutrition, depletion of nonrenewable natural resources, and deteriorating environment. These concerns have created a new kind of awareness that technology and its impact are irreversible. Increasingly, there is the realization that if present trends continue,  self-destruction from overpopulation and high energy consumption is assured. The implication is that increased liberal arts knowledge will directly enhance a society's capacity to make choices, decide goals, and produce desired changes. This acceptance of a new liberal arts perspective, in turn, would increase the potential of education as a creator of intelligent, capable beings. (Author/DB)",

The program proposal was approved in 1974 and a full complement of graduate students were accepted into the program by summer 1975. The overall objective of the program is the improvement of history instruction and curriculum at the secondary and collegiate levels. It emphasizes growth in knowledge and skills related to both the content and teaching of history. The program is designed primarily to provide advanced training for experienced teachers who have the potential to become curriculum leaders or master teachers in their institutions, such as teachers in community colleges, four-year colleges, and comprehensive high schools. The program includes  educational, historical, cognate, and dissertation components. Students are required to take 16 semester hours in history, 16 hours in a cognate concentration, 14 hours in education, and 14 hours for the dissertation. The dissertation can emphasize (1) curriculum development and field study or (2) historical topics and their instructional application. Special program features include cooperation with the Department of Curriculum and Instruction of the College of Education, individualization for student needs and goals, student participation on the doctoral committee, and joint initiation with other D.A. programs at the university. Short backgrounds of the 16 students currently enrolled in the program conclude the document. (ND)",

Protocol materials are defined as original records of an event or a behavior which can be observed and analyzed by inservice and preservice teacher education students. The approach, beginning with the presentation of an editorial taken from the personal history of the methods course teacher, is used as a data source to introduce skills from a U.S.O.E.-funded learning module concerned with paragraph analysis. The students read and analyze the selection, focusing on when and where the document was written. After the students have recorded their initial hypotheses, they are asked to interpret the document in more detail. Capstone questions dealing with the  historiographical process and with the role of the teacher in the inquiry conclude the exercise. The bulk of the paper consists of the following supplements: the editorial, a tape discussion of student-teacher comments regarding the editorial, a sample student analysis and evaluation of the editorial, and a description of four federally funded behavior modification protocols for use in elementary social studies.

Referring to the work of Milton Gordon, the author discusses two theories of social integration. The first theory of assimilation is defined as a process of social and psychological adherence to a core society. The second theory of pluralism is defined as a compounding of different activities and values to make up a group spirit. The enculturation of people in San Francisco is discussed in terms of four composite psychological characteristics--concern, tolerance, internationalism, and pluralism. These characteristics are related to the social process factors of immigration, minority assimilation, ethnic communality, and economic predominance. Vietnamese  immigrants are an example of a group which is assimilated linguistically, racially, and sociopolitically into Asian- and French-speaking groups in San Francisco. Reasons given for this assimilation include the desirability of joining a thriving and self-sustaining cultural group, the wish to share linguistic and cultural preferences, and common values. The differences between identification assimilation and enculturation are described. The need for further research into the coexistence of cultures in pluralistic settings is noted.

The intent of the author is to call attention to a situation that has created considerable internal controversy at American universities. The attempts of Committee members to cancel a UNESCO conference at Michigan State University in 1976 are documented, and letters circulated by the Committee concerning this and other university conferences are discussed. The ethical issues dealt with  relate to those which surround the UNESCO conference, policy statements issued by the National Council for the Social Studies on academic freedom and open inquiry, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the responsibility of the university to remain a marketplace for the free exchange of ideas.

It is recommended that elementary children do projects related to home and neighborhood, such as telling stories of family history connected with moving into the neighborhood,  making scrapbooks of photos of the neighborhood, and visiting museums and public libraries to research simple themes. Secondary level students could study broader community issues such as poverty, pollution, and unusual local events. They could use community resources, such as local newspapers.

Chapter 1 lists and discusses books dealing with the nature of history and its role in education. A discussion of ten ways to structure world history courses follows: (1) the hand of providence, (2) what goes up must come down, (3) good tidings, (4) the golden thread, (5) the ages of man, (6) compare and contrast, (7) interaction, (8) great men, (9) great forces, and (10) the idea of mankind. Included are annotations of works using these approaches plus some books and journals that deal generally with  teaching history. Chapter 2 lists and describes reference works, books on research and writing, multivolumed historical series, and journals. Remaining chapters survey the broad field of world history and list works that focus on the Ancient West, East and South Asia, Middle East, Africa, Australia, Latin America, and Europe. A separate chapter discusses history books that deal with the world since 1945. The final chapter provides a checklist of 75 basic books in world history, both scholarly and popular, with an index to their respective annotations.

Teachers sharpened their own skills in economics by studying in a university setting. Specific sections of the evaluation report assess learning objectives, instructional procedures, instructional and community settings, and the standard and basis for judging quality. A review  of benefits, costs, and side effects of the program includes a report on how federal money was supplemented by contributions from universities, school districts, and state and private foundations. The program had widespread impact in Illinois. Articles published for professional audiences may promote national impact as well. Two areas for further research were identified: sex-related learning differentials in economics and measurement of affective learning in economic education. Appendices include the table of contents of a course text, a sample lesson planning packet, and regression results for cognitive evaluation. (AV)",

In six chapters, the author reviews relevant developmental psychology literature and explores the major sociological dimensions of values education. &quot;The Development of Values as an Educational Objective&quot; summarizes various theories about the goals of values education. It is recognized that responsible individuals must act within a values framework, but there are problems in prescribing any one system of values in a pluralistic society. &quot;Towards a Conceptual Framework for Values Education&quot; reviews theoretical justifications from three viewpoints: the organismic-structural-developmental view (Stewart, Piaget, Kohlberg), the philosophical-social-psychological view  (Lawson, Phenix), and the scientific view (Eckhardt, Rokeach, Maslow). &quot;Four Models of Values Education&quot; describes values clarification, Kohlberg's moral development theory, Allen's environmental-moral reasoning, and the Coombs-Meux moral reasoning model. Curriculum, teaching methods, and reexamination of society's values are discussed in &quot;Institutional Contexts of Values Education&quot; and &quot;Values Education and the Emergence of New Paradigms.&quot; A case study of an interdisciplinary undergraduate humanities course is analyzed in &quot;From Theory to Practice.&quot; (AV)",

        "description":"This document discusses classroom discipline and the teacher's role in promoting student understanding of the democratic process and respect for structure in social groups. Definitions of discipline include punishment, school regulations, and classroom rules enforced by the teacher as a reasonable authority. In explaining the need for rules and limits in the classroom, the author points out that laws preserve some measure of freedom for everyone while, at the same time, limiting certain behaviors. In guiding the structuring of rules and social controls in the classroom, the teacher must be responsive to students' developmental capabilities. This is especially important in elementary grades when children begin to perceive themselves as significant members of a group. Teachers must  apply authority effectively in establishing discipline and should manage conflict resolution in ways that become learning experiences in order to strengthen collective social responsibility. Nine steps are presented to help teachers establish order and build student self-discipline. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"Research is reviewed that concerns citizenship education for primary grade children, and strategies are discussed that deal with political socialization in early childhood years. The most current methods for teaching citizenship emphasize complacency and compliance to school rules, not the understanding of democratic processes and citizen responsibility. Administrators may perceive compliance as practical and necessary, but it fosters naive political inactivity when students grow older. Basing his conclusions on the work of Piaget, the author calls for mutual respect, reciprocity, and obligation between teachers and students. Such an exchange leads toward the democratic process of social interchange. Interviews with primary grade children indicate that children are attuned to  political aspects of their milieu and that they can accept rules as reasoned actions which support a degree of freedom for all group members. Law in a Free Society, a California-based project, is described. It is an elementary and secondary level program with exemplary curriculum, teacher training, and evaluation components. (AV)",

The conference focused on working women as a new student group. Conference participants from higher education, labor unions, and industry exchanged ideas. Topics discussed include outreach on the part of educational institutions to working women, characteristics of women students, and problems peculiar to working women when they become students. A student panel presented four case studies of women who returned to school to highlight problems and rewards which other women might encounter. The keynote speech addressed the university's interest in the working woman as a student. It was followed by a discussion of five model programs which have been successful in  educating blue-collar workers in New York and Detroit. Suggestions for designing a network to attract women students and create a clearinghouse on educational programs for women workers were presented. Five guidelines for creating educationally innovative programs were suggested at the conclusion of the conference: (1) prepare for a long struggle; (2) plan the campaign; (3) make it a team operation; (4) be flexible; and (5) seek insights.

Three issues related to this problem are identified: what educators should do about the loss of our literary heritage, what values operate in our technological society, and whether faith in man's unconquerable spirit is an adequate source of hope. Answers, or &quot;a little good news,&quot; are sought in three 19th-century poems which present solutions to despair and pessimism. The author concludes that technology provides a means of transmitting traditional values, but in formats other than traditional literary style. He finds characteristics of wisdom and rationality in the Graeco-Roman humanist tradition and sees them as being more useful today than  private selfish provision. The spirit of Don Quixote's quest illustrates that faith in man's spirit can triumph over despair. (AV)",

The hypothesis is that if technology has no priority, then it has no purpose. Talcott Parsons' concepts of functional imperatives and pattern variables are discussed to illustrate the relationship of technology to society. From Parsons' framework, it is determined that the United States is an adaptive society with nondirected technology and that technology is not functioning correctly in the United States. Its dysfunction is exhibited in the current incompatibility of energy conservation and technological exploitation. A new look at national purpose is needed for guiding U.S. technology at correct  intensity levels. Technology should be made a societal concern and this concern should be internalized in individuals. Thus, the United States must change to another type of society which will rank technology so that it functions within the society. If this interpretation is true, then (1) the United States inevitably will change from an adaptive society to a goal-attainment society concerned with means-manipulation, and (2) there will be greater tolerance of deviance and accelerated recognition of the &quot;common good.&quot; (ND)",

Discussion of the cases can be integrated into economics or social studies programs. By studying concrete examples of business reacting to changing economic conditions, students should learn to understand microeconomic relationships such as business organization, competitive mechanisms, and economic motivation. All but one of the studies describe real situations which have developed during the 1960s and 1970s in the Northeast. All historical and current facts are provided, and students must analyze the data and make business decisions. For example, the development of a national restaurant chain is explained in terms of demographic  studies, reasons for past successes and failures, and financial requirements of opening new sites. Three possible new sites are described. Students must consider factors such as location, rent, building redesign, and availability of liquor licenses in selecting the most appropriate site. Other cases involve the future of the shoe industry, viability of an investment company, and relocation of a rubber and golf products company. (AV)",

In general, it was agreed that the two nations are getting along very well despite their cultural differences. The first session dealt with the U.S. role in Asia. The consensus was that Japan has taken the U.S. pullout from Southeast Asia in stride and is exerting its own influence as best possible diplomatically and economically. The U.S. commitment to South Korea is a touchy area for both countries, and Japan urged the United States to recognize North Korea so it can be brought into the world community. Fear of both Koreas was expressed. A consensus exists for the current American-Japanese  security treaty. Speakers warned about underrating trouble spots such as China and Russia, Europe, money exchange, access to resource materials, and direct investment policies. A light discussion ensued of cultural and sociological contrasts, followed by a probe into the victor-vanquished relationship after World War II. The final session concerned media coverage of one country by the other and the relationship between the newsmen in crisis times and under ordinary conditions. (ND)",

Teachers of multiethnic education should try to counter prejudices and stereotypes which children learn involuntarily from the media, adults, and society. Merely focusing on ethnic holidays and minority group heroes does not provide students with a conceptual interdisciplinary perspective on particular ethnic groups. Multiethnic education should reach beyond classroom curricula to include ethnic diversity in school staff, attitudes, teaching strategies and materials, testing and  counseling, and school norms.

Research and theories about each stage are presented separately, followed by a discussion of how the two occur within the family structure. This discussion may be useful to teachers, counselors, employers, or researchers working with individuals who are particularly affected by the impact of this cross-stage interaction. Among the unique and stressful characteristics of adolescence are ego identity, peer-group relations, emotional growth, establishment of independence, and career formation. Middle age is frequently characterized by awareness of aging and proximity of death, waning health and vitality, achievement of career plateau, waning parenthood, and  resultant change in marriage situations. When adolescents undergo ego identity and role confusion at the same time that their parents experience pressures of generativity versus ego stagnation, tension and potential conflict are likely. Parents may not have the physical or psychic energy to guide their adolescent children, and alienation may result. Greater freedom for the younger generation may promote inferiority feelings in parents. Research is needed to explore family therapy, education about problems of aging, and effect of environment or individual characteristics on the varying severity of transitional stages experienced by different people.

The seminar was developed in response to increasing popularity of behavior modification and an interest in exploring applications of a science of behavior. The didactic aspect of the course was complemented by an applied emphasis in which each student selected a relatively benign behavior, devised a self-modification procedure, quantitatively evaluated his progress, and submitted a scientific report in the American Psychological Association (APA) publication format. Target behaviors ranged from smoking to assertive behavior and negative comments about others. Short-term gains were reported in most of the programs. Other benefits to students may have  included involving oneself in the application of psychology, developing a more scientific approach to solving everyday problems in living, and fostering a less negative attitude toward the control of behavior.

A forced-choice test requiring students to rank order five basic subjects was administered to 75 pupils in randomly selected third-grade classes. Students represented the socioeconomic structure of an agricultural community in central California during 1971-72. Fifth-grade classes in the same schools were tested two years later. Extensive statistical analysis of results was performed, with the following conclusions: (1) children tend to value a subject equally well from primary to intermediate grades, with the exception of language; (2) children do not highly value social studies in relation to other subject matter; (3) social studies  is better liked in grade 5 than in grade 3, but the difference seems insignificant; (4) when social studies is compared statistically with other subjects over a two-year period, children tend not to change their subject matter preferences; and (5) differences in subject matter preference appear to be more economically biased, with the disadvantaged student preferring social studies. Issues arising from the study include extent to which curriculum developers account for preference changes in preparation of material and whether preference changes result by chance, in response to new social studies programs, or as an outcome of teacher enthusiasm.

The project's goal was to develop an educational base and requisite expertise so that teachers can organize an aesthetic education curriculum. For its conceptual structure, the project implemented concepts, strategies, and evaluation based on the California State Art Education Framework. Fifty participants included elementary teachers, junior and senior high art teachers, principals, art consultants, a music specialist, a resource teacher, university professors, and community agency people. The project's program was organized around three phases over 18 months. Phase one  was program planning and development of an aesthetic education seminar for teachers. Phase two was the six-week inservice teacher seminar that included discussion, laboratory work, curriculum development, and materials review. Phase three was classroom implementation of seminar outcomes for the 1975-76 school year. Evaluation techniques included the Aesthetic Eye Inventory, interviews, rating scales, monitoring reports, teacher logs, and experience descriptions. Also, a profile of participants was prepared for project evaluation. Findings revealed significant gains in participants' abilities to use the conceptual structure and perceptual techniques. It was determined that the structure does provide a basis for teaching children about art. (Author/ND)",

The resource book for secondary social studies teachers and administrators is concerned with basic information and teaching materials pertaining to the evolution of communism and the development of the political and economic institutions in the United States. Its purpose is to help teachers develop appropriate units for their classes, not to impose an instructional program on them. The source book is applicable to any teacher interested in teaching about communism. The contents of the book reflect the cooperative work of the project consultants and teachers. The first five chapters consist of topical summary  papers by the consultants: Marxism-Leninism; the Bolshevik Revolution and development of Soviet communism; world communism; the Soviet communist regime; and political and economic institutions of the United States. These chapters are intended for teacher background information, not as student reading. The concluding chapter, prepared by the cooperating teachers, lists instructional materials by sections organized according to the first five chapter topics. Each section recommends bibliographies, teaching concepts, key terms, classroom activities, discussion questions, and educational media materials. (ND)",

        "description":"Defining the museum as a learning environment, this book analyzes devices that can be used to make the experience more meaningful for visitors in existing and new exhibits. Although the typical museum audience is heterogeneous and voluntary with no particular instructional objectives on which to base museum exploration, instructional technology can be used to arrange media and activities in order to facilitate specific learning outcomes. Elements of two experimental programs, which were initiated in the Milwaukee Public Museum, are described. Audiocassettes and portable visitor response devices can serve as adjuncts to already existing exhibits to give them interactive properties. For example, the visitor may carry and play the cassette as he examines an exhibit, and he can punch  answers on a punchboard in response to audio-script questions. The devices can be wired so that the cassette stops playing until the correct response has been punched. Similar nonportable machines can be attractively programed for pre- and posttesting or self-testing. Other techniques for self-testing could involve latent image response cards, punchboards, and mechanical response devices. Statistics are included for several studies that use various techniques over different periods of time. (AV)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on the preservice teacher education center, particularly on those which encourage the optimal use of college and school personnel and resources in the field-based aspects of teacher education training programs. The paper is organized around five main topics. First, a brief historical view of the teacher center is presented. The second section scans the teacher center literature. The third section discusses emergent themes from the literature important in developing effective teacher education centers including discussion of such topics as: governance; the integration of college and school-based learning experiences; role changes; and teacher training and education renewal. The fourth section presents common problems in developing field-based teacher education.  These problems specifically are related to the conventional roles played by the various participants in teacher education and the role conflicts that are experienced when more than structural or cosmetic program changes are attempted. The fifth section offers suggestions for consideration in the development and operation of a functional teacher education center. The suggestions give particular attention to the human factors involved in a teacher education center and the interplay between these and the many organizational features, distribution of responsibility, and procedures that are part of a teacher center. As a brief summary, advantages inherent in successful implementation of a teacher education center are listed. A bibliography is appended developed by the authors from their own  readings and from a computer search of the ERIC data base. (MM)",

Data compiled from the administration of the Fast-Tyson Health Knowledge Test (1975 revision) indicates that subject knowledge (1) was not strong in any health content area; (2) was moderately strong concerning safety/first aid and consumer health; (3) was weak in the areas of personal health, exercise/relaxation/sleep, nutrition/diet, contemporary health problems, tobacco/alcohol/drugs, diseases, mental health, and human sexuality. Subjects supported the value of a quality health program at both the high school and college level, but those who had completed  a health course at those levels recorded a slightly lower mean test score than those who had not. The study recommended development of (1) a K-12 curriculum for a comprehensive health education program, (2) daily health instruction in the elementary schools, (3) basic health education at the junior high/middle school level (grade 8/9), (4) advanced health education for grade 11 or 12, (5) a personal health course for college freshman, and (6) inservice and preservice teacher education health courses. In addition, the report recommended that all health instruction at the secondary level be taught by certified health specialists and that the current dual teacher certification in health and physical education be discontinued.

Improvement depends upon: (1) defining the areas of concern for health education (experiences influencing knowledge, attitudes, and practices relating to personal, family, and community health), and other health-related areas, such as school health (the determination of health status), and health environment (physical and humanistic surroundings); (2) organized curricular development, as pure subject matter, and as attitude and habit formation; (3) establishing priorities for topics on the basis of  importance, relevance, and need, and weighing the discussion of issues on this basis; (4) defining the role of the classroom instructor as the central person (from the child's viewpoint) involved in health observation, environmental improvement, and health instruction; and (5) concept formation and the embodiment of cognitive knowledge in behavioral development. Studies have shown that health course content is both boring and repetitious and ignores the problems of consumer education, sex education, venereal disease, alcohol, drugs and smoking, nutrition, mental health, and environmental hazards. Health education must be recognized as an academic discipline worthy of the respect and concern given to all other academic discipline areas, or this situation will remain unchanged.

The nature of cancer, the epidemiological factors related to it, the types of treatments available, and rehabilitation of cancer victims are discussed. Finally, the unit discusses personal and community responsibility regarding cancer control. Upon completion of the unit, the student will be able to (1) differentiate between a normal and cancer cell in terms of purpose and function, (2) describe the process of cancerous cell proliferation and its effects on surrounding tissue and of the entire body, (3) associate suspected cancer-causing factors with commonly occurring cancer, and the common sites of cancer in human beings,  (4) analyze cancer morbidity and mortality rates in the population of the country, of regions with differing rates, and of the community, (5) show how early detection affects cure and/or eradication rates, (6) compare methods of treatment, (7) show how continued follow-up ensures sustained control, (8) identify services and resources aimed at cancer control and prevention, (9) determine ways of using these resources, (10) demonstrate how to do a self-examination for cancer detection, (11) describe world, national, and regional organizations involved in cancer eradication, and (12) identify personal responsibility for cancer control and prevention.

        "description":"The intent of this guidebook is to assist teachers and program directors to prepare instructional objectives in a way that will be most useful both for them and for those involved in the evaluation of humanities programs. Contemporary humanities education seeks to achieve its objectives in four categories of student behavior: (1) reasoning, meaning the individual can modify her or his conduct to meet new situations; (2) the affective domain, how a person feels about wanting to learn and what each feels after learning; (3) interdisciplinary learning, understanding the interrelationships between disciplines and their personal and social significance; and (4) values, helping young people develop values that will give them a sense of direction. Humanities education seeks to support  these objectives through three major strategies: (1) process approach, recognizing a need to develop an educational approach based on adaptable process skill, secondarily on content; (2) utilizing community cultural resources, asserting that school and community must be integrally related in planning and implementing educational change, and (3) a focus on individualized instruction.

        "description":"This study examines both the relationship between teacher evaluation by students and student performance (where students were unaware of course grades), and the role of learner perception of effective teaching styles on those evaluations. Ninty-three graduate students served as subjects for this study. Near the end of the five-week course, the students were asked to respond to a survey designed to assess learner perception of the teaching process. The evaluation instrument was comprised of four components. The first factor represented attention to the method used in the course. A second factor indicated evaluation of the knowledge of the instructor. The third factor dealt with personal aspects of the instructor. The final factor displayed attention to course content. Results  indicate a positive relationship between achievement and four evaluation components and offer evidence of the effect learner perceptions have on their evaluation of teaching. Implications for both teacher effectiveness research and research in teacher evaluations are discussed. A list of references for further research is attached. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper examines school productivity research--research regarding school effects on students, divided into two broad classes according to whether the dependent variable is (a) later life consequences or (b) immediate student outcomes. The discussion is organized in four sections. First, six major issues in the methodology of school productivity research are listed. This list provides some major reasons why school effects research may have been unsuccessful to date and suggests ways to better estimate the potential productivity of schools. Second, variables are introduced within the three domains of (1) school structure and organization, (2) social process, and (3) student outcomes. Specific aspects of these variables are examined to discover the role they play in the interplay  between structure, process, and outcomes. Third, three directions for theory development which connect the organization, process, and outcome variables are outlined. A discussion of tradeoffs of school effects on students is presented. Trait-treatment interactions and individual differences are discussed. Parallel mechanisms of social control and individual motivation that are linked to the main organizational variables are detailed. The fourth section ties together the paper's conceptualization of school effects on student outcomes and suggests three broad kinds of research activity to make progress toward improving school productivity: (1) methodological studies to address some major technical issues in estimating school effects; (2) focused studies of specific causal connections  between school organization properties, social processes, and student outcomes; and (3) basic research on processes of human motivation and environmental stimulus.

Eight topics are presented. The first presentation analyzes the different, but effective, approaches to the inservice education of teachers and offers a rationale for the wide range of practices that exist. It is followed by a reaction paper. The second presentation attends to the circumstances of inservice education in higher education and suggests some changes to be considered by members of the higher education community. It, too, is followed  by reaction comments. The third selection offers some views of teaching and teacher education that require serious examination, if not outright rejection, according to the author, and is followed by reaction statements. The fourth presentation is a summary of small group discussions on definitions and purposes of inservice education and higher education's role in inservice education. The fifth section presents resumes of state--Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina--plans for inservice education. Sixth, resumes of university and school inservice education programs are presented. The seventh section consists of participants' comments about the institute program and suggestions for improving future institutes. Eighth is a memorandum addressed to the faculty of the College of Education  at Wright State University that serves as an example of the impact of the institute on its participants. Appendix A lists the roster of program personnel; Appendix B is the program's schedule of events. (MM)",

The basic ingredients of the microteaching concept are the communication techniques dimension, the teach-reteach dimension, and the immediate feedback dimension. Under the direction of a supervisor and working with others in the seminar, each participant demonstrated and spoke on the topic of her choice, with the aim of instructing the listeners. Each demonstration was recorded on video tape. The tape was viewed and analysed, followed by direct question and answer sessions and suggestions for improvement by the supervisor. The benefit of immediate feedback and reaction was apparent, and each participant developed  more self-confidence as the seminar progressed. The concensus of opinion at the end of the session was that microteaching is a valuable tool not only for improving communication skills but also for improving teaching techniques. (JD)",

Seven math tests with similar content but graduated difficulty were administered to students in grade seven. The tests overlapped each other so that each test included about 20 items that were also included in one of the other six tests. The items in these seven tests were calibrated for difficulty using the Rasch procedure. Through the linking data provided by the common items, each of the items in all of the tests was adjusted to the same scale of difficulty. These items then formed a single pool of items. These items were listed in ascending  difficulty order and were divided into seven level tests each with 30 items. These new tests were administered to about 1500 students in the seventh grade. Rasch item calibrations were again computed, and linking data used to adjust items to a common achievement scale. Rasch scaled achievement scores were computed for each possible raw score for each of the level tests and for the same items as calibrated in the original pool. The comparable scaled achievement scores for the tests were established on the basis of the actual performance of students on the second administration. Tables present the results. (RC)",

        "description":"Two techniques for writing achievement test items to accompany instructional materials were contrasted: (1) generating items from statements of instructional objectives, and (2) generating items from rules for transforming instructional statements (adapted from Bormuth). Items of each type were written by two experienced item writers. Subjects were given tests employing these items before and after reading a programmed booklet. One item writer was found to produce consistently more difficult test items regardless of the technique used. This result supports the contention that objective-based item writing results in items of varying quality, but is in conflict with the hypothesis that the rule-generation technique eliminates &quot;subjectivity&quot; in item writing. The need for further  investigation of fully-automated, linguistic-based rules for item writing is suggested. (Author)",

        "description":"The paper describes a variety of analytical difficulties facing prospective users of the first follow-up of the National Center for Education Statistics National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS) and suggests some possible approaches to coping with these. The primary focus is on the causes and consequences of selective item non-response in the first follow-up survey. Coding schemes used to flag this non-response and alternative approaches to estimating values for missing data are discussed. An examination of the special codes used for routing-pattern errors and missing data leads to the proposal of preparation of an analysis-oriented data file to parallel, but not replace, the existing documentary file. Certain coding modifications are mentioned which  might be implemented for such a file. An examination of patterns of item non-response leads to the conclusion that the questionnaire's content and format, especially requests for detailed and/or private information, complex routing patterns, and a layout better suited to personal interviews than to mail-out collection, are probably responsible for some item non-response. Possible modifications that might reduce item non-response in future follow-up surveys are suggested. Review of several approaches to adjustment for missing data leads the authors to recommend a specific imputation procedure for data already collected. Also described are some possible methodological studies aimed at testing the effects of data assignments upon characteristics of the present NLS data base.  (Author/RC)",

Seven major recommendations were made for program improvement: (1) development of an in-service orientation for regular teachers; (2) increasing availability of appropriate career education and vocational training opportunities for the hearing impaired child; (3) enhancing the communication existing between teachers in the itinerant program and students' parents; (4) provision of more adequate facilities for itinerant hearing teachers; (5) provision of in-service training for teachers of the hearing impaired in certain areas; (6) making available more complete information on incoming students especially for teachers functioning in self-contained settings; and (7) more adequate provision for certain equipment items.

Intrinsic motivation was traced to two primary determinants. One, an organizational factor, is the extent to which an employee's job is \"enriched,\" or incorporates challenging elements such as autonomy and variety. A second determinant is an individual difference factor--the extent to which the individual desires to achieve and grow. Data were collected from 353 clerical employees in a large, metropolitan bank. Ability was measured by a pre-employment clerical aptitude test; information about job characteristics, individual growth needs, growth satisfaction, and intrinsic motivation was obtained by an employee questionnaire; and job  performance was measured by supervisors' evaluations. The hypotheses were tested by hierarchical moderated multiple regression. Ability and intrinsic motivation combined in an additive way but not in an interactive way in predicting job performance.

The nine papers in this volume exemplify several categories of protytype testing conducted at different stages of the development process, under different conditions, and yielding different types of results. The first two working papers describe the use of status testing in selecting and sequencing outcomes and related content for spelling and composition skills instruction. The third paper describes an experimental investigation of the effect of two manipulated variables--tracing prompts and descrimination training--on kindergarten handwriting performance. At  this stage of development, prototype testing can aid in important decisions about product specifications and in avoiding costly modifications later in development. As explained in papers four and five, using prototype testing in composition skills and drama, pupil performance data are of secondary interest at such early stages in development. The sixth paper suggests certain procedures for reporting classroom observation of a program lesson and illustrates these procedures with respect to programs in composition and drama. (RC)",

Scores from these measures were correlated with the scales of Lief and Reed's Sexual Knowledge and Attitude Test and the Sex Guilt Scale of Mosher's Forced Choice Guilt Inventory.

The Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT) is used as an example. The third section discusses the need  for test wiseness and points out that without the required test skills the child cannot demonstrate what has or has not been learned.

Here, the interest lies in explicating the interpretive procedures used by the classroom teacher in constructing pupil categorizations. As a specialist, the teacher is expected to be able to detect and assign significant features of children's routine acts to both social (behavioral) and functional (performance) categories. The paper begins by discussing methods used in data collection. These include introspection, role-taking, and the analysis of taped accounts. The procedures used by the actor-teacher to construct a social reality for a second grade class are examined and are documented by ongoing accounts and  retrospective conversations. Critical behavioral distinctions made by the teacher are, among others, the 'hyper', the 'imaginative', and the 'flexible', child. Those distinctions which pertain to function or performance are the 'slow learner', the 'sharpie', and the 'conservative' child. Of particular interest is the teacher's interpretation of children's routine acts and performances in light of existing categorizations. Another area of concern deals with change in category interpretation. It appears that reinterpretation of already assigned categories occurs only when children continuously act or perform in a contradictory way. (Author)",

        "description":"This report presents findings from the first six Gilbert Youth surveys, conducted biannually since May of 1971. The concept of a continuing, national survey of civilian male youth was developed in 1971 as part of a systematic effort by the Department of Defense to study the enlistment motivation and attitudes toward military service held by American youth. It was anticipated that the results of such a project would provide valuable information to those concerned with forecasting accession levels, designing recruiting strategies, and structuring the all-volunteer force. The data reported here represent a considerable contribution toward the establishment of the necessary data base. The samples used in this research are independent probability samples representative of male  civilian youth aged 16-21 years. The samples are representative with respect to age, geographical region, and educational status. In total, the survey sample is representative of slightly more than 10.1 million. Data were collected in personal interviews by peer interviewers working under professional supervision. To fully utilize the representativeness of the samples employed, all percentages contained in the tables of this report make use of appropriately weighted data (unless otherwise indicated). These figures therefore are technically &quot;projected&quot; percentages rather than &quot;observed&quot; percentages. Estimates of the statistical reliability for the major sample breakdowns are given in Appendix A. Topics discussed in the chapters include: enlistment intent, incentives and deterrents to  enlistment, knowledge about military service, service images, and recruiting. (RC)",

These recurring patterns related to objectives, evaluation designs and data collection modes reflect impact of both external factors (e.g., changes in funding guidelines) and internal factors (e.g., changes in priority needs). However, periodic re-emergence of earlier approaches has been characterized by increasingly more comprehensive purposes, with more specific identification and interrelationship of process and product factors. The spiral sequence thus generates &quot;new&quot; combinations and applications of &quot;old&quot; approaches. (Author/RC)",

One of the most widely used methods of analyzing pre and post test norm referenced data has been the six-step historical regression procedure. This procedure compares the rate of growth of children within a Title I program with the predicted rate of growth they would have achieved without the Title I program. This predicted rate of growth is based upon the students' previous rate which is established by a grade equivalent score on a norm referenced test. The first five steps of the procedure demonstrate how to calculate, for a given student with a grade equivalent score, a predicted  score after a certain number of months (usually between six and ten). The tables which comprise this document offer a shortcut way of calculating predicted scores and thus allow the evaluator to avoid the tedious task of calculating predicted scores for each youngster in the program. Limitations to using the tables are given. (RC)",

An attempt is also made to relate the second year results to findings in the first evaluation year, 1973-74. A major objective of the study has been to assess the overall impact of the ESAA Basic and Pilot programs on students' academic skills and on certain desegregation-related outcome measures. Accordingly, results of the impact analyses are reported here. However, it has been apparent from the earliest stages of data collection that the results of any such overall impact study would almost certainly be difficult to interpret because of the wide  variations found among local ESAA projects with respect to specific project goals, approaches taken to reach these goals, and the magnitude and quality of project resources applied to the goals. In such an evaluation, the deficiencies of some projects may obscure the successes of other projects. Accordingly, this report places considerable emphasis on the identification of elements of characteristics of the school programs that seem to have helped disadvantaged students, regardless of the source of funding for those programs.

These four dimensions are: (1) organizational climate, which produced a composite index of administrative leadership and a measure of district-level support for new teachers that predicted math gain; (2) parent and community involvement, which produced an index of parent  participation in the classroom that predicted both reading and math gain; (3) reading and math program characteristics, which resulted in three indices that predicted achievement gains: the use of behavioral objectives, the provision of adequate instructional practice, and less frequent use of positive reinforcement; and (4) reading and math resource use, which uncovered a relationship between achievement gain and per-pupil costs for remedial specialists.

The domain referenced measures in this technology, along with other more traditional measures of reading comprehension, literal and non-literal, are subsequently intended to be used in part in large scale studies of productivity in school reading programs. To date, studies of productivity in reading instruction have had little influence on educational decision-making due to serious methodological problems, one of the major problems being the lack of adequate measures of program output. The report further proposes to solve a number of important instructional management problems created by the use of  the inadequate information available from traditional measures of reading comprehension. The new domain referenced measures of reading comprehension will have an improved basis for scaling students on comprehension ability, and abilty scores from this scale will be referenced to an additional scale defining an individual or group's ability to read in several domains of written discourse. These scaling features will allow for the assignment of students to specific levels of reading materials in specific instructional or content domains, a procedure not possible with existing measures of reading comprehension.

To these ends two aspects of assessment, measurement and evaluation, were identified. Their distinction was mainly in the process used to respond to the items of an assessment instrument. The parameters of the assessment models were identified. These were variously combined and operationalized into either measurement or evaluation models. The intention of this process was to make evaluation more measurement-like by using and developing evaluation models, for polychotomous response information, which were patterned after Rasch latent-trait  measurement models. Also developed were some special models for use in decision making paradigms and for assessment situations for which an estimation sample does or does not exist. Analysis of these models and their associated data were provided by a system of computer programs called PRIME. In all, five programs were developed, illustrated, and documented. Applications of these models and computer programs to personnel research areas of the Navy Personnel Research and Development Center research program was discussed. (RC)",

A criterion referenced pretraining multi-media product was developed and applied to support the initial phase of an experimental research effort in which several instructional methods for training pilots in an aircraft simulator were investigated. The objectives of the pretraining materials phase of the study were: (1) to provide a standardized, replicable method of orientation of subjects across three experimental groups, (2) to permit the training and assessment of prerequisite entry behaviors which were relevant to the tasks taught in the simulator, and (3) to enhance experimental control for the study. Instructional materials  were developed and validated following instructional systems development (ISD) procedures. The materials consisted of a modified programmed text, review questions, a video taped briefing/demonstration, and a criterion test. Materials were validated using two sample groups from the target population of undergraduate pilot training (UPT) casual students. The multi-media pretraining package was applied during the initial or orientation phase of the instructional strategies study. Criterion test scores of the experimental groups receiving pretraining exceeded acceptance criteria for the specified prerequisite skills as called for in the instructional product validation. Achievement scores on the criterion test for the experimental groups closely replicated those of the validation group  (non-significant differences in mean scores). (Author/RC)",

        "description":"The optimum weighting of variables to predict a dependent-criterion variable is an important problem in nearly all of the social and natural sciences. Although the predominant method, multiple regression analysis (MR), yields optimum weights for the sample at hand, these weights are not generally optimum in the population from which the sample was drawn. A method was developed that sacrifices some &quot;prediction&quot; in the sample at hand in order to achieve a more reliable and stable predictor composite. The method developed, Factor Regression Analysis (FRA) is based on the first principle component of the predictor intercorrelation matrix with validities in the diagonal cells. FRA yielded very stable predictor composites and weights--the weights themselves varied less from sample to  sample than did MR weights from the same samples. These differences were marked for low sample sizes (e.g., N = 25), regardless of the number of variables in regression. With regard to prediction, FRA composites were substantially more valid in the population than the MR composites based on the same samples. The number of predictors in the subset did not turn out to be very important. FRA weights based on samples of 25 were about as valid as MR weights based on samples of 100. With samples of 200 the two methods yielded roughly equivalent prediction. (Author)",

The evidence from these studies, when taken in combination, suggests that the tendency of researchers to ignore wrong answers has been a fundamental procedural error of broad scope and serious consequences. Instead of the straight line development commonly found when right answers are considered alone, evidence for a phase and stage sequence was found. These results contradict the use of linear models to describe development. Implications to education, to research procedures, to test theory and analysis, and to learning theory are drawn. (Author)",

Validity coefficients based on program-completion criterion dimensions of \"Training Program Adjustment,\"\"Monetary Expectations,\"\"Effective Job Planning,\"\"Personal Social Adjustment\" and \"Vocational Confidence\" were found to be most significant for tests of Job Seeking Skills, Job Holding Skills, Job Knowledge; with somewhat lower validities for Practical Reasoning measures and the least (but still significant) validity levels for attitudinal measures of  Self-Esteem and Deferred Gratification. Predictive test validities using post-program criteria that deal with social and vocational adjustments were minimal, largely because of difficulties in collecting a sufficient amount and quality of post-program criterion data. The relatively few significant validity coefficients found were for tests of Job Seeking Skills, Attitude Toward Authority and Practical Reasoning. A number of the measures appear to possess predictive value as guidance tools for use in manpower training programs. (Author)",

While the initial changes may consist mainly of &quot;austerity&quot; measures, more fundamental alterations could give greater long term value to the student and the community. The key to this transformation lies in the concept of productivity. Productivity means better results per dollar spent, an operational guideline that would be an improvement over the recent past. The best hope for productive public education in New York City is for the public to press for such changes as the following. Staff Quality: (Have in each school a principal committed to high standards of staff performance; establish procedures for selection, performance review, and retraining of staff, and, if  necessary, dismissal of those who are ineffective); Management and Accountability: (Give principals more authority to run their schools but only within required procedures for participation by students, staff, and parents); A New Delivery System: (Provide more educational options and alternatives to meet the varied needs and learning styles of children, making greater use of out-of school resources); Priority Budgeting: (Through open hearings provide opportunities for the public to comment on budget priorities and options). Collective Bargaining: (Prepare for collective bargaining through local discussions with principals, teachers, and parents); Back to Basics: (Insist on achievement in reading, writing, mathematics, and academic subjects by all students).

        "description":"The primary goal of this study was to determine if attending desegregated schools has a measurable impact on mobility attitudes and status attainments. This study restricted itself to rural black respondents who had attended segregated-only or segregated and desegregated schools. Two lines of analysis were followed. The first dealt exclusively with a comparison of the levels of mobility aspirations, perceived blockages and assuredness, and actual educational attainment. The second type of analysis assessed the processual differences between segregated and desegregated students. In this case, three models were tested for both groups to see if the theorized causal linkages varied between groups. The findings of critical importance seem to be centered around the educational  variables. First, when educational attitudes were regressed on each other, the coefficient between the 1968 and 1972 Levels of Educational Aspiration was much larger for the desegregated group. This suggested that the desegregated group had much greater stability in maintaining its educational attitudes. Second, the larger difference in the relationships between the 1968 level of Educational Aspiration and Educational Attainment suggests that a much greater correspondence between educational plans and educational behavior exists for the desegregated group. These findings suggest that youth who attend desegregated schools differ somehow in the process of attitude formation and maintenance, and status attainment. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"During the 1974-75 school year, 11 Minneapolis public secondary schools formed Student Advisory Committees (SAC's) as one of the conditions of their receiving Federal desegregation funds under the provisions of the Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA). No ESAA funds were allotted for operation of the SAC's, however. The 11 schools with SAC's included eight junior highs and three senior highs. According to Federal ESAA regulations, the SAC in each school was supposed to constitute a &quot;true cross section&quot; of the student body. The SAC was to serve as the students' voice in the improvement of school programs; including, for example, the reading and Counselor Aide programs funded under ESAA in Minneapolis. At the request of the Minneapolis ESAA Project Administrator, staff from the  Minneapolis Schools' Research and Evaluation Department studied SAC membership and operation. This study answered two questions: (1) Did the SAC's follow Federal ESAA regulations during 1974-75? It was concluded that given the ambiguity of ESAA regulations and avoiding their literal interpretation, most of the schools made a good faith attempt to elect SAC's fairly representing their racial groups. However, 5 of the 11 SAC's were not elected by students. (2) How did the SAC's operate during 1974-75? It was found that each of the SAC's met once a month or more, on the average. The SAC's sponsored a variety of educational, social, and other activities. (Author/JM)",

Because of the large number of student needs, this brief aid addresses only a few general areas of need such as language learning, grade placement, social relationships, and school background. Statements about Vietnamese culture are included to help the teacher select an appropriate approach for Vietnamese students who are refugees from a traditional society which underwent evolutionary change due to contact with the West. The degree of the students' cultural differences is  dependent upon their background, for example, whether they had been living in the city or in the countryside, whether they had been intellectuals or illiterates. In working with the students, the teacher is encouraged to adopt the appropriate approach for each case. A bibliography is provided to indicate sources of further information.

(2) What African cultural patterns, attitudes, values and traditions may persist in such areas as Black attitudes toward the aged and aging and the role and place of the aged in the Black community? (3) What has been the impact of Black activist movements on the perceptions and actions of the aged, and on the attitudes of young Blacks toward the aged?

Native Americans would be helped by gerontological research as it has been traditionally done more than by social gerontological research.

This is done to suggest that failures of public policy often are aggravated by political, cultural and historical experiences which some ethnic groups bring to the American scene. It reviews the literature relevant to services delivery to elderly Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, Samoans, American Indians, Mexican Americans and black Americans. These groups were chosen for study because it was believed that each of them would manifest particular economic and demographic characteristics which affect the level of social services needs, or that they have cultural and historical characteristics which affect their readiness to seek access to social services, or that they may suffer in some special  manner from inadequacies in the design of the services delivery system. Several factors affect the use of services by elderly persons from minority groups: differences in socioeconomic status, cultural factors, differences in eligibility for services, communication and language barriers, and differences in physical and financial access. Each of these factors is briefly discussed and each discussion is concluded with some recommendations for improvement in the social services delivery system. (Author/JM)",

The school year is divided into three ten-week cycles with each cycle serving 45 children. The team comprises three reading teachers, a director, and a secretary. Each teacher is responsible for instructing one of the three I. R. I. T. reading areas: decoding, vocabulary and comprehension, and individualized reading. Mornings in the I. R. I. T. Program are spent on instruction.  The 45 students are divided into three heterogeneous groups of 15. Each teacher spends a period of one hour with each of the three groups. The groups rotate to a new teacher for each period so that each student gets three periods of reading instruction, one period of instruction for each of the three I. R. I. T. reading areas. Afternoons are used by the team teachers for preparation, coordination, and professional development, while the students return to regular classrooms in their home schools. The understanding and approval of parents are important to the success of I. R. I. T. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This report reviews the first year of integration, under the implementation of the Six-District Plan, of the elementary schools in Springfield, Massachusetts. Through this plan the school department changed the racial composition in five previously imbalanced elementary schools and integrated the elementary school system. Redistricting, the reassignment of students, and the transportation of students were major tools in this plan. A profile of both the community and the school system is provided in the report, and the historical events that led up to school integration are reviewed. In the description of the plan, special attention is given to the problem of students from Spanish-speaking backgrounds. The city of Springfield was able to integrate its elementary schools with a  minimum of trouble. Some of the factors responsible for this are: The school department worked over several years to develop and implement the plan. Both the mayor and the school superintendent lent their leadership and support. In addition, Springfield's prior experience in integrating the junior and senior high schools probably facilitated integration of the elementary schools. The plan is still opposed by many residents who believe that mandatory busing is not the appropriate path to integration. Of much greater seriousness is the unsolved problem of the Puerto Rican students. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This is a report prepared by the Illinois Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. It deals with how local, state and federal officials, as well as private individuals and groups, have dealt with Cairo, Illinois' racial and economic problems. The areas addressed are employment, housing, health, and law enforcement. It has been found that the impact of civil rights legislation has still not reached Cairo after nearly a decade. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has not yet processed its discrimination charges. The State Fair Employment Practices Commission admits it has done &quot;nothing&quot; to end discrimination in Cairo because it does not have the money or legislative authority to take effective action. The City Council lets its attitude  towards Blacks stand in the way of selling vacant property to a corporation willing and able to build desperately needed low-income housing for the city's poor. A segregated all-white school continues to operate with the support of federally sponsored tax exempt status while the public school system nears financial ruin. In spite of these failures, Blacks have accomplished a great deal during the past decade. For instance, the biracial board of directors and black administrative staff of a housing corporation have successfully overcome the roadblocks of the City Council and have provided low-income housing for poor whites and blacks.

It also describes hunger and its effects on child development. The topics addressed are: definition of malnutrition, the prevalence of malnutrition, the brain, severe malnutrition and learning, chronic malnutrition and learning, deficiency and learning, hunger and learning, the cycle of malnutrition, and rehabilitation. It is concluded that prolonged severe malnutrition during gestation or early infancy when the brain is rapidly growing can lead to permanent behavioral handicaps. Such severe malnutrition is quite infrequent in the  United States. The effects of moderate or chronic malnutrition are not as clearly understood. Adverse behavioral consequences of chronic undernutrition seem to lie in the areas of attentiveness, curiosity, activity, and social responsiveness rather than in learning itself. The consequences of iron deficiency are likely to be in these same areas. The incidence of hunger among children is nearly impossible to measure. Although it does not permanently affect the brain, hunger probably adversely affects learning. Corrective policies must include insuring preventive health care beginning with the pregnant mother and extending through childhood. (Author/AM)",

One is concerned primarily with the normal functioning of adolescent society, the other with the design of reward structures to foster academic achievement. The literature covering the use of material incentives for motivating children and the importance of peer group organization in adolescent culture is surveyed. It is argued that these two considerations are especially relevant to lower-class adolescents, and the likely impact of a reward structure based upon an amalgam of these themes is explored. Specifically, it is suggested here that combining material inducements for achievement with a reward structure organized around peer groups can provide an effective  strategy for motivating lower-class adolescents toward academic goals.

The concept of youth involvement is central to these fourteen projects. Youth involvement is defined as \"initial participation by project beneficiaries in the determination of the nature of their program and continuing participation in on-going managerial and policy-making activities.\" Its purpose is to enable project participants to find their place in community affairs through democratic experience and collective social action. A problem facing some of the projects is the lack of a clearcut relationship between the youth board and the adult boards. For this reason it is recommended that programs of  youth involvement be continued, but that a new structure be developed to emphasize cooperation between youth and adult boards. Evaluation for each of the youth projects was provided by a third party. This report includes a detailed discussion of the evaluation process and emphasizes the use of evaluation as a tool for program improvement rather than as a measure of success or failure. Youth participating in all the programs included members of many ethnic groups and members of both sexes. Most participants were from poverty groups. (PR)",

These families were selected on the basis of their motivation to participate in the project and because there was some indication that they would remain in the educational program for the entire year. The program included self-development courses and bi-weekly seminars for the adults, activities involving all members of the family, and special activities for the various age groups within the family. The main hypothesis of this study is that if Head Start  children, siblings and their parents are involved in a program as a family, various benefits will be shared by all family members. The most important of these is improvement in the parent-child relationship in which the parent, who is himself actively engaged in course work, assists the child as an active learner. Some of the findings include the following: Head Start children whose parents are in the project made measurable progress during the time that their family was in the project. These children progressed at a faster rate as compared with the national norms in evaluating Head Start progress. (Author/AM)",

A professional evaluation of Elementary Secondary Education Act Title I must make a precise accounting of the relations among expenditures, implementation, outcome and impact; measure effectiveness over a long enough term to determine if the benefit and gain last; and explore alternatives to the assumptions on which the programs are based. The problems created by having to develop major evaluation studies quickly are examined. Conclusions about the way in which the National Institute of Education (NIE) handled these problems are reached: (1) The lack of time prevented NIE from securing the cooperation of a representative sample of school districts. (2) School districts should have been selected  from demonstrations so that they would be representative of the nation. (3) All major contracts for program evaluation should have been competitively awarded. The report analyzes the original plan for the longitudinal evaluation of compensatory education by the Office of Education (OE). The scope of that study was being reduced to a half of its original scope when this report was being prepared. Although both the NIE and OE evaluations are supposed to assess the efficacy of compensatory education, neither study will do this. Problems in the coordination of the two studies are also discussed.

It focuses on the actions and reactions of various groups and the specific activities undertaken to prepare the community. The paper notes several themes involving the community preparation process that may be generalizable to other communities. They are: (1) The established community leadership-- political, business, civic -- becomes involved in community preparation reluctantly, if at all. (2) Religious leadership can initiate activities and encourage others to join but probably cannot be the central organizer of the total preparation process. (3) Labor leadership nationally  provides very positive support for community preparation. Local labor leaders may vary from enthusiastic to reluctant followers of national policy. (4) School officials will tend to respond to community-initiated efforts at preparation cooly. (5) A reliable source of unbiased information on the law, desegregation plans and events in other cities is a critical element in the pre-liability phase. Seven other themes are discerned and discussed. (Author/JM)",

Secondary school students serviced by the Taylor Children's Home, a program examined in section two, are identified by their inability to function in a regular public school setting. Title I supports one classroom teacher at the Home. The global objective of the Kindergarten Follow Upward program was to service &quot;educationally disadvantaged children&quot; so that they would show normal developmental growth in cognitive and psychomotor skills needed for success in kindergarten. The purpose of the Title I  Linguistic Program at Janes School was to raise the reading achievement levels of Latino background children in grades one to four who are below the District's thirtieth percentile on the Metropolitan Achievement Test and/or are recommended for the program by classroom teachers.

The first objective of this paper was to discuss the implications of that research paper for the social systems characteristics of schools. It was observed that to a considerable extent adolescents form ethnic stereotypes in response to certain educational processes to which they are subjected. These processes operate so as to allocate better or worse educational outcomes to different students on the basis of their ethnicity. The second objective of this paper was to focus specifically upon the ways in which these educational processes might be changed in desegregated schools to reduce ethnic prejudice. These processes are of two types. The  first type, Status Ranking processes, tend both to separate the students into distinct groups according to ethnicity and to produce better academic outcomes for one group--the Anglo-Americans--at the expense of the others-- e.g. Blacks, Mexican-Americans, etc. The second type of processes, Status Equalization processes, tend to integrate the students into a single group, regardless of ethnicity and to produce good educational outcomes for all students.

The Council reviewed plans for studies on compensatory education conducted by the National Institute of Education. Among the recommendations of the NACEDC are that: programs serving the educational needs of children be designed to minimize the need for Federal regulations; a single standard of poverty be established for all Federal programs; in-kind benefits received by those families in poverty be counted as income for the  purposes of eligibility for poverty-based Federal programs; and, that longitudinal studies of Elementary Secondary Education Act Title I and other Federal education programs be considered routine and essential. NACEDC is convinced that Title I has been a vital force in increasing sensitivity to the individual needs of students. (Author/JM)",

The system was developed on 700 English-speaking caucasian children (hereafter called Anglos) from the anglo core culture, 700 black children, and 700 Latino Children (90 percent were of Mexican-American heritage) five through eleven years of age. The SOMPA is a system of assessment which triangulates the evaluation process. It looks at the child through a Medical Model and screens for possible anomalies indicated by the Health History, performance on the physical Dexterity Battery, or tests of Vision or Hearing. Using a Social System Model. It looks at the child's performances in family roles, nonacademic school roles, peer group roles, community roles, earner/consumer  roles, self-maintenance roles, and academic school roles. Using a Puralistic Model, it evaluates the child's performance relative to others from the same sociocultural background and makes inferences about the child's Estimated Learning Potential. Through this process, it is hoped that the non-anglo child whose potential may be masked by the distance between the child's location in sociocultural space and the culture of the school will be identified.

It was prepared to assist classroom teachers in improving instructional programs. The Prescriptive Reading Inventory was developed as a criterion referenced test to aid instruction. It was administered in September and May to nearly 5000 students. The results provided teachers with individual student prescriptions for instruction. Workshops were then held throughout the state to instruct teachers in the use of scoring reports and to assist them in setting up and managing an individualized instructional program. The findings of the evaluation show that growth occurred at all grade levels. Title I students in the lower  grades showed greater growth on the average, than students at the higher grades. Student growth did not seem to be higher for objectives rated as having heavy instructional emphasis by teachers than for those having light emphasis objectives. (Author/AM)",

The study is based on a statistical analysis of responses to mail questionnaires from 140 Title IV projects, from site visits to school districts served, and from interview data. The first three agencies cited are compared to each other, while the last is treated separately. Two key variables that affect service delivery from the regional offices and projects are explained. These are: commitment (amenability to desegregation), the relationship to the institution at which the project is located, and,  for GAC's, organizational characteristics. The final section analyzes the context in which the programs as a whole operate, and suggests some ways in which Title IV can be strengthened. (Author/AM)",

Data are provided for the survey respondents on demographic characteristics, work experience, backhome socioeconomic conditions, reasons for migration, and on their contact with various governmental systems.

Thirty case studies were compiled from 19 secondary and 11 postsecondary cooperative education programs located in cities. Interviews were conducted with 675 students participating in the 30 programs and with a cohort group of 774 vocational students not enrolled in the programs to compare their school and job experiences and satisfaction. More participants than nonparticipants had positive attitudes and were employed, with the postsecondary participants scoring higher in the satisfaction areas.  In addition, a followup study of participants and nonparticipants in the 50 primarily nonurban programs studied in part I of the assessment study indicated that where comparable data were available the outcomes were approximately the same. Study conclusions were that the program populations of minority, disadvantaged, and average to below-average students were generally competent and well-motivated and had high job placement rates, except in cities with high unemployment. Major constraints to expansion of the cooperative programs were lack of a sufficient number of coordinators and adverse economic conditions.

Teaching freedom means the opportunity to develop the potential for teaching excellence according to the teacher's individuality in dealing with the individual differences among the students. Many teaching institutions have generated robots, programed to follow precise directions for every aspect of educational programs with no individual thinking or judgment. Rigid, prescribed programs cannot exist where teachers understand and respect their freedom, and the persistent companion of freedom is responsibility. The teacher must see his acceptance of freedom in the  light of the much larger dimension of human understanding. The competent professional soon realizes the fallibility of highly prescriptive programs for all students in a given class or grade level. He needs the freedom to design and deal with content toward the maximum individual development of each student. If the teacher is willing to give up this freedom and responsibility of decisionmaking, he should be aware of what he accepts in its place. (MF)",

Following a short history of what materials have done for man and what man has done with materials, particularly in the development of various metals and composites, from the earliest records to the space age, the author notes that it was mainly through the rise of education in this country that science and technology grew to have a profound effect on the national economy and that the rapid development of materials technology in the past 30 years is one of the primary reasons for such seeming impossibilities as jet passenger planes. He observes that this materials technology development  is continuing and challenges educators to look carefully at processes now shaping our world and those expected in the near future, not just to keep abreast of technology but to teach it to those who must follow.

Viewpoints concerning the definition of technology education (assumption 1) are reviewed; the relevant consistencies among these definitions are enumerated, and a new definition is offered. Basic concern is then centered on the growth and expansion of technology in twentieth century United States and the implications that this has for industrial arts curriculum (assumption 2). It is noted that as a result of this growth, a need  has developed for review of the directions that industrial arts has and will be taking (assumption 3). It is concluded that the responsibility for educational programs to reflect cultural trends and therefore technology exists, and that much of the apprehension would be dismissed if technology were considered a process rather than a thing. Also included in the paper is a rationale and outline of a technology education curriculum. (TM)",

The responses (335) were then analyzed to determine the mean frequency and importance of each task, which resulted in the selection of (1) 12 essential tasks;  (2) 96 nonessential, but recommended for inclusion, tasks; and (3) 15 nonessential and not recommended for inclusion tasks. The tabulated data will be utilized in the development and evaluation of the recently approved Legal Assistant Program at Lakeshore Technical Institute at Cleveland, Wisconsin, a pilot 2-year associate degree program for the State of Wisconsin Vocational, Technical and Adult Education System.

A Student Attitude Survey was devised which solicited students' opinions about specific educational programs, dropping out of school, occupations, occupational activities, school activities, and opinions about education and work generally. The survey was given to male ninth grade inner-city students in the public  school system of Baltimore, Maryland. The findings imply that vocational education does not suffer from a poor public image in the socioeconomic levels studied, and that black students do not hold substantially different attitudes toward work and education than do white students. Fourteen supplementary tables and eight appendixes compose the majority of the document. The appendixes contain the sample letters to teachers, English teachers, parents, and respondents; the consent form; VARIPART Procedure; instructions from Student Opinion Survey, and sample confounded two-mode data matrices.

The objectives of the study were: (1) to develop guidelines for establishing mainstreaming opportunities in vocational education for the handicapped; (2) to identify characteristics and provisions of vocational programs that are mainstreaming the handicapped; and (3) to provide a step-by-step procedural manual for mainstreaming handicapped in vocational programs that will provide pertinent information for field practitioners. The project officially started July 1, 1975, with  research into the development of mainstreaming guidelines and criteria in accordance with Federal and State plans and directives. The second phase consisted of developing guidelines and corresponding data collection instruments, i.e., the structured interview/questionnaire. The third phase involved the selection of representative local education agencies by the Project Advisory Committee for inclusion in the study. On-site interviews were conducted with representatives from each of the participating local education agencies during the months of February through May 1976. This final report represents the fourth and final phase, bringing together findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Half of the report consists of such project materials as the interview/questionnaire guidelines, the  instrument itself, and data summaries. (WL)",

Since more service-producing industries are expected to grow in the future than goods-producing industries, and accurate job forecasting is good but must be accompanied by adequate education and training, the growth of human services and meaningful careers must be encouraged. With plans being made to involve the handicapped in the world of work, additional planning must be made now for the desired changes in the occupational distribution of the handicapped. Eliminating cultural stereotypes, disseminating career information, and earlier training and education are ways to eliminate existing inequalities. Education for careers requires programmatic  cohesion and preparation at all educational levels with cooperation among rehabilitation counselors, special educators, career educators, and vocational educators. Revisions in the transportation system, redesign of jobs, buildings, etc., Federal and State laws, fringe benefits, and group health insurance are areas that must be examined for the disincentives they contain for work. Affirmative action means active day to day cooperation between handicapped employees, employers, and the government. (TA)",

Divergent raters are those whose ratings are significantly different from the other raters' ratings. They may be the noncooperative raters who simply generate an arbitrary pattern of responses rather than try to follow the instructions, or they may invert the rating scale, or they may actually perceive the tasks differently. This report uses data from an actual study to show how REXALL is used to detect divergent raters, and to decide whether or not to delete them from the study since they may invalidate task means computed from ratings. It then uses the raw data  from the study to verify the validity of the decisions made on the basis of the REXALL output. (Editor/WL)",

Industrial expansion means new capital investments, a vital factor to the future well being of economically depressed areas. New investments when accomplished by new jobs and adequate opportunity to train for jobs have a positive psychological effect on both those in the labor force and the owners and managers of business and industry. Capital investments in an economic region attest to the faith that indigenous personnel, the corporation, leaders of local, State, and Federal agencies have in the area's future. The monograph is in three parts. Part I  discusses the role that facilities play in attracting new capital investments in distressed economic areas. Four subjects are covered: (1) Instructional Facilities: Constructed to Serve Their Role in Industrial Development; (2) State Equipment Pools: A Key Factor in Providing Trained Manpower for New Industries; (3) Mobile Vo-Tech Facilities Serve Training and Development Needs; and (4) Special Schools for Industrial Training: A Different Concept of Mobile Training Facilities. Part II focuses on the role that adequate State and local vo-tech management systems play in focusing training funds toward real and identifiable training needs: The Product and the Package of Management Information; An Effective Vo-Tech Management Information System; and Management Systems Work in State Vo-Tech  Agencies. Part III consists of suggestions for making Federal agencies more effective in assisting industrial and economic development. (WL)",

It is intended to serve four major purposes: (1) Provide selected insights into what vocational rehabilitation, vocational education, adult education, Title XX, and health programs do, and how each works; (2) point out potential areas for coordination which, from study of field experience, hold the promise of benefit to the clients and administrators of both CETA and the HEW programs selected; (3) present a brief and practical analytical framework for identifying other arrangements; and  (4) review the key management techniques that have proved their value in the negotiation and implementation of coordination projects. A chapter on analysis, identification, and implementation addresses the coordination process and provides information on analyzing one's own program and those of HEW counterparts in order to identify potential coordination arrangements which have the highest probability of success. Summaries of coordination examples are then given for each of the five types of HEW programs listed in purpose l above. Each example covers the following: Issues facing CETA and the subject HEW program, how coordination can help, how it might work, how CETA can benefit, how HEW can benefit, risks to CETA, risks to the subject HEW program, and how to reduce risks.

        "description":"An instrument was developed to enable a comparison of work values of teachers, parents, and students. It was then utilized to investigate the differences between student groups, within and between schools of different curricula, between vocational and academic teachers and parents of students. The instrument, based on constructs obtained from a literature review, sought to measure the degree of commitment to three work values categories: The Classical (Protestant) Work Ethic, the Consumer (work for profit) Work Ethic, and the Meaningful Work Ethic. A pilot study was conducted to test its validity and reliability. Data for the main study was gathered from four senior high schools in Baltimore County, Maryland. Approximately 2500 students in grades 10 and 11 and 180 teachers  participated in the study. Data obtained from the instrument were used to test five hypotheses: (1) Tenth and eleventh grade students from four different high schools scored significantly different means on subtests of the instrument, (2) students from four different schools scored significantly different means on the three work ethic subtests, (3) tenth and eleventh grade students from two different curriculums (vocational and college prep) scored significantly different means on their performance in reacting to three work ethic subtests, (4) academic teachers scored significantly different means than vocational teachers as measured by the three work ethic subtests, (5) students scored significantly different means than teachers when tested on the instrument incorporating three work  ethic subtests. Treatment and analyses of data are reported, and the findings are discussed. It is noted that after completion of the study it was decided that an etiological approach to structuring items within seven work ethics would produce more exact and useful information and that accordingly a new instrument was developed for a second phase of the study.

An advisory committee was appointed to guide the project staff in the preparation of instruments and methodologies, which were then  field tested in three to five local schools. Job performance as assessed by the student and by the employer was obtained. Perception of guidance and placement assistance was also secured as well as an interview with a sample of guidance personnel at the local level.

Specific project goals were to develop and implement group and individual guidance services, a viable placement service, and followup services for those students who have exited from the school system, and to involve the community in planning and operating the expanded services. The programs were conducted in four Arkansas schools.

The project was conducted during an 18-month period in five phases. Phase 1 involved integrating existing California and American Institutes for Research (AIR) models for career guidance program development. Phase 2 entailed the national search for staff development materials, and the development of a system of modules and workshops to teach some basic skills needed to develop programs consistent with the integrated model produced in Phase 1. Phase 3 was a pilot test of this prototype staff development program with selected school personnel. In phase 4, the system  was field tested in both preservice and inservice settings. In phase 5, information about the program and results of the field testing were disseminated. Results of the project were mixed, with competencies increasing to a degree, and attitudes toward the experience a mixture of positive and negative. It was noted that a number of improvements and refinements could be made in both the materials and their delivery to strengthen their impact on the career counseling area of education.

The purpose was to assure that the continuation of the MERC process be of greatest value to the future relationship between Federal and State agencies. The objectives of this assessment were: (1) To determine the feasibility of continuing the program, (2) to determine ways to improve the process, (3) to identify cost to States for the review, (4) to identify benefits to the States, and (5) to identify benefits to USOE. Utilizing a structured  interview approach, Sierra Planning and Research Associates (SPRA) contacted personnel in 5 of the 13 States which had been reviewed by MERC. SPRA also interviewed personnel in six regional offices and various personnel from the central USOE. Additionally, SPRA observed the MERC review in Idaho. A total of 87 persons were interviewed by SPRA, and data from these various sources yielded 14 recommendations which are categorized as follows: (1) The MERC process should be better organized, (2) communications should be improved among all personnel, (3) the MERC process should be reviewed periodically to remove or alter unsuitable items, and (4) the process should be systematized through the development and usage of a procedures manual. The general conclusion of the investigators is that the  MERC process should be continued on a regular basis as practically all the people interviewed held the concept of MERC in esteem.

        "description":"This report was intended to provide a basis and rationale for the organization and development of a multi-State consortium to produce catalogs of performance objectives and criterion-referenced measures in occupational education. Information is centered around two elements which are the major concerns: (1) The accountability phenomenon and its possible effect on occupational education, and (2) efforts of the States to cooperate on a formal basis for the improvement of occupational education in the public sector. It is noted that this report will be used to present to vocational educators and others who may be interested in the formation of a consortium the present status of efforts in this direction and the elements which specifically relate to the national movement toward  accountability in education. After a brief introduction, information is presented under the following headings: Method of Procedure; The Status of Occupational Education in the United States--Are We Ready for the Implication of Educational Accountability; The Accountability Movement--What's in It for Occupational Education?; Performance Objectives and Criterion-Referenced Measures--Possibilities for Getting Accountability to the Classroom?; The Educational Consortium--Another Exercise in Futility, Or Is it an Answer?; and Findings and Conclusions of the Study--Or Putting It All Together.

Topics discussed are trends that led to career education (technological complexity, self-awareness in choice, education and work), four national models, variations at the State and local levels, how career education really works, evaluating career education, and controlling and justifying the costs. The four models are: (1) the school-based or comprehensive model, (2) the employer-based or experience-based model, (3) the  home/community-based model, and (4) the rural/residential-based model.

The literature concerned with aides in ABE, consisting primarily of reports of inservice workshops, has focused on their functions and training needs. This study had four major purposes: (1) To provide demographic data on aides' education, ethnic background, experience, sex, age, and work setting, (2) to determine the nature and extent of specific instructional, clerical, and community relations activities performed by aides, (3) to determine how well aides were prepared to perform the functions important to their work, and by inference, their training needs, and (4) to examine the nature and quality of the working relationships between teachers  and aides. A questionnaire based on the review of literature was field tested with 12 aides, revised, and mailed to 253 aides. Responses were received from 208 aides (82%). Personal interviews were conducted with 35 (16%) aides randomly selected from the respondents, with some adjustments made to insure geographical distribution. Findings are presented in five sections: Modalities of Partnership between Teachers and Aides, Demographic Data, Duties of Aides, Learning Needs of Aides, and Relationship with Teacher. Implications for both administrators and teachers are discussed. Appendixes include the questionnaire and interview guide. (WL)",

(The Batesburg-Leesville Career Education Project was implemented in a school district serving approximately 3,100 students in grades K-12 with a professional staff of approximately 130 teachers, counselors, and administrators.) The report provides local school administrators with an overall picture of the various strategies used to manage a career development program and outlines the roles played by administrators such as superintendents of schools, principals, and career development coordinators. Product and  process objectives are outlined for grades 1-6, grades 7-9, grades 10-12, and for special education. Project objectives are portrayed on a PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Techniques) chart. Project implementation from the teacher's point of view identifies the role of the teacher in the career education movement and reconstructs events, experiences, and preparations which preface actual classroom application of process objectives. A sample lesson plan outline is included. Discussion of administrator implementation focuses on the roles of the district superintendent of schools and local principals. Other sections discuss evaluation, inservice training, staff utilization, successful areas of emphasis, problem areas, and general recommendations. Two guidance newsletters are appended.  (TA)",

The module is divided into two parts. Part 1 involves the acquisition of concepts and background necessary for planning and conducting a staff development program through participation in discussion and other simulated activities, such as the case situation approach and conferences. Objectives included in part 1 concentrate on the following areas of staff development: Understanding the terminology, competencies for leadership,  communication, planning procedures, and evaluation. Part 2 concentrates on implementing the ideas gained from the first part by participation in an internship. The module makes extensive use of the case method, which is a discussion of a typical problem or issue actually facing the curriculum specialist together with surrounding facts, opinions, and prejudices upon which the specialist has to depend. These realistic cases are presented to students for analysis, open discussion, and final decision. Organization of the module is by major performance objectives followed by related learning activities. A pretest, posttest, and explanation of the case method approach complete the module.

        "description":"In order to develop teacher and administrator evaluation systems based on specific measurable criteria, a research population of three groups (full-time students, teachers, and administrators) was drawn from the 57 North Carolina technical institutes and community colleges. Random samples selected from 16 institutions were surveyed, with findings based on responses from 181 students, 150 teachers, and 92 administrators. From field testing of the evaluation instruments at six institutions it was concluded that the evaluation criteria developed were valid. Survey results indicated that generally attitudes of all three groups toward evaluation were not favorable. Teachers held the lowest attitude while administrator attitude was the most favorable. It was felt that the low level of  attitude was due to the evaluation systems currently in use. Each group felt that evaluation of a teacher's or an administrator's effectiveness should be based on a combination of information sources. Teachers and administrators agreed on how often evaluation should be conducted and that the time should be determined by the institution. They also responded positively to all the criteria listed for both groups and were fairly close in their rankings of both sets of criteria. Included in the report are literature reviews on both teacher and administrator evaluation and the teacher and administrator evaluation forms developed. Detailed responses are presented in narrative and tabular form. Appended are the 11 evaluation forms used in the study including the survey instrument, teacher and  administrator opinionnaire, student evaluation forms, teacher and administrator self-evaluation forms, and evaluation forms for chairman, peer, and staff.

A sample population of 300 students from grades 7, 9, and 11 kept career folders and studied components of the career development model. An intensive inservice workshop program for teachers produced marked changes in practices and attitudes. Four project areas considered successful were the inservice workshop programs, the career development guidance model (student plans), counseling development, and acquisition of instructional materials to support career education concepts in the classroom. The third-party annual  evaluation report gives tabulated results of pre- and posttesting of teachers, a sampling of student responses on values development, teacher evaluations of five inservice workshops, and recommendations for the next two years of the project. Principal recommendations were to further involve all secondary teachers and guidance counselors, to connect academic classes and teachers with the area vocational center, and to involve the local community.

Curriculum guides were developed by teachers from the 10 participating schools in career awareness (K-6), career exploration observation (7-9), secondary component (10-12), and occupational cluster curriculum development. Over 2,400 junior high students were given an opportunity to participate in summer work exploration and observation activities. A centralized job development, placement, and followup office to serve the 10 participating schools was established as well as a resource library of career education materials. All graduating seniors in 1974 and 1975 were followed up by telephone survey. The report briefly describes activities, summarizes results  and accomplishments, and presents conclusions and recommendations. A bibliography of books, pamphlets, articles, reports, speeches, and project-developed instructional materials is included.

It was concluded that the project had some impact on the participating students and teachers which varied with schools and classrooms depending on the attitude of the administrator and teacher.

Among the accomplishments reported were the development of three career education centers to increase counseling services and provide career-oriented materials, staff inservice programs, acquisition and development of instructional materials, use of community resources, emphasis on career education in the UNC, and a study of student job placement needs. The third-party evaluation results are also presented. Major conclusions were  that there were no significantly higher performance scores for the treatment students; some attitude change was noted in teachers; and university faculty awareness was somewhat increased.

To accomplish this objective a number of school counselors at 19 high schools and the VTI personnel at the six VTIs in the State were interviewed and a random sample of 10% of tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade students and 1400 VTI students were surveyed. The VTI student survey gathered data about sources of information influencing choice of VTIs and the value of these sources. The high school students were surveyed concerning awareness of the VTIs in Maine and information sources contributing to that awareness. Interviews with counseling and VTI personnel sought opinions and suggestions about  orientation procedures. As a result of the surveys, a series of suggestions concerning orientation procedures are offered for school counselors and post high school personnel to enhance a cooperative effort. The results are presented and analyzed and a summary statement is provided. It is noted that although several influential sources were more frequently cited than others, the general conclusion was that no single procedure constitutes orientation.

The center's activities, based on a previously-developed model, included these components: (1) Cooperative job development with the Bureau of Employment Security, (2) cooperative job matching, (3) followup to assist in work adjustment, (4) the educational program, and (5) feedback of information to improve the program. Findings and analysis are reported for placement, the 1974-75 followup study, mobility, maturity, nontraditional careers, the Bureau of Employment Security, starting wages, and cooperation. Further conclusions are offered on the facility, the word processing machine,  diversified occupations programs, letters to employers, industry input, and professional associations. Conclusions indicate the following: Students placed by the program obtained higher starting wages and jobs in larger corporations; some graduates did not show readiness to enter the world of work upon graduation; although employers sought women for nontraditional jobs, no female students had chosen training in these areas; and cooperation with the Bureau of Employment Security was good. Information about average starting salaries and the followup study is appended along with other project-related material. (NJ)",

        "description":"The Fargo area schools work experience program, &quot;Mission Possible,&quot; was designed to help students explore career-related activities in three phases: (1) Students Seeking Insight (SSI), the observation-visitation-interview approach in which a student is matched with an employer in the career area of interest; (2) Participate in a Career Experience (PACE), an unpaid practical work experience through formal agreement with a community participant; and (3) Job Information Search (JIS), providing career information and materials to students unable to participate in either of the other two phases. This voluntary program originated because student enrollment in the traditional vocational education cooperative work experience program was restricted to rigid school-work structuring and  because the high availability of part-time jobs drew many students to work instead of the school program. The report describes the 2-year program from June 1974 to June 1976 in grades 9-12 in both urban and rural schools. Conclusions and recommendations based on analysis of the 2-year experience are presented along with a review of the five program objectives with commentary on their status at the program's conclusion.

Patterned after vocational education cooperative work experience programs, WECEP is different in that it serves younger students ages 14 and 15 who are having problems in a traditional school setting. WECEP is concerned with helping disadvantaged students experience and appreciate work and education, rather than developing specific job skills. School credits are granted for both inschool instruction and for the part-time work experience. The well-received program experienced a high degree of success and will continue as  a regular program in the district. To continue the success of the program's first year, three areas of concern should be resolved: A reliable and economic method of transporting WECEP students to job sites, a followup for these students into high school to help carry them through to graduation, and the concern felt by teachers in other subject areas about the special treatment given to WECEP students compared to students in the regular junior high program. About half of the report is comprised of WECEP materials such as student data forms and comments of employers, students, parents, and faculty. (MF)",

Research studies on concept learning by the mentally retarded are also reviewed. Several models for teaching concepts are described and the findings of several studies dealing with specific strategies for improvement of concept teaching are summarized. The experimental procedures for the series of substudies conducted by the project are described, which included development of the instructional lesson; development of the  instructional materials--line and detailed drawings, photographs, transparencies, photograms, objects, programmed booklets, and audio scripts; development of the dependent measure; selection of the participating schools; and the research designs for the five substudies. Findings are reported as performance differences among four student groups and as effects on learning of speech rates, technical terms, various visual presentation modes, group size, pupil-teacher rapport, and individualized versus group instruction considering the student characteristics of sex, group, reading and math ability, vocational interest, spatial relationship and form perception ability, and finger dexterity.

Project activities included classes, group sessions, counseling, career materials displays, tours, testing, and informational meetings. In addition, a materials resource center was developed, an inservice program was conducted, and dissemination and public relations activities were carried out. A third party evaluation was made of a selected school population in grades 3, 6, 9, and 12 and a variety of assessment instruments and survey forms were administered to the different  participant groups. Some concluding results were these: Many project activities were found helpful; inservice programs assisted schools to expand career education; group meetings, workshops, and credit classes were the most successful inservice methods; and the last year brought some success in reaching disadvantaged groups.

The evaluation is based on two forms utilized by the advisory councils at the State, regional, and  local levels.

Concept modules were developed for a limited number of concepts based on the task  analyses. Students were expected to demonstrate comprehension of the concept and not necessarily the verbal expression of the concept. The pilot project demonstrated a relationship between acquisition of vocational skill and language development.

Current theory and research have left this level of interpersonal contact untouched. The hypothesis is advanced that the intensity and intimacy of interpersonal contact supplies the motivation which allows the patient to make use of the conditions offered by the therapist in the patient's own coming to explore and experience his inner self. The author defines intensity and intimacy of interpersonal contact and presents a tentative scale for its measurement. Finally, the relationship of this concept to other therapeutic conditions offered by the therapist is discussed. (MPJ)",

It is a revision of an earlier scale, based upon the theoretical conception of intrapersonal exploration as a sufficient antecedent condition for constructive personality change in psychotherapy. The scale is essentially an attempt to measure the extent to which the patient is engaged in self-exploration, with additional weightings given for personally private and personally damning material. In one study, six naive raters, using 358 samples of individual psychotherapy, yielded inter-rater reliabilities of between .58 and .78. This indicates to the author that the scale is explicit enough not to require 'background' or theoretical information for  its use. Two other studies also yielded reasonably high inter-rater reliabilities. The scale ranges from zero (no demonstrable intrapersonal exploration) to nine (a very high level of self-probing and exploration). The judgments are based on the content of patient utterances. Test validity is not discussed. (Author/NG)",

Women from 17 nonprofessional occupations were contacted by mail and asked to complete a revised form of the Strong Vocational Interest Blank (SVIB) for women, and a questionnaire concerned with their occupational choice and job description. Based on responses to this aspect of the study, two scales were constructed--one for Women-in-General (WIG-1) which includes both professional and nonprofessional women, and one for women in nonprofessional occupations (WIG-2). Subsequently it was determined that the WIG-1 scale was the most useful where no information is available as to occupational level. The paper includes extensive  appendices comparing the various populations and job categories, and concludes that intragroup interests of women in nonprofessional occupations differ considerably. Such information can be useful to the counselor who can more adequately counsel nonprofessional working women. (NG)",

Though the author feels that all young people rebel, in all generations, he nonetheless contends that the discontent of the 60's was qualitatively different. He traces its historical sources through the increasing number of graduate students and their increasing awareness of the difficulties of \"getting into\" the academic system; a reaction against the highly standardized and impersonal nature of higher education in the 50's; and the greater sophistication, experience and knowledgeability of the students. He feels that the educational establishment can respond to this unrest in positive ways. He suggests that education return to its traditional role, rather than emphasize professional  training, it should work on the development of each individual's potentialities. There must be increasing emphasis on the arts and humanities; women will continue to redefine their roles and goals; and students should be encouraged to participate in and influence educational institutions and their own educations. The authorities should not, however, discontinue their role as adult, authority figures. Student freedom should continue to be limited. (NG)",

The six values examined were: dominance-recognition, economic, independence, interesting activity, mastery-achievement, and social. There were seven demographic variables: marital status, age, education, current employment status, career pattern, socioeconomic class, and field of work. A sample of 1,871 women responded to a mailed questionnaire. The respondents tended to have better than average education. Seven specific hypotheses were tested, based on the premise that the demographic situation of the woman will in large part determine her work values. Generally, it was found that all women placed the greatest  emphasis on the mastery-achievement value, and the least emphasis on dominance-recognition. The work values of dominance- recognition, mastery-achievement and economic can probably be predicted through knowledge of a woman's field of work, and the interesting activity value can be predicted through educational attainment and work pattern. The author points out the value of this study for guidance and counseling in the preparation of girls and women for their participation in the labor force. (NG)",

All Ss were then administered abbreviated achievement subtests over the four academic content areas and concurrent physiological (galvanic skin response) measures were obtained. The results of this study are consistent with those found in other similar investigations. Artihmetic appears to produce higher levels of anxiety and arousal than any other single content area.

To study college admission practices, bogus applications for admission were sent, ostensibly from individuals of differing ability levels, and both sexes, with appropriate photographs attached. Sex preferences disappeared only for exceptionally high ability applicants. In a second experiment, female students evaluated eight paintings the identity of which varied according to the sex of the artist and the success of the work, in all combinations. Significant differences were found in perception of the artists' technical competence and future depending on the artists' supposed sex. Bogus job interview requests  by Ph.D. candidates were used in a third study which looked at the effect of sex on employers' responses. Females of less than outstanding ability were found to be at a disadvantage when compared with males of equal ability. It is concluded that women are no less responsible than men for this sex discrimination: they expect prejudicial evaluation of their work by men. (KS)",

These six types are: Realistic, Investigative, Social, Conventional, Enterprising and Artistic. From Holland's theory, a high degree of congruence between personality type and occupational choice is postulated. To examine such congruence and occupational stability rates, the data from Project TALENT is reviewed. The sample consisted of more than 31,000 high school seniors who responded to the followup survey conducted five years after their graduation. The occupational choices obtained at the two points in time were classified into one of the six occupational types, and constituted the data for this study. It was found that only 18.5%  of the males and 26.2% of the females chose the same occupation on both occasions. The higher stability rate for females is accounted for by the 60.3% stability rate of girls planning to be housewives. These and other results are discussed. (SJL)",

On the basis of previous research, it was hypothesized that exposure to mild erotic stimuli would tend to inhibit subsequent aggression, while exposure to more arousing stimuli of this type would facilitate such behavior. In order to examine this hypothesis, male subjects were first angered or treated in a more neutral manner by a confederate of the experimenter, and then provided with an opportunity to aggress against this person by means of electric shock. Before aggressing, participants were exposed to one of five different types of stimuli, nonerotic pictures of furniture, scenery, and abstract art; pictures of semi-nude females;  pictures of nude females; pictures of couples engaged in various acts of love-making; or explicit erotic passages. Results offered support for the major hypothesis. (Author)",

Thirty-one Mexican-American and 31 Anglo-American children were matched on the basis of sex, age, SES, educational placement, and reason referred for psychological assessment. All children were administered the PIAT, Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT), and Wechsler Intelliegnce Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). Partial intercorrelations (CA held constant) among the PIAT subtest raw scores and subtests of the WRAT and WISC-R purporting to measure the same construct were performed. Adequate convergent validity was found for the PIAT Mathematics, General Information, Spelling, and Reading Recognition subtests for both  Anglo and Mexican-American children. Poor discriminant validity was obtained for all PIAT subtests evaluated. It was concluded that the PIAT may be of value when used in conjunction with the WISC-R to differentiate between specific learning difficulties and an English language deficiency with Mexican-American populations.

To determine the value of human relations training for associate degree nursing students was the objective of this report. Sophomore nursing students were exposed to human relations training, growth group or transactional analysis sessions after the administration of a standardized test of empathy, the R A-E. Following the group experiences, they were retested with the same instrument. An analysis of variance was used to determine whether or not human relations training was more effective than other group processes in the development of empathy. The F-ratio was significant at the 0.05 level. T-tests between all means indicated that mean R A-E changes between  Experimental Group A pre to post test were of statistical significance. (Author)",

This report represents an initial step in assembling a profile of the U.T. Austin veteran. Sixty-five (43%) of the 150 surveys mailed out to U.T. veterans were returned. The questionnaire requested information on veterans' characteristics, background and concerns, and whether they felt student services available to them were effective. The findings of the survey were that the veterans: (1) were only slightly older than the average student; (2) were likely to be while, male, and married; (3) did not use student services to any great extent, although it was not possible to determine whether services were  inadequate or whether veterans were functioning well without them; (4) were academically serious and successful, and were very career-minded; (5) were receiving financial resources primarily from veterans' benefits; and (6) were lacking information regarding social services in the community and student services on campus, degree programs, career options, and qualifications for veteran's benefits and/or part-time work. Conclusions were that SRS should be responsible for keeping agencies informed regarding the concerns of veterans, and for planning programs for veterans and their spouses. (Author)",

One questionnaire was completed prior to tutoring and two after tutoring, one being an ananymous evaluation of their tutors' effectiveness. Major findings were: (1) tutor's sense of humor predicted course grade at the .05 significance level; (2) the greater the number of hours the student spent in tutoring, the higher his/her course grade was likely to be; (3) although tutor effectiveness variables alone did not predict student success or failure in their courses, a combination of GPA  and tutor patience, dependability and sense of humor did; and (4) tutoring seemed to be more highly predictive of course grade than overall GPA, indicating the effectiveness of tutoring. The major conclusion was that tutoring helped students to perform at their usual level in particularly troublesome courses, although improvement in a given course was difficult to evaluate.

Student counselors select some aspect of their counseling behavior for modification. The behavior is analyzed, a goal is defined, a strategy is outlined and implemented, and an evaluation is made to determine if the goal has been attained. Strategies for the self-management of counseling behaviors are divided into the categories of self scrutinizing, changing cues, regulating rewards, observing others, and tailoring thoughts. Several benefits are derived when student counselors learn self-management procedures. They go through an intensive review of the counseling process when dealing with their own problems. An opportunity is  provided to personally experience some counseling strategy. An interesting aspect of the project is that it encourages the counseling student to learn about N=1 research designs. Two projects that have been completed are described. In one case, the counselor wanted to ask more open questions and fewer closed questions. The second example deals with making more empathic responses. Graphs are presented which illustrate the results of the projects. (Author)",

The present paper describes four studies of the relationship of sex-typing to sexual socialization and to heterosexual attitudes and behavior. This program of research indicates that persons do differ in their sexual socialization and in their career and family plans as a function of the extent to which they are sex-typed. Investigation of the attitudinal and behavioral differences between sex-typed and andro-gynous persons in the context of heterosexual interaction, however, suggests that although there are some differences in their sexual attitudes and behavior, they do not differ in their responses to persons who engage in cross-sex behavior  (female active, male passive) in bed. On the other hand, large and consistent differences as a function of gender emerged in the studies involving heterosexual interaction. It was concluded that gender is far more potent than extent of sex-typing in influencing heterosexual interaction. (Author)",

This paper examines how differing definitions used to describe running away can produce varying estimates of incidence. Due to these variations, levels of incidence range from a low of .0011% to a high of 24.3%. This paper suggests that the definition employed and the resultant estimates of incidence can affect the public's role in providing programming to meet the basic survival needs of youth who run away.

        "description":"Psychology is again revitalizing efforts to explore the nature and extent of human consciousness. Although consciousness has always been the central subject matter of psychology, various metholodological and ideological &quot;schools&quot; have often quarreled as to exactly what constitutes the appropriate measure of the subject. What is most significant about the resurrection of consciousness as a focal point for psychological inquiry--although for some it was never really dead--is that advances and innovations in scientific methodology and in the philosophy of science as well have brought what once were considered metaphysical, non-empirical and even theological issues within the realm of rigorous scientific investigation. Methodological approaches to consciousness have included both the  empirical-experimental, involving psychobiology, psychopharmacology and biofeedback research and the empirical-experiential, resulting in increasing cohesion in these two seemingly conflictual modes of study. Possibly the most significant issue for the inclusion of consciousness as an acceptable subject matter for scientific psychology is a better understanding of the very nature and process of science itself. Those who claim status as scientists must examine, or re-examine, the philosophy of their own discipline to discover, or rediscover, the workings of scientific methodology and attitudes concerning knowledge itself.

Also, this study as well as others explicitly demonstrate to educators and those of us in the helping professions, such as school counselors and counselor educators, that the most studied group of people in our two hundred years of freedom from England blacks, are still educational achievement laggers when academic achievement is assessed by traditional techniques. Desegregation has been no panacea for the non-White and poor white child in a middle class, Anglo Saxon oriented educational system, the reason being that blacks, other minority groups,and poor whites continually demonstrate a lower level of performance on standardized  tests. To say that the aforementioned groups' scores on such assessment measures are better than they were when segregation was vogue says very little. It is only a manifestation of educational malignant oblivion. Being better off but still not quite as intellectually astute as one's peers does not enhance positive self concepts nor does it facilitate marketability in our competitive world of work. (Author)",

The study notes that in previous research, verbal ability has been found to correlate with sensitivity to order, an important component of intelligence. This relationship may be due largely to the greater word store of high verbal scorers. The author's experimental hypothesis is that clustering scores will not differentiate high and low verbal ability subjects, if one omits items retrieved from the pre-categorical store. Subjects were divided into high and low verbal ability, and were presented with word lists containing words from three semantic categories. Presentation was either pseudo-random or in semantic blocks. A comparison of the pseudo-random and block presentation methods indicated that high verbal ability  subjects did better. An analysis of variance showed, however, an interaction between verbal ability and recall stage, and a post hoc analysis indicated that this was the result of a larger difference in clustering score for high verbal subjects in the first stage of recall. The findings tend to support the notion that high verbal ability leads to a greater &quot;echobox&quot; store where more items can be held verbatim and thus retrieved more readily. (NG)",

The procedures and instruments developed were intended to: (1) provide the consultant with a broad range of information about the school; (2) enable the principal to organize his knowledge of and perceptions about problems in his school; and (3) provide systematic procedures for the principal, staff members and the consultant to obtain a comprehensive picture of the needs and problems of the school.

        "description":"The efficacy of gating in the processing of simple, multidimensional stimuli was investigated. In Experiment 1, a continuous classification task was used, with subjects sorting cards according to binary dimensions of line orientation and location. Results suggested that orientation and location are integral dimensions, facilitation occurring with correlated dimensional combinations and interference with orthogonal combinations. In Experiment 2, discrete reaction time (RT) trials were given, requiring classification of tachistoscopically presented stimuli with large Response-Stimulus intervals (l3 sec). Interference, but not facilitation was found. Analysis of sequential effects revealed no support for the hypothesis that interference is due to the greater frequency of stimulus  change in orthogonal conditions. It is suggested that long RSIs induce a set to process stimuli beyond psychological similarity and to analyze the dimensional structure of integral dimensions. Such dimensional analysis would eliminate facilitation effects, and interference might be due to response competition. (Author)",

A silhouette photograph of each subject provided an objective profile. Fifty-six percent of the subjects were able to correctly classify their own profile and 93% of the subjects agreed with the orthodontic conception of the ideal profile. Of the subjects who misperceived their profiles those in the high self esteem group judged their profiles to be less ideal than they actually were.  Since there were equal percentages of subjects with ideal profiles in each self esteem group, self concept does not appear to be appreciably influenced by objective appearance. Rather, in most cases it seems that a person's perception of his facial profile is determined by his psychological self satisfaction rather than by his objective appearance. (Author)",

Specifically, the data were studied to determine how achievement and probability of success varied over time for each treatment group. The interactions were incorporated into a model allowing symbolic representation to be translated into a useable mathematical form. Thus each dynamic variable in the system can be represented by a differential equation  which, when combined, provide data on the changes of each variable over time. (AJL)",

An epidemiologic follow-up indicated more positive teacher ratings of work habits and fewer absences.

The six peer group categories were hypothesized to be stages in children's peer relations but no clear patterns or emphasis on the types of peer groups were found with age. A correlation of 81 between scores derived from direct observation and those  obtained using the picture test was found, suggesting the possibility of developing the picture test for future research or other purposes in lieu of lengthy direct observation.

Reading is seen to be broader than a skill and more like a repertoire with many abilities, aptitudes, and special accomplishments performing in concert. This repertoire is acquired in four developmental cluster periods where the skills to be learned within a cluster are acquired in a nonlinear fashion. Linearity is important in the period between clusters as the reader struggles to achieve new structures of knowledge. This linearity between clusters supplies guidance and support when the learning challenge is greatest, that is, during the time of breaking out of one developmental period and breaking into another.

An analysis of data suggests that, while there is no significant difference between the correlations between scores for standard and  black English forms of the listening comprehension tasks at either grade level, correlations between scores for standard English, black English standard orthography, and black English nonstandard orthography forms of the oral reading and oral reading comprehension tasks were significantly higher at the fifth-grade level than at the third-grade level.

This paper describes an instructional strategy, intended for use with disabled readers, in which process variables may be distinguished. Instruction involves the identification of the child's learning strengths and weaknesses, the use of success-oriented diagnostic procedures, the selection of curriculum task objectives and attendant criteria for success, the review of appropriate teaching techniques, the development of a cueing system in which the teacher can signal feedback, and the institution of appropriate reinforcement and  feedback schedules. The present concern of this strategy is to recast educational procedures and processes so that data about the educational exchange process can be used both in measures of student progress and in curriculum design.

Responses on 148 questionnaires were analyzed after having been divided into two groups: parents of good readers (those gaining at least l.5 grade levels in total reading during the 1975-1976 school year) and parents of poor readers (those gaining less than l.5 grade levels during the same period). Results showed that parents of good readers are themselves good readers and present good reading models; they are aware of the importance of a wide variety of background  experiences; they read for pleasure, use television selectively, and encourage creativity; and they read to their children before the children entered school. Parents of poor readers tend to view reading mainly as a skills process; they read pragmatic materials and use the public library infrequently. (JM)",

        "description":"The effect of mastery of three prereading skills (letter order, letter orientation, and word detail) on first-grade reading achievement was investigated in a study of 1068 students from 42 randomly selected classrooms; 687 students completed all instruments and could be included in analyses of results. Systematic instruction was given to 16 classrooms for geometric shapes/outline figures and to 11 classrooms for letter/word stimuli; the remaining classrooms served as a control group. Preceding the period of systematic skill instruction, tests of prereading skills and of reading readiness were administered. Immediately following instruction and again 18 weeks later, the test of prereading skills was readministered together with a test of reading achievement. Analyses indicated  significant differences between reading achievement scores of students who began first grade with a mastery of skills and students who did not and between children who attained mastery by November and those who did not. The number of children who changed from nonmastery to mastery was significantly greater in both treatment groups than in the control group. (Author/AA)",

Ten elementary teachers enrolled in an introductory graduate course in diagnostic and remedial reading received eight hours of training in the use of behavior management techniques: establishing baseline data, identifying and using a nonmaterialistic reward system, and rewarding only the appropriate behaviors. Subjects, 28 students who had attended a reading clinic for four weeks and had received 20 hours of instruction, were assigned randomly to experimental and control groups. Control-group teachers instructed their students through the use of games, teacher-made materials, and commercially prepared materials, while  experimental-group teachers, using the same instructional materials, added the use of behavioral reinforcers such as verbal and written praise, student-made graphs, wall charts, reading hardware, and free-choice reading. Data, revealing higher skill attainment for the experimental group, suggest that the remediation of specific skill deficiencies in reading is facilitated through the use of behavior modification techniques.

Subjects, who were financially impoverished and three to four years behind national reading norms, were assigned randomly to the reading program alone or to the reading program supplemented by self-instructional exercises involving map-graph interpretation. On the basis of prior research, it was predicted that a reading program would produce substantial gains in reading-test scores and that these gains would be significantly higher for subjects receiving map-graph instruction. Both hypotheses were supported. Findings showed that the map-trained students made significant gains in reading speed, accuracy, and comprehension.

Participants were asked to report the names of either single letters or trigrams, which were presented tachistoscopically. The trigrams were of varying text frequency and had either one or two syllables. Although letters were perceived more rapidly and more accurately than were trigrams when the interval between stimulus and mask onsets (stimulus onset asynchrony, or SOA) was longer (65 or 125 msec), perception of single letters was no more accurate nor faster than high-frequency monosyllables at  the briefest SOA (50 msec). These data are taken as evidence that frequent syllables can, under some circumstances, be perceived as holistic units. (Author)",

As an alternative approach, a textual cognition model of written communicative competence is proposed and elaborated. Arising out of the Trent Valley Project of the Ontario Institute for the Study of Education, the model is operationalized through an extension of the cloze procedure from reading to writing. The underlying assumptions are that written communicative competence implies that a student's writing will make sense for an intended or relevant audience and that, in turn, the cloze procedure will provide a valid measure of the extent to which  the writing does make sense to that audience. On the basis of preliminary investigations, a taxonomy of impediments to successful written communication is developed for problems at the graphic, syntactic, lexical, and contextual levels. Questions remaining to be answered about the textual cognition model and the associated cloze procedure are listed. (AA)",

Careful examination of standardized, norm-referenced tests and criterion-referenced tests in the areas of reading and writing indicates that, in their present forms, both types fail to meet the requirements of ontological validity. Among currently available measures in language arts, the Multiple-Choice Cloze Test of Literal Comprehension is one of the few which are related to a well-researched construct regarding comprehension. Because of the inextricable links between reading and writing, it is possible that a similar approach may be feasible in the  assessment of writing skills, as well.

Unfortunately, the effect of this message upon undiscerning college students may be immediate and far-reaching in its implication that the speaking and writing of literate English is an elitist and undesirable quality and that to be versed in literature is to wear a red \"A\" on the bosom. In contrast, the novels taught in a college literature course approximate life more nearly than do clod-hero television shows, and a college composition course imparts more practical  knowledge than does Columbo or any other clod hero.

Furthermore, the characters' reactions, customs, and attitudes, as well as their moral and ethical viewpoints, are derived from this ethnic background. Thus, to fully understand and appreciate an ethnic work, the literary analyst must be familiar with the work's ethnic background and should then investigate its faithfulness to its cultural matrix.

Teachers can motivate students to write by presenting the composition process as a language game. The following points should prove helpful in accomplishing this end: no game is as much fun when it is first being learned as it is after it has been mastered; people know whether they have lost in any game; in the early stages of a game, people are allowed to profit from mistakes; and all games have rules which are meant to be followed. Teachers of freshman composition should concern themselves with matters of clarity, organization, and meaning and not with those basic \"rules of the game\" whose mastery is  only a matter of practice.

However, students can gain perspective and wisdom through the study of contemporary literature in a soundly developed set of courses which combines the strengths of the back-to-basics trend and the successful elective programs with a zest for knowledge.

        "description":"This paper reviews three studies designed to assess the impact of gender-related terms. The first study examined 144 male and female undergraduate students' preferences for and performance on tasks using alternatives to the standard English forms, \"his/hers\" and \"him/her.\" The second study attempted to replicate the original study and to prove that the more successful women were in performing the task, the more likely they were to dislike the text used in the varied pronoun conditions. The third study provided a longitudinal investigation to assess the effects of repeated exposure to alternative-gender pronouns. It was concluded from this series of studies that the use of a gender-related pronoun creates a mental image consistent with that pronoun, that the quality and enjoyment  of written materials are not adversely affected by the use of alternative pronouns, that task performance is not hindered by pronoun variation, that positive feedback and negative feedback on tasks do not adversely affect appraisal of alternatives, that the self-esteem of an individual does not affect ratings of materials containing alternatives, and that repeated exposure to alternative pronouns increases the positive ratings of materials in which they are contained.

However, while the booklet's emphasis is definitely on planning, many specific practical tips are interspersed throughout the various chapters. Individual chapters focus in turn on the importance of communication planning, solving problems through communication, organizing a communication campaign, identifying communication objectives, developing systematic communication strategy, using flowcharts to reduce wasted time and effort, budget planning for a communication campaign, and evaluating a communication  campaign.

Cahill decision. The analysis focuses on various aspects of the official reaction to the court's decision, including the definition of the Robinson issue itself, the impact of timing on policy deliberation, the context in which the issue was considered, and the patterns of public participation and the structure of the policy process that shaped the new school program. In each instance, the author appraises the  significance of the court's role in the controversy, based on information from lengthy interviews with 26 members of the New Jersey legislature and 20 people from the State Department of Education. Additional information for the study was gathered through 50 additional interviews with persons from the legislature, the executive branch, the legal system, and interest groups, as well as by examining a large amount of documentary and fiscal material and responses to a series of public opinion polls.

After presenting some crude data on teachers' salaries and current per-pupil spending, the authors present a four-step analysis. First, they specify a model of the labor market for teachers and then derive a formulation for the reduced form wage equation. Second, they estimate the wage equations for teachers from data for the 83 largest U.S. cities and the 48 contiguous states. Third, they use these wage equations to predict the wage differentials for different cities and states that would exist if teacher demand variables were held at their average values for the entire sample, while  teacher supply variables were left free to vary. Finally, they explore the policy implications of their findings and conclude that no ideal way of providing equal educational opportunity exists. (Author/JG)",

Some statutes specifically permit the district to secure insurance for this purpose. Relatively few states, however, require either kind of protection. A few comprehensive mandatory statutes, such as those in Illinois and New Jersey, cover not only financial damages but all other expenses incurred in contesting such claims. Indemnification statutes do not, of course, cover acts of malfeasance or willful neglect of duty, although New Jersey provides for legal expenses in criminal cases where the accused is not convicted, and Florida permits reimbursement in such cases. Massachusetts limits  coverage to actions for negligence but otherwise provides a good mandatory statute. (Author/JG)",

Although Alabama currently has no state legislation providing for bargaining for teachers, the trend nationally, as well as in the state, seems to be toward establishment of bargaining units for public employees. The author interviewed representatives of Alabama organizations that indicated interest in and influence on employer-employee relations in the state. These organizations included business and employer groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, as well as employee groups such as the Alabama Education Association. He also surveyed school district personnel and selected legislators and mayors. The results of the survey indicate that Alabama is not  yet a good nesting place for public employee collective bargaining. Also included is a summary of labor legislation for other states and a brief review of the history of collective bargaining. The author concludes that since some form of professional negotiations for teachers and other public employees is inevitable, the state should take immediate action to prepare for the passage of a collective bargaining law. The author proposes the content of such a law. (Author/DS)",

One-way analysis of variance, the scatterplot, and stepwise multiple regression equations were used for statistical analysis. The following conclusions seem warranted: (1) the variation in the per-capita cost of driver education programs was not  significantly related to the nominated variables in the study and (2) factors that exist outside driver education programs, including assessed valuation and mean expenditure per pupil for the total educational program in the school, appear to influence the per-capita cost of driver education programs.

        "description":"The paper examines four management models that could be adopted for use by teacher supervisors. Specifically, the models discussed deal with communication, the Managerial Grid, planning, and the decision-making/problem-solving process. The communication model examines four interaction approaches: developmental, controlling, relinquishing, and defending. The Managerial Grid looks at the relationship between a concern for people and a concern for production or performance. The planning model examines four planning approaches: purposeful, traditional, entrepreneurial, and crisis. The planning process examines objective setting, problem-solving, decision-making, and programming. The author takes the position that such models help clarify supervisory practice into meaningful  constructs. Further, since the models focus on the tools necessary for effective instructional and rational decision-making, the use of such models in supervision puts into practice those very processes that supervisees are expected to demonstrate in the classroom.

Presented in statistical tables are data on the characteristics of students enrolled in nursery schools through college, including data on students' age, race, sex, marital status, living arrangements, and family income levels. The data reveal that enrollment in elementary schools has decreased by 3.5 million between 1970 and 1975. College attendance may also decline by the 1980s when the smaller birth cohorts reach college age. Increases in the enrollment of blacks and women, as well as graduate school enrollments, are indicated in the data. Fewer college students are currently living with primary family units (either spouses  or parents). Twenty-five detailed statistical tables display the data on which these conclusions are based.

This change has implications for finance that center on the method of finance flow--whether funds come from local school districts' own tax sources, regional taxing, higher levels of government (federal or state), or categorical grants from the state through the local district. Financing models are developed that take into consideration the four sources of funding and relate them to the extent of local district participation, the nature of the services to be provided, incentive features, and the extent of equalization provided. Recommendations are  presented based on a consideration of the four models, a review of regional financing practices in other states, and consultation with Connecticut educators. A three-tier financing system is suggested. (Author/IRT)",

The linkages between educational purposes and educational evaluation are so strong that systematic workers in most areas of educational research or practice start with this almost as the first step in their work. The actual materials of instruction and the observation of teaching-learning situations can be analyzed to determine the appropriate evaluation procedures, and, in turn, the relations between the stated objectives, the learning experiences available to  students, and the evaluation procedures can be determined in great detail. Evaluation instruments serve as models for teaching and learning and, as such, help to guide both instruction and student learning. Mastery learning is one way in which evaluation can be integrated in teaching/learning. Evaluation techniques are also available to measure the effectiveness of interaction and learning in innovative and alternative programs. Increasingly, educational evaluation is seen as a quality control measure. (Author/IRT)",

The author presents six principal usages of the term that are based on the kinds of education offered and their purposes rather than on whether they take place in or out of school. Examples of the six usages are given. Variations in terminology are generally more than purely semantic or technical. Each expression is usually associated with a particular type of effort or educational stance, based (overtly or inadvertently) on certain social, economic, and political as well as educational concepts. Basic education also has civic and developmental meanings. Basic education in its civic sense can be said to be that form of education that in any given country can meet at least minimum learning needs and can also be made universal.  Developmental meanings of basic education overlap with civic meanings, but place more emphasis on its contribution to vocational needs and personal development linked with daily activities.

        "description":"This paper proceeds from the premise that, if inspection is to be useful to the teachers, the school, and educational authorities, certain basic conditions regarding the nature and quality of education and of the organization, staffing, and functions of the inspectorate need to be fulfilled. The paper, therefore, begins with an examination of first-level education. It seeks to identify in a number of respects the elements of a complete system of first-level education that have still to be established or improved and that form the basis for the activities of the inspectorate. In the second part of the paper, the organization of the inspectorate at the national level and the succession of structural changes that have influenced the scope and content of its work are examined. Also  examined are the functions of the inspector and the various types of inspecting assistants at the regional, zonal, and district levels in urban and rural areas. The matters of staffing and training in relation to needs for inspecting personnel are also considered and certain conclusions are reached. (Author/IRT)",

Its starting point is an examination of the strong interrelationship between the country's educational policy and its social and economic objectives. How the educational policy has been implemented, how the various levels and types of education have developed, and what the trends of expenditure and costs have been are presented. An attempt is made to see how the educational system might evolve on the basis of its own dynamic, on the basis of changes being contemplated at present, and on the basis of the government's long-term objectives. Finally, the effect of this development on costs and expenditures is assessed. At present all educational expenditures are financed by the central budget. The increase in  educational expenditures will, therefore, depend largely on the trends of public revenue and on the allocation of public resources to the various functions of the state.

Conditions that make it possible for inspection to achieve valuable results are discussed. In the second section, these preconditions are related to some common features of the state of primary education in the six countries in order to identify some of the main development problems to be found in them and the implications of these problems for inspection; namely that there are certain minimum preconditions for inspection to be effective. The third section analyzes the  results of the study of the organization and functions of primary school inspection. Finally, the report presents some conclusions and recommendations, it being clearly understood that there is no model or ideal situation regarding inspection activities against which the situation in each country can be compared.

The feasibility and implementation studies investigated the community's attitudes toward a voucher plan, specified the kind of plan most appropriate for East Hartford, examined student transportation systems, and distributed information to parents about the plan. Even though the board of education finally failed to approve the project, the East Hartford school system was provided with improved budgeting, transportation, and student management systems as a result of the feasibility  and implementation studies. Volume I of this document provides a general overview of the study, and Volume II presents the organizational and technical systems developed for the implementation of a voucher system. (Author/DS)",

The researchers surveyed 3,271 high schools accredited by the North Central Association, including both public and private schools. School administrators were questioned about the history in their schools of 33 educational innovations relating to curriculum, technology, and organization. The majority of the schools responding to the questionnaires were larger, moderately to well financed, public schools located mainly in communities other than small towns or rural areas. The innovation adoption average for these schools was 9.7, while abandonment averaged .76. The innovations most frequently abandoned were those that were complex,  expensive, and difficult to administer, such as flexible scheduling, programmed instruction, and team teaching. The innovations most frequently retained were simpler, less expensive, and easier to administer, such as simulation and gaming, independent study, and ethnic studies. When abandonment did occur, it usually came primarily as a result of factors within the schools related to personnel (specifically, teacher resistance) and pupil outcomes. Statistical tables contain data on each of the 33 innovations, as well as data concerning school characteristics. (Author/DS)",

This framework permits the analysis of two types of innovation.

The first phase, parent notification, involved the following steps: (1) a phone call on the third consecutive day of unexcused absence, (2) a letter on the fifth consecutive day, (3) a letter on the tenth day of consecutive absence requesting a conference, and (4) a home visit after twelve to fifteen days of continued absence. The second phase became operable on the students' return to school. Counselors  contacted the returning pupils and appropriate adjustments were made, including such measures as class changes, program changes, school transfer, psychological testing, and medical referral. In the elementary schools the first step of the intervention system was so successful that the other three steps were obviated. In the secondary schools the four step intervention program materially reduced nonillness absence. (MLF)",

A professional training program or other learning situation utilizing competencies that ignore the question of judgment is insufficient. One must be concerned with whether the use of certain tools (whose use is defined by a competency) will be wise or intelligent.

The primary goal of the project is to determine the specific skills and related competencies needed by administrators of community education programs. Sixty-eight Arizona administrators, including community school directors, school district superintendents, building principals, and district community education coordinators, are participating in the assessment project, which will be completed in the late spring, 1977. The final results should indicate which skills and competencies are given high or low priority in ideal terms, as well as which ones in practice are considered important or unimportant. The results should be of use in  program evaluation, certification, and preservice and inservice training. This article also lists the elements and components of a fully implemented community education program. (Author/DS)",

He asserts that field experience can provide invaluable material for enrichment of any training program for educational administrators.

A second group of products makes judgments about what is of value and what is not. A third group interprets for school practitioners the implications of research findings for the operation of the schools. The products that compact the literature are primarily variations on the bibliographic format. The evaluative products are primarily state-of-the-art papers produced by experts commissioned by the Clearinghouse. The interpretive products usually both analyze and synthesize the literature. A good example of this group is the School Leadership Digest, a series of monthly reports that provide interpretive summaries of the research knowledge. (Author/IRT)",

This planning game is predicated on the assumption that resources for education are limited and that, therefore, there must be a mechanism for determining school system priorities. Players are divided into five constituency groups (students, teachers, board members, administrative staff, and the community). They are distributed in these groups so that they may play roles different from their real life ones. The game is divided into three rounds, during which educational needs and objectives, as well as corresponding process needs and goals (intended to achieve the educational objectives) are  negotiated and prioritized. The participants may bargain and attempt to persuade other groups to support their chosen goals. The final result is a list of matched and ranked products and processes. This list then becomes the school system's developmental blueprint for the coming year. (Author/DS)",

Being more complex both in program and design, the community schools have created complex patterns in use that were not anticipated. This research was commissioned to determine what has been happening in these newly conceived spaces and to recommend ways to design more usable open space areas. In this report &quot;open space&quot; is taken to include all outdoor areas: playgrounds, parking lots, entranceways, totlots, circulation areas, and miscellaneous left-over corners. A scenario provides a composite picture of a day at a hypothetical school. Ten functions that open spaces perform are identified and described in terms of  activities they support. Then follows an analysis of the ways in which each of the community school open spaces creates the opportunities for these activities. Patterns emerge in the way open space opportunities are created and these patterns form the basis for recommendations that suggest how to support or discourage each of the ten open space functions. Several recommendations are put forth to reduce the problems at schools that must be sited next to parks. (Author/MLF)",

Five general questions provide the framework for reporting the findings--(1) Is the &quot;quality&quot; of a neighborhood changed by school closure? (2) Are residents less satisfied with their neighborhood and schools after  school closure? (3) Does school closure affect the quality of education available to students in the closure neighborhood?

It is explained that the instructional program can be used in individual tutoring or small group settings, can usually be completed in 20 to 25 weeks, includes techniques borrowed from the education of deaf or aphasic children, and is appropriate for use by parents or non specialist teachers. Outlined are the developmental sequences of normal child development in the motor, sensory-perceptual, and language-conceptual areas. Recommended for the identification of children with interrupted development are procedures such as a checklist of  student characteristics, and a battery of tests in the areas of motor perception, auditory perception, visual perception, and language. Stressed for training the auditorially handicapped child is teaching language related to the calendar to develop time concepts. Among suggested activities for perceptual training are identifying body parts (motor), identifying location of sounds (auditory perception), and reproducing figures (visual perception). Also provided are activities for the development of receptive, expressive, visual receptive, and visual expressive language including a phonic multisensory reading method. Given for each lesson plan are activities in areas such as color, form, perceptual-motor development, auditory perception, phonics, language, number, writing, and  classification.

It is explained that the Comprehensive Support Services Program focuses on early identification of students with special needs, detailed evaluation of learning needs, and intervention through direct student support and teacher consultation. The role of the support team, led by a learning specialist, is seen to involve maintaining students in the regular classroom by adapting the curriculum and providing teachers with practical help. Analyzed are data from the Peabody Individual Achievement Test subtests of math, word recognition, and comprehension administered to 824 students  in the Fall of 1974 and readministered 5 months later. Discussed among findings is the highly significant improvement in achievement scores for Ss receiving services from the Comprehensive Support Services Program. It is also reported that gains were significantly higher than the expected scores computed with a historical regression formula. Four appendixes are provided, including a list of kindergarten screening tests and a sample pupil personnel referral form. (CL)",

The second study reports on an adaptation of the Aural Study System and describes results of two field trials with 25 legally blind Ss. The third study focuses on an investigation of the relative accuracy and time requirements for 48 legally blind students on six written indexes which accompany the aural reference system. Reported are  findings of a fourth experiment which indicate that 24 legally blind Ss used a cassette adaptation of the system with accuracy and within time limits, but that the system required further refinements to improve its reliability. A comparison of accuracy and time for recorded dictionary materials and more familiar braille or large type materials is reported in the fifth study involving 16 legally blind sixth and seventh graders. The sixth study describes a consumer review of the cassette dictionary in which 80% of the Ss (10 mature blind consumers, 10 teachers of secondary level blind students, and 10 librarians at residential schools for the blind) stated that they preferred a written dictionary to a recorded one.

Study I is explained to have compared five tonal index codes in order to identify a code that required minimal display time, that had easily discriminable characters, and that could be easily learned. Results are seen to indicate that the code with variations in duration surpassed all others in ease of learning. Study II reports on an experiment in which 21 legally blind Ss in grades 7-12 who, after receiving two hours training in this code, learned to find indexed parts of a textbook in an average time of 2 minutes and with 92% accuracy. Described in Study III is a comparison of three vocal index systems used by 24 legally blind Ss in grades  7-12. The three systems are said to include recording index information on the same track as text content, use of four-track systems to provide index information, and use of the Zimdex (number) system. Accuracy of use and location times for all three systems are reported to have met standards for practical use. Among general conclusions of the studies cited is that the system with vocal information recorded on the same track as the content appears superior. (Author/CL)",

The second study is reported to show that a frame of reference with specific instructions on how to search the display facilitated the performance of Ss in the lower grades, but interfered with or had no effect on Ss in the upper grades (total N=72). Described in the third study is the lack of effect of a frame of reference on the performance of 79 Ss who were asked to locate shapes on a tactile political pseudomap. Students in lower grades are reported in the fourth  study to have benefited most from training in scanning a tactile display. The effects on map reading of training 92 blind students to use a distinctive features analysis strategy and line tracing are cited in the fifth study, while the sixth deals with the effects of noise on the location by 72 Ss of point symbols on a tactile pseudomap.

Ss in settings classified as full integration, integration with itinerant help, partial integration, and partial segregation were given tests of hearing threshold, aural and oral functioning, intelligence, achievement, self concept, and speech intelligibility. Teachers were asked to provide data in six areas, including the student's social adjustment in school and the teacher's knowledge of hearing impairment, and parents were interviewed about such aspects as the child's hearing aid use at home. Ss in different programs were found to differ in terms of hearing level; there was a general decrease in hearing level from  settings of more to less integration. Among other findings were that regular teachers who were in contact with an itinerant teacher knew more about hearing problems than those who were not; that Ss who were fully integrated has higher reading, language, and speech intelligibility scores than elementary segregated or secondary partially integrated Ss; that fully integrated Ss at the elementary level were better adjusted than Ss in itinerant-integration settings, while the self concept of itinerant-integrated and fully integrated secondary Ss declined the longer they were integrated. A comparison of successful and unsuccessful Ss was used to develop guidelines for integrating into regular classroom students with moderate and severe hearing losses. (CL)",

A fourth questionnaire, requesting the views of 149 Head Teachers of primary schools on the educational needs of children in the top 1% to 2% of intellectual ability, was distributed. The major result found was that for many of the comparisons, the levels of attainment of the control group and the low IQ  subgroup, relative to their measured ability, were greater than those recorded for the gifted groups. The questionnaires completed for the sample students showed greater variations in levels of attainment and in width of interests for the gifted as compared with the control group. The teachers originally nominated 15% of the gifted sample as controls and classified only 27% as having an attainment level of 1 year or more above the class average. The majority view of 80% of the separate group of Head Teachers was that gifted children had special needs which could be catered for in primary schools. Teacher and parent nomination produced a biased sample of gifted children, which might be avoided by a random selection and group test screening of all students. (Author/SBH)",

The problems have included trying to agree upon a definition of LD, identifying interdisciplinary variations for similar symptoms, and conjointly interfacing services. The vague LD syndrome has survived because of its popularity with educators, physicians, and psychologists. As a diagnosis and assessment, LD has promoted confusion for those professionals who must deal with the problem and for the child referred as LD. Even if LD could be proved to exist in a few children, such a procedure would remain an exercise in futility since it would not  bring forth any specific changes in educational programming or therapy to enhance the level of functioning and development within the child.

Federal guidelines specified that these projects should include the following components: developmental program planning, operation, and evaluation; demonstration of diagnostic/prescriptive services to children; coordination with other agencies; Advisory Council participation; parent involvement; replication; and dissemination. Determined in this study were the effectiveness of individual centers in reaching self-set, program-relevant goals and the extent to which the major program components have been addressed across the Learning Disabilities Program. Among  findings were that there was little uniformity in the 17 centers; that the two or three prime objectives differed in that 12 of the centers emphasized development of effective procedures for identifying and meeting the needs of LD children, 11 emphasized training of teachers in the use of model techniques, and 10 emphasized the dissemination of information about the nature of the CSDC program; that varying numbers and types of tests were being used; and that parents were not highly involved in the center activities. Recommendations included the development of consensus criteria to guide CSDCs in the choice of tests and interpretation of results; the revision of the federal definition of LD; and the review of requirements for parent involvement, Advisory Council participation,  dissemination, and replication.

A time coding instrument was used, with behavior expressed as relative frequencies of a hierarchy of four mutually exclusive, exhaustive categories of behavior--relevent, unproductive, disruptive, and aggressive. Teacher training studies suggested stability in the rank order of categories across various special and elementary education settings, with mean relative frequencies of 67% relevant, 25% unproductive, less than 10% disruptive, and less than 1% aggressive. The instrument demonstrated that the classification definitions were commonly understood, that inter-rater reliability was high, that it was sensitive to behavior  chanqes based on chanqing classroom conditions, and that there was broad applicability to various classroom structures.

An introductory section covers a review of the literature, results of a pilot study involving nine multiply handicapped blind children (4-11 years old), and an overview of the project. Explained are the steps taken in developing the revised Peabody Mobility Scale which provides information on six basic orientation and mobility skills: sighted guide, seating, trailing, turning and maintaining orientation, utilization of discriminable landmarks, and  environmental travel. It is noted that the programed instructional system was developed to correspond to the Peabody scale in the same four components--motor development, sensory skills, concept development, and orientation and mobility skills. Described in detail are the steps involved in implementing the field test study in terms of site and subject selection (23 facilities and a total of 42 Ss, 5-13 years old), materials, assessment and intervention procedures, results, and discussion of the results. The results of the field test study are reported as suggesting that the Peabody Mobility Project resulted in an effective instructional product which had fulfilled the project's principal goal. The bulk of the document consists of appendixes which include raw statistical data, sample  profiles, excerpts from the scale and instructional materials, and sample teacher evaluation forms. (SBH)",

A socio-ecological model of the development of adaptive functioning is presented which focuses on the structure of the conditions in which developmental processes emerge and the developmental issues confronting individuals under varying conditions. The various systems with which a young child must adaptively interact are addressed from a systems theoretical perspective. The systems seen to be of most concern are the primary system (family) and adjunct systems (school, peer groups, clinics, etc.). Aspects of accessing and transitions between and among systems are  explored. The negotiation of developmental issues of critical importance to the young child and interactive systems are highlighted. Mediation, from a number of different perspectives, is presented. From a research framework, particular attention is paid to the compromising conditions of: mental retardation; visual impairments; speech, language, and hearing impairments; affective impairments; and learning disabilities. Implications for future research are briefly discussed. Also provided is an annotated bibliography of adaptive behavior and functioning from a socio-ecological perspective. (Author/SBH)",

A programming language specifies in its description a number of primitive operations which the computer knows how to perform. An algorithm is the set of instructions which constitutes a description of the method by which the task can be performed. This algorithm must be written in the programming language which the computer can deal with. The constructs (elements of LISP) that work in algorithms are described and an example task provided. LISP is a functional language, in that its instructions consist of directives to apply some function to some argument. Part 1 of the course concludes with a  description of some of LISP's functions, and Part 2 deals with its symbol manipulation functions, specifically in manipulating LISP constructs known as lists. Part 3 gives instruction in writing inherently recursive functions non-recursively. Practice exercises follow each section of the course. (CLK)",

        "description":"Bilingual education is not entirely a new idea. In the 18th and 19th centuries it was practiced in church schools, particularly in German and Spanish. Most communities, however, assumed a strongly assimilationist stance for their public schools, especially after World War I. In recent years, however, this attitude has been partly reversed under the impact of the concept of cultural pluralism and a growing ethnic awareness. The greatest impetus to bilingual education was given by the Bilingual Education Act of 1968. That law defined this area of teaching as the \"use of two languages as mediums of instruction.\" Its design may be transitional, maintenance, restorationist, or culturally pluralistic. The last is exemplified by Miami's Coral Way School in which Spanish-speaking Cuban  refugee children effectively learned English and their English-speaking peers learned Spanish. This school's success, the funding provided by the Bilingual Education Act mentioned above, and favorable court decisions help explain the movement's rapid progress in the recent past. Research on the subject has led to several definitive conclusions, but they are relatively few in number. The future of this area of education will be determined by its success in actual practice and in the ebb and flow of social and political influences. (Author)",

In this paper, the egalitarian surnaming system (ESS) is proposed. This system deals equally with the sexes and also serves important social functions, such as providing a basis of family identity for the nuclear group (same surnames for mother, father, and children) and for identifying a line over generations (same surnames for grandparents and grandchildren, for example). According to ESS, both the wife and the husband retain their before-marriage surnames but add the surname of the spouse just prior to it. Female children are given the dual surname of the mother, and the male children the dual surname of  the father. When the children marry, they replace the first of their two surnames with the final surnames of their spouses. (Author/CLK)",

The Panel of Examiners included Eleanor Jorden in Japanese and Jim Gair in Hindi  from Cornell University, Edna Coffin in Hebrew from the University of Michigan, and Walter Lagerway in Dutch from Calvin College. The Panel of Program Directors presented case studies of how self-instructional language programs had been administered at three colleges: The University of Tennessee, Skidmore College and Warren Wilson College. The Learning Center session projected conceptually what a Learning Center is and how a self-instructional language program fits snugly into its operation.

Various possible models of organization are presented as aids to administrators contemplating establishing such a course. Suggested basic linguistic cultural content is presented for the exploration of French, German, and Spanish. The guide stresses the  reinforcement of English skills through the study of prefixes, suffixes, roots, cognates, and borrowed words coming from a variety of languages, including Latin and Greek. The course attempts to combine the &quot;general language&quot; approach with the teaching of expressions from specific languages. The development of language and language families is stressed.

Chapter 4 gives a brief legislative history of the programs which have provided training for the limited-English-speaking populations. Chapter 5 consists of a brief literature review. A list of bilingual vocational training programs funded since June of 1976 is given in the appendix, as well as statistical information concerning the number and distribution of such programs by state and vocational offerings.

        "description":"One major view concerning what an orthography should be conforms to Pike's idea that a practical orthography should be phonemic, that is, that there should be a one-to-one correspondence between each phoneme and the symbolization of that phoneme. An alternative view, that of Chomsky and Halle, proposes that the fundamental principle of orthography is that phonetic variation is not indicated where such variation is predictable by a general rule. This paper points out contradictions in both of these views and states that the claims about what an orthography should be need to be carefully formulated and tested. Possibilities for research are outlined in terms of: (1) the linguistic study of orthography, and (2) linguistics and learning to read and write. The former would include  identifying the varieties of an existing orthography, formulating constraints on orthography, and formulating relevant rules. The latter would entail cooperation between linguists, educators, and psychologists in examing such factors as poor teaching, preparedness to learn reading and writing, and the efficiency with which individuals handle orthographic systems.

Problems in interpreting test results in areas of primary or oral language and in the secondary language skills of reading and writing are examined, with particular reference to aboriginal children learning English as a second language. Ethnocentric attitudes on the part of the teacher are opposed to the need for increased understanding of the characteristics of learners, children in general, particular cultural groups, and individual children. Consideration is given to recognition of developmental patterns observed among children and accomodation  of such sequences in planning programs by teachers and linguists. Finally, some examples of an organic interaction model of teaching-learning in operation are provided. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This position paper gives the results of informal surveys carried out by the Bilingual-Bicultural Task Force of the California State Department of Education. Only 60 to 65% of the teachers in the state bilingual programs are judged bilingual and 50% bilingual-biliterate. Almost all of the teacher aides are judged bilingual, and a large percentage are judged bilingual and biliterate. There is, therefore, a critical shortage of qualified bilingual/cross-cultural classroom teachers for bilingual programs. Another area that shows a need for qualified teachers is the area of &quot;Special Instruction.&quot; In accordance with the Supreme Court decision in the Lau v. Nichols case, California public schools must give special English instruction to 188,159 limited-English and non-English speaking  public school pupils. Thus, there is an immediate need for several thousand qualified bilingual teachers to give this special instruction. Appendix I gives the text of the Supreme Court's Lau decision. Appendix II gives the number of non-English-speaking pupils in California public schools by grade (kindergarten through 12) and primary language for 1972-73. Appendix III presents a summary of selected public-school pupil data by racial and ethnic groups, as of fall 1973. Appendix IV gives, by language, the total number of limited- and non-English-speaking pupils in California public schools in 1972-73, for Spanish and Asian language groups. Appendix V gives the statewide total of classroom teachers, 1967-73, by racial and ethnic groups. (CFM)",

Rhythm, for example, a suprasegmental event, appears to be present at birth or prior to birth. The relationship of physiology to communication is evident in the observations of extra-linguistic aspects of communication, such as movement, the use of the body in space, intense sound, and voice fluctuations. Discoveries regarding the relationship between the brain and language should lead to inquiries regarding the brain and nonverbal behavior as well. It is possible that the origin of nonverbal behavior is in the right hemisphere of the brain, as the origin of language apparently is in the left hemisphere of the brain. Finally, evidence has shown that the cognitive and  cognitive-emotive development of an infant begin much earlier than speech development. Attention to these findings should lead to a new approach to the study of the acquisition of language. (Author/AM)",

It shows the place of the Year Abroad in Modern Languages Degrees, and the need for training of English Language Assistants. After detailing the preparatory arrangements and timetable of a fieldwork visit to French schools to observe and record Assistants at work, the report outlines how the audio-visual material collected was used in developing a training course for Aberdeen students due to become Assistants in October 1976. Of particular interest is an academic game called LAG, designed to help the assistants master the skill of explaining. A discussion of the results of the evaluation of the course and of the training materials and methods developed is followed, in conclusion, by  an outline of the follow-up study planned for 1976-77. Finally, it is argued that the results of this work show that flexible local training courses can usefully be mounted around a resources bank of short self-instructional mini-courses making use of a variety of media and source material (hand-outs, books, audio-tapes, tape-slide programs, etc.) that students can use in their own time. In addition to a discussion of how recordings of live classes were used in the Aberdeen training program, the report also shows how to apply micro-teaching methods to teaching some of the skills identified as being needed by the practicing Assistant.

Educational outcomes providing indices of schools' success in educating minority students include school holding power, reading skills, grade repetition, overageness, and participation in extracurricular activities. A major factor in under-achievement is the lack of teachers drawn from the  same minority and/or cultural groups as the students, along with a shortage of minority personnel being prepared to teach. Charts provide statistics on all outcomes. The report recommends that the Commission announce the need for credentialing and identify the standards for credentialing, and that the Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Education Committee identify the types of credentials required, investigate the possibility of creating \"career ladder\" opportunities to make qualified personnel available immediately, and investigate the requirements for re-training existing certificated personnel in bilingual/cross-cultural education.

Programs fall into three types, based on their trainees' current employment situation: unemployed and without a job site; unemployed but with a job site and verbal commitment to hire if performance during training is satisfactory; and underemployed seeking a change or promotion. To meet the needs of trainees in the three areas, the content objectives of a vocational ESL curriculum are divided into three distinct chronological units: Getting a Job, Holding a Job and Moving Ahead. Within each of the three curriculum units, there are three major divisions: general objectives, language objectives, and contextual areas. The general objectives  provide an overview of the unit in terms of the long-term goal to be achieved, the cultural learning to take place, and the level of language sophistication to be attained. The language objectives are divided into five major areas: listening, oral production, reading, writing, and body language. The contextual areas are divided into specific performance objectives necessary to achieve the long-term goal. In the back of this volume there is an appendix of resource materials useful for teachers in vocational ESL. (Author/CFM)",

General degree students achieve a fair command of English and a broad knowledge of the main periods and trends of English literature. Special courses are offered which lead to Honors in English. Honors students go through a fairly exacting course and achieve a fairly thorough understanding of English literature. Both mother-tongue literatures, Sinhala and Tamil, are taught in schools. Many translations of French,  German, and Russian works are available. (Author/CFM)",

Among the educated Nepalese, English has for a number of years been almost a second language. Its chief uses are as a medium of instruction in certain subjects at degree level, as the principal language for the growing tourist industry and as the medium of communication between Nepalese and all foreign agencies. English is not taught at primary level (Grades 1-3) but it is compulsory through both stages of secondary education (grades 4-10), where it is allocated five periods per week, and for the greater part of the first two stages of tertiary education (Certificate and Diploma). English is compulsory for at least six semesters at the university level. A good deal of teaching at the degree  level is in English. There is a great shortage of English teachers at all levels. Little progress has been made in reducing the great proportion of untrained teachers. The British Council is concentrating its efforts on the training of teachers, the integration of prescribed classroom materials into training courses and the general improvement of the materials themselves. English literature is not taught in the schools, as it is considered irrelevant for the mass of the population. (Author/CFM)",

In the anglophone provinces English is the medium of instruction in primary and secondary schools and teacher training colleges. In the francophone provinces, English is taught as a subject in secondary schools and a beginning has been made to introduce English into the primary schools. In the government schools and better private schools it is taught five hours per week in the first two years and three hours per week in the remaining five years. There is a great  difference between the public and private sectors in the quality and quantity of teachers. In the main the supply meets the demand in government schools, but in many private schools there are grave shortages. The British Council is involved in the teaching of English in two main ways: (1) as the recruiting agency and administrative support for certain personnel; and (2) in giving advice and assistance where possible.

As a legacy of British rule, officially all instruction is in English, but a great deal is carried on in Urdu or provincial languages. Attachment to English language and literature is still strong among the educated elite. This contrasts with the attitudes of some sections of the middle and professional classes who resent the use of English and the continuing British legacy. Within the educational system, English literature is strongly entrenched and only little progress has been made towards more practical and realistic English language teaching. If English is to survive in Pakistan, other than as the language of the elite, it is essential that the standards of English teaching in the  schools be raised by the training of more and better English language teachers. In Urdu-medium schools English is taught as a compulsory subject from classes 6 to 8 in the middle/ junior schools (age 11-14) and as an elective in the secondary schools (age 14-16). In the English-medium schools English is taught from class 1 (age 6). English is compulsory in all higher secondary schools, intermediate colleges, and degree-granting colleges and universities.

The bodies active in this are the Section of Adult Education of the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Absorption, and the Jewish Agency for Israel. Other contributors include radio, television, newspapers, universities, the army and the police. Israeli institutions also assist the teaching of Hebrew outside Israel, within Jewish communities abroad, through the Jewish Agency, which provides training and teachers. One problem facing the learner of Hebrew is the &quot;nikund&quot; or system of diacritics indicating vowels and certain distinctive features of consonants. None of the slightly  different simplified systems for second-language learners has been approved by the Language Academy. Another problem is the difference between spoken and written styles. The Academy for the Hebrew Language, the body officially entrusted with internal language planning, is concerned with, among other areas: (1) spelling and grammar standardization; (2) vocabulary enlargement and standardization; and (3) maintenance of correct Hebrew in public media.

Insofar as native speakers of English are concerned, the language of women in America has four sets of components: those shared with the language of men in America; those shared, in varying proportions, with other women living in patriarchies; those shared with other political minorities; and those which appear to be peculiar to American women. Such a model has two weaknesses: it is incomplete in that it omits consideration of language used by all people when talking about women; further it is uncritically derivative in that it implies that women's language is deviant. The present challenge is to seek a model for the study of women's language which is complete, that is, takes  account of both the language used by women and the language used about women, and which is not uncritically derivative.

        "description":"This paper outlines research done in the context of a pre-sessional language course for foreign students going on to postgraduate studies in various disciplines and universities in the United Kingdom. The role of the social component of language and the students' need for social language are emphasized. Social language is defined as language used either to establish or confirm interpersonal relationships, or to perform other functions dependent for their successful realization on the establishing or maintaining of such relationships. Three elements of the interaction situation are significant: the settings in which foreign students come into contact with English speakers, the topics discussed, and the language functions that students might want to use. The content of  function-based and setting-based learning programs is described. As there exists a need for leveling within a language course in order to deal with the heterogeneity of skills, three criteria for deciding what should be taught are defined: the student's previous knowledge, grammatical complexity of a particular item, and ideational content. Practice materials are designed with the purpose of: (1) developing student awareness of language functions and factors involved in communication, (2) practicing single aspects of communication, and (3) eliciting interactions in conditions related to those encountered outside the classroom. The work reported here resulted in the production of a set of experimental teaching materials. Sample exercises from these materials are provided in the appendix.  (CLK)",

It is claimed that speech production in children and adults, in normal and deviant speakers, and in a variety of languages, can all be described according to the same universal phonological rules which constitute the universal process of grammar optimalization, that is, the process of working toward the replication of some standard adult model. For diverse reasons, the linguistically deviant fail to optimalize their grammars. It is concluded that the phonological rules of language acquisition are universal and finite in number, that these same rules are found in deviant language acquisition, that they are also found in adult dissolution of language facility, and that they are  the motivation for the diachronic phenomena studied by historical linguists since the time of Rask, Grimm, Bopp, Pott, and Schleicher.

        "description":"This paper discusses the conflict occurring as a result of two languages and their corresponding cultural bases coming into contact in North America, particularly in the context of bilingual education. Difficulty exists in translating awareness of problems such as language interference, cultural shock, and lowered self-image into attitudinal approaches and instructional strategies. It is felt that the current definition of bilingual education does not consider how children learn and what language they think in. What most teachers identify as linguistic and cultural dysfunction in minority students is seen as cognitive and learning dysfunction in students, and teaching and affective dysfunction in teachers. A better definition of bilingual education would stress languages as tools  for thinking, learning, and achieving rather than as mere means of instruction. It is suggested that degrees of bilingualism could be defined, and that bilingual education programs could be established in terms of levels of attainment of the individual learner. Areas that need research to improve bilingual education include cognitive and language development and verbal instruction. Research could determine which skills are best taught through language instruction, and which through other subjects, which skills require language mastery, and what the basis of a curriculum and the criteria of achievement should be.

        "description":"This paper examines the differences between second language learning and pidginization to better understand the mechanisms involved in each process. Current research suggests similarities between the two. Both are characterized by reduction and simplification. Grammatical transformations tend to be eliminated, along with inflectional markers of tense and plurality. Articles and gender/case distinctions are usually omitted, as well as the copula. Both are characterized by an extremely reduced lexicon and a simplified phonological system. Generally, they represent an attempt by speakers of a \"source\" language to approximate the rules and usage of a \"target\" language. Based on data obtained from a number of pidgin and creole languages, a theory viewing a pidgin language as merely a  simplified form of a superstrate target language, or as the result of incomplete learning of a second language, is rejected. Due primarily to the extreme social conditions under which pidginization takes place and the resulting limited linguistic contact between native and target language groups, the formation of a pidgin language undergoes processes of development which are independent of the target language and which do not represent attempts to approximate the rules and usage of the target language.

        "description":"This position paper states that it is the responsibility of Pennsylvania's Department of Education to make foreign language (FL) study part of the core curriculum and to develop well-articulated programs that make mastery of a foreign language possible for every student, in order to prepare him to meet the challenge of today's complex society. In summarizing the value of FL study for today's student, the following recommendations are made: (1) FL study is best begun in elementary grades, via audiolingual methods; (2) English as a Second Language should be included in the curriculum for non-English-speaking children; (3) bilingual education should be included in the curriculum where one language or dialect group is sufficiently represented; and (4) non-Western as well as Western  languages should be considered for inclusion. The second part of the paper presents a continuum and evaluative criteria intended to help school districts plan, implement, and evaluate their FL programs, from Kindergarten through Grade 12. (AM)",

        "description":"This paper outlines the syntactic structures which represent a stage in the cognitive development of children, and focusses on an aspect of cognitive development known as conservation. The cognitive components of conservation are presented as the primordial base for the set of syntactic structures which map or mirror them. Piaget proposed four periods or levels of cognitive development; during the third period, that of concrete operations, a child learns to use logical processes to solve concrete problems. Some of these problems have to do with conservation. The ability to conserve requires that the child realize that the amount or quantity of substance or matter stays the same even though its shape or position is changed. These problems include the conservation of number, mass,  and volume. The ability to conserve presupposes a mastery of subsets of cognitive structures such as reversibility and seriation. Each of these cognitive structures is represented by some primary syntactic form. Conservation in its cognitive and linguistic sense is the effective interaction of these composite structures.

        "description":"In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to teachers' classroom language as a variable in the formal learning process. The language used in class by teachers assumes additional importance in formal second language learning situations, where the target language as used by the teacher is not only the means for conveying content, but also a product of the underlying linguistic system to be acquired by the learners. The present paper reports on research which attempted to determine whether foreign language teachers' classroom speech is syntactically different from their speech among linguistic peers. The syntax of samples of the classroom language of eight TESOL teacher-trainees teaching adult English as a second language (ESL) courses was analyzed. Six measures of  syntactic complexity were used. The subjects' classroom language was compared with samples of their speech among peers. In addition, the effect on syntactic complexity of two variables--the level of the classes and the times during the ten-week courses at which samples were collected--was examined. The data as measured by all six dependent variables indicate a process of syntactic simplification in the classroom language. Results suggest further that the degree of syntactic complexity was relatively stable over the ten-week period and that the syntactic complexity of the classroom speech varied as a function of the degree of proficiency the students were assumed to have. Implications of the findings for the formal second language learning process are discussed. (Author/AM)",

Evidence that the language which adults use in addressing young children is different from that used in addressing adults and that parent-child interaction patterns change with the increasing age and language skills of the child has important implications for the study of first language acquisition. The present study examined the syntactic dimensions of the classroom language of eight teachers of adult ESL classes. The classroom language samples were compared with samples of the same subjects' speech with each other. Six measures of syntactic complexity were used. Results indicate that in the same way that adults adjust their normal speech when addressing young children, the subjects under study are  sensitive and responsive to the perceived linguistic abilities of their students. Many of the strategies and devices used by adults in dealing with children in language interactions are also used for communicative and/or pedagogical purposes in the ESL classroom. Thus, in terms of the nature of the linguistic input to which learners are exposed, further support is lent to the hypothesis that second language learning proceeds in a way largely similar to that in which a first language is acquired.

        "description":"The question of teaching a standard dialect to Chicano students who are studying abroad has implications for teaching any standard versus nonstandard dialect. The University of Colorado has a program at the Universidad Veracruzana in Jalapa, Mexico, in which the policy is to teach standard Mexican Spanish (the cultivated norm of Mexico City) as an additional dialect to those students who already speak Chicano Spanish. One technique is to provide written exercises which develop the reading and writing skills of those students fluent in Colorado Spanish. Broadly speaking, the main differences between this dialect and standard Mexican Spanish lie in different pronunciations of the same lexical items and in the use of different lexical items for the same concept. Although the  syntactic patterns of the two dialects are similar, there are certain recurring syntactic patterns in Colorado Spanish which can be termed nonstandard forms, calques or anomalous forms. Various types of exercises dealing with these dialect differences are used in the composition class: dictations, &quot;proof reading&quot; exercises, two-page compositions, and translation exercises. Four passages from student compositions are examined in this paper for instances of nonstandard usage. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"The investigation described in this paper was concerned with language alternation (code-switching) in the speech of Chicano migrant workers in Florida. In order to study Chicano bilingualsim, three principal sources were utilized: (1) a revised version of Wolck's sociolinguistic background questionnaire; (2) pictorial questionnaires such as Sapon's Pictorial Linguistic Interview Manual and pictures taken from newspapers, magazines, and the Sear's catalogue; and (3) relaxed conversational situations between bilinguals, taped by residents of the migrant camps. The specific purpose of the research was to observe the use of unassimilated loanwords which were phonologically English, but which were used in the Spanish of 33 informants. It was found that the vast majority of informants  did not rely on direct English borrowings. If they borrowed any lexical items at all, they tended to assimilate them into their Spanish. They were aware of the linguistic norms of at least one of the two languages and they were sensitive to the separate identity of Spanish and English. Three sample conversations are presented, followed by an analysis of the various causes for the language switching in each. Educators should recognize the differences between Chicanos who switch from Spanish to English because they cannot distinguish the two languages, or from an inability to recall Spanish lexical items, and those who use language switching deliberately in order to convey additional affective meaning. The habit of the latter group should be recognized as an assertion of their dual cultural  heritage. (CFM)",

The reports demonstrate the impact of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 on foreign language study and provide a quantitative measure of the progress made by foreign language study in the nation's high schools during the period 1958-1974. This report also shows the impact on high school foreign language enrollment of the recent trend among many colleges and universities to drop prerequisite requirements in foreign language. The report is based on a survey directed in spring and fall 1975 to all state foreign language supervisors. The results show that in Fall 1974, the public secondary schools (PSS) in the 7-12 range reported a  foreign language enrollment of over 4.03 million, comprising 19.2 percent of the total PSS enrollment of nearly 21 million students. In 1970, 4.57 million foreign language enrollments were reported from the PSS population of 18.4 million students. The report consists of an introductory summary of results, summary tables, and individual tables by language which present a breakdown of enrollment data by region and state, with comparative data from surveys undertaken in 1968 and 1970.

This study limits itself to attempting to answer two fundamental questions: What is the best way to represent nationally the interests of liberal education? and What is the best way to represent nationally the concerns of the independent sector of higher education? A survey was conducted among college presidents, other college officials, and state  association directors. This data combined with information from conferences, interviews, and regional conferences led to a number of recommendations relating to the establishment of a separate organization to represent the special interests of the independent institutions; revisions in emphasis and structure of the AAC; and procedures for implementation.

These considerations are set in a broader social context, and some of the long-term impacts of present trends are identified. An access policy must be determined by first defining the objectives of higher education; twelve such purposes are identified. The need to examine present policies to determine if they meet these specified needs is discussed. The next step in the process is an examination of the barriers to access, such as lack of financial resources, sex, age, and racial discrimination, culturally biased entrance examinations, and physical disabilities. An evaluation of the barriers in relation to the defined purpose of higher education facilitates  the decision to extend educational opportunities and, at the same time, presents some necessary changes in the education system. Trends and speculations about the future access policies and their effects on institutions and society are discussed, with the warning that access policies will have to change as our society becomes more industrialized and mechanized.

Discriminant analysis indicated that factor dimensions, termed Interest Value and Practical Appeal, best distinguished between groups of freshman categorized as high, moderate, and low interactors. High and moderate interactors were characterized by more positive ratings of their academic program on both dimensions and by more positive ratings of their nonacademic life on Interest Value than were low interactors. Academic achievement, as measured by cumulative freshman grade-point average, contributed little to discrimination among the three groups. Analysis of supplementary  data also indicated that high interactors ranked faculty members significantly higher as a source of positive influence on both their intellecutal and personal development than did low interactors. Moreover, in a follow-up analysis of the same subjects conducted during the subsequent academic year, amount of informal contact with faculty was found to be significantly associated with persistence at the institution. No statistically reliable differences were noted between high, moderate, and low interactors with respect to academic aptitude, personality, dimensions, or initial expectations of the college climate.

The program is an attempt to equalize the allocation of resources of the medical profession and to provide primary care physicians to underserved areas. The program is in use at Florida A and M and Florida State Universities in Tallahassee; it utilizes the Arts and Sciences faculty to furnish the basic medical sciences for a class of 35 students each year, who then complete their medical education at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Gainesville. The program is integrated with the undergraduate curriculum of the student so that the total time required from high school to  M.D. degree may vary from six to nine years depending on the student. The admissions philosophy is designed to favor selection of students with a high propensity for primary care practice in underserved areas of health care and is based on demographic background, social and economic background, and personality type. A selection model based on this background data and traditional variables (GPA, MCAT, and faculty recommendation) is used to determine how well the admissions committee is meeting the philosophical goals of the program. Preliminary results of the longitudinal study underway indicate no significant difference in the performance of the PIMS students and University of Florida campus students on the basis of class rankings, clinical grades, or national test scores, and PIMS  students are selecting primary care residencies.

Setting aside the issue of whether the government should be regulating everything from birth control to rat control, and whether the regulations should be improved or clarified, a major question is: why piggyback the government regulations onto the support of scientific research? When a university or other institution makes a scientific advance, all citizens benefit, but no individual or institution benefits exclusively. Without continued federal support for research, we will all enjoy fewer solutions to our major problems in health and energy, as well as in the social and economic domains. Thus, if funds were cut off from the top universities for failure to  comply with social legislation, society would be the big loser. Removal of research support as a punishment for alleged noncompliance with statutes that are at times not even marginally related to scientific objectives is an irrelevant and undeservedly harmful punishment. In short, the current system subverts one national objective, advancement of science and technology, in an effort to achieve other national objectives. (Author/MSE)",

College and university managers must have clearly stated needs for planning and management information and the potential uses to which such information could be put. Information systems should be created to satisfy operational reporting demands placed on the institution as well as to provide knowledge of the institution to support rational decision-making. Specific suggestions include that the managerial strengths and shortcomings of institutional decision-makers be identified before the information systems are developed and implemented; the difference between operational and managerial uses of information systems must be identified; and the uses of decision  information must be identified. Challenges to the system developer to better understand the information needs of the institutional decision-makers include becoming familiar with the decision-making styles of the institutional managers; helping initiate changes in operational reporting systems to enhance their utility in providing management information; and recognizing that integrating management information considerations with the needs for operational reporting systems is an inevitable compromise that causes the data system to be less than perfect for some of its users.

The three functions of these staff are to act as liaison with external suppliers of resources; to implement procedures for internal allocation of resources and control of activities; and to work with student activities and curricular responsibilities. Specific examples of these functions are given. The staffing of these positions has moved  from faculty with part-time assignments to the hiring of recent graduates without experience to a combination of the two. In the present period of retrenchment, due to tighter budgets, the need for more professionalism has become apparent. Influences on the future of college administration are discussed including affirmative action and the process of retrenchment itself. Some problems of middle-level personnel that are considered are the lack of mobility, the lack of opportunity for career growth, and the lack of continuing challenge. Some available solutions for these conditions are discussed. (JMF)",

The author suggests that human resource development cannot be considered fully without taking into account the state of the institution and institutional development. Since human resources represents 75 percent or more of an institution's operating expenses, its management cannot be delegated solely to the business office but must become a priority of the president and the personnel department. Staff development and training is a responsibility of personnel management since it contributes to employee communications. Development planning and programming can keep personnel practitioners in contact with all parts of the campus as well as keep each department  in contact with personnel and administration. (LBH)",

Reference is made to experimental services designed and implemented over the past three years by the Kellogg Foundation-funded Center for Professional Development at the Kansas City Regional Council for Higher Education (KCRCHE). Assistance with job transitions includes utilization of peer consultants, comparative surveys of other institutions and their administrators, and in-service training courses. Career and life transitions are helped by career planning seminars, job search seminars, one-to-one consultations, and  referrals to psychotherapists. It is suggested that a balanced administrative development program should consist of both a training component to assist administrators in learning new job responsibilities, and a personal development component to facilitate the complex personal-professional growth process of administrators.

The use of growth contracts is considered. These are also called individualized development plans and offer a systematic approach to defining administrator roles and priorities, charting the direction of professional development, and assessing one's performance and growth. The thesis of this presentation is that the use of growth contracts is one of the most suitable means to encourage professional and personal enrichment, and to bring a greater measure of integrity and fairness to the process of evaluating administrators. Principles on which growth contracts are based are outlined, and one approach to formulating them is offered. It  includes: definition of long-range career profile; statement of strengths and weaknesses; statement of role responsibility, institutional contribution, and means of evaluation; and statement of growth plans and means of evaluation. Consideration is also given to budget requests, the role of evaluation committees, and methods of implementing growth contracts. (LBH)",

The sample included all students registered in fall 1975. Actual differences between the two records are summarized. The primary difference is one of definition; symbols of incomplete, no credit, and withdrawal are included only on the operational record. In fall, 1975, only about 11 percent of all grades fell into these categories, and there were considerable differences across units. Analysis of the data suggests that grade-point average and a coefficient of completion are different measures of student performance. It is  suggested that the data presented in this report should be supplemented by other information before a final decision is made on the status of the two-transcript system at the university.

The 1975 turnabout, rejection rates, the nature of the resistance, and the public versus private distinction are reviewed. It is concluded that any future increase in the rate of public rejections and in the four-year college rejection figures would serve to substantiate the hypothesis that a slowing of unionization is likely. Extraneous variables, such as a sudden shift in the economy or the enactment of new National Labor Relations Board regulations, could upset the developing trends outlined here, but other factors lend substance to the statistical argument presented.

It is shown that each year for at least three years, unions have held more elections on public and on four-year campuses than on private and two-year campuses. Each year the percentage of union wins to total election attempts has decreased. Private and four-year campuses have felt an increase in organizing attempts of 2.5 percent since 1974 but unions have felt a concomitant decrease in their ability to win on those campuses of 3.4 percent over the same period. The only category in which unions are having unchanging success is the two-year campus. It is predicted that the more unions attempt to penetrate the  realm of four-year and private campuses the less will be their chances of winning. However, unions have won almost 89 percent of all contests. (Author/LBH)",

In the quantitative analyses, models were constructed to predict several indices of academic department structure and function; e.g., Ph.D. production, graduate enrollment, and department size, which were postulated to be linked in a recursive model. The degree to which the federal funding effect varied as a function of the kind of institution was also examined. The key finding was that federal funding has a clear, strong, and positive relationship to department and structure, and that this holds true even when other factors in the  model are taken into account.

The phases of the model are presented as separate networks.

Barriers had to be removed, not just moved. It has been apparent to white administrators in higher education who are trying to comply with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as Title VI and Title IX, that merely enforcing a policy of nondiscrimination does not result in instant equal job opportunities for all persons. Old attitudes and methods need review and revision. Resistance exists among white administrators to current federally-sponsored affirmative action programs.

        "description":"Trends in American higher education between 1969 and 1975 are reported based on surveys in those two years by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education. In general, the late 1960's saw widespread turbulence and disruption directed both at educational forms on campus and changes in American foreign policy. This movement was marked by a political swing to the left among college and university teachers and students. In 1972, with the end of the draft and direct American participation in military operations in Vietnam, the climate on campuses became less political, less radical, and centered more on teaching and studying. With the economic recession of 1975, the mood became more serious and students were more concerned with employment possibilities and vocationalism. This report  reviews attitudes in the following areas: general satisfaction; trend toward conservatism on academic issues; broad social attitudes; race; other attitudes on social issues; attitudes toward women; faculty collective bargaining; numbers, rank, and tenure; faculty characteristics; student finances; and grade inflation. Statistical tables are included. (LBH)",

        "description":"This paper is concerned with faculty members in higher education and the organizations in which they work. The research on which it is based involved an examination of the ways in which discrete work activities that were identified as part of the faculty role might be reaggregated on the basis of faculty preferences, replacing the present role structure where the latter is not supportive of those preferences. Estimated instrinsic satisfaction derived from the performance of the tasks was the foundation of the preferences. The central hypothesis of the study was that academic organizational structures can be modified to accommodate faculty needs and interests more directly. Such reorganization would have the result of placing faculty in roles that provide profound satisfactions,  thereby increasing the likelihood of greater motivation and productivity and, ultimately, higher quality output. The research also examined the probability that even those activities that are now alleged by faculty to be undesirable will be found to be preferred by a number of faculty under a more pluralistic role and reward structure, this number being sufficient to meet organizational needs.

Students did not differ in their teacher/course evaluation ratings when the instructions specified the evaluation results would be used: (1) only by the instructor; (2) by the administration; or (3) by students for course selection purposes. Secondarily, the effects of rank and class level were also examined. It was found that the evaluation of graduate courses was significantly higher than that of undergraduate courses. With respect to academic rank, graduate teaching assistants received higher ratings than did either assistant or full professors. (Author/LBH)",

        "description":"The opinions of 533 Tennesseans were gathered in a survey conducted in late 1974. It was found that Tennesseans have somewhat more confidence in higher education than do Americans generally, with 43.7 percent saying they have great confidence, 46.5 percent saying they have some confidence, and 4.5 percent saying they have no confidence. The University of Tennessee at Knoxville received a &quot;great confidence&quot; response of 42.6 percent, colleges and universities in the state received 37 percent, and the UT system of five campuses received 33.6 percent. Most Tennesseans believe strongly in the value of education, and almost two-thirds want a college education for their own children. State funding for education receives a high priority compared to funding for other services; vocational  training gets highest priority in the general category of education. When extra money is needed to pay for state-supported colleges and universities, 41 percent think the money should come from state taxes, 19 percent from student fees, and 27 percent from both. About three-fourths of Tennesseans say someone in their immediate family has had direct contact with the UT system; among those, experiences have been satisfactory to 92 percent and unsatisfactory to only 3 percent, Qualities of UT units in Knoxville rated highest are intercollegiate sports teams, Agricultural Extension Service, and research. Response tables and the questionnaire are included. (Editor/MSE)",

The emphasis is changed from measuring input (in traditional accreditation) to measuring results, and from meeting minimal standards to achieving self-developed, contractual objectives. The purposes of this accreditation plan are to individualize institutional accreditation, implement comprehensive long-range planning, make the best use of resources, establish measurements of  progress, make timely action possible, and demonstrate to the public the quality of programs. The steps of accreditation by contract are: (1) commitment; (2) application for preaccreditation status; (3) on-site visit; (4) planning of objectives; (5) approval by contract; (6) implementation; (7) evaluation; and (8) revision and up-dating.

A system is defined as a set of interrelated elements, units, or subsystems that work together toward a common goal. If a college functions as a system, the systems-related techniques become available for use in college administration. The techniques defined include program evaluation and review technique; critical path method; planning, programming, budgeting system; management information systems; cost effectiveness; and simulation. The relationship of a systems approach to planning is discussed and potential developments in the field are considered. Sixteen systems models, programs, and  services illustrating developments in the field are categorized and described according to function and cost. Some general implementation and operational factors are outlined for each. A list of significant factors to consider prior to the implementation of a system is presented. A detailed report is made of the actual implementation experience on two campuses for each of three systems. Some conclusions, recommendations, and implications are outlined with regard to the use of a systems approach and related techniques. (Author)",

Student ratings of the 9.9 managers, considered to be the most effective of the five basic approaches found in Blake and Mouton, were compared to the ratings of advisors using other styles. The 17 student advisors in the York College residence facilities were administered the &quot;Self Assessment of Key Managerial Orientations&quot; form of Blake and Mouton. It was found that 47 percent of the advisors use the 9.9 management style, 35 percent use the 5.5 style, and 18 percent use the 1.9 style. All 590 York College dormitory residents were asked to rate their student advisors on a scale of 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent) on the overall performance item of the student advisor evaluation form. The  297 survey forms returned revealed that students rated 9.9 managers significantly higher than 5.5 advisors, but not higher than 1.9-style advisors. It was recommended that high concern for students, as reflected in the 1.9 and 9.9 management styles be emphasized in the selection and training of student advisors in order to promote improved advisor-student rapport.

The study provides practical information about several mergers that have taken place and suggests guidelines for those who wish to consider merger. A variety of factors contributing to a merger decision are discussed including geographical proximity, complementary programs, a history of cooperative relationships, the drive to coeducation, the desire to strengthen the quality of higher educational service, and complexities of higher education financing. The processes involved in merger are outlined as are the various consequences. Closing as an alternative to merger is presented and five case studies reveal a  variety of factors contributing to that decision. From the cases studied a number of generalizations and guidelines for mergers are presented along with a checklist for merger situations. (JMF)",

        "description":"Higher Education Management Services contributes to the decisionmaking process in Michigan higher education by providing data and information on the past, present, and future financial status of higher education in the states. The report presents comparative statewide data and objective analysis of higher education in the state for both public and independent institutions at all levels, although analysis emphasizes public baccalaureate because of their overall importance in the state's higher education system at present. The focus is on projecting future enrollment, cost, and revenue trends to 1980 and 1985. The major conclusions of the study are: (1) that there is an obvious need for greater state and federal support for higher education institutions in Michigan over the next  decade; (2) present funding policies should be modified in the near-term to include support for a funding formula by level of instruction and by program as cost data permits; and in the long-term, enrollment-related funding formulas should be modified to give consideration to funding particular programs and services apart from total enrollments; (3) enrollment gains over the next decade will be relatively modest and are expected to decline by 1985. The report considers each conclusion in detail and ends with a discussion of alternative policy options for decision-makers to weigh and evaluate in light of the analysis contained in the report.

The data received were combined with written data available in administrative files and in the university's archives and affirmative action plan. There was strong consensus that it was the federal initiative that had resulted in the university's affirmative action plan. Among the faculties surveyed, there was considerable resistance to the concept of goals, seen to be identical with quotas, and there was strong concern for maintenance of standards. Debate, however, was generally low key. The percentages of  available women and minority doctorates was low in most disciplines at the time; the distribution within existing faculty was more balanced than in some other divisions, however. Post-doctoral positions in FNSM are an area in which, for several reasons, affirmative action has not been implemented. In other areas of faculty hiring, the collegial contact approach was the most commonly used one for hiring women and minorities. Most department chairmen felt that strong upper-level administrative support was essential to successful implementation, and that budgetary considerations were important; none felt that faculty leadership was an important factor. The disciplines involved in the survey are biochemistry, botany, chemistry, computer and information science, geology and geography,  mathematics and statistics, microbiology, physics and astronomy, polymer science and engineering, and zoology.

A survey was conducted of existing law enforcement policies and procedures within the Pennsylvania State colleges. The investigation focused on mission, staffing, training, equipping, and organization. Questionnaires and interviews were used to obtain data. Missions assigned campus police varied. Most schools preferred the \"security-safety\" function. Eight-five percent of the departments were located in the administrative affairs division of the institution. The institution's complements were similar despite differing enrollment and geographical locations. There was consensus for requiring the associate degree for employment. In order to  improve training, results indicated a need for better articulation between the institutions and the Law Enforcement Academy. Issues affecting policy development were the use of \"rent-a-cops,\" the small number of blacks and women employed, and the use of student security. Results of the study led to a recommendation that the police department be titled Department of Law Enforcement and Safety and its members be called Peace Officers. Trained officers should be permitted to carry firearms. The formation of an all-college committee to formulate operating policy procedures was suggested. Attention should be given to affirmative action guidelines in developing employment policies. (Author)",

The majority of these were 18 years old and almost all entered college directly from high school. Almost half indicated they would be living on campus, either in a residence hall or a sorority or fraternity house. Another third planned to live with parents or relatives. Although a substantial majority of new freshmen reported that they had been A or B students in high school, only 39 percent felt their high school had prepared them well for college. Most had selected UMCP as their first or second choice of college, and a third said they were attending because of its academic program. Depending on the  division in which enrolled, the percent expecting to earn an advanced degree ranged from 40 to 77. Financial concerns were reflected in students' responses about degree completion and student employment. A substantial majority saw college as a means of obtaining career skills or deciding on a career goal, although few saw the function of the University to be solely career-related. The responses clearly indicate that freshmen were uncertain about several of their &quot;survival skills&quot;: budgeting time wisely, studying efficiently, and earning satisfactory grades. Over one-fourth felt that math was their weakest area, while writing was cited by 16 percent and reading by 8 percent of the respondents. (Author/MSE)",

Results showed that women looked more favorably upon women's studies as an academic discipline than did men and showed more interest in taking women's studies courses. While both men and women seemed to accept the common belief that women's studies is not a good choice for a major (and indicate overwhelmingly that they would not major in this discipline), in general neither men nor women see women's studies as a passing fad. It is particularly important that the only thing that men and women agreed on in the study was some ambivalence  about the practicality of a women's studies major in finding a job. This would seem to be a major issue with which women's studies programs must deal in this day of vocationally-oriented students, and a prime area for further research. (Author)",

It is also apparent that there is a need for more complete information on existing programs and about the mechanisms of lateral coordination for providing services. It appears that there is no empirical justification for the state legilature's present policy of not funding off- versus on-campus programs or noncredit versus credit courses. While it would appear that the most economical and efficient mechanism for meeting statewide needs and demands of all Michigan citizens for off-campus services might be the creation of an external degree  program under the direction of the State Department of Education, the effective implementation of such a program depends on the cooperation of the state's higher education institutions. Michigan Council of State College Presidents members have indicated a preference for coordinating off-campus services through the creation of regional consortia among public and private institutions. Feasibility studies of the regional consortia approach, development of an external degree program, and alternatives for funding off-campus credit courses are recommended. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The 1973 study by the Women Chemists Committee is updated for the 1974-75 academic year. Only professors, associate professors, and assistant professors are included, since lecturers, instructors, and others are not considered full-time appointees or permanent positions. Unfortunately, in following the fate of young women Ph.D.'s, it seems that the assistant professor rank can also be a very temporary appointment and not always a position in the tenure track. This revision shows that some chemistry departments have added women to their faculties for the first time since the 1973 report. But of the large departments, having over 30 faculty members with no women in 1973, only three of 26 have added women faculty members. The fact remains that the institutions surveyed continue to  graduate more than 180 women Ph.D.'s in chemistry each year. The revision includes some departments that were omitted in the first compilation. (Author/MSE)",

The Board finds that the need exists to evaluate the effectiveness of existing and new programs to determine the extent to which these programs are attaining their objectives. In its first annual report, the areas reviewed are: the status of higher education in the state (including enrollment, costs, degrees awarded, trends in racial composition, and student progress); issues in and recommendations for master planning, finance, student loan programs, equal  educational opportunity, and accreditation and approval; and Board activities.

A total of 116 women participated in the study and completed a 64-item questionnaire. The majority of the respondents indicated positive attitudes toward former informal and formal educational experiences. They also expressed a desire for continuing their education if special arrangements could be made. Most of those interviewed would consider enrolling in courses or areas of study because of personal interest and enjoyment, although they were also interested in earning credit toward a degree or certificate. Education was the most frequently indicated area of interest. The major  barrier in attaining more education was home responsibilities. Other barriers included lack of time, inconvenient scheduling of classes, job responsibilities, cost, enrollment red tape, and inadequate or no child care. (Author/LBH)",

Using factor analysis, the responses of selected questionnaire items were combined to measure the amount of interest the faculty member has in four areas of professional activity: administration, performance, research, and teaching. An analysis was made of the relationship of the four interest measures to faculty perceptions of USC and their opinions on USC policies and practices. There was a consensus across all four interest dimensions in the extent of agreement with the university's academic  goals and directions. Some differences in the perceptions of faculty status and experiences at USC are associated with relative amounts of interest in the four areas. It is concluded that programs assuming stereotypic behavior from a categorization of faculty (e.g., the &quot;scholar&quot; or the &quot;teacher&quot;) are unlikely to be effective. (Author/LBH)",

Team members cited a seeming lack of instruction in basic science and  theoretical concepts as a major educational disadvantage to the team approach. A significant proportion of the team members also felt that the educational function slows the delivery of health care. However, the presence of students and the need to create a learning environment resulted in more conscientious and thorough health-care delivery, according to the team members.

Emphasis is on some fundamental aspects of planning: the need for courage, for purpose and choice in decision, and for direction and leadership. A definitional inquiry into planning is presented along with reasons for not planning. The variety of problems confronting American higher education today are shown to be similar to those facing institutions in the mid-nineteenth century. The costs of not planning are high, especially during times of retrenchment. It is concluded that the major failure in many planning endeavors is a reluctance to make hard choices or at least choose priorities. (Author/LBH)",

It also discusses the problems met in determining the area of study, defining the terms &quot;serial&quot; and social science, and deciding upon the number and nature of data elements that were to be drawn from the defined population for the purposes of bibliometric study. Planning and administration of data collection, and the organizational and methodological problems met in mounting a large bibliographic data collection  are discussed in section 5 of part 1. Section 6 discusses the preparation of data for transfer to magnetic tape. The second part of the report involves a numerical and associative analysis of the file. Lengthy tables are included in the appendices. (Author/AP)",

The framework of the evaluation and its application is detailed, and the aggregate results presented include profiles of learners, services, institutions involved, and communications. The evaluation leads to policy considerations of service feasibility, service demand and cost, data systems' effectiveness at the individual library level, and recommendations for dissemination of this approach. It is found that the project generated increased attention to the need for providing more and better quality services to adults through the public library, and that it  demonstrated the successful integration of the Learner's Advisory Service with program planning and evaluation management. It also led to the formation of the Consortium for Public Library Innovation. It identified the conditions which must be met for the Learner's Advisory Service to succeed as well as the background and training requirements associated with designing, modeling and implementing the service.

The 1970 United States Census data tapes for Pennsylvania and neighboring states were used for developing potential audience profiles in the areas of total service, effective viewing, core viewing, Federal Communication Commission ascertainment and Pennsylvania total service. Demographic profiles for each station were compiled using 10 variables from the census data. General and specific audience  estimates were derived from Arbitron television audience data bases. For each PPTN station, the following products were generated: (1) service area designation printouts and maps, (2) general and demographic profiles, (3) People Instant Cume printouts covering estimates of average and cumulative television audiences and (4) Audience Flow printouts tracing the movement of the average audience between television stations.

Ultimately, alterations in administrative attitudes and structure are required for professorial values to change and, in turn, for courses to change. Implementing the &quot;conservatory&quot; model from music would enable the development of specific academic specializations in broadcast areas. Professors could develop and refine their ideas and, at the same time, maintain close ties with industry in their specialization. The philosophical orientation and the academic structure of the conservatory model are both  necessary if current &quot;departments&quot; of radio, television, broadcasting, film, and communications are to be organized as &quot;specialist areas,&quot; such as audience research, lighting, set design, history, or international.

However, the increased volume of topics in recent years has made recoding in the system necessary. Education, for example, is a rapidly changing field, and the Dewey Decimal Classification system has not kept pace. As a result subject access to some education literature can be frustrating. It is expected that the forthcoming Edition 19 will do much to overcome the present shortcomings. (WBC)",

Children are growing up in a world where much of their learning is visual, and schools which have included visual communication in their curriculums have found that it has enhanced the ability to write, and contributed significantly to affective education. There is research to support the connection between visual and verbal learning. Visual mediators, for example, have helped subjects remember paired words, and visual sequencing has been an avenue to improved written sequencing. There are several programs that do use the principles of visual communication in teaching the exceptional child such as Media for Exceptional Children (Project ME), A Bookless Curriculum at Ridley  Senior High in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, Wyoming School for the Deaf, Northeast Regional Media Center for the Deaf (NRMCD), and Green Chimneys School for emotionally disturbed children in Brewster, N.Y. The Regional Resources Center proposes to implement a more inclusive visual communication program, using Instructional Television (ITV) programs designed to educate teachers as well as students. The model recommended is Science for the Seventies (SFTS). (WBC)",

The utilities of flowcharting, the calculator, and automated report generation language (ARGL), internal and external interfaces of hardware, and graphic and audiovisual aids enhance the capabilities of the system.

However the accessibility, pervasiveness, and very character of television make it the ultimate mass medium, and hence a cause for concern. Television violence is likely to be a continuing phenomenon because it is the product of the medium's response to its competitive environment, and it fits well its particular story telling needs. Experiments have found that the likelihood of aggression is increased by exposure to televised violence, and under certain conditions this likelihood is increased further. However, there is little evidence to support the claim that television violence  desensitizes viewers to real life violence. It has been found among adults that heavier viewers consistently perceive a world more in line with that portrayed in television drama than lighter viewers. The evidence on desensitization and fearfulness is too limited to draw broad conclusions. The evidence on aggressiveness is much more extensive but does not in itself support a conclusion of increased anti-social aggression. (WBC)",

Teachers should understand it, and as the occasion requires, confront, correct, or take advantage of it. Research on television viewing yields five lessons. Television experience is an individual one, although there are definite patterns related to sex, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Viewing often serves quite specific needs, including information and escapism. The role of television and other mass media changes as children grow. There is evidence that television can influence behavior; and television's influence is at least partly contingent on other communication reaching the young viewer. The weight of evidence is that television is one of many factors  that influence the child, and a teacher cannot ignore it. Needed now is research concerning the ways in which teachers might intervene more effectively in the communication between the child and the medium to turn its teachings to constructive ends. (WBC)",

One possible long range effect is to be found in the inference, supported by experimental and field studies, that television violence is a cause of increased aggressiveness on the part of the young. This leads to the speculation that there may be other long-term effects. One of these is a weakening of parental control over information reaching young persons because of the  trend toward increased frankness and liberality in the treatment of sensitive topics. Another is the reallocation of time away from other activities in favor of consumption of mass media. A third is the increased influence of the vicarious experience of the mass media, and particularly television, in socialization. (WBC)",

The major concern is to find out if the use of a great variety of technology can reduce instructional cost and improve learning. An overall observation indicates that the potential of educational technology in higher education is impeded by: (1) a lack of consensus as to the direction of technological advances; (2) adverse faculty attitude toward improving teaching by technology with inadequate reward; (3) the difficulty of cost reduction; (4) small-scale gains in learning; and (5) the low quality of software. To enhance the influence of educational technology, more research, and large-scale experiment and  development are necessary. (SC)",

Stations are located on and outside of the United States mainland. Advantages offered by satellite are: (1) equal cost of program originations from points close to and remote from the national origination center, (2) nearly identical technical quality and reliability at all stations, (3) program distribution to non-mainland PTV stations and simultaneous delivery of two or more programs economically feasible, (4) program exchanges between PTV stations in separate geographical areas possible without pre-empting service to others, and (5) ability for PTV stations in close proximity to receive different programs at the  same time. Proposed major components of the system are: (1) the space segment to be provided by Western Union's WESTAR satellites, (2) Receive-Only (R/O) Ground Terminals owned, operated, and maintained by PTV stations, (3) Main Origination (M/O) Ground Terminal owned and operated by PBS, and (4) Receive/Transmit (R/T) Ground Terminals dispersed throughout the country.

Fourteen public libraries and 11 systems responded to questions covering the criteria. Half the public libraries and the majority of systems met only 44.4% and 30.8%, respectively, of the standards. Based on data analysis major conclusions were: (1) inconsistencies exist in audiovisual services, materials, staffing, financing,, and space; (2) audiovisual materials and equipment appear to be inadequately financed; (3) collections need size increase and more diversified resources; (4) audiovisual staffing procedures differ, with most libraries and systems understaffed; (5)  inconsistencies exist in audiovisual services to the public; (6) audiovisual materials are used in children's services extensively but with variation; and (7) although financial problems exist, librarians have positive attitudes toward audiovisual resources. It was recommended that more comprehensive studies be conducted of libraries serving populations of both more than 150,000 and less than 150,000 and that the California Library Association either adopt the audiovisual standards of ALA or create its own original guidelines for use in planning and evaluation. Data are presented in tables; a bibliography and the survey questionnaire are attached. (KP)",

They supplied information on salary, rank--assistant, associate, or full librarian, sex, education, and years of professional experience. Statistical analyses showed significant differences between salaries of men and women, all else being equal. The average earnings of women were lower than those of men and mean income level of all  respondents. Men were found to move through the ranks faster than women; however, no pattern of salary distribution was detected between men and women within each rank. Rank was found to be the strongest predictor of salary, other significant predictors being years of professional experience and sex.

        "description":"This paper considers estimation of parameters for a model currently being used to study the Illinois Interlibrary Loan Network (ILLINET) and presents a method for determining how much data should be collected and how it should be aggregated. Four classes of model parameters discussed: demands, probabilities of success, processing times, and delivery times. This approach is being used as a means of deciding when to terminate data collection as well as determining the number of request classes to use in the policy analyses being performed with a library network model. This paper shows how model parameter uncertainty affects prediction uncertainty as a function of sample size and number of request classes. As sample size increases, uncertainty decreases. However, as the number of  request classes increases, the sample size in each class decreases and thus, uncertainty increases. An appendix presents a new version of the model used in previous studies which could be applicable to many different types of networks. (DAG)",

Project 81 was formulated to organize a regional approach to the use of new instructional media materials for occupational education through increasing the acquisition and use of videocassettes. The necessary hardware and opportunities for training were also provided. The evaluation began with a pre-survey in the fall of 1975 which estimated baseline utilization of media by staff. Data were collected on use of individual program materials throughout the evaluation period, and a final evaluation was completed in June 1976. This last survey produced a clear picture of the project's success. The  diffusion of large quantities of videocassette equipment and materials resulted in a significant increase in teacher adoption and utilization. (WBC)",

Two different ITV lessons were presented to three groups of 30 each with attitude measured by scores on a 14-item Likert device forcing responses re: ITV presentors, and achievement measured by scores on a 20-item multiple choice test to assess recall on lesson content. Reliability was conducted by split half, validity by concurrence; data by one way  analysis of variance, and design was experimental. Results in two lesson runs, conducted to correct for maturation, produced hypothesis rejection for attitude (no significant difference regardless of treatment) and split results for achievement (a significant difference favoring the trained communicator in the first lesson run and no significant difference in the second).

Previous literature predominantly focused on issues related to adaptation and integration for &quot;foreign wives&quot; into the host society underlining the hypergamous (marrying a spouse of a higher status) nature of their marriage, which renders the majority of husbands and non-hypergamous marriages understudied. Therefore, the current study focuses on a population that includes husbands and wives, Japanese migrants, and Thai spouses. This study is exploratory and employed a qualitative approach with snowball sampling, which resulted in the inclusion of five Thai nationals and three of their Japanese spouses raising children in Thailand as participants. The study aims to examine their educational decision-making, including the language used in each family and school choice, since the parenting process is a succession of adjustments in response to the conditions of society, where values are explicitly manifested. Data were collected through face-to-face or online interviews, and content analysis was used to clarify themes. Analysis revealed factors that relate educational decisions to preconditions, such as the place of the first encounter, socioeconomic status, and location of their home. Another prominent issue is the strong belief in the English language. All participants claim that their decisions were made unanimously, while their characteristics, high levels of education and overseas experience, the preference of Japanese spouses to live in Thailand, and their lack of knowledge about educational options in Thai society contribute to the rational recount of their decision-making process.",

        "description":"This study aims to determine the future expectation of university students studying in the field of sports sciences and to examine how it affects their attitudes toward brain migration. The &quot;Brain Migration Scale&quot;, developed by Öncü et al. (2018), was used to evaluate the attitude toward brain migration, and the &quot;Future Expectation Scale&quot;, developed by Simsek (2012), was used to measure the future expectation of the students. The approval of the ethics committee was obtained for the study. This program data was collected by applying Sports in different universities with Sports Management program in Istanbul. 299 students responded to the survey questions via the google form link. The data were analyzed with SPSS 25.0 package program. It was determined that the data showed normal distribution. Multiple regression analysis and Pearson Product-Moment correlation tests were applied to the research data. According to the results of the research, it was found that there are significant and positive relationships between the participants' attitudes towards brain migration and their personal and professional future expectations, educational, economic, and total future expectations. On the other hand, it has been determined that there is no significant relationship between students' attitudes toward brain migration and their expectations for a social future. When looking at the impact force, it was seen that students' economic future expectation was more effective in predicting the attitude toward brain migration than their future expectation of education. In this context, it is important to ensure economic stability and improve working conditions in our country.",

In this study, the IoTW-driven CCBL was designed by incorporating content, cybergogical, and technological elements, which can become a sustainable solution in educational settings during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers collected qualitative data by confirmatory focus groups from 12 experts who hold doctoral degrees or equivalent and have at least 3 years of relevant experience. The results of these studies found that the IoTW-driven CCBL involves three specific learning contents (healthcare, disease prevention and health promotion); five dynamic learning steps (context-aware alerting step; observing and questioning step; social information-seeking step; action step; and self-reflection step as all cognitive tools embedded in IoTW devices help promote all digital health literacy components); and four cognitive tools (notification tool; communication tool; searching tool; and monitoring tool). The IoTW-driven CCBL will allow learners to respond to real-life situations by utilising IoT devices to access, apprehend, appraise and apply health information from digital technologies in daily life for well-being, especially in educational settings.",

        "description":"We investigated the socio-psychological effects of both the pandemic and distance learning on high school students in Turkey and Denmark. We aimed to assess whether there were any differences between students attending public or private schools in Turkey, and between two countries having different approaches to the pandemic and considerable socio-cultural and economic differences. We conducted a web-based questionnaire study in a cross-sectional design using the Survey Monkey Platform and sent it out via social media to high school students in Turkey and Denmark. The survey collected socio-demographic data, several variables associated with pandemic and distance education and their effects on social life and psychological well-being. Additionally, emotional health was assessed using the Positive and Negative Affects Schedule. We studied 565 (mean age: 16.5 ± 1.0) Turkish and 92 (mean age: 17.7 ± 1.0) Danish students, of whom the majority were female adolescents (63% vs 76%). Students educated in public (47.6%) and private high schools (52.4%) were nearly similar in number in the Turkish group, whereas in the Danish sample almost all students were from public schools (98.9%). Turkish students were significantly more likely to be compliant with the pandemic-related restrictions. Besides that, there were significant socio-economic disparities between Turkish and Danish students and also within Turkey between public and private school students. Turkish online education system was significantly less adequate and satisfactory compared to the Danish system. These were even worse for those who were attending public schools in Turkey. Regardless of the socio-economic differences, the majority of the students in both countries have been negatively affected by the pandemic and related restrictions and had a negative opinion about distance education. This was also true for the PANAS scores. The total scores of PANAS were similar between Turkish and Danish students (PA: 27.0 ± 7.6 versus 25.8 ± 5.6; NA: 24.8 ± 7.5 versus 24.5 ± 7.3) and also within Turkey between public and private school students (PA: 26.8 ± 7.5 versus 27.1 ± 7.6; NA: 24.7 ± 7.2 versus 25.0 ± 7.8). While female students were significantly more severely affected in the Turkish group, no such gender differences were observed in the Danish group. Additionally, considerable portion of the students in Turkey and Denmark expressed loneliness (55.2% vs 59.8%, p&lt;0.706), boredom (71.2% vs 58.7%, p=0.019) and anxiety towards the future (61.4% vs 22.8%, p&lt;0.001). Decreased physical activity, sleep problems, eating disorders and domestic abuse were other complaints. In conclusion, adolescents from both countries have been severely affected by the pandemic and its related restrictions and expressed negative views about distance education. Turkish online education system seemed to be less satisfactory when compared to the Danish system. Within Turkey, public school students had significantly more disadvantages compared to those attending private schools. Despite the fact that there were several socio-economic inequalities among students, in general, there were no robust significant differences regarding the psychological status and opinion about distance learning, indicating a global worsening of emotional status during the pandemic.

Prior to the data collection, the participants were asked to write a 1500-2000-word essay in the triangle of &quot;reader-writer-context&quot;. Next, they were asked to answer two open-ended questions were asked and they were asked to answer these questions and descriptive analysis technique was used to analyze the data. When the writing difficulties experienced by the pre-service teachers in the writing process were examined, it was determined that they had the most writing challenges at the process level, followed by the writing difficulties at the control level, and the least at the resource level. Coping strategies used by pre-service teachers in response to their writing challenges in the writing process, it was determined that coping strategies aimed at providing cognitive support were used the most, which was followed by coping strategies towards providing instrumental support, and strategies towards creating affective support. In conclusion, problems encountered in the professional training process and the ability to come up with solutions for these problems will be the predictor of the potential resolutions created by pre-service teachers for the problems they might face while performing their own professions.",

In the analysis of the data, Pearson correlation analysis and multi-linear regression were used. In light of the strong predictive relationships obtained from the current study, it can be said that pre-school teachers should effectively manage their classrooms in order to display behaviours that support thinking in learning environments. The subdimension of Communication and Behavioural Regulations yielded the highest correlation with teacher behaviours that support thinking and was found to be a significant predictor. While there is no relationship between the Plan-Program Activities sub-dimension and the predicted variables, Time Management significantly predicted the clarity needed to support thinking, and Classroom Physical Arrangements significantly predicted reflection through documentation.",

Teachers' intentional use of distance education environments is considered effective in taking advantage of the distance education medium. In order to benefit from classroom teachers' experiences during the pandemic when aiming to incorporate distance education's advantages into formal K-12 education, factors regarding teachers' behavioral intention to use distance education environments were investigated in this study within the framework of the technology acceptance model. The study aimed to assess classroom teachers' self-efficacy, perceived benefit, attitude toward the use of distance education environments, as well as each of these variables' influence on teachers' intention to use distance education environments. Data were collected from 370 classroom teachers through a self-reporting scale. Structural equation modeling approach was then used to test the measure and structure models, with descriptive statistics applied to assess teachers' levels for the constructs. The results indicated that classroom teachers' self-efficacy, perceived benefit, and attitudes towards the use of distance education environments significantly influence teachers' behavioral intention to use distance education environments. Both researchers and educational policymakers should consider these significant predictors to promote classroom teachers' intentional use of distance education environments in their future classrooms.",

In this regard, this study systematically examines research on learning analytics through bibliometric, data mining, and analytics approaches. This paper argues that research interest in learning analytics is increasing steadily; some countries, higher education institutions, and researchers have a specific research agenda that indicates their intention to specialize in that field. It is also noted that there is a need for more interdisciplinary studies on learning analytics and a further need to merge technological capabilities with pedagogy. Based on the findings of text-mining and social network analysis, the following themes were identified: (1) learning analytics to improve teaching and personalize learning, (2) hegemony of data-driven teaching and learning practices, (3) multimodal learning analytics as the next generation practice, (4) learning design for learning analytics, (5) formative assessment through learning analytics, (6) learning analytics for social online learning spaces, and (7) privacy and ethical concerns to overcome. This paper suggests focusing on issues such as ethics and privacy and warns researchers to pay attention to the risks of both an educational panoptic society and quantified decision-making processes. Furthermore, rather than relying on algorithms, it is suggested to incorporate social values and center the learners in the learning analytics processes. Finally, this paper asks the following: &quot;If we quantify the learning processes, how can we benefit from the carpe diem of educational processes and then seize the beauty of teaching and learning?&quot;",

        "description":"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) can be designed with different pedagogical approaches and course components as in face-to-face courses. In this context, the development of some standards and field-specific design principles related to MOOCs is seen as a critical step for the creation of quality online courses. The aim of this study is to examine the MOOC experiences of the learners in mathematics education and proposing reflections about design principles of MOOCs for mathematics education. In this respect, the MOOC experiences of 30 teacher candidates enrolled in MOOCs (with mathematic education context) were analyzed, and the general course structure, pedagogical orientations, and mathematical connection elements used in these MOOCs were examined. The data obtained from the participants revealed a comprehensive course evaluation structure including 7 categories and 85 codes under 3 themes and mathematical connection findings consisting of 3 categories and 3 subcategories. The research findings uncovered that teacher candidates had course experiences that differed according to national/international MOOC evaluation criteria in terms of audiovisual elements, video/course durations, interaction-feedback features, teaching methods, measurement/evaluation, and mathematical connection dimensions. Course evaluation codes/propositions and mathematical connection findings that emerge as a result of this research can be considered as a resource that can be used in the design of MOOCs to be planned in mathematics education.",

        "description":"Multi-grade teaching is a widely accepted phenomenon in both developing and developed countries. In this article I report on a phenomenological inquiry into written feedback practices of teachers in multi-grade classrooms and how they described and interpreted their feedback practices pertaining to learners' writing activities in English First Additional Language. Written feedback is widely believed to be central to learners' learning and achievement. Feedback is assumed to change learners' thinking or behaviour towards their work and is regarded as a tool to focus their attention on improving their learning. Despite the benefits of written feedback, however, there is a widespread belief that many learners are disengaged from the feedback they receive. The population in this study comprised 4 English First Additional Language teachers from 4 multi-grade primary schools. Content analysis was used to analyse the data collected from the participants through semistructured interviews. The findings indicate that participants differed in their understanding of what was involved in feedback, and that there was a shared view that feedback was a product and not viewed as a process that could be used towards developing learners' learning. It was also shown that feedback practices used by the teachers of multi-grade classes included providing correct answers and providing delayed feedback to learners. This study adds to the ongoing debates on multi-grade teaching and attempts to shed some light on the nature and the type of feedback that could motivate and enhance learners' learning in multi-grade classrooms.",

        "author":["ElGamal, Hebatullah"],
        "description":"Recently, the flipped learning approach has been widely endorsed as an effective active learning alternative that responds to some of today's educational challenges, such as learner engagement. Flipped learning is a movement coping with the global rise of hybrid and digital learning, not just a teaching model. Although this review covers studies published before the COVID-19 pandemic, the findings of this review were analyzed during the lockdown witnessing the escalation of digital approaches. This review systematically revealed patterns, trends, conceptions, and practices in research into the flipped approach in higher education published from (2010-2019). It employed a descriptive analysis of 169 empirical studies in three highly indexed databases while focusing on authorship, subjective definitions, methods, theoretical frameworks, the role of media, and video in practice. Accordingly, the review provides an exhaustive summary of studies capturing the evolution of the flipped approach not restricted to a specific subject area or a study group. The findings revealed that the disciplines of education and medicine led the flip research. While the faculty was almost silent, students were the prominent participants in the investigation. Most studies employed the mixed-method research design, while they didn't employ a theory to guide the research. Furthermore, this review recommends using enhanced classification frameworks to contextually define key concepts addressing the gap of a unified framework defining this tangled and rich approach. Finally, this review suggests a better understanding of the flipped approach focusing on its value more than its modality.",

With many resources claiming to be STEM, it can be overwhelming and difficult finding specific classroom activities to establish an interest in the subjects. The use of loose parts can address challenges teaching STEM and meeting curriculum standards in elementary schools. To better understand STEM best practices, a scoping review was implemented. The key words &quot;STEM,&quot; &quot;elementary,&quot; and &quot;science&quot; yielded 1,955 publications, which were then narrowed down to 20 articles for in-depth review. The selected publications were analyzed for STEM activities using loose parts principles.

Emergency remote education has been adopted to ensure the sustainability of education, which was interrupted by the closure of educational institutions. The transition has also impacted higher education students as well as primary and secondary education students. In this regard, the study aims to examine the perceptions of distance education of higher education students continuing their education in the field of special education during the COVID-19 pandemic through metaphor analysis within the scope of the qualitative phenomenology method. The study participants consisted of 185 associate, undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students. In the data collection process, the researchers prepared an online form and asked the participants to complete the statement, &quot;Distance education is like ... because ...&quot;. According to the results obtained by content analysis, the participants produced 137 positive and 142 negative metaphors. Among the positive metaphors, the themes of &quot;usability,&quot; &quot;flexibility,&quot; &quot;student participation,&quot; and &quot;suitability&quot; were obtained, while the themes of &quot;teaching process,&quot; &quot;interaction,&quot; &quot;usability,&quot; &quot;student status,&quot; and &quot;assessment and evaluation&quot; were obtained among the negative metaphors. While students thought that the resources offered in distance education for the acquisition of new knowledge were very diverse and comprehensive, they criticized the teaching process for being artificial and non-interactive.",

The data were drawn from a questionnaire survey of 1,860 final-year secondary school students from Yaoundé, Cameroon, as well as supplementary interviews with 16 students. The findings show that the majority of respondents indicated a preference to continue their education after the end of secondary school and participate in some form of higher education. However, contrary to previous studies that identify gender or SES segregation in higher education participation, the findings in this study suggest that the influence of SES and gender on students' attitudes was minimised in the later stage of secondary schooling. Among the relatively minor external influences, institutional factors surpass family influence, and fathers' influence is stronger than that of mothers, echoing the patriarchal cultural background in Cameroon. Considering the positive attitudes revealed in this study, it is suggested that more external efforts could be made to respond to students' optimistic attitudes and smooth their transition processes. Higher education institutions should improve their capability to enrol and accommodate more students and patriarchal culture should also be challenged to boost women's educational opportunities.",

This research study discussed both these strategies from a learner centered approach in order to determine the effectiveness of cognitive and metacognitive strategies in comprehending a reading text and building a good vocabulary. A descriptive research design was adopted to study the attitude and perception of readers/ learners towards cognitive and metacognitive strategies. Since the study was non-experimental by nature, no manipulation of variables was carried out, and the data collected was for a single period of time. The sample consisted of 450 students of two urban senior high schools in Serang, Indonesia selected through convenience sampling method. The data was collected through a questionnaire that dealt with two major elements: reading comprehension and vocabulary. The results showed that experimental group improved significantly over the control group in both vocabulary and reading comprehension. This shows that the type of reading strategies do affect students' reading ability and that the strategies applied by students in understanding the text are strongly influenced by the students' ability to understand the words of the text and the context of the reading. The study implies that the reading challenges are different in the Indonesian and English languages, there is also a need to differentiate between reading strategies The study addressed this issue and examined how to maximize teachers' assistance in improving reading comprehension skills of students. The study recommends to introduce exercises for students to internalize the meaning of a given text.",

The question arises whether these findings and theories undergirding these researches are equally applicable, to the teaching of LOTEs. This study explored teachers' perspective of teaching &quot;Bahasa Melayu&quot; (Malay language) as a LOTE and the role of English in teaching it. A narrative research design was utilized, with a sample of six &quot;Bahasa Melayu&quot; teachers from universities in Malaysia, who reported how the use of English enhanced or impeded the delivery of &quot;Bahasa Melayu&quot; curriculum. The data primarily came from teachers' semi-structured interviews, and was complemented by field notes, memos, and casual phone calls. Findings showed that teachers' decisions are mainly influenced by institutional atmosphere, and students' linguistic and cultural background. Teachers' stories revealed the importance of English owing to internationalization of education. This study will help LOTE teachers reflect on their own their decision to use English for teaching LOTE.",

De Bono's six thinking hats technique can help effectively approach the issue of bullying. The innovation of this scenario lies in the fact that it uses De Bono's technique to deal with bullying at school. In this way, students can gain a holistic knowledge and promote creative and critical thinking in addressing an issue by considering multiple points of view. The purpose of the paper is to present and highlight one more tool, a teaching scenario that uses De Bono's technique to address the issue of bullying at school. The scenario was implemented in 6th grade students the school year 2021-2022 to develop skills and examine if their attitudes about bullying can be changed. Finally, the students, as they wrote in their evaluation, changed their behavior, reflected, and discussed the problem of bullying and proposed solutions.",

This study used the quantitative-qualitative research methods by using the modified self-administered questionnaires based on Schomburg primarily and interviews. The data revealed that the graduates perceived the relevance, appropriateness, and satisfaction of their program to their work. The graduates were also trained in terms of writing and presenting reports, critical thinking, managing their time and publishing. However, the program needed to enhance the skills in publication which could be attributed to the lack of internal motivation to publish one's research output and availability of journals for publication. Thus, this study implies that there is a need to strengthen the research agenda of the department. It is indeed recommended that the students should be required by faculty members to submit their final papers for review and publication to a selected journal and publishing the master's theses before and after earning the master of arts in applied linguistics (MAAL) program should be encouraged, reinforced, and practiced. A scholarly journal could also be created.",

Round 1 qualitative data were organized into Likert questions and used in the second round, which resulted in data about frequency of mentoring practices for the same participants from Round 1. The third round provided data about importance of each preference rated by faculty and current students. Findings indicated a dichotomy was present in that mentees' academic self-esteem appeared to be tied to faculty being responsive.

        "description":"Literature-in-English is a major school subject that equips students with language and other soft skills needed for entry into the workforce. For students to acquire the skills, effective teaching, which is dependent on the availability of basic teaching--learning resources, is essential. Education is underfunded in Nigeria. This affects the quality of teaching and impedes learning. The rate at which students fail Literature-in-English, which is getting worse each year, indicates that there is a problem in the teaching--learning process. Using a mixed-method research design, this study investigated the problems of teaching Literature-in-English in 51 public senior secondary school in Ibadan metropolis, Oyo State. Random and purposive sampling techniques were used to select three local government areas (LGAs), 20 teachers, and 7,090 students. Data were gathered through Availability of Literature Teachers Checklist (ALTC), Interview Guide for Literature-in-English Teachers (IGLT) and Students' Text Possession Checklist (STPC). The result shows that teachers are faced with many challenges that prevent them from delivering quality instruction. These include poor learning environment, acute shortage of textbooks, low language proficiency, misconceptions about the value of literature, heavy workload, and lack of parental support. Some schools do not have literature teachers. The biggest obstacle, however, is lack of textbooks. The situation is critical and points to a crisis of teaching and learning in Literature-in-English classrooms. Urgent interventions are needed if the objectives of this school subject are to be achieved. Some recommendations are made.",

The study was influenced by earlier research reports indicating that the large class sizes prevalent in Nigerian schools may be detrimental to student academic and emotional well-being. The study employed an ex post facto research design, as no attempt was made to alter the pre-existing conditions in the schools. Three hundred and thirty-five (335) Senior Secondary School 2 students from nine purposively selected schools participated in the study. An achievement test in essay writing (r = 0.7); attitude toward essay writing questionnaire (r = 0.72); and self-esteem questionnaire (r = 0.84) were the instruments used for data collection. The data collected were analyzed using analysis of covariance. All hypotheses were tested at a 0.05 level of significance. Results showed that there was a significant effect of class size on student achievement in essay writing, whereas class size had no significant effect on attitude toward essay writing. Results also showed that there was no significant effect of self-esteem on student achievement in--and attitude toward--essay writing. Based on these findings, it was recommended that the government should ensure that classrooms are not overcrowded.",

Therefore, in online learning, understanding the relationships between significant personality traits of learners and potential variables that can contribute to or hinder the learning experiences, and furthermore, the questioning of their impact on learning performance is critical to delivering effective learning experiences. The main aim of this associational study is to examine the relationships and effects of specific variables (online self-regulation, cognitive style, online interaction, and gender), on online learning and thus, to create a partial roadmap for effective online learning practices in the context of learning analytics. It also intends to understand the learners at a fine-grained level and to support individualized online learning environments. Correlation and simple linear regression analyses were used to analyze the data obtained. The findings of the study indicate that the online self-regulation scores of field-independent learners are much higher than those of field-dependent learners. In addition, there is a moderate positive correlation between the online self-regulation and cognitive style. The online self-regulation scores of the female learners are found to be higher than those of the male learners. The relationships between the variables analysed in the study are discussed in a holistic manner. It is thought that the study findings may contribute to the information on the adaptive online learning within the framework of learning analytics.",

The review covers 238 empirical studies which were based on primary data and published in 2021 in eight DE journals listed in Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) or Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI). Findings suggest that they are fairly good in terms of clarity in context of study, purpose of study, and duration if a study involves an intervention or is otherwise length-sensitive, albeit the existence of small room for improvement. In contrast, a large proportion of the studies reviewed are less rigorous to different but considerable and even alarming degrees in terms of research approach and design, sampling strategies, source of data, researcher bias, ethical concerns, and limitations. Put specifically, less than one quarter of the sample studies adopted the qualitative approach while over 90% of the quantitative studies followed the survey and correlational designs, resulting in a staggering disproportion from the perspective of diversity in research approach and design. Over 60% of the sample studies did not spell out their sampling strategies and only about 20% of the specified sampling strategies were probabilistic in nature, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Over 90% employed questionnaires/scales/rubrics and/or interview protocols to collect data but over 70% of these two types of instruments were neither reviewed nor piloted before put to use with less than 50% available in full content, hence likely to undermine the value of the findings. Researcher bias, ethical concerns, and limitations were addressed in 10%, 50%, and 70% of the studies respectively. Implications for future research are also discussed in the light of these findings.",

Women in both developed and developing countries can access learning through technology, yet the scholarly community do not have an up-to-date collective view of how technology is being used to provide learning materials to empower women around the world. Therefore, this systematic review included an aggregated and qualitative synthesis to investigate extant empirical work over five years, 2017-2021. Following a rigorous PRISMA selection process, 40 articles were included in the final analysis from 80 countries. The findings reveal that the majority (60%) of studies took place in Sub-Saharan Africa. From the grounded coding, five industries emerged as areas providing empowerment through the learning materials: health, agriculture, environment, entrepreneurship, and communication. Women were empowered by learning in three main areas: health, communication, and entrepreneurship. This study provides information for funders, policymakers, advocates, and women. This study revealed areas in need of future research, including additional systematic reviews to explore gray literature not published in scholarly outlets and academic publications published in non-English language journals.",

        "description":"Emergency Remote Learning presented unplanned and unexpected educational paradigms from traditional to remote classes that occur due to the COVID-19 outbreak in various countries. Zoom platform served as an emergency solution, providing a potentially safe environment for learning. Students adjusted to the new mode of teaching and learning process since the beginning of the pandemic. This study aimed to determine the pre-service teachers' perceptions of their experiences in utilizing Zoom technology to enhance their engagement (cognitive, emotional and behavioral) during emergency remote classes. Following a cross-sectional survey design, pre-service teachers enrolled in a state university (N=242) were randomly selected into strata to answer a Likert type created questionnaire with two open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics was used for the quantitative data, while content analysis was adapted in the qualitative portion of the survey. Findings revealed that Zoom Technology is an viable tool during students' engagement in emergency remote classes. However, preservice teachers prefer face-to-face classes than online classes with the use of video conferencing tools such as Zoom. Qualitative analysis revealed the following rewards of Zoom into three categories: collaborative student interaction, online flexibility and adaptability, and performance reliability. However, some drawbacks in utilizing Zoom included: connectivity status, complexity in features, and online health struggles. Based on the results, this study serves as a basis for instructors, pre-service teachers, course designers, and academicians to provide the most suitable online learning platforms. It is recommended that instructors create various course learning activities, such as using performance-based tasks which may include online debates or other oral communication activities to foster student engagement.",

(2019) on technological pedagogical STEM (TP-STEM) knowledge into Turkish and to determine the knowledge of pre-service and in-service teachers about TP-STEM. The original survey consisted of four factors and a total of 17 items. These factors included Technological Pedagogical Knowledge in Science (TPSK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge in Mathematics (TPMK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge in Engineering (TPEK), and Integrative STEM (iSTEM) knowledge. The participants of the study were 520 pre-service and in-service teachers. The analysis showed that the model fit indices for the validity of the factor structures were acceptable with a value of RMSEA=0.0621 and showed excellent agreement with the values SRMR=0.0346, CFI =0.961, TLI=0.953. The Cronbach's alpha values for the factors ranged from 0.80 to 0.84 ([alpha]-value &gt;0.70). These results mean that the survey adapted to Turkish language was reliable and valid for further research. The results showed that pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers had lower self-efficacy on the subfactors (TPSK, TPMK, TPEK, and iSTEM) than pre-service and in-service science and computer teachers.",

To date, limited research has been conducted regarding these tasks in teacher education and the process of solving these tasks. This study focuses on the solution quality of student teachers' task solutions. 149 students were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: invention activity and worked solution. The latter group were given a set of categories; the former group had to invent their own categories to compare two constructed contrasting auditive cases with a focus on the subject classroom management. To determine whether it is more effective to compare cases with given categories (worked solution) or with self-generated categories (invention activity), we coded the 149 solutions regarding the content-related solution quality using qualitative content analysis. Students in the worked solution condition demonstrated a significantly higher content-related solution quality than those in the invention activity condition. Thus, it may be assumed that students of the worked solution gained a better conceptual understanding of classroom management through working on this task. Implications for the use of this task format in teacher education are discussed.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to determine the prediction level of teachers' psychological empowerment perceptions on their job satisfaction and organizational citizenship behaviors. The research is designed in the relational survey model. 400 teachers working in primary schools in Bolu, Turkey participated in the study and out of 356 teachers participating in the study voluntarily, 314 scales were delivered back and evaluated. Psychological Empowerment Scale, Job Satisfaction Scale and Organizational Citizenship Scale were used as data collection instruments. The findings indicated that teachers' perceptions of psychological empowerment were moderate in self-determination, and high in other dimensions and the whole scale. The moderate level of teachers' perceptions of job satisfaction and organizational citizenship is a striking and concerning result. When teachers do not have high level of job satisfaction, their performance will decrease, and it will be difficult for these teachers to exhibit organizational citizenship behavior. In the study, that the teachers' perceptions of psychological empowerment affect both job satisfaction and organizational citizenship behaviors necessitates the importance of psychological empowerment in increasing teachers' job satisfaction and organizational citizenship behaviors. In this sense, it is an important finding that teachers' job satisfaction and organizational citizenship behaviors will be increased by means of them having self-determination over their work, increasing their competence, making them influential by allowing to think, talk about and intervene the incidents that occur in the school, and ensuring their participation in work-related decisions. The finding indicating that teachers' perceptions of psychological empowerment play an important role in increasing their job satisfaction and organizational citizenship behavior reveals the authenticity of the research.",

The data was collected with General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), Perceived Organizational Support Scale (POSS), Personal Growth Initiative Scale-II (PGIS-II). Descriptive analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to examine the structural relations among the variables. It was observed that faculty members' organizational support perceptions had a significant direct effect on their personal growth initiative levels; organizational support perceptions had a significant effect on general self-efficacy beliefs; and the effect of general self-efficacy beliefs on personal growth initiative levels was significant. It was evidenced that faculty members' self-efficacy beliefs fully mediated the relationship between perceived organizational support and personal growth initiative levels. These results are in line with the principles of Organizational Support Theory and Social Cognitive Theory. More research explaining the effect of organizational factors on self-efficacy and personal growth initiative is needed.",

However, limited research has focused on these teachers' experiences and far fewer studies examined those with Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) backgrounds to identify what contributes to the high attrition rate. This narrative study captured the experience of a first-year ESL teacher with CALD backgrounds. Data were collected using a three-step interview approach over the course of 1 year. The data show the protagonist's identity as an advocate for Emergent Bilinguals (EBs) began during his extended clinical practicum and was further driven by his CALD background, unsupportive colleagues, and the marginalized status of EBs and ESL teachers. Although he overcame numerous challenges, he ultimately left his ESL position due to his unsustainable low salary. The story confirmed current research regarding systematic barriers that may prevent CALD individuals from entering and staying in the ESL teaching field.

To measure these constructs, I used the Wang Engagement Scale as well as a descriptive approach, especially in its relational components. The population, which comprised 15,057 students from the northern West Bank, was divided into groups; from each I chose a representative sample drawn using a random sampling technique based on the size of each of the three directorates of education (Jenin, Qabatia and Tubas). A questionnaire was then designed and delivered to 1,132 respondents from the fifth and ninth grades. The results suggest that fifth graders are by far more engaged than ninth graders, especially female students, and that female teachers, teachers with a degree in science, teachers with 1 to 5 years of experience and teachers with a 2-year associate degree were particularly motivating for student engagement.",

A non-probability purposive sampling strategy was used to recruit participants. The results of this study confirm that classrooms in special needs schools may not be acoustically sound spaces which teachers feel may compromise effective learning. As a result, teachers reported using a variety of active and passive strategies to manage classroom acoustics in order to enhance learning.

One such important method of management is the accommodation of these learners in mainstream class. The quantitative survey study reported on here was aimed at determining the perspectives of educators in 2 private schools in the Tshwane South District, Gauteng, South Africa, regarding the knowledge of, attitude towards, and management of accommodations for learners with DD. We implemented a quantitative descriptive cross-sectional survey research approach where a self-administered questionnaire was administered after purposive sampling. Results indicate that the respondents, regardless of their qualifications, gender, or years of teaching experience, had limited knowledge of DD, but with a generally positive attitude towards inclusion and management of these learners. Furthermore, it was found that educators had an awareness of the terminology related to the accommodations that the education department granted these learners with DD. However, they were uncertain about the perceived path and nature of accommodations provided to learners. Specific details and related recommendations were explored.",

Using various online resources, especially YouTube videos, website links, e-texts, and journal articles, to make a classroom vibrant, interesting, engaging, and entertaining and to disseminate the best possible knowledge among students was the common trend in the classrooms of the English Department of Daffodil International University (DIU) before the pandemic. However, using teacher-developed materials in the classroom was not a regular phenomenon in the culture of higher education in Bangladesh, particularly in the Department of English at DIU. This paper will explore what kind of positive motivation this shift brought to get the students more engaged in the classroom during the worldwide crisis. It will also discuss whether the teacher-made video lectures helped students understand the topic(s) better. This study intends to address these issues besides inspecting the general pros and cons of using such materials in a tertiary classroom. The data were collected through close-ended and open-ended questionnaires from the selected students and analyzed using qualitative and quantitative research methods. The researchers hypothesized that teacher-made video lectures were more effective given that students' and instructors' similar stress and intonation, pronunciation, and cultural experiences which helped learners comprehend the lesson topics in comparison with materials prepared commercially. This paper also highlights the students' expectations and satisfaction, particularly related to the video lectures made by teachers compared to those taken from popular online resources.",

It is vital to shed light on the experiences of this particular group of teachers because their linguistic and cultural particularities (i.e., non-native speakers of English from the non-Western world) and the characteristics of their future students (i.e., largely monolingual and monocultural) differ notably from those of their counterparts in Western countries. This study examines, through the use of narrative interviews, the transformative learning of a preservice language teacher of English at a Japanese university who participated in a study-abroad program in Sweden. Findings suggested that the participant experienced interrelated, but successive, phases of transformation processes: from having increased confidence to experiencing a disorienting dilemma, and from engaging in critical reflection to performing new roles. Practical implications and research recommendations associated with study-abroad programs for pre-service teachers are also included.",

Applying a quantitative survey methodology, the data was collected from 193 students with disabilities studying in six different universities in Indonesia. Using SmartPLS-3 software, structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data. The results revealed the significance of all three teaching strategies in enhancing students' perception of teachers' efficiency via an underlying mechanism of students' motivation to learn EFL. It is hoped that the study results will contribute to the existing body of literature regarding the teachers' application of strategic ways and the development of students' motivation and readiness for inclusion in EFL studies in the higher education sector. It will also help form a stimulating socio-cultural environment for efficient adaptation of people with disabilities having sufficient command in EFL.",

It offers a discursive analysis of vital issues in implementing effective communicative language teaching (CLT) by surveying 216 teachers about their views on the current English curriculum, their classroom practices, and the barriers they encountered in teaching. A significant gap was revealed between participants' understanding of curriculum expectations and their actual practice. An extended qualitative investigation followed and it was found that there is a demand for acquiring English language competency both within the country and for the purposes of trade, work, and study overseas. Unfortunately, teachers face a shortage in training courses in CLT. Furthermore, implementation of the curriculum in classrooms is affected by the availability of resources for creating communicative and real-life English language contexts, qualifications, knowledge, and experience of teachers, and especially, by the way learning is examined. The study concludes that a full range of inhibiting factors needs to be addressed to improve English language teaching (ELT). It further recommends the development of local and thorough theorisations of ELT rather than undue reliance on overseas trends and experts.",

This study aimed to shed light on the speaking strategies that learners use to deal with problems they encounter when using the target language or to improve the quality of their L2 performance. This study deployed the Oral Communication Strategy Inventory (OCSI) developed by Nakatani (2006) to measure the strategies that students use in oral communications. In doing so, adopting the mixed-methods sequential explanatory design, this study investigated the use of speaking strategies of low and high proficiency English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners in performing speaking tasks. The participants of the study were 23 low and 25 high proficiency students learning English in an institute in Iran. After performing the speaking tasks, the participants filled out the OCSI questionnaire and answered two open-ended questions. The results indicated that low and high proficiency students employ different strategies. While advanced learners used &quot;accuracy-oriented&quot; strategies the most and &quot;message abandonment&quot; strategies the least, &quot;message reduction&quot; strategies and &quot;thinking in English&quot; strategies, respectively, were found to be the most and the least frequently used by elementary learners. The Mann-Whitney U test indicated that of the six speaking strategies, only &quot;message abandonment&quot; and &quot;thinking in English&quot; strategies were found to be significantly different between elementary and advanced English learners. This study contributes in some ways to the understanding of how students' proficiency level relates to their strategy use and provides English teachers with a variety of pedagogical methods to motivate students and enhance their oral production via speaking strategies.",

Findings are based on a cross-sectional study and data that come from observation, journaling, and video recording. There are many beliefs, arguments, and controversies about the importance of being exposed to a language at an early age and the roles that these three vital theories play: behaviorism, innatism and interactionism. Hence, this study sought to investigate the importance of an early start in language acquisition and the role these three core second language theories played in the process. The data collected adds evidence to the theory that age plays a significant role in acquiring a language.

        "description":"It is widely acknowledged that textbooks play a critical role in instilling sociocultural norms, values, and ideologies in learners. Within this role, they are also recognized to significantly contribute to the development of learners' gender roles, particularly during primary education. A great deal of information about gender-appropriate behavior, traits, and social roles projected in the textbooks is available for children to model and imitate. As a result, textbooks can be effectively used to promote or perpetuate gender (in)equality. Unfortunately, in the last few years, Indonesia has witnessed little improvement in gender equity, despite the continuously growing awareness in global contexts. Since textbooks play a paramount role in canalizing gender ideologies or values, this study is aimed at examining whether differences in gender equality in global and Indonesian contexts are reflected in gender representation patterns in English language textbooks (ELTs) distributed internationally and locally. Through a critical image analysis perspective, this study discloses emerging differences between the two ELTs in terms of the frequency of male-to-female appearances, where the international ELT depicts a fairer distribution between the two genders. However, the prevalence of gender stereotyping in three social domains, namely, family, occupation, and leisure activities is evident in both ELTs under examination. This study suggests that ELT authors present an equal direction of learning materials that delineate gender equity in EFL textbooks, particularly those used in Indonesia.",

        "description":"This study aims to develop a valid and reliable measurement tool to determine the financial literacy levels of primary school 4th-grade students. The research sample consists of 567 4th-grade primary school students studying in the Kahta district of Adiyaman. The prepared scale items were sent to the field experts for content and opinion validity, and the scale was and finalized according to their feedback. As the second step, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed to determine the scale's construct validity. As a result of the EFA, a draft scale consisting of 17 items and 3 subdimensions was obtained, which explained 40.9% of the total variance. The factor loads of these 17 items ranged from 0.439 to 0.840. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to verify this draft scale. According to the CFA results, the goodness of fit indices are as follows: X[superscript 2]/df = 1.138, RMSEA = 0.023, GFI = 0.95, SRMR = 0.049, CFI = 0.98, and NFI = 0.82. The values found due to CFA show that the scale items were well validated. The significance of the item discrimination coefficients was tested using the test-retest reliability coefficient, lower and upper 27% values calculated to increase the scale's reliability. The Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient was 0.77 for the overall scale and between 0.65 and 0.67 for the sub-dimensions. It can be said that the Financial Literacy Scale for Primary School Students, which was developed according to the results of the analysis, is valid and reliable.",

        "description":"The study was carried out to explore the pedagogical skills of secondary-level English language (EL) teachers in Bangladesh. Classroom teaching is a challenging job, and more so for English language (EL) teachers as English is a skill-based subject. Teachers are supposed to demonstrate the required pedagogical skills for effective classroom EL teaching-learning. Following the constructivist research paradigm and a multiple case study approach, qualitative data were collected through direct non-participant classroom observations and face-to-face interviews with six EL teachers and other secondary informants. The collected data were analysed by a qualitative data analysis software, NVivo 11 Pro, using thematic analysis. The main findings of the study substantiated that the participating EL teachers had poor pedagogical skills in classroom management, ignored the four skills, built no rapport with learners, failed to retain learners' attention, encouraged memorization, could not motivate the learners, assigned ritualistic homework, taught grammar and vocabulary without contextualization, used teaching aids insufficiently and ineffectively, and exhibited poor planning and preparation for classroom teaching. The paper also discusses the implications of the key findings and proposes some recommendations for the EL teachers and other stakeholders concerned.",

        "description":"This study was designed to see if using Test-Teach-Test (TTT) method via &quot;Telegram&quot; and &quot;Edmodo&quot; can promote EFL Learners' pragmatic awareness. To fulfill this aim, the researcher selected 93 learners from an initial pool of 130 female, pre-intermediate learners based on their performance on the Preliminary English Test (PET). The selected 93 learners were placed into three groups including: experimental group one (N=31), which received TTT via &quot;Edmodo&quot;; experimental group two (N=33), which was exposed to TTT through &quot;Telegram&quot;; and the comparison group (N=29), which received face-to-face (F-to-F) instruction using the TTT method. Prior to the treatment, the three groups took the pragmatic awareness test as the pretest. After the treatment, the researcher gave the three groups the pragmatic awareness test as the posttest. The results of One-way ANOVA revealed that TTT via both &quot;Telegram&quot; and &quot;Edmodo&quot; significantly improved Iranian EFL learners' pragmatic awareness. Moreover, the results demonstrated that TTT employed via &quot;Edmodo&quot; was more effective in enhancing English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners' pragmatic awareness compared to TTT used through &quot;Telegram.&quot; Based on the findings, EFL teachers are recommended to use social networking tools in general and &quot;Edmodo&quot; in particular to promote EFL learners' pragmatic awareness.",

However, most of the research in this area has been done in business and vocational fields and more research is needed in educational and non-business contexts. This study took the initiative to explore the connections among entrepreneurship intention (EI), entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE), entrepreneurial identity aspirations (EIA), entrepreneurial outcome expectations (EOE), and subjective norms (SN) in an English language teaching (ELT) context. To this end, 382 Iranian ELT students were conveniently chosen and requested to complete a questionnaire survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was run. The findings of SEM analysis revealed that ESE and EIA directly predicted EI. Further, SN proved to be a significant predictor of ESE, EIA, and EOE. The results also showed that ESE could significantly predict EOE and EIA. EOE also significantly predicted EIA. In addition, ESE, SN, and EOE could indirectly affect EI through the mediation of EIA. Altogether, this study can help enhance the realization of the stated entrepreneurial concepts, and guide potential entrepreneurship education programs in the ELT context.",

Using a nonrandomized control group pretest-posttest design, the researchers attempted to see if instruction could enhance the intake and noticing of the targeted form. To this end, through convenience sampling, 65 lower intermediate learners of English were selected. The subjects were divided into a control group (N=32) and an experimental group (N=33). The experimental subjects were exposed to the three pedagogical techniques while the control subjects did not receive the techniques. The results of the independent samples t-test showed that the experimental group who had received seven teaching interventions significantly outperformed the control group. Furthermore, the obtained results from a chi-square goodness of fit revealed that during the consciousness-raising phase of the study, the experimental participants paid attention the most to the targeted form. The pedagogical implication of the current investigation is that ESL/EFL teachers can simultaneously implement these three techniques in their classes for the learners to both notice and intake the targeted form. Another implication of this research is that material developers can apply the findings of this study in the materials they are going to develop in the future.",

        "description":"The global COVID-19 lockdowns caused universities to shift from face-to-face instruction to online. Since online teaching was used as a supplement to the traditional in-person instruction before the pandemic in China, Chinese college students were forced to learn in fully online learning (FOL) environments with very little preparation. These first-time online students faced challenges that significantly impacted their confidence and ability to succeed as online learners. Fortunately, the instructor can play a crucial role in conducting early interventions to reduce students' online learning anxiety but understanding these students' expectations of their online instructor is necessary for using appropriate teaching strategies. As a result, this study investigates 439 first-time Chinese online students' expectations of their instructor in FOL environments during the emergent transition. Results indicate that several characteristics are highly expected by new online Chinese learners, such as being familiar with technology, being knowledgeable about the subject, and respecting other students. This study is expected to point Chinese universities and others toward best practices in preparing their faculty members for online course instruction, thus further enhancing first-time online students' learning experiences.",

This kind of problem has a negative impact on English language learning because it does not allow learners to complete learning activities in the same way as sighted learners. Therefore, this phenomenological qualitative research explored the experiences in the teaching and learning process of two VI learners and their teacher in a public school in Latacunga, Ecuador. Data were collected by interviewing and observing these learners and their teacher during their English classes. Then the collected data were transcribed, coded, and thematised using Braun and Clarke's (2006) thematic analysis framework. The study showed that there were positive attitudes towards the English teaching and learning process. These attitudes were an indication of inclusive education and progress in the teaching-learning process. Furthermore, the teaching strategies and materials used successfully provided VI learners with better opportunities to learn English despite the teacher's lack of training. However, there were some negative aspects, such as learning difficulties associated and not associated with the disability, the lack of training and specialized resources for the teachers, and problems of communication and classroom management, all of which hindered these students' learning.",

        "description":"This explanatory mixed-methods study investigated the use of bilingual students' linguistic repertoire for teaching and clarifying grammar. A repeated-measures design was used in which the quantitative data were complemented with follow-up qualitative data. Data were collected in six treatment sessions and from twenty-five all-male twelfth-grade state-school students from Bandar Turkman, Golestan, Iran. A three-phase experiment was carried out involving teaching six grammar lessons to one group: (1) in English only; (2) in the students' local language; and (3) their official language, which was followed by a semi-structured interview. The results of the quantitative data analysis indicated that translanguaging through incorporating students' linguistic assets proved to be an effective strategy which allowed students to have a deeper understanding of grammar. The analysis of the qualitative data showed that language learners had a positive attitude towards this pedagogy and believed that it promoted their language learning, motivation and self-confidence. Implications of the study for language teachers and researchers are discussed.",

        "description":"This research aims to determine the environmental risk perceptions of preservice science teachers (PSTs) and compare their risk scores in relation to different variables. The research participant group consisted of PSTs (N = 205) from the Faculty of Education in the Department of Science Education at Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University in Turkey. The environmental risk perception scale (ERPS) was used as a data collection tool and the environmental risk perception interview form (ERPIF) was used during the interviews. A survey model was used in the research. An enriched design in which quantitative and qualitative analyses were used together was included. Quantitative results from the research show &quot;radiation,&quot; &quot;factory waste,&quot; and &quot;hazardous (chemical) waste,&quot; as environmental problems that PSTs consider the riskiest. The least risky environmental problems were &quot;overgrazing of animals in meadows and pastures,&quot; &quot;commercial fishing,&quot; and &quot;open mining.&quot; According to the qualitative interview results, &quot;air pollution&quot; and &quot;factory waste&quot; were seen as the riskiest environmental problems, while &quot;environmental waste&quot; was considered the least risky environmental problem. In addition, while the females had a higher environmental risk perception than the males, there was a significant difference between the 3rd and 4th levels with 4th level PSTs favoring a higher environmental risk perception. There was no significant difference between the environmental risk perception scores of the PSTs depending on whether they took an environmental course or not; neither was there any significant difference issuing from the educational status of PSTs' parents.",

        "author":["Sengönül, Turhan"],
        "description":"Theorists and researchers have been discussing the relationship between social class background and differences observed in cognitive ability test points of children from lower social class families and their middle or upper SES peers. It has been discussed that for a &quot;more detailed understanding&quot; of these cognitive inequalities, it appears necessary to move beyond boundaries of psychology and consider sociological conditions or contexts as well. It has been asserted that social class background characteristics affect general cognitive ability over time. The present study introduces research exploring the impact of social class background on cognitive abilities of children. In Britain, the 1958 National Child Development Survey (NCDS), the &quot;1970 British Cohort Study&quot; (BCS70) and more recently, the &quot;Millennium Cohort Study&quot; (MCS 2000) conducted at the start of the 21st century are particularly relevant and nationally representative broad-based studies for exploring the impact of social class background on general cognitive abilities of children. It was observed that they provided scaled data and emphasized the impact of social class, particularly the role of parental education as an indicator of social class in surveys. Social class affected children's cognitive abilities as early as primary school years and led to inequalities in their cognitive performance. Children from lower social class and lower socioeconomic status (SES) families &quot;suffered a clear disadvantage.&quot; Poor and disadvantaged conditions of the lower social class adversely impacted and impaired the cognitive ability of children. Given the fact that cognitive abilities play a role especially in later life, adverse impacts and impairment of cognitive abilities are regarded as alarming and undesirable situations in childhood.",

School leadership and learner performance continue to be of great concern in the South African education system. We explore the relationship between school leadership and learner performance from a school leadership and management perspective. Since the attainment of democracy, the South African education landscape has been plagued by poor learner performance. While the reasons are as diverse as the nation itself, the adverse effects of poor learner performance on the school system or the quality of education cannot be overemphasised. As a result, we explored school leadership and learner performance as it relates to the leadership of secondary school principals. Principals' lived stories provided the empirical evidence for this article. The findings reveal that a principal's leadership plays an important role in school management and learner performance.",

A correlational research design was employed to examine such relationships among the study variables. The study sample consisted of 542 pre-school, elementary school, middle school, and high school teachers. The participants were selected using a stratified sampling method. Three different instruments were used for data collection. To determine the normal distribution of the variables, normality tests were used after the data collection. For data analysis, Pearson's correlation was used to determine the relationship among the variables. The effect of study variables on one another were determined using multiple regression analysis. Lastly, the structural equation model was used to examine the mediating effect of communication skills in the relationship between leadership styles and 21st-century skills. The findings of the study show that there were significant relationships among the variables. The findings also indicate that communication skills had an indirect mediating effect on the relationship between leadership style and 21st-century skills.",

Introductory professional development workshops on horizontal articulation, productive pedagogy and lesson study were given to teachers at the onset of the project. Teachers were then tasked to produce two research lessons for grade 10 chemistry using the productive lesson study framework. We utilised inductive thematic analysis to identify the themes underpinning the perceptions of the teachers. Findings show that the teachers improved and deepened their knowledge by learning from each other's perspectives. They had also adopted effective strategies for teaching by reflecting on their students' learning, which helped them address the challenges of integrating and relating different topics into one. Furthermore, they became more aware of their students' prior knowledge which enabled them to address misconceptions. Thus, learning was reinforced, broadened and extended. Participating in the study made a transformative intervention in the teachers as they became more focused on the enhancement of their professional practice as teachers.",

In Japanese LS, teachers work in small teams to plan, teach, observe, analyse and refine individual lessons called research lessons. This study examined a small sample of primary school teachers' perceptions of LS as a professional learning endeavour. The benefits and challenges teachers experienced when attempting to engage in LS was further explored. The study focused on the Fijian primary teaching context, specifically on Year 8 mathematics teachers. Data was collected using a series of class observations and semi-structured interviews in two case-study schools. Analysis of classroom observations and semi-structured interviews confirms that LS provided a useful mode for teachers to talk about their mathematics lessons and open them for scrutinisation by their teaching colleagues. The findings suggest that all the teachers in the two schools found that LS is a powerful learning platform to improve teachers' mathematical knowledge and pedagogical skills. These findings have important implications for the implementation of effective professional learning amongst practising primary school teachers.",

The semi-structured interviews were conducted between November, 2020, and May, 2021, and centered on the leaders' experiences to implement suitable teaching and outreach strategies to continue providing education. The findings suggest that Uruguay's digital learning strategy has grappled with conciliating traditional views on education and digital learning. They further point to not all schools using digital learning resources during the pandemic even when these were available to them and their students, which suggests in some cases a digital divide originated by choice (Gunkel, 2003). The socio-economic gap seems then to depend not so much on the lack of means to acquire technological devices, but on the balance between the traditionally valued education system and the incorporation of new technologies.",

This paper uses semi-structured interviews with parents around the globe to examine the following research questions: 1. How have the spatial and temporal organizations of learning and working in the home been altered throughout the COVID-19 pandemic? 2. What are the alterations in the educational processes and the role of the family in response to the changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic? We found that typical boundaries, those between the roles of family members, between work or school and home, and between leisure time and work time have been fundamentally blurred. While some of these boundaries are more porous than others, families report fundamental shifts, temporary and permanent in the way they organize their home and family, spatially and temporally, and the roles they take on within the family.",

Semi-structured interviews were employed to collect data from 12 Omani participants and data were analysed using thematic analysis. Utilising Bochner et al.'s (1977) Functional Model, the study found that Omani students were generally satisfied with how they were developing friendships with co-national and international students but revealed dissatisfaction concerning forming friendships with New Zealand students. The perceptions of Omani students revealed six factors that influenced their formation of intercultural friendships: (1) willingness to establish intercultural friendships; (2) frequent communication and social interaction; (3) English language proficiency; (4) capability to engage with host nationals; (5) cultural differences; and (6) personality traits. The data suggest that host-national contact is lacking and that international students prefer to contact co-national and multinational friends, which indicates that highly supportive co-national and international social ties significantly predominate. Higher-education providers in New Zealand and receiving countries addressing one cohort of international students will find these findings particularly useful.",

        "description":"To understand how the policies adopted in different parts of Brazil affected learners and learning outcomes and have contributed to widening the digital divide in the country, the researcher conducted an exploratory study with different actors based on semi-structured interviews. The interviewees for this inquiry were a teacher from a public school in Rio de Janeiro, a policymaker working in the secretary of education of Manaus, and a policy analyst working for a non-governmental organization focused on public education. The interviews were conducted in 2021 and centered on each interviewee's perspectives according to their professional standpoint. Based on the questions presented to the interviewees, some topics emerged in the analysis and focused on how educational policies during the pandemic affected three specific groups: students, families, and teachers. The findings suggest that the lack of unifying guidelines from the Ministry of Education made states and municipalities develop strategies constricted by the scarcity of resources at their disposal. Another conclusion is that, despite regional variations, similar issues arose in different parts of Brazil. A last relevant finding was that the digital divide could not be understood independently of other gaps, such as those related to socioeconomic status.",

        "description":"New digital technology areas were added to the New Zealand primary school technology curriculum in 2020. These areas aim to grow students who are not just passive users of technology but, instead, students who understand how computers work, who are digital creators, informed by design processes and critical thinking. The new digital areas of the technology curriculum appear to have created tension between the expectations of teachers and their relative capabilities. Examining three primary teachers' implementation of the new digital areas, this project utilised a participatory action research (PAR) methodology to review teachers' journey of adoption. Findings indicated that implementing the curriculum areas was not as complex as teachers first imagined and that unplugged activities (those without devices) played a significant role in the new digital technology areas' successful implementation in the classroom. The main themes that appeared from the data included levels of teacher knowledge, teacher confidence and curriculum learning area integration.",

        "description":"The change from in-person to in-home schooling and the rapid digitalization of the system impacted the access to education and the quality of the outcomes during the pandemic, but the extent to which digital measures helped school administrators to face that impact is difficult to understand without hearing from them directly. To give those who had to adapt to digital learning some voice, this report discusses the experiences of one national education policy expert, one Learning Resources Coordinator in a public school in Northern Chile, and one Technology Coordinator in an elite private school in Santiago during the process of adapting to digital learning. The goal of these semi-structured interviews was to explore the different digital learning strategies among systems and regions at the school-home level, to then compare them with the national vision and the information that official documents and Aprendo en línea provide. The interviews took place from November, 2020, to February, 2021, right between the end of Chile's 2020 school year and the beginning of the 2021 one. The findings of the exploration indicate that school administrations, but also the type and position of schools within the education system, determined which digital strategy schools adopted and how successful it was. They further revealed the social disparities that prevailed by the lack of digital tools, but also new socio-educational challenges. In all, current Chilean officers stood out as the ones accountable for addressing the digital divide, which in this case can be understood as those who learned how to use digital tools (US National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), 1999), and those who are learning to create them.",

        "description":"Ensuring that learning is participatory and even further democratized seems particularly important at a time when people are kept apart because of a COVID-19 pandemic that thrives on proximity. Whilst learning is based on exchanges, it also benefits from the existence of a learning community, the access to which needs to be equal and taking account of learners' diversity. How is Higher Education equipping itself to adapt to new learning conditions? How can it ensure that it can meet new types of needs? To address these questions, a workshop was organized at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Research on Education and Development (CeiED), Lisbon, on an emerging area of research called 'Citizen Science'. Citizen Science has been gaining popularity in many disciplines. Here, we are interested in how it could help to improve education and learning, as well as how current research in education might also help approaches in Citizen Science to move forward. Reflections on theory were carried out in parallel with a one-day practical online workshop on 'operationalizing Citizen Science', involving researchers in the center's three areas -- education, museology, and urbanism. This article explains the outcomes of this event.",

The study was guided by Daskalogianni and Simpson's 2001 belief systems categories and strategies for non-routine mathematical problems. The participants were 625 grade 11 students from five high schools in Tshwane North District, Gauteng province of South Africa. Data were collected using a mathematics beliefs questionnaire, a mathematics problem-solving test and interview. Quantitative and qualitative research techniques were used for data analysis. It was found that the students held all the three belief systems (utilitarian, systematic and exploratory) at different degrees of intensity and the belief systems and strategies for problem-solving had a weak positive linear relationship, and there were no statistically significant differences among mean scores of the students holding systematic, exploratory and utilitarian beliefs. They apply unsystematic guess, check and revise; systematic guess, check and revise; systematic listing; looking for patterns; consider a simple case; modelling; logical reasoning; no logical reasoning; trial-and-error and use a formula in solving non-routine mathematical problems. Furthermore, it was found that the systematic belief system could explain the students' behaviour in problem-solving more than the exploratory and utilitarian belief systems.",

        "author":["Ram, Rajesh"],
        "description":"In this era of pandemics, asylum seekers, and conflict between super powers, social sciences are a critical subject that can help develop young people who can not only recognise racial and social discrimination but also injustices at a regional, national, and global scale. Mainstream subjects, such as sociology, routinely support learning in the social sciences area. As a science/biology teacher, I wanted to find out whether biosecurity science could be used to support learning in the social sciences area. My interest in biosecurity stems from personal and professional experiences in New Zealand. Further, in my own pedagogical experience, teaching science/biology in schools, I found young people (15-18 years) were unfamiliar with the concept of biosecurity in New Zealand. Considering my experiences, I set out to conduct research to look at the efficacy of using biosecurity in teaching and learning. This paper reports on the experience of one Year 13 social science teacher who used biosecurity content to teach in the social sciences learning area. Classroom observations and individual teacher interviews were used to gather data. The results show that biosecurity content engaged Year 13 social sciences students in the classroom and that the teacher used transformational learning theory to engage his students into undertaking social action related to biosecurity. Given the importance of biosecurity to New Zealand, this paper shows that social sciences as a learning area could support teaching and learning about biosecurity.",

For this purpose, one of the quantitative research approaches, the discriptive survey method, was used in the study. 142 students from 3 different primary schools in Erzurum province participated in the study, using the appropriate sampling method. Demographic information questionnaire, Parental Academic Success Pressure and Support Scale (PASPSS), and Science-Based Entrepreneurship Scale (SBES) were used as data collection tools in the study. The data obtained from the participants were analyzed with the SPSS 26.0 package program. As a result, the science-based entrepreneurship levels of the students change in terms of the length of time the parents study with their children and participate in social sports activities. The pressure on their children's academic success is enhancing in terms of parents' children spending time in the digital environment while studying. On the contrary, the higher their children's educational expectations, the more they support their academic success. Finally, weak and intermediate relationships were determined regarding students' science-based entrepreneurship, parental academic achievement pressures, and support.",

This study employed a techno- pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) survey of 70 pre-service mathematics teachers (29 males, 41 females) from a public university. The goal was to determine which domains, if any, were open for development so that a course could be designed to meet these needs. The data was analysed thematically according to the TPACK sub-domains. The results showed that the pre-service teachers were confident in the areas of pedagogy knowledge, content knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge (90% confidence) and open to improvement in the areas of technology, technological content, and technological pedagogy knowledge (70% confidence). As a result, we suggest creating a 14-week course to increase pre-service mathematics teachers' TPACK of these components in the hopes of bridging the knowledge gap identified in this study.",

        "description":"Turkey is currently home to the world's largest refugee population, with more than 3.7 million Syrians and around 322,000 refugees and asylum-seekers of other nationalities under international protection. Situated in a theory of teacher education for social justice, the current study aims to illustrate the lessons and insights that teacher educators, who are critically engaged in preparing teachers to teach immigrant and refugee students, offer in reimagining preservice teacher education to prepare prospective teachers to teach &quot;all&quot; students, including refugee children. The study employed phenomenological research to investigate the perspectives and the lived experiences of 18 teacher educators who were purposefully selected through criterion, maximum variation, and snowball sampling strategies. The data were collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews with the participants. The findings revealed three key issues for a socially just teacher education system: &quot;who should teach: teacher educator identities&quot;, &quot;teacher education curriculum and pedagogy&quot;, and &quot;contexts, structures, and collaborators in teacher education&quot;. As a letter to educational stakeholders in general and to teacher educators specifically, the present study issues a call to action to revisit our roles and rethink the education of massive numbers of refugee students in Turkey and around the globe to advocate for and enact social justice in and through teacher education. [This study was presented at the annual meeting of the IX International Congress on Curriculum and Instruction (ICCI) in Izmir, Turkey between November 4-6, 2021.]",

        "description":"This study aims to examine the effects of a social studies course supported by stories on the critical and empathetic thinking skills of 4th-grade students. The study was conducted according to the intervention design, a method used in mixed-method research. The 10-week study was conducted in two public schools in Gaziantep in the 2018-2019 academic year. The Critical Thinking Achievement Test developed by Egmir and Ocak (2016) and the Empathy Scale for Children developed by Bryant and adapted to Turkish by Yilmaz-Yüksel (2004) were used to collect quantitative data. Semi-structured interview forms, semi-structured observation forms,and a research diary were used to collect qualitative data. The qualitative data were analyzed by content analysis and descriptive analysis. Quantitative data were analyzed by Shapiro-Wilks test, T-test for unrelated measurements, T-test for related measurements, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. In addition, the effect size of the experimental intervention was calculated using eta squared (n [superscript 2]) for parametric tests and Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (r) for non-parametric tests. The significance level was taken as 0.05 for statistical analysis. The study results show that using stories in the social studies course significantly impacted the development of students' critical and empathetic thinking skills in the experimental group and the experimental intervention had a high effect size. In addition, the students' opinions suggest that cognitive and affective features, language skills, and content such as empathy, interpretation, deduction, fast and meaningful reading, analyzing, knowledge acquisition, inferring, effective responding, and listening can be developed by enriching the social studies courses with stories.",

        "description":"The purpose of the present study was to determine teachers' views on the communication skills of school administrators through a mixed methods design. Although quantitative or qualitative studies deal with the communication skills of school principals according to teacher perceptions, the number of studies conducted in mixed design is quite low. The study's quantitative data were obtained from 368, and the qualitative data were obtained from 20 teachers working in primary, secondary, and high schools in Acipayam and Tavas districts of Denizli province in Turkey. The data were collected via the &quot;Interpersonal Communication Skills Scale of Primary School Administrators&quot; developed by Sahin (2007) and through an interview form developed by the researchers. For the quantitative data analysis, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, t-test and one-way analysis of variance were applied as a content analysis were carried out in the qualitative data analysis. When the results were examined, it was observed that the communication skills of the school administrators were at a high level, and it was revealed that their communication skills were at the highest level in the dimension of &quot;giving confidence&quot;, while it was at the lowest level in the dimension of &quot;giving feedback&quot;. There are significant differences in school administrators' communication skill levels considering the branch's variables, teachers' tenure at school, school type, and the number of teachers. It has been seen that the quantitative and qualitative data of the research support each other.",

We used a collaborative teaching journal and student work as main sources of data, which were analysed inductively at key points before, during and after the focal classes. Findings showed that in these two geographically and culturally distinct contexts, practices related to &quot;correctness&quot; and &quot;academic&quot; language or writing were similarly hard to displace, even when the underlying ideas were unsettled. Our analysis suggests teachers and teacher educators have similar struggles of balance--to both prepare students to succeed within the world as it is now and to prepare them to push against the systems that maintain inequities.",

In March 2020 they were forced to immediately switch to fully remote learning, a platform they had never previously experienced. Since then, they have engaged in hybrid and now fully in person learning through a worldwide pandemic. The school community, whose focus before the pandemic was on social emotional learning and culturally responsive pedagogy, utilized those practices and the strong relationships between staff, students, and families to persevere. The pandemic disproportionately impacted communities of color, like the one this school community is located in. Other inequalities such as food insecurity, job loss, sickness, financial strain, and death impacted the community. Racial trauma and political unrest that was exacerbated during the pandemic also placed a toll on the school community. The staff, families and children of the community joined together with a mission to support one another, strengthen relationships, practice self-care, address trauma and crisis, tackle unfinished learning, and focus on celebrating the community wherever possible to find joy, survive and thrive.",

In the Ghanaian context, some attention has been given to challenges students with disabilities encounter during their university education, while less attention has been paid to the types of support they receive. Using Bronfenbrenner's socio-ecological model as a theoretical framework, this study conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with 11 participants with a disability, made up of 10 undergraduate students and one lecturer (physical disability: n=8 and visual impairment: n=3), to understand the nature and extent of psychosocial supports institutionalized for students with disabilities in universities in Ghana. The participants were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling approaches from one of the largest public universities in Ghana. The interview data were transcribed verbatim, and theoretical thematic analysis was performed. The psychosocial supports received by the students with disabilities that enable them to maintain their status at the university were presented and discussed around three levels: micro-system, meso-system, and exo-system. The result showed that students with disabilities received most of their psychological support from the micro-system. The study concludes with a call to policymakers to consider the important role of stakeholders such as family and peers as well improve support services to enhance the retention of students with disabilities.",

Data were analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative approaches before being synthesized through a pillar integration joint display to merge study findings. Based on self-report data, approximately 60% of participants were experiencing poor-to-moderate mental health at the time of the survey. Participants also expressed dissatisfaction with online learning and felt uncertain about their degree trajectory due to changes and restrictions associated with the pandemic. Based on the participants' responses, recommendations for assisting graduate students during the pandemic were presented. Highlighted by these recommendations was the importance of accessing workspace on campus and the challenges associated with university mental health resources. Overall, nearly 16 months into the pandemic, participants' mental health was negatively impacted by the restrictions.

This lesson plus the inclusion of technology in continental, national, and university policies and strategic plans implicate significant technology integration, especially blended learning, in higher education in the post-pandemic era. However, there lacks sound theoretical frameworks to adequately explain &quot;success indicators&quot; and &quot;success factors&quot; in blended learning. Existing frameworks provided particulars about the impacts of blended learning within certain contexts; none provided a comprehensive analysis of the significant factors that transcend specific application contexts. Moreover, the frameworks did not offer clear conceptions of &quot;knowledge,&quot; &quot;teaching,&quot; &quot;learning,&quot; and &quot;technology&quot; and &quot;its role in learning.&quot; To better inform successful blended learning adoption, this study problematizes &quot;success indicators&quot; and &quot;success factors&quot; based on a configurative review of existing frameworks and emerging theoretical perspectives in higher education.

Nonetheless, this does not simply mean restoring long-standing norms, or reorganizing and perpetuating existing practices as &quot;back to normal,&quot; but discarding and transforming many obsolete assumptions and conventional operations as a &quot;new normal.&quot; As one of the high-performing learning systems around the world throughout the decades, Hong Kong has successfully transitioned from disruptive schooling to a &quot;new normal&quot; throughout the pandemic. By collecting concrete examples emerging and evolving across different layers of Hong Kong's learning system, this conceptual article aims to contribute to the field of comparative and international education by shedding light on ten key principles in terms of shaping a more responsive, resilient, and sustainable curriculum system for all students to thrive in the uncertain and unpredictable environment ahead of them.",

        "description":"Current research typically uses surveys to study parental preferences but examines the responses in isolation from each other. A key insight from the sociology of culture and political psychology, however, is that the meaning of responses in opinion data comes from their relationships with one another. To make progress in understanding the meaning of parental preferences, it is necessary to study their educational belief systems -- the structural configuration of their attitudes related to schools. Using data from Phi Delta Kappa's annual survey on education, I employ correlational class analysis to identify three subsets of parents whose members configure their beliefs about integration, standardized testing, and enhanced academics in distinct ways. These three groups of parents are &quot;convergents,&quot; who see testing and integration as being aligned; &quot;integration divergents,&quot; who see standardized testing and integration as being in opposition; and &quot;academic divergents,&quot; who see standardized testing and enhanced academics as being in opposition. Compared to the full sample, these subgroups display more structure in the associations among their preferences. I also examine if the relationships between preferences and sociodemographic characteristics vary across subgroups and if political ideology predicts belief systems. I conclude with a discussion of implications for policy and future work.",

        "description":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, amid the collective necessity to pivot towards new technologies for teaching and learning, many educators expressed concerns about unequal access for multilingual learners. When online learning relies exclusively on English, students and families who navigate school in multiple languages can be excluded. Over the past two years, a focus on the intersection of multilingualism and equity catalyzed connections across the worldwide community of teachers. Global networks such as the WIDA International School Consortium provided an opportunity for educators to connect with, share, and learn from each other as a community of practice. This essay explains how, in an increasingly interdependent world, a global network of schools and scholars co-created a powerful community to both learn from and contribute to dialogue about equity for multilingual learners during the pandemic.",

        "description":"Brazil has focused on internationalization of the higher education sector, in response to trends across the globe. The main program for promoting internationalization was the Science without Borders program. The paper analyses Brazilian international mobility from a regional perspective, particularly reviewing how inequality affected access to fellowships. The Northeast Region, which historically records higher poverty indicators than the South and Southeast regions, showed average growth statistically equal to the Southeast Region. By comparing access to scholarships and fellowships between the two largest regions of Brazil, this paper sought to analyze any structural change between the Southeast region and the Northeast. The Science without Borders (Ciência sem Fronteira, in Portuguese) program has achieved considerable results. In the first four years of the program, completed student exchange programs increased by 1,620% (i.e., 2011-2014). Despite this, the structure of unequal regional access remained. Using the hypothesis test methodology T for means with different variances, it was possible to evaluate at a significance level of 95%. The two largest regions in Brazil maintained the unequal profile of access to the program. The conclusion is that the growth in the offer of scholarships for internationalization between 2010 and 2019 has not changed the unequal regional profile of access to public education services in Brazil.",

        "description":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many United States brick-and-mortar schools in Spring 2020 rapidly transitioned to emergency remote learning. School leaders grappled with how grades ought to fit within the many unknowns of K-12 remote education. In some cases, schools modified their grading scales to give students greater flexibility to pass courses, and in other situations, schools offered &quot;incomplete&quot; grades in lieu of failures. During this time, state departments of education (DOEs) provided a variety of guidance documents to their school districts. The purpose of this study was to explore the components of state DOE grading guidance during the Spring 2020 school shutdown, along with the patterns of guidance across states. The researchers applied a grounded theory approach to systematically explore the equivalent of 1,444 pages of documents from 48 state DOE guidelines. The document analysis resulted in three primary categories that influenced state DOE grading guidance: &quot;guiding principles,&quot; &quot;student advancement,&quot; and &quot;determining grades.&quot; The researchers conclude by presenting and discussing a three-category model for emergency remote learning grading guidelines for K-12 schools. In the event of another pandemic temporarily affecting the delivery of education to students, policymakers may use this model as a starting point for future recommendations.",

A case study design within an interpretivist paradigm was employed to determine the experiences and perceptions of principals, school management teams (SMTs) and teachers of how principals managed curriculum changes in their schools. Change is deemed a necessary and significant component of educational praxis. Principals, as instructional leaders, are compelled to be the driving force in managing curriculum reforms, ensuring that changes are conscientiously aligned to high learner achievement. Data were gathered through personal and focus-group interviews using a purposeful sample comprising of 4 principals, 13 SMT members and 9 teachers. Findings reveal that principals were not directly involved in the facilitation of curriculum changes but delegated this to deputy principals and heads of departments. For SMTs and principals to effectively manage curriculum changes, a collaborative culture must exist in schools. It is recommended that principals should make a paradigm shift by placing high priority to the procurement of adequate resources, providing support and development to teachers, and keeping abreast with latest trends in teaching. This approach will result in high learner achievement and educational standards.",

We demonstrate that despite the schools' self-claimed progressive stance, its learner participation still exhibits numerous nuanced examples of tokenism. Using a qualitative research design and purposive sampling, we collected data from interviews and observation to examine the possible causes for, as well as consequences of this tokenism. The findings indicate that adults' beliefs about minors' limited capacity remain a structural barrier to learners' genuine participation. This belief threatens the credibility and legitimacy of the Representative Council of Learners (RCL) and this threat to legitimacy, in turn, reinforces the structural beliefs that adults hold and thus perpetuates a cycle whereby genuine participation is compromised and token participation is entrenched. We conclude this article with recommendations to address, mitigate and transcend token participation.",

        "description":"Cheating behaviors have been construed as a continuing and somewhat vexing issue for academic institutions as they increasingly conduct educational processes online and impose metrics on instructional evaluation. Research, development, and implementation initiatives on cheating detection have gained new dimensions in the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) applications; they have also engendered special challenges in terms of their social, ethical, and cultural implications. An assortment of commercial cheating-detection systems have been injected into educational contexts with little input on the part of relevant stakeholders. This paper expands several specific cases of how systems for the detection of cheating have recently been implemented in higher education institutions in the US and UK. It investigates how such vehicles as wearable technologies, eye scanning, and keystroke capturing are being used to collect the data used for anti-cheating initiatives, often involving systems that have not gone through rigorous testing and evaluation for their validity and potential educational impacts. The paper discusses accountability- and policy-related issues concerning the outsourcing of cheating detection in institutional settings in the light of these emerging technological practices as well as student resistance against the systems involved. The cheating-detection practices can place students in a disempowered, asymmetrical position that is often at substantial variance with their cultural backgrounds.",

Applied within a systemic functional linguistics (SFL) framework, the GBA allowed micro- and macro-analyses of essays from 23 first-year university students with low/high proficiency in English and limited/extensive second-language writing experience. Quantitative analysis collected general impression scores from all students' essays at three time points using the SFL rubric. Qualitative investigation applied clause structure annotations to identify and analyse the functional parts of the clause from three metafunctional perspectives--ideational, interpersonal and textual--on descriptive genre essays by EFL learners. Lower-proficiency and novice EFL students demonstrated an improved understanding of the content, events and background information of the essay topics (ideational), and the social and power relationships between readers and writers (interpersonal). By comparison, high-proficiency and experienced students demonstrated a better understanding of the structure and coherence of the essay. This study was limited in developing an understanding of the use of pronouns and auxiliary verbs, which should be addressed in future studies.",

        "author":["Asquith, Steven"],
        "description":"Although an accurate measure of vocabulary size is integral to understanding the proficiency of language learners, the validity of multiple-choice (M/C) vocabulary tests to determine this has been questioned due to users guessing correct answers which inflates scores. In this paper the nature of guessing and partial knowledge used when taking the Vocabulary Size Test (VST) is examined. The analysis evaluates the thought processes of test takers through think-aloud protocols and self-reports. This provides a taxonomy of seven types of guesses used by learners while taking the VST and measures the frequency of their occurrence. Based on qualitative coding, guesses are investigated to determine if they exhibit partial word knowledge which is relevant to the test construct. The findings suggest that both guesses resulting from the use of partial knowledge and random guesses are included in estimates and this has a detrimental effect on test accuracy. The paper concludes that the VST does not provide an accurate measure of the vocabulary necessary for reading due to guessing and the meaning-recognition format. It also suggests that the role of partial knowledge should be considered when producing more sophisticated vocabulary tests in the future.",

        "description":"This exploratory study aims to understand how learning policies and digital learning measures implemented in Honduras during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted access to education, quality of education, and socio-economic gaps. The study involved semi-structured interviews providing a valuable window into the perspectives of individuals across different educational strata in the country. First, the report outlines demographics in Honduras and actions at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic while considering preexisting socio-educational and socio-economic conditions of the country. Next, the study explores accessibility to education opportunities during the pandemic, quality of education opportunities for students of various socio-economic status, and possible concerns for society emerging from a limited access to quality education. Findings indicate that the socio-economic gap is fueling inequalities in access and quality to education opportunities more than in the past with potential negative effects in society at large.",

          "Xu, Yidie"],
        "description":"This conceptual paper aims to review some commonalities between two paradigms: Global Englishes and translanguaging. It does so by considering the postcolonial varieties of English, the challenge of native speakerism ideology and the inclusion of multiple discursive practices in classroom discourse. This paper argues that both paradigms should be recognised and incorporated into current English language education. It further asserts the need to regard the two paradigms as complementary but possibly conflated in future English language education. If the notion of Global Englishes aims to incorporate some issues in English language education, including linguistic imperialism, language policy and planning, translanguaging brings that aspiration into classroom discourse. Both policy makers and language practitioners should recognise the commonalities of Global Englishes and translanguaging to be conflated in current English language education. This paper discusses some proposals for how these two paradigms can be incorporated into English language education from the perspectives of (1) critical pedagogy in applied linguistics and (2) decolonising pedagogy for the inclusion of minority/indigenous languages in language education. This paper concludes that English language education, as well as language education in general, has the multilingual and translinguistic opportunity to promote diversity and inclusion of language use. The field of teaching English as a second/foreign/additional language should address the need for diversity and inclusion in language education from the perspective of Global Englishes and translanguaging not as lip service but by implementing these proposals into practice.",

        "author":["Stinson, Hannah"],
        "description":"This analysis explores the ways in which the digital measures taken by Ecuador's MINEDUC affected the access and quality of education in Ecuador, as well as impacts of these changes on existing socioeconomic gaps in the country. The exploratory study was based on two semi-structured interviews, one with an educational practitioner and one with a policymaker. The first interviewee was the director and sole multi-grade teacher of a public IBE elementary school in a rural zone of Ecuador. This interview took place in December, 2020. The second interviewee had served in a high rank position in the MINEDUC during the pandemic, and this interview was carried out in August, 2021. The analysis of the data indicated that participants conceptualized academic quality as care for the holistic wellbeing of students as well as taking opportunities provided by remote learning for innovation in education. Educational policy, curriculum, and practitioners emphasized these forms of quality education during the pandemic. Another finding was the roles of technology and teachers as educational gatekeepers. Educational access was mediated by access to technology, and/or teacher responsibility to deliver other forms of remote learning. Teacher responsibility was especially high in rural areas where access to technology is scarcer. Finally, digital divide is a term used in recent decades to describe the gap between those who are able to access and effectively use new technologies, and those who cannot (Van Dijk, 2012). Social distancing highlighted the digital divide in Ecuador, but the diversity of measures offered helped to mitigate adverse effects of the digital divide. Even where technological access was limited, the wealth of digital resources developed in response to the pandemic provided professional support to teachers.",

        "description":"To understand how Aprende en Casa contributed to the spread of digital learning and the implementation of the Educational Digital Agenda in Mexico, this report presents the analysis of an exploratory study that consisted of three semi-structured interviews. The interviewees for this inquiry were a leader of the Aprende en Casa strategy at SEP, the director of a basic education public school in Tijuana, northern Mexico, and the director of a private pre-school establishment in Mexico City. The interviews were conducted from February to August 2021 and centered on each interviewee's perspectives according to their professional standpoint. This report presents the results according to three topics that complemented each other among the interviews: the duty of the State as the main provide of education, the progress and setbacks in the use of technologies for educational purposes, and the factors that define the digital divide in Mexico. Findings suggest that the digital divide in Mexico cannot be merely understood as the access to devices and the Internet that the US National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) defined in 1999, but as a holistic set of factors that intervene in the use of technologies: Internet and mobile, social class, economic capital, emotions and perceptions, and public policy, results which are very much in line with Robinson et al. (2015). These factors interact within an already unequal society whose educational backbone is its Secretary of Education, but whose implementation burden ultimately lies on the teaching staff.",

        "description":"The paper aims to explore how head teachers and other education service leaders and their teams have been experiencing shifts in their identities during the last decade of education cuts in Catalonia (Spain), and the possible effects during the current COVID-19 crisis on educational leaders. Our exploratory hypothesis covers the crisis years (2008-2015) and on into the nonrecovery years (2015-2020) until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. During these years, through what Ball (2008) describes as a &quot;ratchet effect,&quot; education cuts and their everyday effects in schools produced learned helplessness (LH) in head teachers and leaders. Theoretically, we propose to examine this malaise from a political angle, seeing it as a disciplinary technology to transform education leaders' identity and practices. To corroborate this, we conducted four interviews with head teachers of different public primary, secondary, and special education schools, and a psychopedagogical service leader in the same semi-rural area in Catalonia. The exploratory results show that the incremental and selective cuts soon became a new normal and created feelings of (political) learned helplessness that may be seen not as negative side effects but as a disciplinary technology that reshaped leaders' subjectivity. At the same time, education leaders carried out some (ir)responsible practices of resistance that can be understood as care of the self and others. More research needs to be done with different agents to capture the complexity and ambiguity of cuts and LH as a political phenomenon.",

In total, 451 relevant publications from Google Scholar and 999 relevant publications from Crossref have been identified by utilizing content analysis. Based on the findings, VR is an immensely new and emerging worldwide topic that involves authors and connections from various countries. Overall, the significant increase in publications on &quot;virtual reality for learning&quot; (as a source of knowledge) in recent years corresponds to the growing trend of Internet searches on &quot;virtual reality for learning&quot; (as a practical demand). These findings contribute to a reference, to promote, to adjust and re-align VR in workplace learning.

We argue that the forces of the market have acted &quot;against institutional isomorphism&quot; in teacher education, as evidenced by the emergence of new graduate schools of education (nGSEs), which are a new population of teacher preparation providers. We suggest that nGSEs are animated by logics based on highly-specialized missions, alternative funding models, and membership in powerful networks that set this population apart from others within the organizational field of teacher education. We also argue that there is remarkable variation and diversification &quot;among&quot; nGSEs, which has resulted in highly specialized &quot;teacher preparation niches&quot; that distinguish each nGSE from other members within the same population through mission-specific branding, publicity, and funding, which in turn prompts increased demand for specialized programs. Finally, we suggest that although nGSEs have been shaped in many ways by the forces of the market, most of them are &quot;not completely dominated by market logics.&quot; Rather, most combine elements of the logic of markets with elements of other powerful logics, forming &quot;hybrids&quot; that create tensions, some of which are highly productive, prompting rapid organizational evolution, including name changes, reorganizations, and new partnerships.",

Besides, it is an effort to organize a case, reorganize it according to new ideas, and concretize and rediscover the case to understand it better. This research aims to determine the effect of RME-based teaching against traditional methods, develop a general opinion, and contribute to the literature. In the study, the meta-analysis method was used to synthesize the results of independent experimental studies examining RME's effect on academic achievement. The data set of the research was created in September 2022. Necessary searches were carried out within the ULAKBIM TR Index, YÖK Thesis, ERIC and Web of Science databases. As a result of these searches, 54 studies met the selection criteria to be included in the meta-analysis. The random-effects model was used in the research. As a result of the analysis, the calculated effect sizes were all positive. In the light of this finding, it has been concluded that in all studies, RME-based teaching was more effective than traditional methods on students' academic achievement in mathematics. A moderator analysis was also carried out to determine whether the effect sizes differed statistically significantly according to the variables &quot;publication type, sample size, and educational stage.&quot; As a result of the moderator analysis, it was concluded that all moderator variables obtained from the GME-based teaching practices significantly affected the combined effect size.",

This paper undertakes a systematic review of research literature on school turnaround policies to explore why this lack of understanding prevails in the field. We find key disconnects between &quot;policy&quot; and &quot;practice&quot; research on the topic of school turnaround. We contend that this divide negates the potential to learn from school leadership policy and practice in turnaround settings. We offer implications of these findings within turnaround research and policy while pointing out that this apparent divide seems to extend beyond the example of turnaround.",

For that, the case study was used as a method, with a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data. The qualitative analysis of the regulations took place through descending hierarchical classification (CHD), word cloud generator and similitude analysis, as well as through the descriptive analysis of the data from the application of a questionnaire to 78 basic education teachers. The results showed a gap between the main regulations issued by the federal and state public authorities that affect basic education in Paraná in the emergency period due to COVID-19 and the teaching practice of teachers, as well as the problems faced in the pedagogical/administrative support that these teachers received. Finally, the information presented in this study proved to be significant to understand the complexity of the educational problems that were intensified and others that emerged, due to remote teaching.",

Furthermore, the levels of school administrators' beliefs, which are assumed to guide their practices based on X and Y theory, were revealed in the research using data obtained during the scale development study; it was determined whether the demographic variables of school administrators differed according to the subscale (X and Y subscale) scores. Relational and causal comparison strategies were used in this quantitatively constructed investigation. Research data were collected from three sample groups in the Erzurum sample. It has been determined that there is a significant difference in the X theory subscale score in favour of school administrators working in primary schools. The study concluded that, based on X-Y theory, the assumptions of school administrators that shape management practices could be determined by the School Administrators' Beliefs in the Nature of Human Scale.",

The intention with this article was to assess the extent to which the circuit managers' views on quality education is affecting its provision at public schools. A Systems Thinking Approach to Leadership guided the study reported on here in which a qualitative research methodology was used. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, observation and document analysis to ensure data triangulation and guarantee the trustworthiness and credibility of the study. Ten participants were purposively selected from 5 districts in the Limpopo province. The findings reveal that circuit managers' varied views on quality education negatively influence their curriculum delivery, support, and responsibilities entrusted to them. As there is little improvement in the provisioning of basic quality education, I argue for the strengthening of the circuit offices and suggest ways in which they could be utilised to improve the quality of basic education in public schools. The implications of the findings suggest capacity building of effective supervision and monitoring of the provision of quality support by circuit managers.",

Reflection is a process of reviewing an experience of practice to analyse it for improvement. In this way, reflective journals could be viewed as a tool that moulds and harnesses the professional development of student teachers. Critical emancipatory research was adopted to reflect on student teachers' journaling as an important assessment tool to be used to empower students with pedagogical content to convey knowledge to learners. In the study we purposively sampled a selected group of 10 PGCE students' reflective journals. We found that students' reflective journals are important tools that shape student teachers' professional identities during teaching practice. Furthermore, we found that student teachers' journaling is an emancipatory platform that allows students teachers to think independently and innovatively to free their thoughts on real teaching and learning situations. We recommend that teacher training institutions should emphasise the importance of journaling in teacher training programmes with a focus on critical thinking and problem-solving innovation.",

This research departed from the efforts of educational institutions to produce graduates with entrepreneurial profiles. Data was collected through questionnaires distributed to 530 respondents who had taken sharia entrepreneurship classes at a university in Indonesia. The results showed that education positively affected students' alerts and self-efficacy. Alertness and subsequent self-efficacy also positively impact entrepreneurial intention and behavior. Next, the entrepreneurial intention has a positive effect on entrepreneurial behavior. Contradictory findings show entrepreneurship education does not significantly impact entrepreneurial intention, self-efficacy, and behavior. The indirect effect found that the mediating role of alertness, self-efficacy, and purpose could fully bridge the relationship between education and entrepreneurial behavior. The results implied the importance of alertness, self-efficacy, and intention to promote entrepreneurial behavior in educational institutions. The study results highlighted an important message for universities and schools to put more effort into students' self-efficacy, vigilance, and personal intention to maximize learning activities on campus.

This case study presents current conditions for cognitive load and Community of Inquiry (CoI) presences in an asynchronous online introductory undergraduate STEM course. Researchers present the novel use of Python script to clean and organize data and a simplification of the instructional efficiency calculation for use of anonymous data. Key relationships between cognitive load and CoI presences are found through validated use of NASA-TLX instrument and transcript analysis of discussion posts. The data show that student presences are not consistent throughout a course but are consistent across sections. Instructor presences are not consistent throughout a course or across sections. The study also explored predominant factors within each presence, confirming previous reports of low cognitive presence in discussions. The highest extraneous cognitive load was reported for understanding expectations and preparing an initial post. These results provide support for improvements to course design and instructor professional development to promote Community of Inquiry and reduce extraneous cognitive load.",

        "description":"Surveys indicate that nearly three-fourths of all college students do not get an adequate amount of sleep on most nights and over half report daytime sleepiness. Sleep deficiency impairs cognitive function, diminishes academic performance, and impedes learning. Asynchronous online education, which provides flexibility to participate in learning exercises and complete assignments at a time and pace that better matches a student's sleep schedule, may offer a solution to this problem. In this study, we examine the impact of reported sleep deprivation on learning outcomes for a group of students who took an asynchronous online class versus a similar group of students who took the same class in a face-to-face (F2F) setting (N = 399). Our results indicate that whereas sleep deprivation, all other factors held constant, significantly negatively affects learning for F2F students, no such influence is observed for online learners. Student counselors and school administrators should therefore consider advising sleep-deprived students to take more online classes to enhance student learning outcomes, which in turn may improve student retention and degree completion.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether online faculty members practice culturally responsive teaching and to explore the characteristics of culturally responsive teaching that are reflected in the responses of 12 instructors in a fully online undergraduate general education course required in the first few terms of enrollment. Qualitative methodology was utilized, involving deductive and inductive coding methods of analysis. Data were coded deductively based on four major categories of cultural competence: sociopolitical/cultural consciousness, community of learners, and high academic expectations. Data were coded inductively for culturally nonresponsive interactions. Findings from deductive analysis revealed partial use of culturally responsive teaching strategies in online classrooms. Results for inductive analysis showed themes of nondifferentiated responses, missed opportunities for addressing linguistic or cultural differences, and lack of encouragement for collaboration or sense of community. These findings indicate a need for further research in culturally responsive teaching in online learning as well as faculty professional development that focuses on culturally responsive teaching.",

Since 2017, the stated intention in Ireland is to use the Pobal HP Deprivation Index to identify schools serving high proportions of disadvantaged students. In spite of this, little published research has compared the performance of the HP index to richer survey measures from large-scale educational assessments or examined its association with educational achievement at primary or second level. This paper aims to assess the validity and fitness for purpose of the HP index for use in identifying schools serving high concentrations of socio-economically disadvantaged students. Analyses draw on Ireland's Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 dataset matched with administrative data. Findings show a strong correlation between school-average HP and other socio-economic measures examined. However, about one-in-five schools are identified as potential 'false positives' or 'false negatives' when school-average HP is used for identification purposes. Also, school-average HP explains less variance in reading achievement than other variables considered. Conclusions recognize the benefits of the HP index but emphasize the need for ongoing examination of the most appropriate methods of identification.",

        "author":["Sutherland, Daniella Hall"],
        "description":"Democratically elected school boards in the United States play a crucial role in school governance because they enable community voice in educational practices and programs. Research on locally controlled boards finds they can be undemocratic and unproductive. However, little research has been conducted in rural or small towns, where local control persists through formal and informal means. This qualitative case study examines two rural, locally controlled school boards to understand how they engage in community-centered democratic governance, and the extent that they influence the technical core of schooling. The process of developing and approving school district budgets is used as illustrative examples of the enactment of local control. The findings from this study explain how small, locally controlled school boards employ elements of democratic governance, and that their community governance influences the technical core of schooling. The study provides a rural counter-narrative to previous research on local control, demonstrating that local control enacted by school boards can be an effective democratic practice that shapes teaching and learning in public schools. The article concludes with recommended practices non-rural school boards and communities can employ to expand democratic participation in their schools, as well as future directions for research.",

With the aim of extending empirical coverage of protest movements in non-English speaking countries, this study examines a Norwegian parental movement called &quot;Foreldreopprør i Osloskolen&quot; (FiO) (in English: Parental Uprising in the Oslo School). We draw on exploratory research based on in-depth interviews with initiators and members of FiO (n=8), as well as documentary and press analysis and an examination of social media sites. The analysis sheds light on the emergence and nature of the movement, parents' main motivations and discourses, as well as the movements' collective action strategies and main successes. The findings highlight how rather than opting-out their children from standardised tests, some Norwegian parents chose to opt-out their children from public schools, while continuing their fight for whole-child approaches in public education.",

In this study, we report survey findings on how administrators and faculty apply the following terms in practice: online learning, hybrid learning, hyflex learning, in-person learning, synchronous learning, and asynchronous learning. Drawing upon the literature, the research team developed survey definitions for each of these terms. The survey then asked participants to rate the extent to which they agreed with the survey definitions. A total of 987 faculty and 1,051 administrators participated in the study. Participants represented the full range of higher education institutions in the United States. The key finding from the study is that there was widespread agreement with the survey definitions, which is contrary to much of the literature that indicates confusion and contention about how online and hybrid learning terms should be defined. In light of the findings, we provide a framework for categorizing common learning modes and the variations that exist within these modes. This study provides a foundation for establishing common language and shared understandings as online and hybrid course offerings (and learning technologies, in general) continue to evolve.",

        "description":"Without a strategy in place, online discussions in asynchronous courses rarely rise above the level of information sharing. As a result, it is important to design discussion strategies that push students further in their interactions with both the content and each other. In this case study, the role-play strategy was examined to determine whether it fosters critical thinking and student engagement. Student discussion transcripts were examined from an online, self-paced human biology course using both Garrison et al.'s four-phase model of cognitive presence and Gunawardena et al.'s five-stage model of knowledge construction to look for evidence of higher-order thinking. Furthermore, the transcripts were examined qualitatively for phrasing that signified evidence of student engagement. The findings indicate that the role-play instructional strategy, when used in online discussions, does support student engagement and critical thinking. This strategy places students in authentic, real-world contexts and enables them to explore different perspectives while engaging with the content to discover new knowledge and construct new meaning. The research presented here also supports evidence that written reflection should be incorporated when employing the role-play strategy. Based on the insights from this study, the researchers have developed a framework for students to achieve deeper, more engaging online discussions. This framework is called the &quot;Framework for Student Engagement and Critical Thinking in Online Discussions.&quot;",

Additionally, little research has examined group work skill development, despite calls for better preparing students for working effectively in groups. The purpose of the current study was to test the effectiveness of a utility-value intervention designed to enhance students' perceptions of online group work and their group work skill use. Students (N = 68) were randomly assigned to view a video and answer an essay question on the usefulness and benefits (utility value) of online group work and group work skills (intervention) or on how online group projects were graded (control). Students in the intervention condition indicated online group work to be more useful and reported greater post-intervention group work skill use compared to students in the control condition. Students further reported their perceptions of the usefulness and costs of online group work, as well as their group work skills and insights, in open-ended items. Overall, the current study provides an effective and easy to implement intervention for improving college students' perceptions of online group work and their group work skill use.",

We created a conceptual framework to organize the literature surrounding online learning anxiety and used this framework to develop an initial item pool of 30 items. The researchers recruited N = 297 undergraduate student participants from four public universities in the southeastern United States from whom we collected and analyzed data for descriptive statistics, internal consistency reliability, exploratory factor analysis, and correlational analysis. Following systematic analytic procedures, we arrived at a three-factor model explaining approximately 65% of the variability in these data and retained 24 items in the final model with minimal cross-loadings in the pattern matrix. We labeled the identified factors as (1) online learner feelings of negativity and inadequacy, (2) online learner apprehension towards personal communication, and (3) online learner discomfort with instructor capacity and communication. The final instrument was named the Online Learner Anxiety Scale (OLAS). Scores on the OLAS were correlated with five other measures hypothesized to relate to online learning anxiety thereby providing stronger construct validity evidence. The OLAS was found to produce reliable scores that can be validly inferred as measures of online learning anxiety among undergraduate students in institutions of higher education. These findings are discussed and framed in light of current literature on online learning and possible future research directions.",

Through a secondary analysis of the annual &quot;Survey of Faculty Attitudes on Technology&quot; conducted by &quot;Inside Higher Ed&quot; each year from 2013 through 2019, this study investigated changes in faculty attitudes toward technology and online education over time. Specifically, the study examined and synthesized the findings from surveys related to attitudes toward online education, faculty experiences with online learning, institutional support of faculty in online learning, and faculty use of technology. Results showed a low magnitude of change over time in some areas (e.g., proportion of faculty integrating active learning strategies when converting an in-person course to a hybrid/blended course) and a large magnitude of change in other areas (e.g., proportion of faculty who believe that online courses can achieve the same learning outcomes as in-person courses). These results reveal that, prior to the widespread shift to remote and online learning that occurred in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, faculty perceptions of technology and online learning were static in some areas and dynamic in others. This research contextualizes perceptions towards online learning prior to the pandemic and highlights a need for longitudinal studies on faculty attitudes toward technology use going forward to identify factors influencing change and sources of ongoing tension.",

There are two global themes, &quot;Create Connections&quot; and &quot;Know Your Program.&quot; The &quot;Create Connections&quot; global theme is supported by three organizing themes: (a) Communication and Feedback, (b) Building Relationships and Community, and (c) Investment in student's personal and academic growth. The &quot;Know Your Program&quot; global theme is supported by organizing themes (d) Program Requirements and Policies and (e) Technical skills. Based on the data, three recommendations are presented to aid online graduate advisors, including building trusting relationships with advisees, building a community of students, and knowing program policies, requirements, and technology platforms.",

Researchers at a mid-sized university in the southeastern United States leveraged Christensen's (2011) disruptive innovation theory as a guiding framework to explore student satisfaction with this instructional method. This first phase of the study measures learner satisfaction with this approach using the Ritzhaupt (2019) Electronic Learning Satisfaction Survey (eLSS). Preliminary results suggest that learners (n=145) rated their experience with this disruptive technology above average on all Likert scale questions on the eLSS. Identified best practices for instructional design using similar approaches include repeating the game rules, reframing the purpose beyond the game, helping students appreciate their community, guiding students to lead their own posts and gain reactions, and thwarting those trying to game the system. Initial findings across multiple courses suggest that instructors can leverage the gameful experience and social media-like engagement to foster critical connections and increase course satisfaction.",

        "description":"The purpose of this research was to gain an understanding of the unique professional development needs related to the struggles of online adjunct professors. Twenty-one participants from within a purposefully selected group of online adjunct professors in the United States participated in this qualitative investigation. Data were gathered in two phases: the first phase consisted of a six open-ended-question Qualtrics questionnaire completed by the 21 respondents, and the second phase was follow-up interviews with six of the 21 participants along with the collection of pertinent documents related to professional development. Results indicate that online adjunct professors receive varied and limited professional development, and therefore need more training in the following major categories: course preparation and technology awareness, access to course materials and online resources, and improved communication interaction and engagement. The participating online adjunct professors confirmed that training within these professional development areas would be most beneficial for all stakeholders and should be provided by their employing institution or attained through self-initiated methods.",

There are a variety of online tools that assist the development of student higher order thinking. In this paper, a process of scaffolding for the writing of higher-order questions enabled through peer learning activities is explored. Data collected over two years across five cohorts shows that there was an overall statistically significant improvement in the number of higher-order questions produced by students at the end of each unit. The findings reveal a viable peer teaching tool that can easily be embedded into existing programmes to develop the necessary critical thinking skills for higher education students.",

This study aims to find out the contribution level of entrepreneurship education and creativity taking into account factors that support entrepreneurs' intents. This type of investigation was ex post facto with a quota sampling technique of 76 vocational high school students. The data collection was done through tests to measure entrepreneurial knowledge and instruments to measure entrepreneurial intentions. The data analysis technique employed a regression test to determine the relationship and the magnitude of the influence between variables. The study has found that there is a positive correlation between entrepreneurial education and students' intent in entrepreneurship. The contribution of change in entrepreneurship education partly to intent in entrepreneurship was 32.60%. There is a positive contribution to creativity in students' intents in entrepreneurship. The contribution to allow for creative change in entrepreneurial intent is partially 18.40%. There is a positive contribution between entrepreneurship education and creativity in students' intent in entrepreneurship. Other supporting factors are self-efficacy and locus of control.",

Therefore, a review needs to be conducted to determine what steps the teacher may take for coping purposes in handling the behavior problems of CSEN, to determine the predictors for handling the behavior problems of CSEN, to identify the analysis basis for determining teacher predictors, and to figure out the effects of the behavior of CSEN based on the predictors chosen by the teacher. A survey was conducted on 109 teachers of CSEN. This research used a Google Forms questionnaire containing a list of statements to be chosen by teachers as instrument, and analysis was carried out by computing the frequencies at which the teachers chose the statements in percentage and by comparing teachers' statements on the way they handled behaviors. The results show that the teachers were more inclined toward problem-focused coping (PFC), the predictor chosen was intimacy control, the teacher directed the children to do a task at the time a behaviour problem arose, and in choosing predictors, the teachers would rather calm the children down and give them comfort, making the children calmed.",

        "description":"Teacher training has long relied on experienced school mentors as role models for novice teachers. However, qualifications and experience alone cannot remain the prerequisites for teacher leadership in 21st century schools. How can experienced school mentors collegially mentor new teachers into leadership, without abrogating their responsibilities? In this article, a constructivist approach was explored to mentor new teachers into leadership with the focus on establishing symbiotic relationships based on the mutual continuous professional development (CPD) of experienced school mentors and novice teachers. A multi-faced approach to leadership is proposed. Data regarding the perceptions of 241 final-year student teachers of their mentors' collegial leadership competencies were collected using a questionnaire. The findings indicate the positive perceptions that the student teachers had of their mentors' collegial leadership competencies. In the study reported on here, the focus was on the perceived characteristics of experienced school mentors to assist student teachers with work-integrated learning. The findings provide insights into enhancing the interpersonal collegial competencies of experienced school mentors to improve the school-work-integrated knowledge of student teachers.",

        "description":"The purpose with this article is to amplify the significance of effective mentoring of pre-service teachers in order to address classroom matters and situational issues associated with teaching practice. Open-ended interviews were conducted with 10 pre-service teachers about the ways in which they experienced mentoring during their teaching practice. The majority of preservice teachers have raised concerns that once they were dispatched to schools, they found themselves without adequate mentorship from in-service mentors and mentor lecturers. The study was contextualised in less-privileged South African schools and involved fourth-year Bachelor of Education and Postgraduate Certificate in Education pre-service teachers as participants. Findings suggest that the common denominator among the documented lived experiences of the interviewed pre-service teachers was a lack of information about the difficulties that in-service teachers in less-privileged schools faced on a daily basis, especially in townships or rural areas where facilities such as computer rooms, smart boards and data projectors are not available. The Situativity theory was used to frame the argument that the lack of effective mentoring that pre-service teachers received resulted in them not successfully adapting to the situation in less-privileged schools during teaching practice.",

        "description":"To make it easier for students to learn the contents of physics and increase their motivation to learn, physics teachers need to apply different teaching strategies. With this study we aimed to examine the impact of the modified Know-Want-Learn (mKWL) strategy in physics teaching on elementary school students' metacognition. The pedagogical experiment with parallel groups was applied to determine whether the mKWL strategy affected students' metacognition. The students in the experimental group were taught by applying the mKWL strategy with a specific chart. The chart consisted of columns: T -- What I think and what I know, Q -- What questions I have, H -- How can I find out, L -- What I Learned (TQHL chart). The students in the control group were taught (the same physics curriculum) by using the traditional teaching model, without this TQHL chart. A questionnaire on metacognition was used for the evaluation of sixth-grade students' metacognition. The statistical analysis of data included descriptive statistics, as well as paired sample t-tests and independent sample t-tests. Research results, based on the scores obtained using the questionnaire on metacognition, imply that the use of the proposed mKWL strategy increases students' metacognition. Considering the positive effect of this teaching strategy on students' metacognition, its further application in other teaching subjects is planned as well as the training of a large number of elementary school teachers for its application.",

Research sample consisted of 90 students and 7 lecturers from Arabic major. Research data were collected through questionnaires and analyzed descriptively based on the percentage formula. The results showed that the main problems of students in reading Arabic texts without &quot;harakat&quot; could be classified into four, namely, weak mastery of Arabic vocabulary, weak mastery of Arabic grammar, lack of interaction with Arabic texts, and weak mastery of effective strategies in reading Arabic texts with no &quot;harakat.&quot; In the view of the Arabic language lecturer, the reconstruction of &quot;nahwu&quot; material for the purpose of reading Arabic without &quot;harakat&quot; can be done by selecting relevant and functional materials to read and understanding Arabic sentences and texts at the word, phrase (&quot;murakkab&quot;), sentences, levels as well as at the level of analysis of the function and role of words in sentences. The results of the study would be helpful in understanding many important aspects of Arabic grammar that have not been mastered well by students, and due to which they experience difficulties in reading Arabic texts without &quot;harakat.&quot;",

        "description":"This study examined the impact of requestee's gender on the choice of request strategies by female speakers of Saudi Colloquial Arabic. A Discourse Completion Test consisting of twelve situations was used to collect data from two groups of participants. The first group consisted of 40 Saudi females directing their requests to female requestees. The second group consisted of 40 Saudi females directing their requests to male requestees. The collected data from the two groups were compared and analyzed using Blum-Kulka, House, and Kasper's (1989) coding scheme of request head act strategies. Findings suggest that Saudi females varied their request strategies based on the gender of requestee. While they tended to use more direct request strategies with females, they tended to use more indirect request strategies with males. A remarkable finding revealed by this study relates to situations in which the rate of imposition is high. While Saudi females tended to use more indirect request strategies with females in these situations, most of them refused to make a request to males regardless of the power and social distance between interlocuters. This study's findings, however, have to be understood in terms of the specific nature of the cultural norms of Saudi society. Since Saudi Arabia is a gender-segregated society, it is expected that females would keep distance from males who are not first-degree relatives. This would normally entail the use of higher level of indirectness and avoidance of requesting weighty personal favors.",

The participants were 11 lecturers of Bioprocess Engineering Study Program at Institut Teknologi Del (IT Del), Indonesia. The objective of the checklist instrument was for the lecturers to monitor their students' understanding about the lessons given each week. The data generated from the instrument was analysed descriptively. The results found that pre-class, in-class and outclass are important parts of learning in flipped classroom setting. The data showed that 56% of students achieved good understanding of the knowledge taught by their lecturers. The same idea as in-class, attendance checking and interaction between students and lecturers had a key factor in the learning process. It was found that students' understanding increased by 20% (very good), 62% (good) and 18% (moderate) through questions and answers, discussions, and tests at the end of class. Those were the modes of interactions that had been done in class. In line with an out-class checklist, giving assignments and feedback could improve students understanding into the level of very good (61%), good (27%) and sufficient (10%). with using a checklist tool, participants in this study self-monitored their progress in a flipped classroom while taking distance learning courses online to improve the quality of their class.",

The result of the research was a learning trajectory consisting of three activities; first, students explore their knowledge of egg racks which are very close to students' self-life, secondly, students change the problem into a bar form based on students' knowledge of egg racks, then students change the problem into fractions and students change the fraction with the denominator one hundred, third, students solve the percent problem in a more complicated form. The activities that have been produced and tested on percent learning using the context of an egg rack, can help students to better understand the concept of percent.",

When GBV occurs in schools, it severely endangers access to education. Using the third round of data of the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) from over 60,000 Grade 6 learners across 14 countries, we examined the relationship between GBV in primary schools and learners' absenteeism. Findings indicate that sexual harassment perpetrated by teachers significantly increases learners' absenteeism. In contrast, effects were less clear when the perpetrator was a fellow learner. Effects found are similar in magnitude for girls and boys. Violence prevention education programmes and stricter punishment for offenders are needed to establish a safer school environment and overcome harassment-related barriers to learning.",

        "description":"The shortage of secondary STEM teachers has led to periodic calls over the past four decades for federal intervention. For more than 15 years, the National Science Foundation Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program has constituted the most important response at the national level to these calls. The main activity is direct support to undergraduate students and degree holders to become K-12 STEM teachers. Here we examine the Noyce program by looking beyond the qualities of particular university programs and measuring long-term outcomes on a statewide level. We accomplished this through a collaboration of eight Texas universities that pooled data on Noyce scholars supported as far back as 2003. Making use of a state longitudinal dataset, we examined whether recipients of Noyce Scholarships are more likely than other math and science teachers to remain in teaching, determined where Noyce scholars taught, and estimated student learning in classes taught by Noyce Scholars. Noyce Scholars are more likely than other STEM teachers from the same universities to teach marginalized students, and students of Noyce Scholars obtained higher value-added scores in mathematics than students of other teachers at the same schools. These are some of the most important intended outcomes. However, Noyce Scholars did not stay in teaching as long as other STEM teachers from their universities, and they were more likely to switch away from schools with low-income students. The Noyce program currently operates far below the scale needed to start reducing national STEM teacher shortages. We conclude with prospects for expansion and modification of the Noyce program.",

A qualitative research approach was employed along with the interpretivist paradigm to underpin the study. We used a qualitative case study approach to allow for an in-depth understanding of the views of the teachers by talking to them directly. Semi-structured individual and focus-group interviews were used as data collection methods. Participants in the study included 5 Grade 9 EMS teachers and 5 Grade 10 accounting teachers who were conveniently and purposively sampled from 5 secondary schools. A thematic analysis approach was adopted to analyse the interview responses. The findings of the study reveal that teachers understood that EMS was an integrated subject. However, Grade 9 teachers struggled to teach EMS in an integrated manner and this hampered the teaching of financial literacy. The challenges in teaching EMS are aggravated by the lack of relevant pedagogical strategies, the lack of adequate knowledge of the subject and missing pertinent foundational content in the EMS curriculum and textbooks. As a result, learners enter the FET phase without being adequately prepared to study accounting in subsequent grades.",

        "description":"In this article we report on an investigation into developing people and serving the community at faith-based schools through a servant leadership theory lens. Relevant literature was reviewed, and data were collected from school leaders by means of individual semi-structured interviews. Twelve participants were purposively selected from schools classified as top-performing schools in Gauteng, a province in South Africa. The interviews with these participants were audiotaped and transcribed, and the data analysed by using a process of abductive data analysis. The following measures were employed to review the servant leadership practices of faith-based leaders: being a serving leader, fostering people growth, and enhancing community relationships. Overall, principals were found to be effective leaders involved in a hands-on manner in both task-orientated and person-orientated activities. The servant leadership conception whereby &quot;other&quot; interests are regarded as more important than own interests serves as the basis for people development and there is a clear awareness that the enhancement of community relationships is a key facet in the communication that takes place between school principals and community members. The participants also showed concern for school-led development activities. It was evident that participating school staff were personally involved in facilitating learning activities such as collaborative workgroups and workshops and in creating a supporting structure for staff development. Apart from recommending that principals' leadership behaviour in the abovementioned areas is consolidated, we strongly support their involvement in related matters such as coping with contextual realities and enhancing community relationships. The improvement of community relationships is eventually a challenging task to be exercised by principals within the social, political and demographic contexts of faith-based schools.",

As with any new technology, understanding how users adopt these technologies is still unclear. In the study reported on here we proposed a theoretical model shaping the determinants of teachers' attitude toward e-textbooks. Specifically, we identified three contextualised factors (ease of use, usefulness, and concerns) as the factors of adopting e-textbooks. In addition, we examined teachers' use of e-textbooks. A mixed-methods research design was used in which quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analysed. The results show that teachers held positive attitudes toward using e-textbooks in their teaching and used them as instructional aids. The results might inform education decision-makers who are planning to integrate e-textbooks into their schools in line with digital transformation and the knowledge society.",

The results reflect settings that value democratic coexistence at school and in society, although when we delved a bit deeper, we found aspects that still required more work.

BPT (Basic Proficiency Test) score has positive significant relations with entrepreneurship, cognitive practices and technical skills and CGPA has positive significant relations with academic self-efficacy scale sub-dimensions. As the work experience period of the students increased, the acquired level of entrepreneurship also increased. Moreover, as their academic self-efficacy increased, their entrepreneurial intentions also increased. The results obtained include empirical evidence that academic self-efficacy has a statistically significant. and positive impact on entrepreneurial intention. Therefore, higher education institutions should focus on improving the academic performance of students studying in undergraduate, associate and graduate education in order to increase their intention to create new job opportunities. Since this study only includes the opinions of the students of the faculty of sport sciences, it is recommended to expand the sample group and investigate the effect of different variables on entrepreneurial intention.",

The sample of the study, which was conducted using the survey model, consisted of 216 Social Studies and Science teachers. Data were collected according to the gender, age, branch, professional seniority, education level and social media usage time of the sample. The Social Media Teacher Student Interaction Scale developed by Korucu and Usta (2017) and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale developed by Dilbaz (2001) were used as data collection tools. Since the teachers' responses to the items in the scale showed normal distribution, the data were analysed using parametric tests. Some of the results obtained from the research are as follows: it was determined that there was no significant difference in the opinions of teachers in terms of gender, branch, professional seniority, education level and duration of social media use. However, it was concluded that there was a significant difference in terms of age variable in terms of teachers' use of social media in student interaction. According to this result, it was determined that teachers between the ages of 21-30 use social media more for student-teacher interaction.",

These days, when psychological problems are more noticeable, especially in young athletes, it is possible to trigger various anxiety disorders such as depression, anxiety, and stress caused by the pandemic. Considering that psychological characteristics such as depression, anxiety, and stress in young people may increase the risk of psycho-social disorders, this study aims to examine the effect of the fear of COVID-19 on the depression, anxiety, and stress levels of undergraduate athlete students and to seek an answer to the question of whether psychological resilience has a mediating role. The research was carried out with 372 athlete students studying at the undergraduate level and continuing their sports lives actively. Structural equation modeling was used to determine the direct and indirect predictive effects between variables in data analysis. The results of the study show that psychological resilience has a significant predictor effect on depression, anxiety, and stress.",

This focus on cognitive processes is one of many ways that reading is imagined as an individual pursuit. Through a lens of post-human subjectivity, I consider a narrative of a key moment of collective motivation in the classroom as situated in a larger context. While I draw upon empirical evidence in the form of interviews, narrative inquiry takes me toward questions that evoke. Notably, I find that the ubiquity of collective endeavors appears as solo achievements. As a result of my narrative-inspired thinking-through-theory, I argue that collective motivation is a feature of post-human subjectivity, and that we might generate new possibilities for learning as assemblage in our teaching. To elaborate, I weave together narrative and diagrammatical modes of thinking, storytelling and description of my analytical process, to evoke questioning.",

        "description":"Standardized testing and accountability are currently unavoidable components of Texas Public Education. Through years of push-back, parents and educators have demanded that Texas consider alternative testing options that would reduce the high-stakes testing burden on students and schools. In 2015, the State of Texas passed legislation requiring the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to undertake a study of authentic writing assessment. This paper draws on data from a larger qualitative study to illustrate the complexity of teacher decision-making in the assessment process, provides further consideration into the influences of scoring calibration such as teacher knowledge, and highlights the need for intentionally designed professional learning about scoring as a means to mitigate differences and ultimately improve inter-rater reliability.",

        "description":"What is bias? A review of the library literature reveals no attempts to define the concept. Nor does it reveal systematic attempts to develop interventions that teach the identification and evaluation of bias. Current pedagogical approaches (checklists and bias charts) tend to assume a self-evident definition that categorises bias as unquestioningly bad and disqualifying. Current approaches, however, fail to recognise the cognitive complexity of decoding bias within a source. A decoding process includes identifying the type of bias, determining an objective baseline, recognising biased features, and analysing bias's impact. Based on work done from several fields--argumentation theory, media bias, media literacy, and history education--this paper proposes an operational definition of bias and a practical framework for conceptualising a process to identify and evaluate bias. This paper will explore the limitations of this framework, as well as existing source evaluation paradigms. If librarians want to prepare individuals to participate in a post-truth society, where disinformation weaponises bias by appealing to emotions and beliefs rather than facts, an inclusive and nuanced conception of bias is a necessary component of library instruction.",

        "description":"The purpose of the current study is to determine Turkish as a foreign language learners' tendency to use communication strategies. Quantitative and qualitative research models were used together in the study. The survey method was used in the qualitative part and the phenomenological method was used in the quantitative part of the study. The study group of the study is comprised of 77 participants from 13 different nationalities with Turkish language proficiency levels of A2, B2 and C1. Quantitative data were collected by using the &quot;Oral Communication Strategies Inventory&quot; and qualitative data were collected by using a semi-structured interview form. Descriptive analysis was performed on both the quantitative and qualitative data. The results of the study revealed a strong correlation between the level of competence and the tendency to use strategies. Participants with low language proficiency levels tend to use strategies including the behavior of moving away from the verbal boundaries of the target language. On the other hand, those with a high level of language proficiency tend to use strategies that include the effort to stay within the boundaries of the target language. In the qualitative dimension of the study, 10 different communication strategies were determined based on the episodic memories and experiences of the participants. These are strategies mostly used in compensatory functions.",

The purpose of this research was to explore how community college librarians, an understudied population, understand their teaching role. Online interviews lasting fifteen to seventy-four minutes were conducted with thirty community college librarians who provide information literacy (IL) instruction. Participants were recruited by direct email invitation and were asked questions relating to their instructional practices. Interview transcripts were analysed qualitatively, with a specific focus on participants' experiences of the teaching role. Participants reported positive relationships with students, and significant challenges in their relationships with disciplinary faculty and administrators. Their lack of formal preparation for the teaching role led to infrequent and informal assessment and evaluation practices. Pre-service education for the teaching role could be strengthened to provide librarians with the skill set and confidence to provide more effective instruction. Instructional quality is critical as the importance of IL is increasingly recognized as key to academic, workplace, and personal success.",

The research sample consists of 353 students studying at Isparta Süleyman Demirel Science High School. Research data were collected with a structured questionnaire. In the first part of the structured questionnaire consisting of three parts, there are questions to determine gender and grade, in the second part there are questions to determine the music listening habits of the students, and in the last part there is the Intangible Cultural Heritage Attitude Scale, the validity and reliability study of which was conducted by Gürel and Çetin (2019). The analyses within the scope of construct validity of the measurement tool were made and evaluated to be appropriate. In addition, as a result of the reliability analysis applied to the entire scale, Cronbach's Alpha result was calculated as .871. Independent samples t-test and one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyse the data obtained from the research. According to the results of the analyses, when the music listening habits of high school students and their attitudes towards intangible cultural heritage elements were examined, it was determined that there was no significant relationship according to gender, grade level, music listening tool, frequency of allocating special time for music listening and Turkish lyrics of music. In addition, it was determined that there was a significant difference between the type of music students listened to and their attitudes towards intangible cultural heritage elements.",

        "description":"The Fourth Industrial Revolution and rapid developments in technology increase the need for improving the teaching-learning process and teacher performance. Research shows that empowerment has a significant and positive effect on teachers' organizational behavior. Schools are living spaces where teachers spend most of their lives. As long as teachers' perceptions of the quality of work life are high, it is expected that the degree of achieving the goals of the school will be greater. In this article, it is evaluated how empowerment in their school affects their own work life quality according to teachers' perceptions. Quantitative design was used in this study. The data of this research were collected from 298 teachers determined by random sampling method working in the central districts of Denizli province during the 2020-2021 academic year.235 (79%) of the teachers participating in the study were female and 63 (21%) were male. The Teacher Empowerment Scale developed by Hidiroglu and Tanriögen (2020) was used to measure teachers' perceptions of empowerment. The Quality of Work Life Scale, which was adapted to Turkish and educational organizations by Akar and Üstüner (2017), was used in order to determine teachers' perceptions towards their work life quality. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to predict the quality of work life by using the &quot;cooperation&quot;, &quot;professional development&quot;, &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;status&quot; sub-dimensions of teacher empowerment. Teacher empowerment affects the quality of work life. Accordingly, &quot;cooperation&quot;, &quot;professional development&quot;, &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;status&quot; which are the dimensions of teacher empowerment predict the quality of work life positively and significantly. The predictive variables &quot;collaboration&quot;, &quot;professional development&quot;, &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;status&quot; dimensions explain 58% of the total variance of the predicted variable &quot;quality of work life&quot;. However, according to the standardized regression coefficients ([Beta]), the order of importance of the predictor variables on &quot;quality of work life&quot; is &quot;trust&quot;, &quot;status&quot;, &quot;collaboration&quot; and &quot;professional development&quot;. In this study, it is recommended to examine the &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;status&quot; dimensions, which were determined as the variables with the highest impact on &quot;quality of work life&quot;, separately.",

In summary, students carried out almost all their academic reading in electronic format, due to the restrictions in place. However, in common with research conducted prior to the pandemic, their preferences for reading in print format remained. Students also report doing less of their assigned readings, feeling more tired as well as reporting other negative health benefits from excess use of screens and devices.

The study employed a qualitative case study method. The working group consisted of 5 science teachers who work in secondary schools affiliated with the Ministry of National Education in Turkey and who have master's degree. This study deployed the &quot;Semi-structured Preliminary Interview Form&quot;, &quot;The Evaluation Rubric related to the Activities Based on Argumentation-Based Science Learning &quot; and &quot;Semi-structured Final Interview Form&quot;. Content analysis and descriptive analysis were used during data analysis. The results revealed that the teachers' perceptions towards ABSL before the implementation were mostly grounded on giving opinions and argumentation. Four teachers did not use ABSL in lessons before and they did not prepare any activities. On analyzing the activities prepared by the teachers through use of ABSL, all the teachers were identified to consider grade level, unit, subject area, learning outcome and associating them with daily life while preparing the activities. The teachers were also determined to use concept cartoons, competing theories with stories, and experiment design techniques in the activity papers. Besides, the Toulmin argumentation model steps were taken into consideration in the activity papers. Concerning the analysis of last interview data, teachers' perceptions towards ABSL were found to be opinions, claims, opposing ideas and arguments. The teachers also indicated that they avoided creating misconceptions and that they took into account the student and grade levels in the ABSL activities. In addition, the teachers noted that preparing the activity is time-consuming and unsuitable for every subject. This study is paramount in terms of giving information to teachers and pre-service teachers related to the teachers' views on ABSL and how they have prepared ABSL activities.",

        "description":"This study aimed to analyze the articles examining five teaching sets commonly used in teaching Turkish as a foreign language from different perspectives by using meta-synthesis method and to reveal the research tendency in the field. For this purpose, 136 articles published in different journals in the ULAKBIM TR index, Dergi Park, ASOS, and Google Scholar databases were accessed by searching the identified keywords. The articles have been analyzed in terms of the publication year, subject area, index, method, name of the teaching set examined in the article, book type, level/grade, sample group, and data collection tool if exists. As a result of the analysis, three main themes were formed: articles analyzing teaching sets, articles taking opinions about teaching sets, and articles analyzing teaching sets and taking opinions about these sets. Under these themes, the subject areas of the articles, the teachings set, the levels, and the grades were analyzed in detail. It was realized that the number of articles that took opinions about the teaching sets and the number of articles that both analyzed and took opinions about the teaching sets was limited. According to the results of the research, it was detected that the document analysis method was mostly used in the articles, the textbooks included in the teaching sets were mostly included in the article samples, and the teaching sets were mostly analyzed in terms of culture transfer/cultural elements and vocabulary. It was also concluded that in articles examining a single teaching set, basic and intermediate level text and workbooks were included more in the article samples, but in articles examining more than one teaching set, there was a gradual decrease from basic level to advanced level.",

        "description":"During the Fourth Industrial Revolution, especially in the internet age, digitalization and smart uses have significantly increased today, and they also deeply affect life and learning forms. Since language education is a difficult process, learners must make great efforts in the world. In this sense, the importance of traditional methods has decreased with the increase of technological inputs. In this study, the potential of using artificial intelligence technologies in language learning, which have radically increased worldwide, is analyzed. In addition to this, artificial intelligence language applications in Turkey and Turkish are examined. Here, it is claimed that, with artificial intelligence applications, language learning has become easier with some visual exercises and especially a non rote-oriented approach there. Moreover, it is noticed that Turkey has started to develop language learning programmes based on artificial intelligence, and despite the shortcomings, some productive artificial intelligence applications have been developed to learn Turkish. These findings suggest that the modern society necessiates innovative technology in teaching language or any subjects, and it is important to understand the advantages of employing a collaborative technique in learning the subjects.",

With a quantitative research design, a correlational survey model was utilized for this study. The study was conducted with 200 secondary school Turkish language teachers. This study used the Curriculum Literacy Scale and Teacher Performance Evaluation Scale as data collection instruments. The obtained data were transferred to the statistical program Jamovi 2.2.5, where statistical operations were performed. Standard deviation, mean, frequency, and percentage were used during data analysis. The relationships between dependent and independent variables were examined using the independent samples t-Test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Correlation analysis (Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient) was conducted to determine the relationships between scales and their dimensions. Utilizing linear regression analysis, the predictive role of curriculum literacy in teacher performance was determined. Results demonstrated a positive and highly significant correlation between curriculum literacy and teacher performance; curriculum literacy was a significant predictor of teacher performance. In addition, curriculum literacy did not differ significantly by gender or professional experience. There was also a significant difference in teacher performance in favor of female Turkish language teachers, but there was no significant difference in teacher performance based on their professional experience.",

In the study reported on here, we used the qualitative research approach and a case study research design was adopted. Five primary school teachers were recruited through purposive sampling to participate in the study. Data were collected through an open-ended questionnaire. We employed pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) (Shulman, 1986) as a theoretical lens to make sense of the findings. Four findings emerged from the analysis of the data. Firstly, teachers were knowledgeable about the legislation, policies and guidelines about inclusive education to leverage their efforts to create enabling environments to accommodate diversity in their classrooms. Secondly, teachers' understanding of inclusive education was still entrapped in the medical model, and not in the social model. According to the medical model of disability people are regarded as disabled by their impairments or differences while according to the social model disability is caused by the way in which society is organised. Thirdly, teachers showed an understanding on how to use the principle of differentiation to accommodate diversity in their classrooms. Fourthly, teachers used their social capital to manage diversity in their classrooms. These findings have at least 3 implications. One, policymakers need to take teachers into consideration when they develop policies for inclusive education. Two, there is a need to empower teachers with a better understanding of what inclusive education is. Three, there is a need for parents, teachers and other stakeholders to collaborate in accommodating diversity in schools.",

To this end, several studies were conducted to identify and analyse educators' practices while teaching reading comprehension. As a result, the aim of the study reported on here was to investigate educators' teaching practices when teaching reading comprehension in order to diagnose challenges and then make recommendations. The study was qualitative in nature with a case study design. For the purpose of data collection, 3 Grade 9 English First Additional Language (FAL) educators were purposively chosen. The observation data collection method was followed and content analysis was used to analyse data. With regard to the choice of reading comprehension strategies, the findings reveal that the educators did not appear to have a thorough knowledge of reading comprehension strategies. In the observed lessons, the reading comprehension strategies were neither applied explicitly nor implicitly. Educators tended to change the reading lessons into vocabulary lessons. The findings further reveal that the educators relied on traditional questioning techniques that did not engage learners with the text. Thus, the reading comprehension support, motivation and feedback from educators were limited. The main recommendation is for teacher training institutions and universities to play a more active role in developing both pre-service and in-service educators' reading comprehension instructional practices.",

In this article, we use the role identity theory as a framework to analyse novice principals' narratives of lived experiences to understand how they construct themselves as principals in schools and how these constructions influence their execution of leadership. Positioned within the interpretivist paradigm, we adopted the narrative inquiry methodology to engage with the lived experiences of 3 purposively selected novice principals from the Pinetown district in KwaZulu-Natal. The narrative interview was employed to generate field texts, which were subsequently analysed using 2 methods: narrative analysis and analysis of narratives. From our analysis of field texts, 4 themes explaining how the participating novice principals construct themselves as school principals were identified; these themes are: a leader as a learner, re-establishing oneself as a leader, spanning boundaries, and leading to inspire. From these themes, we conclude that a principal's conception of self is dynamic and is a blend of multiple meanings generated prior to becoming a principal and meanings generated during the principalship tenure.",

The data were collected using a behaviour management and instructional management scale developed by Martin and Sass (2010). The data for the English proficiency level were obtained by administering a reading subtest from the sample test of the Preliminary English Test (PET) to 54 English teachers from Aceh, the westernmost province in Indonesia. Information regarding age, gender, and years of experience were embedded in the PET. The correlations were analysed by using the Pearson coefficient formula for normal data, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient for non-normal data, and the Independent Sample T-test for the analysis of the gender category. The results show that there was a medium positive correlation between instructional management and behaviour management, which was statistically significant (r = 0.4121, p = 0.0019). Behavioural management skills were also significantly correlated, but in a negative direction with the level of English proficiency (r = 0.32, p = 0.018), as were instructional management skills (r = 0.35, p-value = 0.029). In addition, age was negatively correlated to instructional management skills, and no correlation was found for gender and years of experience.",

        "description":"South African schools are faced with an arguably insurmountable problem as a culture of indiscipline continually increases in schools. Despite being undeterred by the legal framework that guides stakeholders in the discipline crisis in schools, indiscipline in schools has soared to critical levels. Scant literature exists on how stakeholders collaborate in managing discipline in schools. The research reported on here was guided by the primary research question: How do stakeholders collaborate in managing discipline in schools? As such, in this article we explore how stakeholders collaborate in managing discipline in schools. Through purposive sampling, 16 participants from 4 secondary schools in KwaZulu-Natal were chosen to take part in semi-structured interviews. The sample of participants comprised school management team members (SMT); the principal, 1 head of department, 1 post-level 1 educator and 1 school governing body (SGB) member from 4 schools in the iLembe education district. Themes that emerged from the data include that implementation of the school code of conduct as one of the most effective strategies in managing discipline in schools. The inclusion of stakeholders such as the local community, the Community Police Forum, the South African Police Services and the Department of Social Development in the successful management of learner discipline surfaced as an important theme. Furthermore, participants asserted that a whole-school approach to the implementation of the code of conduct was successful in managing discipline. The participants revealed that the collaboration of stakeholders in schools was very important for the smooth running of the school, including the management of discipline.",

        "description":"The modern era demands a radical pedagogical shift and a complete overhaul of traditional teaching methods that flaunt teachers as the sole producers of knowledge and learners as impetuous consumers of knowledge. In this article I propose interactive teaching methods and strategies as the pedagogical approach to be advocated by 21st-century isiZulu teachers so that learners are empowered on all cognitive levels as producers of knowledge. This pedagogical shift in the isiZulu classroom has the power to revoke the historical debt of the marginalisation of indigenous African languages, which native speakers of these languages inherited from the apartheid education system of South Africa. Used as the guiding theoretical framework, the transformative learning theory is set to challenge the status quo and disrupt the current instructional classroom practice that is regressive to change demanded by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The participatory action research methodology, reflecting the encounters with student teachers at a teacher education institution in South Africa, provides a critical analysis of how interactive teaching methods and strategies can be used in an authentic classroom environment.",

In this innovative practice article, we share the experiences of a team of digital learning designers created to support the university community's pivot online. This project adopts a case study methodology. The case study of the Digital Learning Design Unit (DLDU) described in this article offers an examplar of learning design and the work of learning designers during the time of COVID-19. Findings from this case study indicate that a demand led professional learning approach can be very effective at encouraging staff engagement with learning design; a rapid learning design intervention can provide just in time support for colleagues during a time of crisis; time and digital competencies are essential to build staff competence and confidence with online pedagogy and learning design approaches. In this case study, the pandemic prompted a strategic approach to learning design for online, blended and hybrid education. This strategic approach began as a temporary proactive measure to keep teaching and learning going but has now been cemented into a permanent strategy for online blended and hybrid education at our institution which will continue in the post pandemic environment.",

In this respect, the Student Engagement Scale and appropriate open-ended questions were employed in order to obtain data from learners. The sample covers 400 undergraduate learners studying at Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University. The study has a mixed research design, hence both quantitative and qualitative approaches were employed. The results of the study revealed that behavioral engagement has a significant effect on learner achievement. The study also demonstrated that the engagement of Kyrgyz learners in online courses differs in terms of their gender and their prior online course experience. The majority of Kyrgyz learners had limited access to the Internet and computers; therefore, they experienced problems in online courses. The other problems facing Kyrgyz learners are due to insufficient house conditions, frequent power failures, health problems, and a lack of interactivity in online courses.",

        "description":"In the study reported on here we investigated the use of post-method practice to optimise pre-service teachers' teaching practice and English First Additional Language (EFAL) proficiency. This study was premised on the theoretical framework of Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy which promotes diverse perspectives in language learning and teaching among teachers and learners. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews with 10 (n = 10) third year pre-service teachers enrolled in a 4-year Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree programme in the Department of Language Education, School of Education at the University of Limpopo, South Africa. We found that post-method pedagogy enables pre-service teachers to monitor their teaching process and optimise learners' potential to learn, which affords them opportunities for critical reflection on the self and the social world, as well as opportunities to form learning communities. The results suggest that post-method pedagogy enables pre-service teachers to recognise their prior and current knowledge, and their potential to teach and act autonomously. This promotes their ability to know how to develop a reflective critical approach in their teaching by analysing and evaluating their teaching acts, initiating change in their classroom practices, and monitoring the effects of these changes. We concluded that post-method practice could provide teachers, curriculum developers and researchers with an understanding of the realisation of post method in teaching and learning of EFAL in South African classrooms.",

        "description":"The aim of the study reported on here was to examine workplace bullying among teachers in South African schools. The research was framed by the Job Demands-Resources Model which was utilised to determine the extent of demands and resources that teachers experience and the implications thereof for creating an environment that fosters bullying and the effect of such bullying on teachers and schools. A qualitative interpretative research design was utilised. Data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews with 13 teachers. Thematic Content Analysis (TCA) was used to interpret the data. The findings reveal that teachers work in an environment characterised by excessive demands with ever increasing workloads and a lack of supportive resources. This environment fosters stress, anger, frustration and aggression, and increases perpetration of bullying acts, as teachers turn upon one another. The findings in this study indicate that in the aftermath of bullying, feelings of incompetence, emotional exhaustion, depression and anxiety manifest. Furthermore, teachers reported engaging in withdrawal behaviour and expressing an increased desire to leave the profession. The results of this study have serious implications for teachers' well-being and their willingness to remain within the profession. In order to protect the well-being of teachers and the overall integrity of schools there is an urgent need to increase resources and interventions to create a more conducive and healthy work environment. The need for resource provision and a re-examination of demands becomes even more evident during the era of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).",

        "description":"Character education reinforcement in secondary schools is one of the educational programmes aimed at anticipating the tendency of moral perversion as a result of moral decadence. Various forms of moral deviations that occur among high school students result in them being alienated from life because they conflict with cultural norms, school discipline, and life ethics in society. In this article we aim to discuss the relation of character value reinforcement and the principal's transformational leadership strategy to shape students' characters in a descriptive-critical manner. The objective of this study was investigating school strategies for optimising the implementation of character education reinforcement. In this research we used a qualitative method with a case study design. The data validity measurement was based on the levels of credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. The results emphasise the importance of shaping student character as an anticipatory step to minimise moral distortions among high school students, and the effectiveness of the principal's transformational leadership role in optimising the implementation of education programmes for the strengthening of students' characters in schools.",

All forms of violence have negative effects, i.e. physical and psychological, educational damage and societal breakdown. The overall aim of the study reported on here was to explore the nature, causes and consequences of school violence, and then to design an effective intervention strategy to reduce it. In this study we used action research methodology in which stakeholders were empowered to interrupt the occurrence of violence, stop the spread of violence and change group/community norms regarding violence. This strategy of violence reduction was tested at 1 school in Umlazi, in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa, in 4 stages: initial data collection, formation of an action team, design and implementation of a strategy, and evaluation of its efficacy. The action team was composed of teachers, community members, parents and learners who developed a strategy entitled, We Care (WC). Initial from both schools data showed that schools were unsafe, with school violence caused by substance abuse, theft, vandalism, physical violence, religious discrimination, sexual violence, cyber bullying, gender-based violence and gambling. WC clustered abnormal behaviour patterns demonstrated by learners into categories: violent cases and behavioural indicators of physical, sexual, alcohol and drug abuse. WC assisted high risk learners who had decided to act non-violently, help victims and assist parents and community members who perpetrated violence. A preliminary evaluation was conducted 1 year later and WC reported that they had developed capacity to assist with these categories of violence, leading to a reduction in violent behaviour at the school.",

        "description":"As COVID-19 mutates, the highly infectious omicron mutants (BA. 5.2., BF. 7) tension shrouded China. Given the internet information explosion and youth social media addiction, observing the mental impact on college students during the 2022 Shanghai closure is worthwhile. A pilot survey study was conducted to explore the anxiety levels of college students during the closure. The sample size was limited to 101 second-year college students. In addition to demographics, the survey involved the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, self-perceived COVID-19 anxiety, frequency of COVID-19 information reception, number of social media accounts, and number of electronic devices. Though 68.4% of students equipped with two electronic devices (N = 95) exceeded the students with only one electronic device, a Chi-square test showed that students with only one electronic device had the highest anxiety index (mean = 50). Further, the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that the number of electronic devices affected the students' anxiety level (p = 0.027) while social media membership did not (p = 0.565). As a result, it was suggested that social media usage and pandemic information inputs among college students were significant concerns that required special attention from the government, schools, teachers, and families.",

This study evaluates the perceptions and attitudes of both students and teachers in relation to mobile apps that assist in classroom learning. The research used a mixed-methods approach that collected demographic information and conducted qualitative interviews to determine the perceptions of mobile apps to students and teachers. Cross-sectional data was collected from participants and analyzed for associations. 43 students and 6 teachers were recruited and interviewed. The participants were asked about their thoughts on mobile educational apps, and their interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. For students, themes were centered on barriers to educational app adoption, barriers to continued use of education apps, tracking progress, credibility, and goal setting/reminders. For teachers, themes identified that influenced mobile app use, and criteria used for mobile app selection was identified. Future research should aim to assess quantitative improvements in mobile educational app use within the classroom.",

        "description":"Since it was first published by the Council of Europe in 2001, the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) has become one of the most widely referenced documents in language education, particularly in English language teaching and assessment (Savski, in press). The recently released CEFR Companion Volume (2020), with its new descriptions of plurilingual and pluricultural competence and mediation, has done much to extend the potential of the framework, as it provides a more concrete foundation for using CEFR to support heteroglossic pedagogies. In this way, CEFR has acquired a greater level of potential relevance to innovative pedagogies in English language education, such as Global Englishes Language Teaching (GELT), which seeks to equip learners with communicative skills and dispositions needed for success in a world where the target interlocutors are linguistically and culturally diverse (Rose &amp; Galloway, 2019). In this paper, we examine the prospects for using CEFR to support heteroglossic pedagogies like GELT, highlighting points of convergence between descriptions of competence in CEFR and current scholarship in Global Englishes, as well as points of divergence between the two. We underline the need to embed CEFR in decentralizing educational reforms, in which the framework is used to facilitate teacher agency, rather than to impose objectives and methods upon them.",

        "description":"This systematic review analyzes 20 empirical articles on translanguaging (TL) pedagogies in ESL and EFL contexts. The review is guided by the following questions: &quot;(1) How is TL implemented across different teaching contexts? (2) What are the identified benefits and challenges in the implementation of TL in TESOL? (3) What are the identified future directions?&quot; Findings indicate that, in ESL contexts, educational equity was more emphasized in the implementation of TL pedagogies, whereas in EFL contexts, the TL pedagogies were more used for instruction reinforcement and creation of class rapport. Furthermore, in K-12 contexts, TL pedagogies were used for disciplining student behavior and promoting equal access to knowledge. In higher education, TL pedagogies empowered students in multilingual written and oral communication. Numerous benefits and challenges of implementing TL, along with future directions for research, were identified in the selected articles. TL pedagogies fostered an inclusive learning environment, increased students 'participation, and facilitated students 'English learning. The identified challenges included logistical issues in the implementation of TL strategies, along with strong adherence to language separation ideologies. For future research, the selected studies propose various topics including the effectiveness of TL pedagogies and call for expansion of research on pedagogical TL.",

        "description":"This paper compares the speaking scores generated by two online systems that are designed to automatically grade student speech and provide personalized speaking feedback in an EFL context. The first system, &quot;Speech Assessment for Moodle&quot; (&quot;SAM&quot;), is an open-source solution developed by the author that makes use of Google's speech recognition engine to transcribe speech into text which is then automatically scored using a phoneme-based algorithm. &quot;SAM&quot; is designed as a custom quiz type for &quot;Moodle,&quot; a widely adopted open-source course management system. The second auto-scoring system, &quot;EnglishCentral,&quot; is a popular proprietary language learning solution which utilizes a trained intelligibility model to automatically score speech. Results of this study indicated a positive correlation between the speaking scores generated by both systems, meaning students who scored higher on the &quot;SAM&quot; speaking tasks also tended to score higher on the &quot;EnglishCentral&quot; speaking tasks and vice versa. In addition to comparing the scores generated from these two systems against each other, students' computer-scored speaking scores were compared to human-generated scores from small-group face-to-face speaking tasks. The results indicated that students who received higher scores with the online computer-graded speaking tasks tended to score higher on the human-graded small-group speaking tasks and vice versa.",

        "author":["Song, SunYung"],
        "description":"Although the number of emergent bilinguals (EBs), also known as English language learners (ELLs) in U.S. K-12 schools is growing at an increasing rate, K-12 mainstream teachers remain predominantly white and monolingual and receive little training for working with such learners. In addition, many states mandate &quot;English-only&quot; policies that prevent EBs from accessing grade-level content and academic language. Given digital inequalities, remote learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may put them even further behind academically. Moreover, EBs may not have adequate at-home parental support to develop language skills in literacy. Recent studies (García &amp; Li, 2014) have indicated that translanguaging offers great potential to close the academic achievement gap and facilitate home-school connections by embracing EB students' home language and culture. This article discusses a qualitative participatory action research study that examined how monolingual elementary preservice teachers (PSTs) constructed a translanguaging stance and enacted it in a digital service-learning (DSL) setting in an undergraduate ESOL methods course at a southeastern university in the U.S. The article also offers insights into curriculum development and implementation as to preparing monolingual mainstream PSTs to support linguistically and culturally diverse students and families through translanguaging.",

        "description":"In pedagogical debates about Global Englishes (GE) and English as a lingua franca (ELF), there is widespread agreement concerning an urgent need for liberating teachers and students from the normative constraints of ELT's orientation towards standard English by raising their awareness of the characteristics and complexities of GE/ELF communication. ELT students are generally perceived as weak GE/ELF communicators requiring remedial education based on the analysis of recorded GE/ELF exchanges. Contrary to this deficit view, this article calls for acknowledging ELT students as 'speaker-learners', who are endowed with a natural capability for communication including strategic creativity, contextual inferencing, empathetic cooperativity, and communication monitoring. Through a social constructivist lens, they appear as principal agents of 'MY English' development, guided by their personal requirements of communicative and communal success and their aspiration for speaker satisfaction. A normalizing account of GE/ELF communication and an emancipatory MY English perspective on ELT provide the theoretical-conceptual underpinnings of an immersive pedagogical GE/ELF approach, preferably implemented through virtual exchange in a blended learning environment. Pedagogical mentoring is essential for helping students assume MY English responsibility, make best use of their ordinary communicative capability, and exploit the translanguaging range of their resources when faced with unfamiliar challenges in GE/ELF encounters.",

As teachers turn frequently to online resources for guidance, we reviewed the available resources and professional development on departments of education websites from all 50 US states and District of Columbia related to ELs. Our research question was: What type of resources and professional development are available on state departments of education websites that a teacher of ELs might benefit from? Findings suggest a majority of states link to federal resources. About half of the states provide more robust resources, such as webinars. Approximately two-thirds of states include links to professional resources; however, there is little consistency between the states as to which outside organizations they recommend. There is no correlation between the quantity or quality of a state's resources and the EL population in the state.",

        "description":"With the increase in linguistic and cultural diversity in South Korea, the landscape of English education in Korean classrooms has been changing. This has led to an increased need to explore the language and literacy practices of the emergent multilingual youth in Korea where one (official) language (Korean) has been predominantly used as the medium of instruction for English teaching and learning. Addressing this need for more research on how emerging multilingual children learn English in the diverse Korean classrooms of today, this four-year longitudinal case study explored out-of-classroom English language learning experiences of three Uzbek students in South Korea. Drawing upon the conceptual framework of &quot;translanguaging&quot; and &quot;agency,&quot; data were collected from various sources. I found that the actions taken by these students to learn English depended on their interlocutors, practical and academic purposes, and language ideologies embedded in contexts, which in turn influenced learners' agency and translanguaging practices. More specifically, the findings show the students exercised agency over their choice of linguistic and non-linguistic resources in order to expand their linguistic repertoires on their own accord. These findings provide implications for EFL research and pedagogy, particularly within the context of the transition from monolingual to multilingual.",

        "author":["Yigitbilek, Demet"],
        "description":"Deficiency-oriented attitudes are still common occurrences despite growing emphasis on linguistic and cultural diversity. Promoting inclusivity in learning, Herrera (2016) proposed &quot;biography-driven instruction&quot; emphasizing the power of students' assets. Though her work was intended for young learners' biliteracy, I argue that the tenets can be used as a framework for more equitable adult ESL instruction to build on learners' &quot;funds of knowledge&quot; (Moll et al., 1992) and &quot;cultural wealth&quot; (Yosso, 2016). In this article, I theorize an &quot;'auto'biography-driven instruction&quot; approach where L2 writing instruction can foster inclusivity through life writing by acknowledging diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds as assets, drawing from rich lived experiences, and tapping into multi-competencies. Drawing from the work in translanguaging and life writing, this article problematizes the deficiency-based assumptions, argues for life writing practices, and provides a practical look into the theorized &quot;auto&quot;biography-driven instruction. I detail how this approach can help students take a more active role in their learning and inevitably leads to amplifying diverse voices and inclusivity in ESL by learners (1) choosing the content they write about, (2) practicing a variety of the life writing genres, and (3) sharing their personal stories to create empathy and build rapport.",

        "description":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lecturers of higher learning institutions had to pivot quickly from face-to-face classes to online classes. The new normal of online teaching and learning challenged lecturers in keeping their students engaged, especially when teaching a language course that heavily focuses on the writing component. The purpose of this study was to examine students' perception of using Padlet as a learning space to simulate real-life business communication. At the end of a 14-week semester language course, a cohort of 38 diploma students responded to a self-administered online survey with a 79% response rate. Findings from the descriptive analysis indicated high mean values for most survey items measured, implying that the students were generally favourable towards the use of Padlet and the simulation approach in learning business communication. Curriculum designers and lecturers of other courses could consider the potential of using Padlet as a learning space for simulation. Recommendations, limitations, and future research directions are also discussed in this paper.",

The study adopts a within-subjects design with forty students performing the same narrative task twice. Students also completed two prior vocabulary knowledge tests (i.e., a receptive size test and a productive level test) and two working memory tests(i.e., a backwardspan task and a Vietnamese-version operation-span task). Lexical complexity was measured in two aspects (i.e., lexical sophistication and lexical diversity). Fluency was assessed in terms of articulation rate. Unlike previous studies, our study surprisingly did not reveal an effect of task repetition on lexical complexity and fluency. Interestingly, prior vocabulary knowledge and working memory appeared to be good predictors of learners' lexical complexity and fluency.",

The literature review brings together important contributions from previous research and assessments of the full-time school programme, including results of similar programmes in other countries and particularities of the Portuguese case. The methodological design is outlined, describing the research questions as well as the variables and categories under consideration. Drawing on extensive administrative data from all public schools in the country, the analysis focuses on participation rates and their link to school location, socioeconomic context, local providers, and educational achievements. The (moderately) positive correlation between participation rates and educational success arises as a key finding, for which possible explanatory factors are discussed.

One contributing factor is the low number of female students selecting STEM school subjects and careers. Despite the literature recommending students engage in STEM activities earlier, many initiatives are not implemented until high school. This paper reports on an Australian project named MindSET-do which provided students with early positive STEM experiences prior to high school to raise awareness of, interest in, and aspirations for STEM-related subjects and careers. The case study surveyed n = 107 Year 6 boys' and girls' interests, ability beliefs and expectations in STEM school subjects and careers. Students' awareness and interest in STEM-related subjects and careers increased significantly following experiences with inquiry-based STEM activities, X[superscript 2](1, n = 107) = 4.57 to 63.67, p &lt; 0.05. Expectancy for success in mathematics was significantly higher for males than for females (U = 1125, p = 0.044, r = 0.2). Expectancy for success in science was slightly lower for the female group, but p &gt; 0.05. Logistic regression found females were 24 percent less likely to have a positive view of mathematics than males (p = 0.003). Gender differences in STEM ability versus ability beliefs and expectancies for success are discussed, with recommendations for earlier positive experiences with STEM tasks.",

Global Englishes Language Teaching (GELT) (Galloway &amp; Rose, 2018) provides the potential for movement away from such 'native speaker' ideologies, but lacks empirical evidence. In this study, the use of GELT input in comparison with prestige varieties of English was investigated. Sixteen first-year L1 Japanese university students in an English Medium Instruction programme participated in a self-paced listening study via a learning management system (LMS). All participants were tested on their perception of the English vowels /ae/, /[open-mid back unrounded vowel]/, /[open-mid central unrounded vowel]/ and/ /[open-mid back rounded vowel]/. After this pretest, they were separated into two groups: using edited TED talks, the experimental group (G) (N=8) watched videos of Global English varieties, and the control group (P) (N=8) watched videos of prestige English varieties. Both groups acquired losses, i.e., immediate posttest scores were mainly lower than pretest scores on vowel identification. Scores were predicted by the variation in interval between lessons and posttest, but not by the varieties of English used. This provides support for the view that GELT is as valid a language teaching approach as using prestige varieties.",

With an interpretative phenomenological research methodology, we invited 10 Chinese students at three different universities in the United States to share their experiences and strategies in resolving campus disputes. Five themes emerged based on the experiences of research participants. The findings strongly indicate that conflict management strategies and styles of Chinese students are significantly shaped by Chinese culture, and Chinese international students are less likely to express their needs and negative feelings. According to findings, this study suggests that more attention and resources of student help centers should be allocated to Chinese international students in the United States for improving their learning experiences.",

The present study, in an intensive academic English program in Japan, was intended to explore whether reading rates and related reading skills might improve while autonomously reading and listening outside class, holding &quot;book clubs&quot; in class, and while meeting course goals. Within the program setting's trimester sessions, young adult participants carried out extensive reading and listening online at their own pace, followed by small group &quot;book club&quot; discussions, and conducted monthly silent reading rate checks. Participant data collection found the participants (N = 130) reported approximately 64 wpm in overall average gain through their 9-10 week projects. Post-project survey responses and interviews also indicated positive views of book club discussions and possible growth in skills related to increasing fluency, such as mentally &quot;hearing&quot; while reading, and visualizing. Rates of spoken word delivery in audiobooks were measured and compared to reading rates and fluency development markers discussed in research to date. Correlating these with participants' reading rates was found potentially helpful in visualizing ranges in learners' reading fluency development. Further research investigating these points is suggested.",

Situated in a Spanish-English dual language school in Miami, Florida, this ethnographic case study utilized student shadowing as the principal method of data collection. Data sources included six months of classroom observations, students' mathematics work, and interviews with students and their mathematics teachers. Findings illustrate how translanguaging was not a random, haphazard experience among participants; rather students and their teachers transcended modes in a dynamic way that reflected their personal histories as members of Spanish-speaking families, as Latinas/os living in Miami, as members of a dual language school, and as individuals with different mathematics histories. This research underscores the multimodal aspects of translanguaging that students used to make sense of their mathematics learning. It highlights translanguaging as an asset-based pedagogy in its recognition of students' funds of linguistic knowledge. Pedagogical implications are provided for the teaching and learning of mathematics among emergent bilinguals.",

        "description":"Even-though teaching experience has been identified as one of the main variables affecting student academic gains, teacher cognition, and practices, research focusing on the influence of experience on language teacher challenges is still rare. Hence, the study aims to analyse comparatively the challenges encountered by EFL teachers with varying lengths of teaching experience. Quantitative data were collected utilising a questionnaire involving 208 language teachers. The respondents self-reported being especially challenged by teaching speaking, learner motivation, teaching writing and listening, learner engagement, differentiating instruction, and providing effective learning. The overall challenge rate was moderate. Notably, a statistically significant difference in the perceptions of challenges was established between groups of teachers with varying lengths of teaching experience. As expected, novice teachers reported being more challenged than their most experienced counterparts. Contrary to popular belief, challenge estimates of a group of experienced teachers (10-15 years) were higher than that of less experienced teachers (1-5 years). The principal implication of the current study is that experienced language teachers also need assistance in dealing with professional challenges arising from the complexities of language teaching. To serve well, teacher development courses should be sensitive to language teacher needs and challenges, aligned with transformations they undergo as they move along the career stages.

        "description":"This study is based on a broad research question: How does the translation into Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) capture and convey the meanings embedded within languages belonging both inside and outside the sphere of the Arab world? To answer this question, a translation and literary study of borrowings, combining the methods of etymology and lexicology with in-depth content analysis and close reading, involving Nesrin Chukri's translation of Mouloud Feraoun's &quot;Le Fils du pauvre&quot; (&quot;The Poor Man's Son, 1950/1954&quot;) into MSA, was carried out. Feraoun's text hybridizes the French language by borrowings from many languages: Algerian Arabic, Kabyle and Old Arabic. The loan words, collected for the purpose of this study, offer relevant study examples to throw the light on MSA handling of vocabulary, which this study sought to understand. The analysis of Chukri's translation of Feraoun's loan words belonging to three languages (Algerian Arabic, Kabyle and Old Arabic) suggests that the translator does not favor newness; most of the time, Feraoun domesticated the Kabyle and Algerian Arabic loan vocabulary found in the source text, and systematically reinjected Old Arabic vocabulary. This practice poses the problem of the referentiality of MSA and its capacity to convey ethnic cultures, in our case Algerian Arabic and Kabyle. However, for this conclusion to be confirmed, larger, corpus-based translation studies extended to other Algerian francophone novels and also to the languages of other non-Arab ethnicities belonging to the Arab world are needed.",

        "author":["Korol, Tetiana"],
        "description":"The article is aimed at the studies of the assessment practices currently applied in translation training at Ukrainian universities in the context of cutting-edge trends and dispositions in translator's education observed worldwide. They include the synergism of both evaluative and formative assessment, the extensive use of diverse assessment methods and tools, including alternative ones, the rational involvement of self- and peer-assessment procedures. Method: A mixed research method was designed and employed with that end in view. It involved 41 translation teachers from 16 Ukrainian universities, who were asked to answer an online survey of 30 close and open-ended questions regarding their background, attitude to assessment and its different aspects such as functions, procedures and tools used for different types of tests in translation, assessment objects and agents, grading methods and associated problems. The obtained results were processed with the help of statistical methods and contrasted with the data received by relevant studies conducted abroad within the last twenty years. Findings: The findings of this research allowed us to compile the aggregated profile of Ukrainian translation teachers in terms of assessment practice, define the most common ways to conduct monitoring, borderline and summative assessment in teaching translation to undergraduate students in Ukraine, and claim that the teachers' subjective evaluation of translation assessment efficiency depends on their teaching experience. Implications for research and practice: The obtained results should boost further theoretical and practical development in the field of translation assessment as well as in the area of translation teachers' training.",

        "description":"The problem of motivation in foreign language learning has always been of great importance. Researchers agree on the non-static, dynamic nature of motivation, investigate the role of the motivational context, and recognize the fact that some aspects of motivation are not internal but are externally determined by the learner's sociocultural environment. The study aims to investigate the prevalent type of motivation among pre-service English teachers in challenging circumstances. The analysis of motivation sources and ways to protect and maintain motivation to learn English as a foreign language in challenging circumstances constitutes the novelty of the study. 60 fourth-year students (57 females and 3 males) participated in the investigation. The questionnaire adapted from Gardner's Attitude/Motivation Test Battery (AMTB) has been used as a tool to collect quantitative data. The results reveal that the level of motivation is high with a prevalence of instrumental motivation. Qualitative data have been obtained from interviewing students. During the interviews, the students identified the sources of their motivation, critically evaluated their learning situation, and described their learning circumstances as challenging. The study suggests pedagogical implications in line with positive psychology recommendations and the latest research on the protection and maintenance of ? motivation to learn English as a foreign language in challenging circumstances. The implications for teachers include developing motivational strategies, maintaining engagement, providing role models, using technology.",

As data collection tools, Sociodemographic Data Form, The Revised Two Factor Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ2F) and Morning-Evening Questionnaire (MEQ) were used. A total of 163 sixth-year students (n=90) male and (n=73) female were included in the study. There was no significant difference between the gender of the students and their academic performance scores (p=0.880). Academic performance scores of morning type students were significantly higher than those of evening type students (p&lt;0.05). There is a correlation of 0.521 in the same direction between the deep approach and the academic performance score, and this relationship is statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). There is a negative correlation of 0.608 between the superficial approach and the academic performance score, and this relationship is statistically significant.

We used descriptive statistical methods to analyze the data. The reason was that such methods allow us to better understand the correlation between the results obtained in traditional testing and online testing. The research was conducted in the summer semester of the academic years 2020/2021 and 2021/2022. 2508 students of the University of Economics in Bratislava participated in the research. The respondents were first-year Bachelor's degree students at the University of Economics in Bratislava whose first foreign language was professional English. When analyzing the data we took into account the test results, the number of students who did not take the test, the number of students who had to retake the test, and the number of students who did not take the test. The results confirmed that students who took the test in the home environment performed significantly better than students who took the test in person at the university. The results of on-site education were influenced by the online learning process. As students adapted to the online environment, they changed their study habits, which had a negative impact on learning. This negative impact was also reflected in the results of the on-site testing. The solution to this situation is to better prepare teachers for online learning and to ensure that schools are equipped with the latest technology.",

For this reason, a simple random sampling strategy was used to perform the study on 200 level 2 English students (100 males and 100 females). The English accomplishment test served as the research instrument for the quasi-experimental study. Pre-test and post-test data analyses were conducted using descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings show that when students received differentiated instructions, their academic success in the English subject was unaffected by their gender. This study could be regarded as a pioneering study that could aid other researchers in conducting their research in various nations with different conclusions. The research findings may contribute to a body of knowledge for differentiating instruction and serve as a platform for future research.",

        "description":"Political communication exemplifies rhetoric and propagandist approach in its various forms, among which the Aristotle's rhetorical theory and its three aspects, ethos, pathos and logos are the major ones. This study used these three as indicators of public rhetoric in the context of Indonesian parliamentarian speeches This study used a qualitative research design, to produce descriptive data comprising sampled speech excerpts of parliamentarians. Secondary data from journals, books, documents, websites, media helped in sustaining the rhetorical criticism. The data was analyzed using data reduction techniques prior to describing, clarifying, and interpreting the data. The study took a discourse analytical approach to find out the implied ideas in the sampled speech excerpts. The theoretical dimensions explained by Wodak (2012) and Fairclough (2000a, 2000b) helped this study to analyze the linguistic data and find out the structures intended by the speakers. The study findings imply that the parliamentarians who speak on the policy of handling COVID-19 in Indonesia are largely determined by their position, whether from parties supporting the government or the opposition. The application of the Aristotelian three principles would provide useful insights to understand the objectives and impact of the political speeches.",

This study attempted to examine how the GTM utilizes grammar rules and vocabulary through translation to learn the Arabic language, in pedagogical situations of the Indonesian Islamic boarding schools, where the L1 is Javanese. This study adopted qualitative research design as the data was gathered using field notes and participants' observations and semi-structured interviews for a cultural and a linguistic analysis, in a bilingual paradigm. A short survey instrument was also prepared to understand the teachers' and students' opinion about using the GTM. The teacher and students in the Javanese Islamic schools were the participants of the study, who were selected using a purposive random sampling method. The obtained data was subjected to data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing and verification methods. The study found out that Islamic boarding schools in Java still adopt a word for word translation technique to learn a foreign language (Arabic). They practiced translating or converting the sentences into the native language (Javanese) and vice versa (Arabic) using the grammar and translation methods, although both of them are included into a classical model. The teachers, especially using the GTM, should choose an appropriate teaching method and a teaching strategy. They should pay attention to the level of the students' ability.",

To this end, several strategies for encouraging the use of English in academic settings have been implemented. International students' academic success may suffer if colleges refuse to recognize English as their first language. As a result, the current study's purpose is to assess the impact of English language ability, multilingualism, and perceived linguistic challenges on international students' academic achievement (GPA). Data was gathered for this purpose from three foreign colleges in Iraq. The results of the multiple regression show that multilingualism and English language proficiency significantly impact students' academic performance (GPA) while speaking, reading, and listening skills, as well as writing difficulty, are unimportant factors. Speaking, reading, and listening difficulties are among the four perceived language difficulties (GPA). According to the study's results, most respondents valued English fluency while managing a university's academic atmosphere.

The study is based on 54 in-depth case studies. Using the Internet reciprocal teaching method (IRT), 54 implementers trained 54 primary school students from first to fifth grade in basic computer skills, Internet information searching, and website navigation, as well as analysing data obtained using the TICA Phase 1, 2, and 3 Checklists, the implementers' report, and the children notes in a text editor. Triangulation of the data in combination with selected statistical methods shows that there are differences in the use of the method between students according to age.

The research adopted a qualitative research design with the content analysis approach to prepare a study based on the modes like rhetoric, discourse analysis and persuasion strategies. The study hypothesized that language is a common factor and the content depends much upon the choice of words and phrases and their meaning. A total of fifty magazine advertisements (25 Arabic and 25 English) were randomly selected from different Arabic and English magazines which were published between the periods of September 2019 and March 2020. Findings The analysis suggests that both groups of magazine advertisements employed several modes of persuasion that prompt women to purchase their products and brands. With regards to Aristotle's modes of persuasion of ethos, pathos and logos, it was found that both English and Arabic ads used them most creatively to address the women products. The study implies that any rational mode that uses rhetoric or persuasive strategies depends on providing scientific arguments and statistical information. It also implies that persuasive strategies can be applied to women products within the social and cultural limitations by making use of lexical and figurative aspects of a language.",

It aimed at examining the important factors like reproduction of metaphors according to the theme of contestation, its duration, use of electronic media and problems associated with their forms, class and syntactic structures in a linguistic perspective. This study used a descriptive qualitative research method to examine metaphors used by the contestants in Indonesian public intellectuals' platform. It conducted a content analysis (Creswell &amp; Miller, 2000) and identified themes namely how metaphors occur, why living metaphors are used productively, and what the implications of the metaphor used. The study sampled 14 video recordings (of 15 debate opponents) from 04/04/2018 to 22/12/2019, from the electronic media, related to &quot;hot issues,&quot; and &quot;trending topics&quot; in Indonesia. The selection criteria were the use of metaphors and by contestant who were in competition with Rocky Gerung in political debates. The results showed that metaphors reflect the power, culture, and greatness of speakers in processing language and common sense. The contestation used an average time duration of 13.55 minutes contains many syntactically structured metaphors (phrases, clauses, and sentences). Each metaphor depicted the intensity of language and its structure. The implications of using metaphors make learning intelligent, imaginative, expressive, scientific, poetic, effective, and powerful ways of thinking. Contestants in the debate in pragmatic dialogue are very attractive to the attention of their listeners.",

        "description":"This study mainly aims to reveal the bibliometric profile of research on teacher emotions. To this end, the study sought answers to seven research questions, including the most frequently used keywords and their relation networks, the frequency distribution of articles by country and the collaboration network between countries, the frequency distribution by years and the number of citations, the most prolific scholars, the most cited articles, the frequency distribution of articles by WoS categories, and the most prolific universities. The study employed the bibliometric method. The data were limited to the Web of Science and retrieved only from this database. The first search yielded a total of 598 publications. However, those who did not satisfy the criteria were excluded, and the analysis was conducted on the remaining 521 publications. The findings of the study can be summarized as follows. 255 keywords were used at least twice in the articles (excluding search terms). The top five keywords were &quot;emotion regulation, teacher education, teaching, teacher identity, and emotional labour.&quot; The researchers who published on teacher emotions were from 54 different countries, and the five countries with the most publications were the United States, China, Germany, Australia, and England.The most publications were in 2019. The top ten most prolific scholars published 70 articles, and the most cited articles were published in 2011. As for categories, two-thirds of the articles were in &quot;education educational research&quot;. The most prolific institution was the University of Munich. The study also provided bibliometric maps, figures, tables, and graphs to illustrate the findings. It can be concluded that teacher emotions are associated with various disciplines. Although there is increasing research on teacher emotions, which has been ignored for a long time, teacher emotions as a research field is in its infancy. As the interest in teacher emotions increases, knowledge will accumulate, and the research capacity will be strengthened.",

        "description":"This research aims to examine student satisfaction at higher education institutions through the estimation of a student satisfaction index (SSI) by simultaneously building a strategic management map (SMM) to help higher education leaders identify the areas for improvement at their institutions during COVID-19 induced hybrid education in Turkish Higher Education. The research was carried out with university students at a well-known foundation university in Turkey during COVID-19 pandemic. American Customer Satisfaction Model (ACSI) was used as a lens of analysis to demonstrate the causal relationship between the antecedents and consequences of student satisfaction in Turkish Higher Education. The partial least squares (PLS) estimation was employed to test the model and obtain the SSI score. Given the complex nature of student satisfaction and loyalty, the model was found to adequately predict overall student satisfaction and loyalty. SSI score of 64.95 was found to be lower than the weighted average of all sectors in the United States in 2021. The SMM that was built to examine the relative importance of each quality attributes demonstrated that the perceived utility/benefit and interactional/process-based quality attributes have the greatest positive influence on satisfaction score. The research contributed to the discussion on quality perceptions by highlighting the significance of perceived utility/benefit and interactional/process-based quality attributes over the core/hygiene factors in quality construct. The research also contributed to the discussion on the relationship between satisfaction and complaining behavior by proving that the relationship it is not necessarily negative but contingent on the number of different factors.",

        "description":"All cognitive diagnostic models that evaluate educational test data require a Q-matrix that combines every item in a test with the required cognitive skills for each item to be answered correctly. Generally, the Q-matrix is constructed by education experts' judgment, leading to some uncertainty in its elements. Various statistical methods are suggested to validate misspecifications in the Q-matrix. This paper evaluates the performance of the Q-matrix validation methods, the sequential expectation-maximization-based [delta]-method (SEM [delta]-method), and the Q-matrix refinement (QMR) method using a study with real data and simulations. The simulation design results showed that the misspecification percentage and the length of the test had a small or no effect on the mean q-entry recovery rates (MRRs) of both methods, while the increase in sample size had an improving effect. The MRRs of both methods decreased when the number of attributes and guessing (g) - slip (s) parameters increased. According to simulation study results, the QMR method performed better than the SEM [delta]-method. For the q-matrix validation, it can be suggested that CDM practitioners prioritize the QMR method and use a sample size of 1,000. On the other hand, the real data results revealed that the MRRs of both methods were at the base rates. This result highlights the need for further research on method comparison, specifically for real-world data applications where the number of attributes is relatively large and the test duration is short.",

A quasi-experimental design (selective) with a pre-test and post-test control group, one of the quantitative research designs, was used in the research. Using songs, poems, rhymes, acrostics, stories, fairy tales, riddles/puzzles, animations, and traditional children's games, the experimental group's success in acquiring certain concepts from the third-grade life science course was enhanced by developing and implementing the above activities. Research data were collected with the &quot;Concept Achievement Test&quot; developed by the researcher by quantitative research data collection techniques. In the data analysis, arithmetic means were used to determine the academic success of the experimental and control groups. The Independent Sample t-Test was used for comparisons between groups. As a result of the research, there was a considerable achievement gap between the experimental and control groups, with the experimental group performing significantly better. According to these results, activities structured with songs, poems, nursery rhymes, acrostics, stories, fairy tales, puzzles/riddles, animations, and traditional children's games significantly impact student success in teaching concepts in third-grade elementary school biology classes. These activities apparently increase student success rates and are useful in this regard.",

        "description":"This study examined the effect of Discrimination Model (DM)-based group supervision on novice supervisees' counseling self-efficacy and insight levels. The study used a pretest-posttest model with 3X2 quasi-experimental, comparison, and control groups. Eighteen novice supervisees (6 participates in each group) constituted the participants. Two-factor ANOVA for mixed designs/split-plot tests was performed to analyze the data. The results revealed that DM-based group supervision significantly increased the levels of Helping Skill Self-efficacy (HSS), Session Management Self-efficacy (SMS), Counseling Challenges Self-efficacy (CCS), and Insight of novice supervisees. The comparison group showed significant changes only in their HSS and SMS levels, but not in their CCS and Insight levels. The results revealed that DM-based group supervision led to a significant difference in novice supervisees' SMS, CCS, and Insight levels compared to the comparison group. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of their HSS levels. Moreover, the control group did not score differently regarding the research variables. DM-based group supervision is an effective way for novice supervisees to develop counseling self-efficacy and insight. Findings provide an empirically-based clinical map for those aiming to provide effective supervision.",

The purpose of this article was to prove the positive impact of using the eclectic method on students' foreign language learning by comparing it to the traditional approach to teaching. This study proposed to integrate the eclectic approach into the educational program of first-year students of Linguistics and Intercultural Communication Institute at Sechenov University. The experimental method and interview method were used to collect the data. Seventy participants were divided into experimental and control groups according to English test results. After one semester of the experiment, the results showed that the academic performance of experimental group students improved by an average of 7.3 points. In the control group, students' academic performance decreased by 4.2 points. The effect of the eclectic method was investigated by analyzing the results of English proficiency test of students in both groups. The study results can be useful for English teachers, as they can improve their teaching methods using the eclectic approach. Further research could focus on a detailed analysis of the eclectic approach and its possible variations and components. Due to the small sample of participants, the study could not determine whether external factors such as students' age, gender, nationality, etc. influenced the results.",

Reading literacy has been connected to gender and regional inequalities in national and international studies. As a result, the research's main goal is to examine how gender disparities and regional influences affect Iraqi college students' reading literacy. Data were gathered from rural and urban students attending public sector colleges in Iraq for this purpose. According to descriptive statistics, male students in both urban and rural areas scored less than female students overall. Compared to rural areas, the female scores were higher in urban areas. The independent sample T-test used in inferential statistics shows that there are statistical differences between gender and region in terms of reading literacy. The study could assist governing bodies and educational institutions in effectively addressing gender and regional inequalities so that students' reading and literacy needs could be met, perhaps increasing their positive impact on Iraq's economy.",

The participants were chosen using purposive random sampling. Data were collected using field notes for observation and unstructured interviews and were analyzed qualitatively with descriptive approach. Results showed that Javanese people's pride of their local language was still high, of which they used the values retracted from the language as fundamental living norms. Another finding portrayed that this community was reluctant to appropriate foreign language due to dissimilar identity that leads to experiencing xenoglossophobia. The last finding conveys that people are content to live traditionally and less modernized. This study implies that xenoglossophobia might affect the Javanese people's pride, identity, and living capital.

Regarding psychological problems, some concepts, such as hope, have a protective and accelerating role of well-being. This study aims to reveal the psychological symptoms experienced by individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic process and their relationships with hope and special areas of expectancy. 412 individuals aged 18-67, who are residing in Turkey, participated in the study. The data were collected within three months from the emergence of the first case in Turkey. Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-53), Life Domains Hope Scale (DSHS) were addressed to the participants for investigation. The results show that gender and education level significantly affect psychological symptoms and hope. That family and leisure time, among the special domains of hope, explained almost half of the variance and partially predicted psychological symptoms. Psychological symptoms increase and hope in some domains decreases with educational level increases. Women seem to have more psychological symptoms. It is necessary to conduct supportive and empowering studies for these groups. Since hope is a good predictor of psychological symptoms, all interventions that increase hope in the pandemic process will reduce psychological problems. In addition, it is recommended to investigate other protective and supportive factors that may be associated with psychological symptoms during the pandemic process.",

The HIV prevalence was assumed to indicate a positive relationship between sensation seeking and high sexual risk-taking behavior. A sample size of 357 adolescents (44% males and 56% females) was drawn using a stratified sampling method from a population of 10,278 secondary school students. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze quantitative data, while the qualitative data was summarized thematically. The study's findings indicated that about half the adolescents were highly sensational seekers predisposing them to take risks. There also existed significant gender differences in the prevalence of sensation-seeking and sexual risk-taking behavior, with the male adolescents being higher risk-takers than their female counterparts. Similarities in the prevalence of sensation-seeking were also reported. However, this varied across ages and different gender. Female adolescents' sensation-seeking increased earlier in life than their male counterparts. Further, the study indicated gender differences in the adolescents' tendency to indulge in sexually risky behaviors due to their sensation-seeking. This behavior tendency was higher for males than for female adolescents. Additionally, the results indicated significant age differences, with the susceptibility to indulge in such risky behaviors increasing with advancement in age.",

Using the relational survey model, 418 adults were recruited to participate in the study. The Spirituality Scale, Psychological Well-Being Scale, Compassion Scale, and Life Satisfaction Scale were used to collect data. Pearson Product-Moment Analysis was used to examine the links between adults' spirituality, psychological well-being, compassion, and life satisfaction. Using the Regression-Based Bootstrapping Technique and Serial Multiple Mediator Variable analysis, the researchers investigated the mediating function of compassion and life satisfaction in the link between spirituality and the psychological well-being of adults. The sequential mediation function of compassion and life pleasure was found to be significant in the link between adult spirituality and psychological well-being.",

The data for the study was obtained from adults over the age of 18 between April and May 2021. The &quot;Personal Information Form,&quot; the &quot;Delay of Gratification Inventory,&quot; the &quot;Psychological Well-Being Scale,&quot; and the &quot;Barratt Impulsivity Scale Short Form&quot; were used to collect research data. In addition to construct validity and criterion-related validity in the validity assessment of the inventor, in the reliability evaluation, Cronbach's alpha internal consistency, test-retest, and lower-upper 27% group difference values were examined. In exploratory factor analysis, the measurement tool consists of five sub-dimensions, and these sub-dimensions explain 52% of the variance. The conclusion of the CFA show that the five sub-dimension structure obtained has a good fit (X[superscript 2] = 352.97 N = 265, sd = 184, p = 0.00; X[superscript 2] / df = 1.92, RMSEA = 0.059, CFI = 0.90, IFI = 0.90, GFI = 0.89 and AGFI = 0.86). In another validity study, it was found that delaying gratification was positively related to psychological wellbeing and negatively related to impulsivity. Within the framework of reliability, the Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient of the whole inventory was found to be 0.78. The test-retest coefficient for the whole inventory was found to be 0.84. Findings at the end of the research indicate that the Turkish form of the measurement tool is at a level that can measure the delaying gratification variable in adults.",

        "description":"Bringing real-life cases to the educational environment and presenting them to students is one of the main goals of psychology. However, this is unfortunately not as easy as it is said, both ethically and practically. Since the educational materials to be offered to students on this subject are insufficient, academics and lecturers recommend that their students read case studies in psychopathology lessons or watch videos depicting certain disorders. While the use of films in both national and international literature in psychology and psychological counselling theories and practices is increasing, it is thought-provoking that there is no similar interest/attempt in reading literary works. Despite the (not)reading rates, the using literary works in students' education is overshadowed by films constitutes the main motivation of this study using literary works in students' education is overshadowed by films, which constitutes this study's main motivation. In this sense, the main purpose of the research is to provide an example of how literary works can be used in psychopathology teaching. Accordingly, Jean-Louis Fournier's book entitled &quot;My daddy never killed anybody&quot; was examined in terms of both causal factors and DSM criteria by using document analysis, which is one of the qualitative research methods, to delineate &quot;alcohol use disorder. Accordingly, Jean-Louis Fournier's book named &quot;My daddy never killed anybody&quot; was examined in terms of both causal factors and DSM criteria by using document analysis, which is one of the qualitative research methods, to delineate &quot;alcohol use disorder&quot;.

The PEN-3 cultural model was used to contextualize the role of culture in mental health needs of AISs. Applying a mixed method approach, the study developed messages through a multistep participatory process consisting of three focus groups (n = 15 participants), 13 individual interviews, one expert consultation, and an online survey (n = 85 responses). Data analysis led to the development of seven broad themes with seven tailored messages under each theme, including increasing the awareness of mental health and reducing stigma; motivational quotes; available and accessible resources for AISs to improve mental health; seeking help from social network and developing interpersonal skills; adjusting to American culture and college life; coping strategies to reduce stress and improve mental health and adjustment; and safety issues.

This study explores the challenges encountered by African international students in China. I used semi-structured interviews of 12 Black African graduate students studying in three different universities in Beijing, China. Results indicate Chinese language, limited interaction with Chinese lecturers, and discriminatory treatment as the major challenges. Although some were ambivalent about their experiences, in general, these experiences did not produce a negative impact on their learning rather Black African students reported their overall academic experiences as being positive. The study concludes by discussing the implications of the findings for practice and recommends specific interventions to enhance Black African students' learning experiences in Chinese universities.",

A Facebook group was maintained for both the treatment and control conditions; however, the discussion activities were required only by the treatment condition. We found a statistically significant difference between the initial and post-test speaking scores for the treatment and control conditions. While no difference was observed in post-test scores between the two conditions, students' and the instructor's comments on the Facebook group and student interview data revealed that Facebook was helpful for both conditions in improving their performances, but in different ways.",

With the majority of immigrants coming to the United States today from Mexico and Latin America, the Hispanic educators in our Catholic schools are highly diverse. A striking finding from the &quot;Cultivating Talent&quot; report is that nearly 40% of Hispanic teachers and 27% of Hispanic leaders in Catholic schools are immigrants, proceeding from nearly every Spanish-speaking nation, mirroring the backgrounds of students and families in their communities (Ospino and Wyttenbach, 2022). Their presence enriches the Catholic educational experience in the United States with important global perspectives.

However, there has never been any study on the environmental attitudes of prospective biology teachers in Indonesia. This study aims to discover the environmental attitude of the prospective science teachers throughout Indonesia. This cross-sectional survey study analyzes the aspects of gender, grade point average (GPA), college status, and study status which are positioned as the character of the respondent whose impact on the students' environmental attitudes are analyzed in this study. The target population size of this study is 1300 people. Thus, based on Krejcie and Morgan Table, the minimum sample size with a confidence level of 95% and margin error of 5% is 1235 students. The data collection instrument used in this study is the Environmental Attitude Inventory/EAI questionnaire which has been validated by bilingual experts and transformed into an online questionnaire by means of Google Form. SPSS software was used to examine the data. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in EA scores based on gender, GPA factor, and university status background. The difference in EA scores is affected by whether or not students have taken courses related to the environment ownership. The researchers believe that it is critical to ensure that the course materials concerning environmental education are properly planned and implemented. Courses should be supplemented with themes on environmental issues ranging from local to global scope.",

However, it remains ineffective, resulting in a threat of learning loss. This condition can be overcome if students have confidence in their abilities or self-efficacy. It is important to do an analysis related to biology learning tasks taught by the teachers and students' self-efficacy. This study aims to analyze biology learning tasks variation during the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on students' self-efficacy. This study used descriptive design with cross-sectional survey method. Samples were taken using the convenience sampling technique from five public schools. 446 students out of 465 total students and seven biology teachers participated in this study as respondents. The instruments used in this study were rubrics for quantifying learning tasks and self-efficacy questionnaires given to students after Biology Learning. The results show that all learning modes in Biology Learning during the COVID-19 pandemic have learning tasks that were more dominant in the low-level cognitive process. The dominant learning tasks include retrieval and comprehension, while learning tasks with a higher level of cognitive processing such as analysis, knowledge utilization, and metacognitive only cover a small part of the whole Biology learning process. There were no learning tasks that reached the highest level of cognitive process (self-system). The result of self-efficacy in all learning modes was high, but it was higher in learning modes that used hybrid learning. Biology learning tasks given by the teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic have an effect on students' self-efficacy.",

Hence, this learning approach is potentially effective in developing critical thinking and students' creativity in solving problems and students' collaborative skills. Based on this, the aim of this research is to see the effect of the free inquiry approach based on blended learning on creative thinking skills and collaboration skills of Biology Education students, Sembilanbelas November Kolaka University. This research uses quasi-experimental Non-equivalent Control Group Design Pretest-Postest Design method. In this design, both the experimental group and the control group were compared where the experimental group was treated with a blended learning-based free inquiry approach, while the control group used a conventional approach (online discussion). The research data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and inferential statistical analysis (t-test) to determine whether there was a difference between the two sample groups studied with a significant level of 0.05. Based on the data analysis, it was found that the free inquiry approach based on blended learning had a better effect on students' creative thinking skills and collaboration skills.",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of local-based teaching materials on student's argumentation, scientific reasoning, and problemsolving skills using Science Project-based Learning (SPjBL). Argumentation skill is a social and dynamic process, involving individuals engaged in thinking, constructing, and critiquing knowledge in science. Scientific Reasoning skills require students to give reasons in the form of opinion or actions and conclusions by using appropriate language to explain what they think and making judgments or decisions based on the produced reasons or evidence. Problem-Solving skill is a process of designing, evaluating, and implementing a strategy to answer questions. In this study, the time series approach was used as a part of the quasi-experimental design with Science Projectbased Learning (SPjBL) as the learning model. A total of 29 Biology students of Universitas Negeri Malang participated in this study in August-November 2019 at the Department of Biology of the university. The data was collected using pre-test and post-test instruments which measured scientific argumentation, scientific reasoning, and Problem-solving skill variables. The data analysis was done using ANCOVA test in SPSS 16.0. The results of this study show that there is positive effects of local-based invertebrate and vertebrate materials on scientific argumentation, scientific reasoning, and problem-solving skills. These findings can be used as reference for educator to gain students' scientific reasoning, argumentation, and problem-solving skills in science classroom through Science Project-based Learning (SPjBL) with the help of local-based teaching materials.",

Similar to other fields, thankfully technology has come to our rescue in the area of career guidance also. This paper presents a systematic review of Expert Systems (ES) developed for career guidance, course selection and evaluation of students in the past ten years. The popular research databases Google Scholar and Science Direct were used for obtaining the relevant research papers through broad keywords. The keywords were refined to identify the articles related to rule-based, case-based and fuzzy logic-based ES used for career guidance. A total of twenty-five peer-reviewed relevant articles with full-text available online was selected for the final study. In order to avoid duplicity, technical reports and unreferenced literature were excluded. The review identifies the relatively high weight given by the researchers to rule-based systems owing to their simplicity and broad applicability. However, the relative merits and demerits of rule-based, case-based and fuzzy logic-based ES are highly dependent on the field of application. Nevertheless, ES find wide applications in the area of career guidance and have the potential to enhance the career guidance accessibility of the most remote students.",

The energy and attention spent on these tools reduces their capacity to engage deeply with new learning concepts. Digital literacy skills require both cognitive and technical skills to develop a learner's ability to locate, use, and communicate information. Increasingly complex information environments create various barriers for student learning, and as our learning and working industries continue to evolve and integrate technologies, students must overcome these barriers by bridging learning needs and technology expectations. This research explores the value of developing digital literacy to improve learners' cognitive flexibility by decreasing technological cognitive load and increasing learning fluency. The findings highlight the need for establishing scaffolded digital literacy skills and digital tool selection, and expand college readiness requirements to include digital literacy as a prerequisite skill for learners.",

        "description":"Writing is the result of our desire to express our feelings, thoughts, dreams, and ourselves. In today's education, with the penetration of technology into our lives, what we express not only on paper but also on the screen is within the scope of writing skills. Writing is a language skill that requires high-level mental skills such as producing a new product, questioning, evaluating, and analyzing-synthesizing. A country's reading literacy success in PISA provides information about that country's native language education policy. Therefore, depending on the reading literacy learning outcome of Turkey and Japan in PISA and since writing is the last language skill to be acquired, it was aimed to comparatively examine the activities on writing skills in Turkish textbooks (fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades) and the writing activities in the (seventh, eighth, and ninth grades) Japanese textbooks to reveal similarities and differences in these textbooks. Case study method one of the qualitative research methods was used in this study, and it was carried out with the limitation of writing skills in Turkish textbooks published in 2018 and Japanese textbooks published in 2015 and 2016. It was seen that writing activities in Turkish textbooks have a ratio of 20% (f = 267), and writing activities in Japanese textbooks have an 11% (f = 36) ratio. Although there are too many repetitive activities in Turkish textbooks, it has been observed that some of the learning outcomes were not exemplified by any activity. On the contrary, content for writing skills, which was addressed with more general expressions, was reflected in every activity in Japanese textbooks.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate how a gifted student perceives the effectiveness of Duolingo, as well as how the participant improved his language skills. The participant was a 14-year-old Turkish male who began using Duolingo knowing nothing about French. Data was gathered through interviews, self-reports, and language tests. According to the findings, Duolingo provided a user-friendly, enjoyable, and competitive learning environment for the participant, but it was not regarded as an all-in-one language-learning tool. The participant appeared to gain various language skills, particularly reading and writing skills, without referring to other sources. When considering the improvement level in this case, Duolingo should be a reciprocal learning tool as an addition to language courses rather than a replacement for regular language courses.",

A descriptive survey design was used to attain the study's stated objective. Both quantitative and qualitative method was employed in this research. Sample respondents were drawn by available sampling technique due to their direct relationship with the issue under study and hence to gain sufficient information. The data was collected through questionnaires, interviews, document review and personal observation. Data gathered through questionnaires were quantitatively analyzed using percentage and mean values. Moreover, the data gathered through interviews, open-ended questions, observation and relevant documents were qualitatively analyzed. Having gone through these, the study found that resource management functions such as planning, inventory, purchasing, maintenance, participatory management and budget allocation for the provision of the required materials were poorly implemented. Purchasing physical resources revealed weaknesses in quality, quantity, time and price. There was ineffective maintenance of physical resources, unqualified storekeepers, and a lack of proper follow-up are reasons for the damage and wastage of such physical resources. The inventory practice and using inventory reports for decisions in the school were poor. The storage management system was in poor condition in all schools. The lack of users' technical skills was a significant challenge for managing physical resources. Significant challenges were due to a lack of good storing and disposal strategy, proper distribution, and poor close follow-up.",

A qualitative approach is used in this study and the primary focus was on group discussions involving human resource professionals and well-known academics from higher education. The result of this study shows that the Behavioral Event Interview (BEI) instrument is used to quantify each of the five clusters that make up the higher education leadership competencies framework. These five clusters are: impact and influence, achievement and action, leading, cognitive and personal effectiveness. The leaders are then classified into five position levels ranging from Level 1 to Level 5. Level 1 is individual contributor which is coded as 'Reviewable' whilst Level 5: is leading the whole organization coded as 'Significantly Exceeds'. The study's findings provide an instrument for determining whether the potential leaders in high education institutions are ready to take on the responsibility of leading. In order to improve a leader's abilities as a part of succession planning, the findings could assist the center. This study provides some considerations for alternatives to the prevalent frameworks for evaluating leadership skills in the interest of sustaining a high-quality organizational culture.",

Using a 4-point Likert scale and a self-made validated questionnaire on factors affecting mental wellness, with a reported internal consistency of 0.73, the present study differentiated mental wellness of respondents in terms of their age and sex through ANOVA, and identified factors affecting mental wellness of 100 online Filipino students, evaluated through percentage, mean, and SD, who participated in this mixed method study, which combined quantitative and qualitative research design. Most disagreed with and viewed online education as more difficult than in-person, which had significant effects on their mental wellness, from losing motivation to work on tasks to feeling less effective in lessons. Some had mental breakdowns, anxiety, and considered dropping out. Online education is a possible solution to continue learning until normalcy returns, but questionable in countries where thousands of households lack a stable internet connection and means to buy online education gadgets.

        "description":"Artificial intelligence is the driving force of change focusing on the needs and demands of the student. The research explores Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) for building personalised learning systems for students. The research investigates and proposes a framework for AIEd: social networking sites and chatbots, expert systems for education, intelligent mentors and agents, machine learning, personalised educational systems and virtual educational environments. These technologies help educators to develop and introduce personalised approaches to master new knowledge and develop professional competencies. The research presents a case study of AIEd implementation in education. The scholars conducted the experiment in educational establishments using artificial intelligence in the curriculum. The scholars surveyed 184 second-year students of the Institute of Pedagogy and Psychology at the Abay Kazakh National Pedagogical University and the Kuban State Technological University to collect the data. The scholars considered the collective group discussions regarding the application of artificial intelligence in education to improve the effectiveness of learning. The research identified key advantages to creating personalised learning pathways such as access to training in 24/7 mode, training in virtual contexts, adaptation of educational content to personal needs of students, real-time and regular feedback, improvements in the educational process and mental stimulations. The proposed education paradigm reflects the increasing role of artificial intelligence in socio-economic life, the social and ethical concerns artificial intelligence may pose to humanity and its role in the digitalisation of education. The current article may be used as a theoretical framework for many educational institutions planning to exploit the capabilities of artificial intelligence in their adaptation to personalized learning.",

        "description":"The purpose of this research study is to explore insights to create more contextual lecturer performance indicators (LPIs); and to gain a fairer and more useful evaluation tool for lecturers in the online environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This significant change in conditions has forced higher education to understand the new requirements, especially of lecturers, who have played a central role in creating engaging moments for students in online classes. This study adopts a qualitative approach, based on the need for a more in-depth exploration of new phenomena. It explores students' daily lives in class, which were expressed through social media, and gains further understanding through in-depth interviews with students and lecturers. The results indicate that most of the items taken from the Social-Task-Technology-Fit (STTF) framework remain the same; there are not many changes compared to the era before the pandemic. However, some aspects have new meanings that need to be revisited to capture the lecturers' performance in the new context. Three new themes emerged from the exploration study which have never been discussed in previous studies on LPIs for online teaching, especially in abnormal conditions such as a pandemic. The first theme concerns the variations in digital literacy of lecturers and the implications for lecturers' performance. The second theme is the dynamic ratio of social versus task activities, which implies the need to focus on academic (task-oriented) or non-academic (social) tasks. The third theme is the degree of controllability of each performance. This study provides awareness of the importance of weighting in evaluating lecturer performance, especially when not all lecturers are digitally literate, not all factors are controllable, and the ratios between social versus task requirements are not the same. These weighted evaluations have never been discussed in previous studies, which mainly used quantitative surveys. In addition, these insights can also be applied to online learning beyond the pandemic. The study results can be used by higher education information management to design more contextual LPIs for the early detection of issues with lecturer performance.",

To gain knowledge on this learning context, we monitored motivation (in Self-Determination Theory framework), flow, social identification and self-rated performance during a 10-day project conducted with 281 engineering students. Final grades were also collected as objective performance indicators. Results show that intrinsic and identified motivation, flow, self-rated performance and group identification increased throughout the project, which suggests that remote PBL stimulated students' needs for autonomy and competence without hindering their need for relatedness. Furthermore, the analysis of significant predictors of teams' and individuals' performance draw avenues for improving PBL and stimulating intrinsic and identified motivation, for the subject and for the project, at the right time along the program.",

The mixed-method approach involves a quantitative pre-post design, comparing intervention groups who are studying modules based on MdCM to control groups using traditional PjBL. The knowledge measured comprises three dimensions: declarative, procedural, and conditional. Qualitative measures, including semi-structured interviews and reflective diaries, added information on student learning. Main findings indicated an effect of MdCM as a form of PjBL which showed significant differences between intervention and control groups in terms of total knowledge acquisition, particularly in procedural and conditional knowledge. Interviews and reflective diaries elaborated on the significant link between thinking processes and knowledge acquisition, indicating that students perceived development of their cognitive abilities and personal competencies. In this study, implications for teaching using MdCM as a novel PjBL approach are discussed.",

The authors developed a project in secondary education through an action research approach. The different action research cycles aimed to solve dilemmas throughout the project and interpret them in terms of student motivation through the self-determination theory. According to this theory, autonomy, relatedness and competence are three psychological needs that, if fulfilled in the classroom, will lead to greater intrinsic motivation. The results revealed that one of the main characteristics of PjBL, namely, presenting the final product to an external audience, led to a tight schedule. This time-pressure context generated the majority of dilemmas, which affected the development of the three basic psychological needs, especially competence and autonomy.",

Changemakers incorporates the basic tenets of STEM engagement and a purpose curriculum to increase students' sense of engagement. Purpose is an aspiration towards future-oriented goals, active engagement with one's goals, and intention to contribute to the world. The sample was composed of students, ages 15-17 years old (N=10, 5=M; 5=F), from a public, low-income high school. Findings suggested that three elements helped engage participants with STEM material: challenging and novel curriculum, experiential learning, and supportive relationships.

        "description":"This research is motivated by the high level of imitation of adolescents on the negative behavior of adults, in addition to the high concern of educators on the failure of character education in schools. As many as 40% of adolescents have been bullied at school and 32% reported being victims of physical violence indicating high levels of juvenile violence, bullying, and lack of empathy. So schools need to strengthen their conscience and compassion to deal with this. The study aims to investigate the effect of character education management with a reflective pedagogical paradigm on conscience and compassion. This study was conducted with a quantitative experimental method with a quasi-experimental type. Data collection instruments both questionaries and documentation are used as instruments to collect the data. Hypothesis testing is done through multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) because the dependent variable is more than one. The results of this study prove that based the MANOVA test, the study revealed that there was a significant and positive influence between character education and the reflective pedagogical paradigm on the conscience of students 71.5%, and compassion of students 69.1%. It turns out that aspects of students' conscience and affection can be influenced by character education with a reflective pedagogical paradigm. This shows that schools need to manage their character education system with a reflective pedagogic paradigm so that students feel changes in attitudes and behavior due to the involvement of all school members in strengthening and sharpening character education.",

In this context, it is aimed to examine the predictors of students' early literacy and numeracy skills on their later math and science achievements across countries. A quantitative research approach using a correlational survey design was performed. The sample of this study consists of 15815 fifth-grade students who participated in TIMSS-2019 from Norway, South Africa, and Türkiye. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze data obtained from two different scales and students' math and science tests. The study's findings supported the essential roles that early literacy and numeracy skills play in fifth-grade students' math and science achievement in the three-country contexts. The results revealed that the more frequent involvement of parents in early literacy activities could increase children's later science achievement and that children's ability to perform early numeracy tasks better when beginning primary school could increase students' later mathematics achievement. Another result of the study is that for countries where all of the other early academic skills within the scope of this study are statistically significant, they can contribute positively to students' later mathematics and science achievement, which may be long-term. Finally, it is recommended that activities and tasks to increase parental participation can be included in preschool curricula. In addition, support that can help children develop early academic skills can be provided to children who have not yet started primary school and their parents.

Two methods are combined in the research. As a first step, the integration of technology in education/teaching models literature was analyzed, synthesized, and categories were created based on the critics. Next, technology-related courses in teacher training curricula were defined, the content of those courses was analyzed, and some content and suggestions were proposed for better technology-integrated courses. Even though literature indicates the most critical barriers to technology integration in education are hardware problems and the lack of technical infrastructure, one of the underlying factors is the teachers' inadequacy in ICT, the usage of technology in education, and technology integration literacy. These inadequacies are the result of the training curriculum deficiencies. There are three suggestions based on the findings and for further studies. The first one is to add courses and contents to the teacher-training curriculum as discussed in interpretation and discussion. Secondly, instructional technology courses should have specific content related to the content area. The syllabus should be developed with the cooperation of the content area teacher trainer for each subject area. Finally, as a part of curriculum development, these proposed courses and their content should be reevaluated for further studies. [This article includes an extended summary in Turkish.]",

        "description":"At the beginning of primary school, young children need to adapt academically, socially, and emotionally to their new school environment. Enjoying going to school and becoming socially integrated are important preconditions for successful learning. However, children from disadvantaged families have fewer resources and receive less support, and such deficits can result in lower attainment, negative emotions, and lower well-being. In recent years, interest in emotions and well-being in school has grown in educational research. However, studies analyzing the affective characteristics of disadvantaged students, especially in primary school, are still scarce. In this study, we analyzed reciprocal relationships between school enjoyment, social integration, and achievement using cross-lagged structural equation modeling (Grades 1 and 2), while controlling for family background and sex. We used data from the National Educational Panel Study in Germany (NEPS; N = 4,986). Results showed positive effects of school enjoyment on achievement and social integration on school enjoyment. Additionally, a better home learning environment had positive effects on school enjoyment and social integration in Grade 1. Effects of socioeconomic and migration background on school enjoyment and social integration were not significant. Our results show no evidence that educationally disadvantaged students are additionally disadvantaged in their school enjoyment or social integration at the beginning of primary school.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents faced many hardships such as economic and health disparities. This resulted in an influx of reported and presumably unreported adverse childhood experiences. The most reported experience included child neglect and psychological maltreatment (Sonu et al., 2021). While not seen as popular in the media and literature, the impact of psychological maltreatment is more severe than any other form of abuse (Hines, 2020).

To be able to keep up with these rapid life changes depends on some basic skills that the individual should have. The World Health Organization has determined these 21st-century basic life skills that everyone should have for a quality life as decision-making, problem-solving, creative thinking, effective communication skills, interpersonal relations, critical thinking, self-awareness, empathy, coping with emotions and coping with stress. In order to guarantee their future, societies should provide their new generations, especially their students, with these life skills in schools. This research aims to determine the knowledge levels of teachers about 21st-century life skills and to determine their opinions on developing 21st-century life skills in their students. The case study design, which is one of the qualitative research methods, was used in the research. The study group of the research consists of 8 teachers, 2 male and 6 female, who are graduate students in Hatay Mustafa Kemal University, Department of Educational Sciences and also work in public schools affiliated with Hatay Provincial Directorate of National Education. A semi-structured interview form developed by the researcher was used as a data collection tool in the research. Research data were collected through face-to-face interviews with teachers. In the research, it was concluded that the teachers experienced the most problems in transferring their life skills due to the lack of time, the intensity of the curriculum, and the arrangement of appropriate materials and classroom environment.",

        "description":"It is aimed in this study to analyze the effects of the Montessori education method on children with Down syndrome and autism having special training who have received and not received Montessori education through the Eurofit test batteries selected for motor skills and physical fitness. A total of 20 male children with Down syndrome and autism in the age range of 12 to 16 and receiving and not receiving Montessori education at two different special education and rehabilitation centers in Kayseri were included in the study. The treatment group included a total of 10 children, 5 with Down syndrome and 5 with autism, and the control group of 10 children, 5 with Down syndrome and 5 with autism. While the volunteers included in the treatment group received Montessori education, those included in the control group received a traditional education. In the study, the volunteers performed the selected Eurofit tests including flamingo balance, plate tapping, sit and reach, handgrip and standing long jump tests. When the results of the Eurofit test batteries of the treatment and control groups were examined, plate tapping and standing long jump test results were found significant in the comparison of the pretest and posttest of the treatment group (p &lt; 0.05). In the pretest and posttest comparison of the control group students, a significant difference was determined in the sit and reach test (p &lt; 0.05). In the posttest comparison of the control and treatment groups, a statistically significant difference was determined between the pretest and posttest measurements of the plate tapping and between the pretest and posttest measurements of the standing long jump (p&lt;0.05). In the pretest comparison of the control and treatment groups, no statistically significant difference was found between the pretest and posttest of flamingo balance, pretest and posttest of plate tapping, pretest and posttest of sit and reach, pretest and posttest of standing long jump and pretest and posttest of handgrip measurements of the control and treatment groups (p&gt;0.05). Consequently, the use of Montessori education materials supports the big and small muscle groups of children with disabilities since most of them learn about an object through touch. In our study, when some activity and motor skills of the children with down syndrome and autism in the special rehabilitation school that uses the Montessori education method were analyzed, it was observed that there was an improvement in their physical activities and some motor skills according to the results of plate tapping, standing long jump and sit and reach tests. It is recommended that education programs can be prepared by using Montessori Approach as part of the education programs applied in preschool education institutions and that they can be used more widely together with traditional education programs.",

The aims were to capture teachers' recent experiences concerning (1) access and use of technology; (2) any student learning losses observed, and teachers' recommendations to address lost learning; and (3) experiences and needs concerning teacher professional development (TPD). Key findings were (1) forty percent of teachers reported that their school lacked access to any form of technological device, with almost half stating they never used digital technologies for teaching and learning purposes. (2) Almost half of the teachers perceived that girls' learning suffered more than boys, and more than 60% of teachers believed learners from the financially poorest households suffered the greatest learning losses. (3) Teachers in Tanzania engaged in very little TPD and wanted increased support. The key differences across teacher groups were further examined by demographic factors, with notable differences apparent between urban and rural teachers, teachers with different levels of experience and different qualification levels. Recommendations are presented to stakeholders across the education ecosystem, including policymakers, school leaders, TPD designers, teachers, and researchers. The findings inform a national technology-mediated TPD programme in Tanzania.",

A total of 817 students participated in the study, 497 of which were in the EFA study and 320 in the CFA study. As a result of EFA, a three-factor structure was obtained for each subscale which explained 55.57% of the total variance for the time and chronology perception (TCP) subscale; 52.04% of the total variance for the historical empathy (HE) subscale; and 49.01% of the total variance for the historical inquiry (HI) subscale. Findings from CFA showed that the subscales had sufficient fit indices and their reliability coefficients were within acceptable limits. Findings reveal that the scale can be used as a valid and reliable tool in determining students' historical thinking skills. [This article includes an extended summary in Turkish.]",

        "description":"Higher-order thinking skills are of great importance for the welfare and development of a particular society since it depends on the quality of the decisions taken by individuals. Apart from families, teachers play a crucial role in equipping pupils with these skills such as critical, analytical, reflective or creative, but to do this, they should initially possess them, which requires a special training tailored for teaching these skills. This study focused on the effectiveness of &quot;Critical and Analytical Thinking&quot; course (CATC) taught at a bachelor of education program based on teacher candidates' opinions regarding course design, materials, delivery and strengths and weaknesses of the course. CATC was delivered online due to COVID-19 pandemic conditions; however, provided invaluable insights for future implementations regarding its delivery, activity types and evaluation system. The study was conducted as an analytical study by incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods. The data were collected through Critical and Analytical Thinking Survey and written interview forms developed by the researcher. The participants were 78 teacher candidates who took the course and volunteered to participate in the study. The results revealed that CATC was highly influential on their individual and professional development and not only the theoretical but the practical elements of the course were beneficial for the teacher candidates. Based on the research results, this study concluded with a lesson proposal to be implemented both face-to-face and/or online with similar teacher candidates at education faculties.

Focusing on these global-wide studies within the context of the Ecological System Theory, this meta-synthesis aims to identify the common factors that hinder the curricular change implementation and to reveal the final synthesis that will lead to effective curricular change adoption. Hence, 10 studies from seven country settings (Türkiye, Japan, Colombia, South Korea, China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh) were included in the sample of the study. The analyses uncovered similar factors such as teachers' qualifications at the micro-level, lack of support and infrastructure at the meso-level, and lack of guidance or misalignment between curricular change and high-stakes testing policy at the macro-level for blocking the implementation. The synthesis indicated weaknesses between the systems from macro to micro, which resulted in the lack of interactions, as well as the coordination needed for the curricular change adoption. When they are improved, the connection between the systems will be built and all the needed contexts will be structured for the adoption. Consequently, the implications for the interaction improvement are provided. [This article includes an extended summary in Turkish.]",

As this approach has led to student stress and a narrow instructional focus, the Japanese Government revised educational goals toward more holistic development of well-rounded citizens who are healthy, independent, creative, and work collaboratively with others. However, many teachers did not know how to promote these new goals. This study investigated Japanese educators' application of Philosophy for Children, a discussion-based inquiry approach that has been used to promote socioemotional learning and well-being. Methods included email communications with 29 educators, analysis of Japanese language documents related to the approach in Japan, and observations of meetings of educators who used the method. Educators applied the approach to elementary, secondary, and university settings. The approach was used to promote socioemotional learning and critical thinking among Japanese children. Some have used the approach to facilitate children's healing after the Tohoku earthquake and other trauma. Facilitators applied the approach outside of the classroom in public settings like train stations to promote everyday citizens' expression and understanding. The results suggest that Philosophy for Children has the potential to promote holistic goals for children and adults.",

There is a large corpus of research on how to teach PA to young language learners. In spite of these relevant data, there is a dearth of literacy information on PA in Arabic, especially targeting Saudi students. The focus of this discussion is to describe how to introduce phonological awareness activities into the curriculum to benefit kindergarten-aged Arabic speakers in Saudi Arabia. In addition, this research review describes PA abilities and the significance of rhymes, rhythms, and syllables. Finally, this paper will also provide examples illustrating how Saudi teachers may use the holistic language theory (i.e., whole language approach) to implement PA through the use of games, songs, and storyboards comprised of rhymes, rhythms, and syllables. The implications suggest PA is essential for young Saudi learners' mastery of reading, speaking, and learning Arabic.",

One of these values is to highly regard education.

Within this context, the aim of this study was to examine the &quot;possible selves&quot; of pre-service teachers in order to consider implications for their future orientations. Sequential explanatory mixed-method design with a stratified purposeful sampling technique was used in the study. One hundred eighty-six junior and senior pre-service elementary school teachers constituted the quantitative strand sample of the study and thirteen of the participants were purposefully selected for the qualitative strand. Findings reveal pre-service teachers indicate a high level of &quot;expected possible selves&quot; while demonstrating a low level of &quot;feared possible selves&quot; in the &quot;uncaring teacher&quot; and &quot;uninspired instruction&quot; dimensions. However, pre-service participants expressed fears about the &quot;loss of control&quot; dimension of &quot;feared possible selves.&quot; One of the main reasons for this fear was their on-line teaching practicum course, which provided limited experience of classroom and learning management in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

STEAM programs coincide with the Whole Child approach as it allows them to expand their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, build their social-emotional needs, and be prepared for the 21st century workforce. STEAM programs are designed to emphasize inquiry and an interdisciplinary approach that reflects the tenets of the Whole Child paradigm. Much of the research that has been done in STEAM and Whole Child education pushes for further implementation of high-quality programs in schools so students can learn in a way that best fits their needs. However, there are many barriers and funding issues that preclude schools from the full implementation of high-quality, Whole Child STEAM programs that foster equity and accessibility especially for marginalized populations. These barriers and suggestions for overcoming them are discussed through a policy lens so curriculum can be flexible and more interdisciplinary and so that students have multiple opportunities to be nurtured in their creativity.",

Their usage has been of special interest in online self-learning scenarios to increase student retention and improve the learning experience. In this article, we present the design of a hybrid course recommendation system for an online learning platform. The proposed hybrid system articulates the recommendation carried out by collaborative and content-based filter strategies. For the collaborative filtering recommender, we address the challenge of recommending meaningful content with limited information from users by using rating estimation strategies from a log system (Google Analytics). Our approach posits strategies to mine logs and generates effective ratings through the counting and temporal analysis of sessions. We evaluate different rating penalty strategies and compare the use of per-user metrics for rating estimation. For the content-based recommender, we compare different text embeddings that range from well-known topic models (LSA and LDA) to more recent multilingual contextual embeddings pre-trained on large-scale unlabelled corpora. The results show that the best model in terms of P@5 was the Collaborative filtering recommendation model with a value of 0.4, i.e., two out of five courses recommended could be of the user's interest. This result is satisfactory considering that our models were trained from ratings inferred from implicit user data. The content-based strategies did not yield significant results, however, these strategies help to mitigate the cold start problem and validate the use of a combined hybrid strategy.",

In practice, however, delivering timely feedback to students can be challenging for instructors for a variety of reasons (e.g., limited teaching resources). In many cases, feedback arrives too late for learners to act on the advice and reinforce their understanding. To this end, researchers have designed various automated feedback systems in different domains, including novice programming, short-essay writing, and open-ended questions. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated automated feedback generation for a more complex form of student work - student project reports. In this work, we present a novel data-driven system, dubbed &quot;Insta-Reviewer,&quot; for automatically generating instant feedback on student project reports. In addition to automatic metrics such as ROUGE scores and BERTScore, we propose a five-dimension framework for manually evaluating system-generated feedback. Experimental results show that feedback generated by Insta-Reviewer on real students' project reports can achieve near-human quality. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of automatic feedback generation for students' project reports while highlighting several prominent challenges for future research",

Recent scholarship has suggested that numerous student learning predictors are enhanced when interacting with flexible seating. This study aims to fill a gap in the literature by investigating the effects of flexible seating from a physical perspective in the higher education setting. Seventy-five participants engaged in mixed-method data collection and analysis strategies that included observations and field notes, a validated online survey, and open-ended question prompts. A thematic review and descriptive analysis revealed almost 80% of the respondents indicated that the flexible seating had a positive effect on their experience in the course related to the following themes: (a) Movement Opportunity; (b) Back Pain &amp; Comfort; (c) Anxiety &amp; Restlessness; and (d) Focus &amp; Engagement. This research provides evidence that physically comfortable classrooms promote a sense of well-being, keep minds focused, and limit distractions, and that physically comfortable classrooms with increased movement opportunities for students make possible mental and emotional health benefits, as well. Results indicate the need for campuses to (re)consider the purposes and roles of seating styles within the 21st century classrooms, with seating selection based on principles of universal design.",

Current approaches tend to consider only institution-centric objectives (e.g. enrollment, revenue) and neglect student-centric objectives in their formulations of the problem. There is lack of consideration to the need to improve access and affordability to higher education. Previously, we contributed a metaheuristic and machine learning approach for optimizing strategies that allocate merit-based awards and need-based aid. The approach can be used to optimize both institutioncentric (e.g. enrollment and revenue) and student-centric objectives (affordability and accessibility to higher education). We now employed an improved version of this approach to explore comprehensively a recent admission dataset from our university. We showed that current applicants depended very much on financial sources other than federal and institution aid to attend the university. This potentially created a financial burden for many of these applicants. We identified seven budget-friendly strategies that promise to increase access to higher education significantly by more than 100%, while still keeping it affordable for students and limiting a budget increase to less than 7%. Additionally, we identified a total of 111 strategies, including those that benefit from more aggressive changes in the budget to obtain higher increases in enrollment, revenue, and/or higher affordability and accessibility for students. This method may be used by other institutions in ways that best fit their institutional objectives and students' profiles.",

Students skilled in SRL are more likely to effectively set goals, search for information, and direct their attention and cognitive process so that they align their efforts with their objectives. An influential framework for SRL, the SMART model (Winne, 2017), proposes that five cognitive operations (i.e., searching, monitoring, assembling, rehearsing, and translating) play a key role in SRL. However, these categories encompass a wide range of behaviors, making measurement challenging -- often involving observing individual students and recording their think-aloud activities or asking students to complete labor-intensive tagging activities as they work. In the current study, to achieve better scalability, we operationalized indicators of SMART operations and developed automated detectors using machine learning. We analyzed students' textual responses and interaction data collected from a mathematical learning platform where students are asked to thoroughly explain their solutions and are scaffolded in communicating their problem-solving process. Due to the rarity in data for one of the seven SRL indicators operationalized, we built six models to reflect students' use of four SMART operations. These models are found to be reliable and generalizable, with AUC ROCs ranging from 0.76-0.89. When applied to the full test set, these detectors are relatively robust to algorithmic bias, performing well across different student populations and with no consistent bias against a specific group of students.",

        "description":"This study explores how teachers' perceptions of students' math anxiety changed during online learning imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the focus group method of qualitative research for a group of selected math teachers, we have looked into the following questions: How was the students' perceived level of math anxiety in online classes? What differences and what similarities have the teachers noticed in comparison with the face-to-face learning? The results of the study show that the phenomenon of math anxiety is decreasing and is becoming less significant than in face-to face education. Moreover, our research showed that the frame description of how teachers perceived the students' math anxiety implies two different different processes: the students' engagement in online learning (SEO) and the students' digital competences (DC). It seems that students' digital competences has a positive effect on learning mathematics, a fact that leads to students' experiencing less anxiety. Also, the phenomenon of math anxiety may be caused by the lack of students' engagement in online learning. Students who don't have digital skills, tend to avoid participating in online mathematics classes.",

        "description":"Student success and drop-out predictions have gained increased attention in recent years, connected to the hope that by identifying struggling students, it is possible to intervene and provide early help and design programs based on patterns discovered by the models. Though by now many models exist achieving remarkable accuracy-values, models outputting simple probabilities are not enough to achieve these ambitious goals. In this paper, we argue that they can be a first exploratory step of a pipeline aiming to be capable of reaching the mentioned goals. By using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as SHAP and LIME, we can understand what features matter for the model and make the assumption that features important for successful models are also important in real life. By then additionally connecting this with an analysis of counterfactuals and a theory-driven causal analysis, we can begin to reasonably understand not just &quot;if&quot; a student will struggle but &quot;why&quot; and provide fitting help. We evaluate the pipeline on an artificial dataset to show that it can, indeed, recover complex causal mechanisms and on a real-life dataset showing the method's applicability. We further argue that collaborations with social scientists are mutually beneficial in this area but also discuss the potential negative effects of personal intervention systems and call for careful designs.",

In this field, one of the most important subjects examined is 'Principles of Economic Theory'. It was introduced in the panhellenic examinations in 2000 and is still in existence today. The textbook of the course has not undergone any changes and according to many economists it contains anachronistic information and knowledge. In this context, the Greek Ministry of Education decided to introduce a new course entitled &quot;Principles of Economic Science&quot; from the school year 2025-2026 and consequently to write an updated textbook. In this paper we evaluate the adequacy of the old textbook to determine, on the one hand, whether the change in the curriculum was necessary and, on the other hand, whether its replacement in secondary education was correct. Through descriptive statistics and inferential testing and using the prefecture of Rethymno, Crete, as a case study, we cross-check the attitudes of students and economics teachers towards the textbook, to draw our conclusions.",

        "description":"This article includes multiple case studies that aim to explore the effectiveness of using video modeling on the development of daily living skills in middle and high school students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In this study we used video modeling to train five daily life skills in students with ASD. The students watched the videos according to a specific procedure. The participants in the study were four students with ASD enrolled in special education, two boys from the 8th grade, and two students (a boy and a girl) from the 9th grade. Data were collected by applying the Waisman Scale for Daily Living Skills (W-ADL) at the beginning and end of the intervention and the Observation Grid that was completed for each individual student, during each session/session, throughout the duration of the intervention. The results showed that video modeling is an effective technique for teaching a wide range of daily living skills to students with autism spectrum disorders that they were able to master, achieving 100% of them on their own, some in a shorter time frame, others in a larger number of sessions. The findings and recommendations of the study suggest that video modeling is not only an evidencebased practice to train daily living skills in students with ASD, but also that the use of video modeling is beneficial because of the reusable and portable technology. Future research should further explore the effectiveness of video modeling on the training of both daily living skills and other activities (eg: assembling a toy, playing games with peers, evacuating in case of fire, but also activities of teaching) to pre-schoolers and young school children.",

        "description":"Demand for education in Computer Science has increased markedly in recent years. With increased demand has come to an increased need for student support, especially for courses with large programming projects. Instructors commonly provide online post forums or office hours to address this massive demand for help requests. Identifying what types of questions students are asking in those interactions and what triggers their help requests can in turn assist instructors in better managing limited help-providing resources. In this study, we aim to explore students' help-seeking actions from the two separate approaches we mentioned before and investigate their coding actions before help requests to understand better what motivates students to seek help in programming projects. We collected students' help request data and commit logs from two Fall offerings of a CS2 course. In our analysis, we first believe that different types of questions should be related to different behavioral patterns. Therefore, we first categorized students' help requests based on their content (e.g., Implementation, General Debugging, or Addressing Teaching Staff (TS) Test Failures). We found that General Debugging is the most frequently asked question. Then we analyzed how the popularity of each type of request changed over time. Our results suggest that implementation is more popular in the early stage of the project cycle, and it changes to General Debugging and Addressing TS Failures in the later stage. We also calculated the accuracy of students' commit frequency one hour before their help requests; the results show that before Implementation requests, the commit frequency is significantly lower, and before TS failure requests, the frequency is significantly higher. Moreover, we checked before any help request whether students changed their source code or test code. The results show implementation requests related to higher chances of source code changes and coverage questions related to more test code changes. Moreover, we use a Markov Chain model to show students' action sequences before, during, and after the requests. And finally, we explored students' progress after the office hours interaction and found that over half of the students improved the correctness of their code after 20 minutes of their office hours interaction addressing TS failures ends.",

        "description":"The purpose of the study was to examine the prevalence, type and frequency of supervision provided to school counsellors, as well as to map experienced counsellors' expectations of the supervisor. The research question guiding this study was: What is the platform, type and frequency of supervision provided to school counsellors, and what are experienced counsellors' expectations of the supervisor? An online survey was employed to collect data for the present study from the respondents (N=78). The survey was distributed to Israeli counsellors via an announcement posted on a dedicated WhatsApp group. The survey results indicated that 71% of the counsellors receive supervision, where 44% receive individual supervision and 78% group supervision. Sixty-seven percent of the supervision sessions are provided at the school and the rest at the district and in workshops. Regarding experienced counsellors' expectations of the supervisor, a higher proportion than novice counsellors noted the following topics: additional points of view, space for deliberation, new intervention tools, good understanding of their feelings, emotional ventilation, new knowledge in counselling, as well as the wish to receive emotional support and clear guidance. This data suggests that experienced counsellors need regular supervision to enhance their awareness and professionalism and that their needs change throughout their years of work. At the same time, some counsellors still need the dominant and directing presence of a supervisor even after many years of work, a fact that indicates personal aspects that affect the role of the counsellor. This paper contributes additional knowledge concerning experienced school counsellors and suggests expanding the range of possibilities according to counsellors' needs.",

        "description":"Studies that have been conducted on the topic of self-esteem have shown that it contributes considerably to various important areas of life. However, research has proven that there is ontogenetic variation in self-esteem, and the factors that contribute to its development are not yet very clearly defined (Robins et.al. 2002, Orth &amp; Robins, 2022). Furthermore, researchers suggest that greater consideration should be given to the development of self-esteem in the context of close relationships (Erol &amp; Orth, 2014), in addition to the implementation of engagements aimed at improving self-esteem. These engagements are intended to bring considerable benefits, both to the individuals and to society (Orth &amp; Robins, 2022). In this context, the present research study aims to examine the impact of personal development activities on the level of self-esteem development in primary school students. For the purpose of this goal, we base our arguments on the hypothesis that personal development activities do determine the improvement of the level of self-esteem in primary school students. The design of the study entails quantitative, quasi-experimental, pre-posttest research. The trial was carried out on 40 subjects distributed in two groups, experimental and control. As a methodological tool, we used the LAWSEQ questionnaire (Lawrence, 1981), which measures the general level of self-esteem. After analyzing the data, it was observed that the average level of self-esteem felt by the students in the experimental group was higher than that of the students in the control group, nevertheless, differences were not significant from a statistical point of view. In conclusion, the research hypothesis, according to which: Personal development activities determine the improvement of the level of self-esteem in primary school students, was not confirmed. Thus, it is necessary to reconfigure some of the personal development activities that were proposed, and the topic requires additional research.",

The increasing importance of practice in teacher education is a global educational policy trend, but the national context necessarily influences implementation. However, few studies researched comparing teacher education in developing countries, although the national context is essential to understand the organization and operation of teacher education systems (Tatto, 2021) where the main obstacle is the linguistic diversity of different countries. This study referred to Weidman et al. (2014) conceptual framework for comparative and international teacher education. The qualitative document analysis method with MAXQDA software is used to analyze teacher education policy documents, mainly focusing on the aim, structure, and student activities. Researchers developed a common codebook, imported it into the software, and analyzed 39 documents. The results revealed that the aim and definition of the practicum are similar, but the learning outcomes of student teachers' practice related to practicum are a little different between the four countries. Student teachers are required to complete the practicum as part of their preservice teacher education program in four countries. Teacher education policy documents in four countries have addressed all the elements and requirements related to teacher education contexts, however, the implementation level of the practicum in each country may differ significantly. Nevertheless, this study compares the practicum in teacher education document, highlights similarities and differences, and shares the best practices from four countries.",

The starting point of understanding the purpose of an institutions is to analyse the content of mission statements and the context in which the universities operate. The content of the mission statements of the six selected open and distance universities from Sub-Saharan countries were analysed using contextual content analysis. The role of mission statements is to communicate the purpose of the institution to stakeholders. Although most open and distance universities mentioned some of the principles of openness, many mission statements were silent on access, equity and student-centredness. The findings revealed that there is misalignment between what the university claims to do and their practice. This shows that these institutions did not consider the open and distance education principles and context when developing mission statements.",

        "description":"Despite a culture of sharing in education, awareness of Open Educational Resources (OER) in teacher education and K-12 education is limited. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to explore graduate-level teacher candidates' (n = 9) understanding of OER, the value they placed on it, and their self-efficacy in sharing work openly after participating in a renewable assignment. Data collected included a survey, course artifacts, and interviews. Of the nine participants, three openly licensed their work and one shared their resource publicly on OER Commons. Further findings indicate that the participants' understanding of OER improved and they valued OER as part of their practice in both using and sharing resources. Participants indicated that they lacked teacher self-efficacy about their work for varied reasons. However, after receiving positive student outcomes and feedback from peers, participants were more open to sharing their work publicly. Implications for teacher education are discussed.",

Meaningfulness is an extremely subjective factor, which depends on experiences, values, attitudes and much more. &quot;The ways in which adults learn in and through the workplace are rooted in educational trajectories and their complex intertwining with social institutions (of labour market, workplace, community) and social roles (of employee, citizen, family member) at different stages of the life-course&quot; (Kersh et al., 2011, 355). The interplay between work, studies and lifeworld is the focus of this study, conducted at the University College Copenhagen in 2020-2021. At the College, and in teacher training in particular, we are asking two important questions these days: How can we establish an engaging learning culture in our educational program? How can we create space for all students to find the relevant content to engage with? How can this be done when our students are so diverse according to age, life and work experiences, life situation and life interests? In this article, I analyse my own workplace learning and professional development during my first 2 years at University College, where I have been working on transforming my experience from the university to a new context -- a professional teacher education program at University College.",

To date, most of the EDI studies are conducted in the Nordic context where management, employees and public authorities work closely with each other. In more hierarchical societies, such as those in Asia, employees may be given less discretion in exercising initiative to improve work processes and conditions. This study seeks to provide insights on factors that support employees initiating, enacting and sustaining innovations in Singapore SMEs through case studies. Besides interviews, data gathering was also undertaken through observations of the employees, supervisors/managers and owners at work and their interactions where possible. It is found that employees' engagement in workplace learning contribute to initiation, enactment and sustenance of EDI in Singapore SMEs. The findings underline the significance of workplace learning in developing and strengthening employees' innovation capacity.",

        "description":"The development of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programs for vocational teachers in Africa has been hampered by a lack of relevant research on their CPD practices and learning needs. This study therefore investigated the learning needs of vocational teachers in Kenya based on the professional competencies vocational teachers identify as essential for their work and their self-perception of competence. Using a concurrent mixed methods approach, data was collected from 170 questionnaire respondents and sixteen interview participants from six Technical, Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions in Kenya. Despite TVET teachers perceiving themselves as highly competent, they were found to express a relatively high need for CPD. The need was most strongly expressed by teachers who had received Initial Teacher Education (ITE), which suggested that ITE has a positive influence in sensitising teachers on the need for CPD. New teachers were however found to have a lower perception of competence. Mentorship for new teachers is thus recommended. An unexpected finding was that while TVET teachers in Kenya identify good teaching skills as an essential competency for vocational teachers, they assume mastery of content translates to good teaching skills. It is thus recommended that the curriculum for TVET teachers in Kenya be reviewed to help teachers appreciate, identify, and develop subject-specific teaching skills.",

Specifically, the issues, such as the preparation of young people for the world of work, facilitating the links between academic studies and practical experiences, and situating practice-based education have become central to the higher education landscape. This article discusses the extent to which practically-based higher education learning spaces can be constructed and co-constructed, involving the cooperation and collaboration of different stakeholders: employers, university lecturers and students. The article will particularly draw on the perspectives from a case study of practically-based higher education in the hospitality sector in England. Drawing on this case study the article will address the following research questions: (1) How can practically-based learning spaces be constructed and co-constructed within the context of higher education? and (2) What is the role of different stakeholders in this process? The article argues that the development of a practically-based higher education learning space is much more complex than simply bringing together academic and practical learning, and involves both institutional affordances, industry engagement and collaboration of key stakeholders.",

Using mixed methods: surveys, focus groups, and iterations, we assessed assignment structures and created design guidance for renewable assignments and open pedagogy. We find that in a remote course, these assignments were effective in advancing learning goals. Both students and teachers favored their inclusion in the course. Analysis revealed six design principles to maximize effectiveness of renewable assignments and courses, and empowering teachers and learners to contribute to open knowledge. These principles also provide insight to praxis related to theories of open pedagogy, scaffolding, peer interaction, and active learning.",

        "description":"Work practices and learning are entangled processes that operate differently in each workplace. Central factors producing this diversity are the informal, social and affective cultures facilitated and supported in each workplace. Recent research findings further suggest that these informal modes of workplace practice are critical for how people in these organisations learn, and for their capacity to innovate and adapt to changes in their business environment. Lockdowns implemented because of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which many organisations and individuals have had to embrace remote working using digital devices, software and broadband, have significantly reduced opportunities for these important informal and social dimensions of workplace practice. Given the likelihood that diverse forms and degrees of remote working will become part of the post-pandemic 'new normal', we discuss in this paper approaches to researching the extent to which, and in what forms, the benefits of informal interactions can be enabled and replicated in situations of partially or wholly remote working. The paper contributes to the literature on workplace learning by critically discussing the effects of the pandemic, and especially remote working, on the modern workplace, and discussing possible future directions for research.",

Eight university instructors from the same university in Turkey with one year of experience in online teaching participated in the study. The study first conducted a needs analysis, that revealed that the instructors were not accustomed to student-centered instructional methods, and they maintained direct instruction in their online courses. Moreover, the instructors' technology integration understanding was inadequate, and they were generally concerned about the students' low participation in online classes. Considering these findings, the professional development program was designed for the instructors who first joined a one-week design-based learning training and then attended mentorship for two weeks. The findings indicated that this approach was effective for the instructors' professional development.

The findings first revealed that the vision statements of the units cover all system levels from technology to the broader socioeconomic context. Improving quality is the most underlined statement, followed by becoming a leading institution and enabling equity and access. On the other hand, it was observed that there is an overlap between their vision and mission statements, and many of the academic units use similar statements.

        "description":"Professional learning is complex and is the result of a mix of experiences made in academic and workplace settings. An interesting step in the learning trajectories of professionals is represented by internship. Interns have to engage in boundary crossing when connecting academic learning with professional practices. An interesting issue to explore concerns the experiences of undergraduate interns when they encounter challenges in workplaces. Drawing upon Dewey's notion of experience to examine internship learning, this article focuses on the role of sociomateriality when neophytes--interns--enter the workplace. Analysing semi-structured interviews with undergraduates (N = 38) performing their internship at the public relations and communication industry where internship is not an established practice, we present three findings. First, materiality of work activity plays a central role in organizing learning for interns at the workplace. Second, interns report networking at the workplace for convergence of work objectives which in turn provides opportunities and constraints for learning about the logic of workplace activities. Finally, interns report balancing between different identities during internship practice in order to direct their participatory efforts within the complex workplace organization. The value of internship learning calls for agency from the learners while considering the implications for the workplace organisations where learning experiences are located. Finally, we bring attention to the role of the workplace supervisors and faculty members in the development of professional learning in such complex professional learning settings.",

        "title":"The Self-Willed Child -- Basic Needs and Education in Post-Mythic Times Outlines of a Responsive Pedagogy",
        "author":["Skiera, Ehrenhard"],
        "description":"From the beginning of its existence, the child is articulating an unconditional claim to life. Even in the post-mythic era, or rather in the myth-critical world of the modern age, education is confronted with the difficult task of responding to this claim -- but now without the possibility of being able to legitimise its interventions and actions by appealing to an unquestionably absolute authority. First of all, this means questioning the coercion that is primordially inscribed in education. May parents, may teachers, may educators force the compliance of the self-willed child? All guardians of a supposedly true and unconditional social order will answer the question with &quot;yes&quot;. For even since antiquity, human beings have been granted free will, but this -- according to the great Church teacher Augustine in the 5th century -- is &quot;not always good&quot;. For this reason, education was, and to some extent still is, a project to replace the &quot;bad&quot; self-will with a will that was as fully &quot;good&quot; as possible, or an attempt to at least neutralise or tame the bad parts of the will. In the case of success, so the anxious hope of education, the child can protect itself as well as the community into which it is born from &quot;evil&quot; and from sinful misfortune. Since the rebellious discourse of the dignity of man, one cannot avoid including the child, even the wayward one, in the circle of dignity. As in politics, so also in education, dealing with resistance and &quot;deviants&quot; shows the real meaning of values such as freedom, justice, codecision, public spirit and the protection of life. The question is how the values are anthropologically justified, normatively interpreted and practically concretised. In more recent times, i.e. in the modern age that is far removed from God and critical of myths, this poses a particular challenge. Now, the legitimisation of education in general, as well as its moments of coercion in particular, can no longer be justified with a &quot;Higher Will&quot; as it was centuries ago. Coercion inevitably emanates from the authoritative counterpart of the child, from the holder of the &quot;educational power&quot; -- as a spontaneous action of responsible adults as well as in the form of a longer-term and planned effort on the part of socially legitimised authorities. This study attempts to provide food for thought from historical, conceptual-systematic, various theoretical and practical perspectives regarding the &quot;eternal&quot; question of the inherently contradictory relationship between child and educator or between individual and community/society. In the post-mythic era, according to the thesis, there is a need for a constant dialogue effort based on agreement in the sense of an authentic culture of responsive communication. According to its intention, it establishes a creative space of claim and response in which every human being has a right to a voice and a hearing. In this endeavour, the child to be educated must be included as a relevant co-creator of his or her educational process, if he or she is not to be made a mere object of foreign ambitions and demands. For the possibility of an education that respects human dignity and is resolutely oriented towards universal values is ultimately dependent on the free consent of the child and the later adult.",

Despite the importance of teachers' resilience, it seems that insufficient studies have been done on Iranian EFL teachers' resilience resources and strategies that make them immune to the difficulties and challenges that might lead to their burnout. To this end, a mixed-method study was conducted. The participants of the quantitative phase of the study were 79 EFL teachers who filled in the questionnaire, and only 65 questionnaires were completed. Out of 65 teachers, 36 Iranian EFL teachers who showed low and high scores on the Multidimensional Teachers' Resilience Scale (MTRS) accepted to participate in the qualitative section of the study. A series of semi-structured, one-on-one interviews were conducted. To ensure data validity, other data collection tools, including journal keeping and classroom observation, were also applied. Data analysis, guided by the grounded theory approach, resulted in a multi-dimensional approach involving interrelated aspects of personal, professional, organizational, social, and economic dimensions. The study may offer helpful resources and strategies to address some of the challenges faced by teachers in the profession.",

The aim is to demonstrate that learning at work mainly manifests informally and to identify its patterns. Companies shifting towards teleworking during the pandemic further increased the importance of informal learning. The empirical research uses complex methodology of three pillars: A questionnaire about workplace learning conducted among employees in the IT sector (N = 162). Case studies of three Hungarian IT companies using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Learning activity logging of work-related learning events were recorded by participating employees (N = 19). According to the main conclusions there is a positive correlation between the number of available workplace learning opportunities and opinions on the efficacy of informal learning. Informal learning dominates the learning patterns of employees in a knowledge-intensive industry. In supporting employees' learning the average number of informal learning opportunities are significantly higher than those of formal learning and both employees and employers agree that this mode of learning is more effective. The results highlight that reinterpreting workplace learning is necessary due to economic, social and technological trends not to mention employer flexibility becoming more and more inevitable. Thus, the importance of informal learning is unquestionable.",

        "description":"Scrum is a widely-used framework in industry, so many schools apply it to their software engineering courses, particularly capstone courses. Due to the differences between students and industrial professionals, changing Scrum is necessary to fit capstone projects. In this paper, we suggest a decision-making process to assist instructors in developing a strategy to adapt Scrum for their course. This framework considers critical differences, such as student's workloads and course schedules, and keeps the Agile principles and Scrum events. To evaluate the adapted Scrum, we investigated student's learning experiences, satisfaction, and performance by quantitatively analyzing user story points and source codes and qualitatively studying instructor's evaluations, student's feedback, and Sprint Retrospective notes. Our two case studies about adapted Scrum showed that having daily stand-up meetings in every class was not helpful, student's satisfaction positively correlated to the difficulty of the task they tackled, and the project provided good learning experiences.",

The basis for predisposition assessment was their voluntary self-assessment of certain preferences, which are related to the theory of multiple intelligences of Professor Gardner. The study was conducted on a reference group of IT sector employees, assuming that they will be the model, to which the results of the study will be related. The method used to obtain data about the students' predispositions was a test carried out in an auditorium mode or online. More than 500 students from several countries were surveyed and interesting statistical material was obtained allowing for comparison between groups. The most important result was to find a way to sort the students into groups in order from most similar in their aptitude to the market pattern to least. This made it possible to determine the boundary beyond which students could be considered selected for a job in the IT sector. Statistical hypotheses about the similarity of the student groups to the reference group were verified. The results were both positive, confirming that a large percentage of students have predispositions to work in the IT market, and less promising. The authors are convinced that the method can be applied all over the world, as they examined groups in very diverse countries, taking into account, for example, location, education system, culture or religion.",

This study addressed this gap by exploring teachers' stated and enacted beliefs about (effective) materials use in L2 classroom discourse. To this effect, naturally-occurring interactions within 10 Iranian EFL classes were videotaped for three consecutive sessions. Then, the teachers were interviewed where they reflected on their transformations of textbooks. The data were analysed through document analysis of the textbooks, discourse analysis of the classroom interactions, and content analysis of the interviews. The findings showed that sheer convergence between what teachers think about materials (use) and what they actually do in the classrooms cannot guarantee the attainment of the intended and emergent goals of the lessons and/or activities. In-depth analyses indicated that there exist complex interrelationships between teachers' stated and enacted beliefs. Teachers' levels of understanding of their talk were found to mediate this interplay in classroom discourse. The findings can inform teaching process and teacher education programs by raising teachers' awareness about their actual use of materials and students' engagement in L2 classroom discourse.",

If the data coding is done appropriately, it will lead the researchers to develop patterns or themes and to make final inferences about the research problem. As such, qualitative researchers are supposed to take systematically informed steps and procedures to perform qualitative data coding and analysis. However, this is not as easy as it might be thought, and even published articles might fall short of providing a thorough explanation of their methods and procedures, making it difficult for other researchers, especially early career researchers, to aim for replication of the study. This article presents a review of the methods and data coding and analysis procedures in the field of L2 writing as a case in point. We scrutinized and analyzed all 168 articles with a qualitative orientation published in the &quot;Journal of Second Language Writing&quot; (JSLW) over its lifecycle. We present the results and discuss some articles to illustrate how L2 writing researchers handled qualitative data coding and analysis and showcase problematic areas. The outcomes of the review and analysis, including the showcase articles, provide some tips and guidelines for prospective L2 writing researchers and other stakeholders more broadly.",

From a total of 1,314 articles in seven peer-reviewed accredited AL journals, 220 articles were finally identified to be mixed in method which were subsequently scrutinized based on already established frameworks regarding their research questions, research designs, sampling designs, and inference quality to explore the status quo of mixed methods research (MMR) in AL. We went through two phases of screening to identify the articles which met the principles of MMR and analyzed the selected articles qualitatively based on a coding scheme. The findings revealed (a) only a few research questions were hybrid, (b) both concurrent research designs and concurrent sampling designs were employed more frequently than their sequential counterparts, and (c) only a few articles made their inferences mixed in a principled manner. The findings of several extracts and an open-ended questionnaire showed a growing interest in MMR and the challenges and problems of conducting MMR, respectively. The results might imply that the new paradigms of research favor mixing methods and that the researchers employ it more due to its strengths.",

        "description":"The rapid development of technology in today's times make business' survival a rather complex task. It is therefore necessary for the specialized organization and administration of each company to differentiate and strengthen its competitive advantages. Gamification is an established practice in many business domains and can enforce employees to engage in business processes and change aspects of their behavior. Even though numerous gamification patterns that are described in literature have been used so far by businesses to various working environments, the outcomes were not the best possible that we would expect in terms of their right utilization to business non-game contexts. Thus, there is need for concise gamification patterns that can offer right guidance to game designers in business. Gamification design patterns can provide a distilled knowledge of techniques of how to design object-oriented software. This paper aims to address this gap in existing literature by describing new gamification design patterns, classifying them according to specific criteria and providing new information to this research domain. Our study is a descriptive literature review and is based on review of previous works. This descriptive literature review tries to give a better understanding by proposing new gamification design patterns in the continuously evolving research domain of gamification design patterns.",

We were motivated by the need of filling, at least in part, the gap between the expectation of employers and the competences acquired by students. Indeed, several big-data-related tools and patterns of widespread use in working environments are seldom taught in the academic context. The course also allowed to expose students to company-related processes and topics. So far, the course has been taught for two editions, and a third one is currently ongoing. Using both a quantitative and a qualitative approach, we show that students appreciated this new form of learning activities, in terms of enrollments, exam marks, and activated external theses. We also exploited the received feedback in order to slightly modify the content and the structure of the course.",

        "description":"Preparing students for the workforce is a balancing act that involves theory, practice, and assessment. As students navigate an educational experience that is, however, often distant from real-world needs, it is imperative that academia finds a novel way to bridge the gap. As many organizations utilize open challenges to attract ideas and talent, academia can easily create such bridge, leading to greater engagement, greater student preparation, and a potential employment pipeline. This paper describes the experience of our students and faculty advisors who participated to the NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students) Design Challenge. In particular, we review the pedagogical value of the solution that they created and the changes that were implemented in the curriculum of an undergraduate degree program in Information Technology. This open-source, multi-year project is also a flexible platform that can be utilized for engagement in K-12 education as well as graduate research projects.",

Every year, enterprises are looking for new technologies that can improve the skills of their collaborators, bringing VLE resources to e-training formations. The PSs are actions carried out by professors or manager in their practice, both for e-learning and e-training. In order to develop a PS, it is important to consider the socio-affective profile. For data inference were used: Social and Affective Map. Using these two tools, 38 Socio-affective Scenarios were mapped and their strategies were developed. This study utilizes an applied qualitative approach. As a result, a total of 228 PSs based on Socio-affective Scenarios were developed by 15 specialist professors. Its main contribution is the creation of PS based on criteria that can be adapted to be applied in the industry context.",

        "description":"The misalignment between the skills learned in tertiary education and the skills demanded by industry is well documented. One of the ways this misalignment can be reduced is through the introduction of an internship phase in degrees. This article identifies the perceived benefits and challenges that internship programmes offer academic staff in a tertiary educational facility. It also determines how feedback from the industry helps shape the curriculum of the degree. A qualitative case study is employed through interviews with various staff working at a tertiary education institution. The data generated is analysed using a thematic approach. The results show that internships not only place value on soft skills but also build a communication channel between the mentors that visit students whilst out on placement and the industry staff that oversee the students during the work-based phase. This mutually beneficial interaction between the industry and the education institution helps the mentors maintain familiarity with the latest technologies adopted in the industry and allows the industry to influence the curriculum of the degrees. Internships were shown to offer a means of advertising the skills gained in academia to the audience that would eventually employ the graduates.",

Employing a counterbalanced repeated-measures design, the researchers examined the accuracy of 2327 comments provided by 96 intermediate EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners in synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated conditions. In the synchronous condition, the learners exchanged comments using the desktop version of WhatsApp, and the participants in the asynchronous condition created weblogs and provided feedback in the comment box. All students provided peer feedback in both conditions, and the accuracy of their comments in these computer-mediated environments was compared. Findings showed that the asynchronous condition yielded significantly more accurate comments and fewer missed erroneous items. The data analysis also indicated that low-intermediate students provided more accurate comments in the asynchronous condition. Further, the findings revealed that EFL learners provided comments supported by references to external sources, including textbooks, online sources, teachers' lectures (referentially-justified peer feedback), which were significantly more accurate than those comments not accompanied by references. The findings of this study suggest that when the accuracy of peer feedback is of paramount importance, asynchronous peer feedback design should be implemented.",

        "description":"Balancing assessment of learning outcomes with the expectations of students is a perennial challenge in education. Difficult exams, in which many students perform poorly, exacerbate this problem and can inspire a wide variety of interventions, such as a grading curve. However, addressing poor performance can sometimes distort or inflate grades and demotivate students. Here, I review this problem and propose solutions which are fair and based upon item analysis of an assessment. To correct for exams with questions that were more difficult than intended, item score and discrimination is used to determine a bonus value in a way that is limited and continuous. Educators that utilize item analysis to improve exams for future iterations can easily use this approach to retroactively lessen the burden of some questions. This solution expands the repertoire of tools for achieving a transparent, fair, and equitable means of assessment.",

This synthesis of the literature will reveal four salient themes that SoTL authors have used to understand the concept of empathy. The value of empathy, according to SoTL researchers, will also receive a summarized treatment in this paper. Findings from this first part of the paper promote more accurate interpretations and comparisons of publications about empathy. Relatedly, a less ambiguous definition of empathy allows researchers and practitioners to design more precise studies that attempt to measure empathy in tutors or students, and to implement more precise educational policies involving empathy. The second goal of this paper is to raise a sceptical challenge to advocates of empathy in teaching--this will be done by drawing from the disciplines of psychology and social neuroscience. This paper concludes with a sketch of some pedagogical implications for tertiary educators in light of the worry that was raised against empathy in teaching.",

Using data collected via student surveys and teacher interviews, we present our findings through the transition pedagogy framework which will help learning designers and teachers make quality design decisions. We found students and staff identified positive aspects of IMD, such as accelerating progression, high engagement, and smaller class size. The challenges with IMD include the intensity associated with workload. In most subjects, student attainment was higher in IMD compared to standard delivery over a semester.

In contrast, these changes had to be made in a few days, which is why this situation could be considered as Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT). The objective of this article is to evaluate the teaching of our faculty during this period using the CIPP model (Context, Input, Procedure and Product), which is especially focused on educational projects among others. The university was able to maintain teaching during this period despite the difficulties of the transition. In addition, evaluation surveys show that the satisfaction of professors and students was also maintained. This was possible thanks to the order and clarity transmitted from university authorities and the commitment of the professors, despite their increased workload. This knowledge is important to ensure a better response by universities in future emergencies.",

        "description":"Online learning is rapidly becoming the preferred study option for many higher education students, due to its accessibility, convenience and flexible teaching arrangements. For other students who have access to a university campus, their preferred option is to attend on-campus classes, where advantages include synchronous interaction with peers, lecturers and access to practical experiences, materials, and resources. The impact of COVID-19 resulted in interruptions to social, economic, cultural, and educational life, with social distancing measures and health and well-being concerns leading to widespread restrictions in numerous different contexts. Universities throughout Australia restricted access to campuses and shifted their teaching of classes to purely online delivery. This shift posed many challenges for students and staff as ways of teaching and learning were reconceptualised. This paper examines the experiences of two different cohorts of pre-service teachers from two different universities who were studying full-time on-campus at the time when the restrictions were applied and reports the impact the shift to online had on cognitive, social and teaching presence within a model of community of inquiry. The findings indicate that despite the challenges involved with the rapid transition to online delivery, participants were able to identify the presence of core elements of the model, and how these factors impacted upon their engagement with the course.",

        "description":"There are many ways to learn how to be entrepreneurs and one of the powerful ways is to learn from successful entrepreneurs. However, it is difficult to reach and interview those entrepreneurs about their best practices in doing business in real lives. Chatbot technology can come into play in mimicking conversation of successful entrepreneurs and providing pre-programmed responses of their best practices drawn from interviews published in newspapers, books and articles. Therefore, this research aimed to examine the impact of chatbots in the form of successful entrepreneurs with 24 first-year graduate students, who enrolled in a master's degree of entrepreneurship education at Kasetsart university. Data analysis involved mean, standard deviation, frequency, percentage, and content analysis. The research findings showed that the developed chatbots were appropriate at a very high level (Mean= 4.75, S.D. = 0.22). The impact of chatbots was positive. Students perceived that their learning was better and their satisfaction was at a very high level (Mean = 4.65, S.D. = 0.44) with thoughts that chatbots were an interesting, innovative, and fun teaching way. This study indicated that chatbot technology positively impacted student learning and satisfaction. It can be implemented as a powerful tool to teach entrepreneurship in entrepreneurship education programmes in higher education context.",

The reasonable enrollment proportion of general education and vocational education also plays an important role in the adjustment of the overall employment structure and the development of the regional economy. Therefore, it is imminent to seek a more accurate and reliable prediction model of the enrollment proportion of general education and vocational education. Based on the grey prediction model, exponential smoothing model, ARIMA model and BP neural network, and with the data of the enrollment proportion of all regions in China from 2010 to 2018 as the data sample, the enrollment proportion of each region in 2019 is predicted. By comparing the predicted values with the real values, it is found that the exponential smoothing model has the best accuracy and stability for the enrollment proportion of general education and vocational education forecast. Exponential smoothing model is used to predict the number of high school enrollment and vocational education enrollment, which is of great significance to ensure the reasonable structure of human resources in various regions and promote the coordinated development of the education system.",

        "description":"This research focused on the common errors that EFL learners included in their writing. The frequent errors that the study focused on were at the micro level, specifically the structures that related to gerund and infinitive forms. The participants were selected from the English language department at one of the Saudi universities. They were undergraduates and passed the &quot;English Grammar 1&quot; course in the program and were ready for the &quot;English Grammar 2&quot; course. In this study, the participants passed through two phases. In the first phase, they wrote one paragraph individually in the midterm examination. In the following phase, they chose their group and wrote a paragraph during class time. In both phases, students received clear instruction including the topic, the grammatical rules, and the minimum number of sentences. The only difference was that students were allowed to discuss for ten minutes before writing their paragraphs in the second phase. To analyze the data, common errors were identified and classified from writing as groups and individual writing based on gerunds and infinitives. Then, the comparison between common errors was employed to understand learners' written production when working individually and in groups. The results indicated that learners easily used infinitives better than gerunds. Learners also overused specific words to ensure that they used gerund and infinitive in the correct form. Finally, the same common errors were found and identified in their individual writing and as groups.",

Considering that student engagement may be reduced to a performativity scarcely related to learning outcomes and that a good deal of it may be invisible to teachers, further studies are needed to contrast teachers' and students' views of student engagement in higher education. This article presents the results of a quantitative study about definitions and indicators of student engagement carried out with 118 students and 45 teachers of Law, Education and Nursing from two Catalan public universities (Spain). The results confirm the performativity associated with the concept by both teachers and students, and reveal that students may appreciate silent and invisible engagement more than teachers. The results also show that teachers may conflate signs of student engagement with good academic results and learning, risking an oversimplification of both student engagement and learning.",

This research is part of a descriptive mixed methods study. A questionnaire and in-depth, qualitative interviews were used to explore pre-service teachers' perceptions of the affordances of social media platforms for learning and the actualization of those affordances. The survey and interview data were analyzed through the theoretical lens of affordance theory. The results suggest that the pre-service teachers actualized the affordances of social media by their knowledgeable use in a dynamic learning environment. The key findings are that the teachers perceived the social media applications to be flexible, useful and practical (functional affordances), bridges formal and informal learning and supported self-regulated learning (cognitive affordances), allowed pre-service teachers to assume new identities and discover learning as independent learners who had control over their learning (identity creation affordances), and fostered interaction and collaborative feedback (social affordances). Lack of guidance or lack of teacher presence was the main constraint. This research produces new knowledge and analysis and makes new theoretical contributions on the specific affordances of social media technologies. This study adds to and extends existing literature by contributing to an understanding of the actualization of the affordances of social media platforms.",

One thousand seven hundred and eight-six undergraduate students at the National University of Mongolia in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, participated in this study. Data were randomly split into two groups. The four-factor structure of the SOLR instrument explained 69.355% of the variance in the pattern of relationships among the items in the first half-sample. All four competencies had high reliabilities (all Cronbach's alpha values were 0.84 or higher). The validity of the four-factor structure of the Mongolian-language version of the SOLR model was confirmed with the deletion of one item that cross-loaded on multiple factors. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the validity of the hypothesised model of the 19-item structure of the Mongolian-language version of the SOLR instrument using the second half-sample.",

        "description":"To promote student writing development, integrated approaches such as genre-based writing instruction (GBWI) are advocated in tertiary education. However, most subject lecturers are not used to centralise writing in their subjects as they focus on content teaching. Capitalising on teacher learning within GBWI is therefore necessary. Design-based research can offer a fruitful learning environment for such innovative type of content and language integrated instruction. In a multiple case study (n=2) in Dutch higher professional education, we aimed to explore what subject lecturers can learn in a design-based research project in terms of scaffolding students' writing. Qualitative data on teacher learning were collected through logs and interviews before, during and after three GBWI interventions. These data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using transcription software. Results showed the subject lecturers reported multifaceted learning outcomes, particularly concerning changed knowledge and beliefs. Some of these were directly related to GBWI (e.g., metalanguage, deconstruction, text features) whereas others were related to scaffolding language in subject learning more generally, and to the lecturers' teaching roles. Both lecturers also reported learning outcomes in terms of changed practices, but to a lesser extent. This may be related to the challenging character of enacting GBWI in the subjects. On a more general level, this study has yielded valuable insights into what factors are at stake when subject lecturers learn to enact GBWI. Further, it has shown the potential of a design-based research learning environment which we view as part of a causal field instigating subject lecturers' professional development.",

Our teaching has evolved, moving from traditional didactic delivery to the utilisation of online technology to accommodate both academic and student expectations. The pressure to teach within constrained resources and issues presented from the COVID-19 pandemic has provided opportunities to optimise educational technology. We identified a gap in genuinely engaged online discussions, observing that pedagogic value was often obscure. This cross-sectional study investigated the opinions and experiences of undergraduate students in four health science online units where asynchronous discussion boards were linked to summative assessment. By assessing discussion posts, students may be motivated to participate further, with student engagement influenced through educator involvement, the discussion purpose and group interactivity. Whilst some students were critical of the value of asynchronous discussion boards, others positively viewed discussions as a platform for peer engagement and information sharing. Discussion boards can provide active learning experiences particularly for online students; however, effective educator involvement and online supportive teaching strategies and practices are crucial to pedagogical success. Based on the key findings from this study we propose implications for practice in a higher education context.",

        "description":"While discussions on the efficiency and adequacy of distance education, which has passed through various stages from the 1700s to the present day, and its accessibility has become easier with the opportunities provided by technology, it has to be experienced by almost everyone after the pandemic in 2019. While there are various scale studies for distance education before 2019 in the literature, there is a need for an up-to-date scale with proven validity and reliability. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an up-to-date scale with proven validity and reliability for the use of researchers who aim to study this subject. The item pool of the scale was designed considering the attitude and its sub-components as positive and negative. The scale, which took its final form before the application with the help of an assessment and evaluation specialist and a language expert, was applied to a group of 341 students consisting of Gazi University Education Faculty, Haci Bayram Veli University Fine Arts Faculty, Haci Bayram Veli University Faculty of Literature. As a result of Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis, a structure consisting of 30 items with six factors was revealed. Cronbach's alpha values of the factors were measured as 0.84, 0.71, 0.85, 0.70, 0.75, and 0.76, respectively. The total Cronbach's alpha value of the scale, which constituted the whole of the factors, was 0.92. As a result of the analyses performed at the end of this research, a valid and reliable scale was put forward to measure the attitudes toward online education.

        "description":"Politics and International Relations (Pol &amp; IR) lecturers can capitalise on the established relationship between comedy and political analysis by using humour techniques to enhance the student learning experience and to develop students' critical analysis skills. Using collected data from focus groups with 21 British and International undergraduate students from four UK universities, this small-scale empirical study advances a methodology that enables participants to engage in collective meaning-making without being restricted by a closed-ended question survey. This research highlights student perceptions that humour attempts can make concepts memorable, improve student-lecturer rapport, and increase student engagement and motivation when lecturers consistently adopt a friendly persona and use humour to supplement high-quality lecture content. Mild self-deprecation by lecturers improves the student-lecturer relationship. Lecturer &quot;banter&quot; with students is risky, but might be acceptable if the lecturer's persona is consistently humorous and sufficient student trust is developed. Participants considered that analogies and pop culture references are beneficial explanatory tools, especially for complex Pol &amp; IR concepts or theories. Memes were considered to be most effective when used as a summarising or concluding point, thus corroborating the &quot;educate before subvert&quot; principle.",

        "description":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Northampton changed its usual mode of delivery from face-to-face to online. This may have involved less adjustment than in other institutions as, pre-pandemic, the university already made use of active blended learning using its virtual learning environment. To capture the student voice concerning satisfaction with this change of mode, professional service teams surveyed students attending embedded academic skills and information literacy workshops. The number of students completing the survey was 385 and overall, students were satisfied with online learning. Nearly two-thirds of respondents listed specific advantages and challenges of online learning. The most frequently mentioned advantage was convenience: being at home; the greater ease of combining study with work or home life; and reduced traveling saving both time and money. Other advantages were the improved quality and functionality of the online sessions, and positive motivational/affective factors. The most common challenge was issues with technology. Other challenges were negative motivational/ affective factors, with students reporting lack of concentration and that the sessions were impersonal. A significant challenge was a perceived lack of communication between both students and lecturers, and students and their peers. Age was found to be a salient factor with students over the age of 30 markedly more positive about online learning than their younger peers. Concerns for practitioners in moving to online learning would be around ensuring students have access to the appropriate technology and finding ways to improve communication online. However, with appropriate planning, future provision may benefit from the advantages that online learning affords.",

The data of the study were collected from a total of 556 participants, 188 men and 368 women aged 18 and over. Participants were recruited by utilizing convenience sampling technique, and correlational survey method of quantitative research models was adopted within this study. Quest for Significance Scale, Social Media Addiction Scale and Personal Information Form were used as data collection tools. The data from assessment tools were analyzed using the T-test, and multi-group comparisons were made using ANOVA (one-way analysis of variance). The relation between the points acquired from assessment tools was calculated using Pearson's Moments Multiplication Correlation Coefficient. Predictive relations between quest for significance and social media addiction was analyzed using simple linear regression model. Significant difference was determined in quest for significance of adults as a result of the study considering age level, marital status, time spent on social media, the reason for using social media and whether using social media has any impact on sleeping pattern. On the other hand, no significant difference was determined in quest for significance of adults in terms of gender, income and educational background. A moderate positive correlation between quest for significance and social media addiction of adults was determined.",

        "description":"The integration of digital multimodal composing (DMC) in the second language (L2) and heritage language (HL) classrooms has expanded our notion of writing, shifting from a focus on the written mode to include other modes of expression (e.g., visual, textual, or aural). Notwithstanding the increasing presence of L2 multimodal learning tasks, which combine different semiotic resources (e.g., language and visual components such as images or videos) as intrinsic elements used to generate meaning, instructors have not yet modified the way in which they provide feedback. That is, despite the increasing integration of different modes in a multimodal task, instructors still focus exclusively on language development -- replicating the feedback behaviors modeled by non-digital writing assignments -- rather than on all the components of multimodal texts. In digitally influenced environments and societies, however, there is a need to reconsider our approaches to feedback to pay greater attention to the linguistic and nonlinguistic elements of DMC. With the scarcity of research on feedback in DMC, this article first identifies a gap in multimodal teaching and research regarding the role and focus on feedback in DMC, and, second, provides an assessment rubric from which to base formative feedback that addresses both linguistic and nonlinguistic elements to help students develop their multimodal texts.",

The sequence, which was intended to raise the children's awareness of the demands involved in understanding (content goals) and expressing as written reports (rhetorical goals) how levers work, scaffolded their activity from item-based writing to the production of full texts. On completing the unit, each child independently wrote a report on levers, all of which were analyzed from the perspective of cognitive discourse functions and ideational meaning. The results of these analyses are discussed in terms of their significance for CLIL writing with young learners.",

A mixed method research model as one of the qualitative research approaches was adopted in this study aiming to develop a number sense-based instructional design to eliminate student errors arisen from mathematical misconceptions in secondary school students. In preparation stage of the instructional design, 27 seventh grade students studying at a state school in Mersin province were determined as the study group.

        "description":"As the COVID-19 pandemic was spreading rapidly throughout the world, the most widespread reaction in many countries to curtail the disease was lockdown. As a result, educational institutions had to find an alternative to face-to-face learning. The most obvious solution was e-learning. Conventional tertiary institutions with little virtual learning experience had to deal with an unprecedented challenge. This study delineates practices that can be suggested for conventional institutions of tertiary education that may be planning to acquire more e-learning experience in the post-COVID era so that they may be better prepared to move on beyond traditional classroom teaching. The qualitative research method was utilized to carry out this study. The data collected for the study comprised mainly two sources: the existing literature that tackles the issue of how tertiary institutions around the world shifted to e-learning during the pandemic, and an analysis by the researchers of COVID-related circulars that were issued by the Saudi Ministry of Education and by Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University. The review of related literature and the analysis of the circulars enabled the researchers to produce a number of suggestions aimed at improving the e-learning experience of conventional tertiary institutions. The researchers followed five steps in their literature review: (1) pinpointing search terms and then creating a search strategy and implementing it; (2) sorting the studies gathered, excluding duplicates and studies deemed irrelevant, and decreeing standards for deciding what to keep and what to rule out; (3) evaluating the studies in the light of those standards; (4) obtaining data; and (5) analysing data. This study does not recommend that conventional tertiary institutions become 100% online, but it does suggest that those institutions should make some learning content digitally accessible, build community partnerships, encourage self-study skills among students, help students change their learning style from passive to active, and revisit their e-assessment practices. This paper also stresses the importance of giving further support to teaching staff, sheds light on how institution buildings can reopen smoothly as the restrictions ease, discusses what factors influence the outcomes of e-learning, and tackles the issue of student dropouts during the pandemic. This study concludes by outlining the important notion of adopting blended learning and developing e-learning programs on an international scale.",

        "description":"This study compares the processing of three different types of written corrective feedback (WCF) by heritage language (HL), second language (L2), and third language (L3) learners who wrote and revised three short essays and received a different type of WCF for each essay (i.e., direct, coding, or underlining). Comparison of pre- and post-feedback texts and analysis of think-alouds served as the basis for determining whether one type of feedback promoted higher depth of processing (DoP) and whether this processing was mediated by error type and language background. The findings indicate that feedback type did interact with DoP, and that this interaction was in some ways mediated by learner background and error type. This research serves as a first step toward understanding how these three learner groups are impacted by these commonly used feedback types and is therefore important to drive evidence-based pedagogical decisions.",

        "description":"This study was motivated by Truscott's (1996, 2004) scarcely empirically tested claims that written corrective feedback (WCF) processing hinders fluency in subsequent rewriting owing to learners' purposeful avoidance of making mistakes by composing shorter texts at a higher speed. It examined the writing fluency of the texts produced by eighteen 10-11-year-old L2 English children in a digital environment. They were divided into a feedback (N = 10) and a self-correction group (N = 8). Both groups engaged in a three-stage task: writing, comparison of their texts with a model or self-editing as appropriate, and rewriting. Fluency was analyzed via five product/offline and five process/online measures. The texts and writing behaviors were recorded with Inputlog 8.0. The results partially support Truscott's claims. The feedback group improved their fluency in all the ten measures. However, the self-editing group showed higher fluency than the feedback group in seven of the ten measures, with the corresponding Hedge's effect sizes between groups ranging from small to large. The study enlightens our knowledge of young learners' writing fluency and supports adopting a multidimensional approach to understand the complex and multi-faceted nature of fluency as mediated by WCF processing.",

The current study introduces the South Pacific digital literacy framework (SPDLF) driven by 6 essential literacies and sixty attributes. The study intends to provide a three-stage statistical validation for the South Pacific digital literacy framework. The three stages of validation include: (1) evaluating the strongest predictors of digital literacy from the six literacies in the SPDLF; (2) evaluating the significant predictors of each of the six literacies; and (3) evaluating the significant attributes from a total of sixty attributes in the SPDLF. The results show that all attributes in the SPDLF are statistically significant, therefore, all attributes are significant contributors to digital literacy in the South Pacific digital literacy framework.",

        "description":"Dropout happens when a student withdraws themselves from school at any level of education without a certificate to account for their education. It is an educational problem in America because of its negative consequences on society. Three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations require more than a high school diploma, and yet, just over half of American citizens acquire that extent of education. Out of the industrialized nations, America holds one of the most significant high school dropout rates. Half of the students who begin college will never finish. School dropouts are intelligent individuals capable of offering a lot to the world. However, because they never complete their studies, their abilities may never transpire to their full effectiveness. Hence, solving school dropouts is key to national development. Adolescents who drop out of school vary in demographics and socioeconomic status. There is also a correlation between students with disabilities and the dropout rate. This paper discusses school dropouts in the United States to contribute to its solutions. It examines the causal factors and the effects of school dropouts on individuals and society. School dropout is prevalent among vulnerable groups, and the cost to disadvantaged individuals, families, communities, and nations is high. Since school dropout status has negative consequences, moderating this dilemma benefits the individual and broader society, locally and globally.",

The main problem in this context is how to understand the questions without any doubts in meaning and how to provide the most relevant answers to the questions. In this study, a question-answering system for specific courses has been developed to support the learning environment. The research outcomes indicate that the proposed method helps to solve the problem of ambiguities in meaning through the integration of natural language processing tools and semantic resources that can help to overcome several problems related to the natural language structure. This method also helps improve the capability to understand students' needs and, consequently, to retrieve the most suitable answers.",

        "description":"Whether type of written corrective feedback (WCF) impacts L2 learning has been investigated for decades. While many product-oriented studies report conflicting findings, the paucity of studies adopting both a process-oriented and curricular approach (e.g., Caras, 2019) underscores the call for further research on: (1) the processing dimension of L2 writers' engagement with WCF in this instructed setting (Manchón &amp; Leow, 2020); (2) from an ISLA &quot;applied&quot; perspective (Leow, 2019a; Leow &amp; Manchón, 2022); and (3) any potential relationship with subsequent performances. Also, whether type of linguistic item (e.g., morphological vs. syntactic) plays a role in the processing dimension also warrants further probing. This preliminary quasi-experimental study explored the cognitive processes of 10 adult L2 writers with minimal previous exposure to Spanish interacting with WCF (both direct and metalinguistic) on morphological and syntactic errors. Think aloud data gathered from three compositions written within the natural writing conditions of a foreign language curriculum were transcribed, coded for depth of processing (DoP) (Leow, 2015), and correlated with subsequent performances on the target items. The results revealed: (1) a higher DoP for metalinguistic WCF; (2) differences in processing of linguistic items; (3) similar DoP over time; and (4) a beneficial relationship between DoP and subsequent performances. Recommendations for future research underscore the importance of acknowledging variables within the instructed setting that may impact a pure effect of WCF on L2 development.",

        "description":"Online learning is increasingly popular as the pandemic spreads around the globe. This shift in learning preferences presents opportunities and difficulties for the assessment of learning. As a method of assessment used throughout the learning process, formative assessment can encourage students' interest in learning, enhance learning outcomes, support teachers' strategic planning and maximize teaching results. However, the effectiveness of online formative assessment has been questioned. This study uses a qualitative research methodology based on Grounded Theory to analyze the validity of formative assessment in online learning by examining the factors unique to online learning that affect it. After reviewing previous studies and interviewing 45 online learners, this paper three-level-coded the sources and analyzed them. Findings show that the validity is influenced by the lack of functional alienation caused by the effects of the subject's emotional game and adaptability, objective environment and technology and poor interaction. To help implement formative assessment in real classroom practices, two models were established based on the findings, namely the Formative Assessment Model (FAM) and Online Formative Assessment Validity Model (OFAV). This study asks about the influence factors and explores how much the validity of formative assessment shows in online practice, and provides new feasible ideas and suggestions for the future development of the field of educational assessment.",

In this qualitative case study, data were obtained from eight teacher candidates through online video case discussions implemented in three cycles among two separate groups. In the discussion platform, while one group focus on their own videos, the other group focus on expert teachers' video. As a result, professional identity indicators, gathered under three themes, named task-based, profession-based, and self-interpretation-based indicators, were reflected in the discussions. Moreover, it is noteworthy differences between the own video -case discussion group and expert video-case discussion group in 'profession-based and 'self-interpretation-based' dimensions of professional identity. Results suggest that especially discussing own video-cases can be a productive tool that helps the teacher candidates to make stronger theory-practice connections and feel like 'a professional teacher'.",

With this purpose, 74 master and doctoral theses on skills teaching in the Social Studies course were included in the research. Descriptive content analysis was used in data analysis. The results demonstrated that there are mainly attempts towards practical implementations in skills teaching, and the teaching processes are important in the Social Studies course. The investigation revealed that many studies were conducted on skills development, but the number of theses on social skills was limited. It was determined that some of these theses had insufficient explanation regarding the teaching-learning processes. However, the experiences of the researchers concerning the processes were not included in many of the theses. It was also observed that in some of the theses, there was no information about the assessment tools utilized, and some researchers were not critical of the results of the analyses. In addition, there was no scientific justification for the time allocated to the implementations in most of these theses. Researchers stated that they encountered problems due to insufficient implementation time in the skills development process. The suggestions made by the researchers at the end of the process include updating the curricula and course books, eliminating the school infrastructure deficiencies, and providing in-service training to teachers.",

The research data were collected using semistructured interview forms developed by the researcher, and the data were analyzed using descriptive analysis and content analysis. The research found that principals and teachers were positive and negative about principals' knowledge and skills in inspecting classrooms. Principals' problems in classroom observation, the appropriateness of principals' classroom observation, and the effects of principals' classroom observation on teachers' development were also revealed. In addition, it was found that both principals and teachers frequently mentioned: &quot;the topic of in-service training&quot; for principals to make principal inspections more effective. It was also found that the influence and authority of principals should be strengthened, and teachers expressed strong opinions about increasing inspection time. In connection with these findings, it was suggested that principals receive in-service inspection training, extend inspection duration, conduct inspection according to objective criteria, and expand principals' authority for instructional inspection.",

The study revealed that the school engagement levels showed a significant difference in favor of female students in terms of gender. Based on the multiple regression analysis, it was determined that school moral atmosphere is a significant predictor of school engagement. The results of this study suggest that school moral atmosphere is one of the key determinants of students' engagement with school, and hence it can be useful to improve school moral atmosphere to increase students' affective, cognitive, and behavioral engagement.",

        "description":"The study aims to determine the predictive relationship between self-efficacy beliefs, attitudes toward the teaching profession, and teaching motivation among pre-service teachers. The study, in which 364 pre-service teachers participated, is designed as a correlational survey model. Teachers' Sense of Self-efficacy Scale, Attitude Scale of the Teaching Profession, and Motivation to Teach Scale are used as data collection tools. The independent variables in this study are willingness to choose the teaching profession and academic achievement. The dependent variables are teacher self-efficacy, attitudes toward the teaching profession, and teaching motivation. The result of the study suggests that as the general academic achievement average of pre-service teachers increase, their perceptions of teaching self-efficacy, teaching attitudes and teaching motivations also increase. The fact that preservice teachers choose the teaching profession voluntarily affects their teaching self-efficacy perceptions, teaching attitudes and teaching motivations positively. There is a significant relationship between the pre-service teachers' teaching self-efficacy beliefs, teaching attitudes towards teaching, and teaching motivation levels. It can be concluded that intrinsic motivation toward teaching and teaching profession self-efficacy beliefs have a significant effect on attitudes toward teaching.

The participants were 12 graduate students pursuing their doctoral studies in ELT at a Turkish university. A chosen text was used for data collection and the students' paraphrased texts were analyzed employing Keck's (2006) the taxonomy of paraphrase types and 'a paraphrase found form' developed by the researcher in terms of lexical and structural changes. The results of the study revealed that graduate students had challenges in appropriate implementation of paraphrasing in their task. While they generated frequently moderate level of paraphrases, the strategies they often used were synonym substitution as well as copying strings of words from source. Additionally, deviated meaning was designated as a new paraphrase type in the taxonomy of paraphrase. These findings suggest that students need an explicit paraphrasing instruction supported by good and bad paraphrase examples and more practice to learn how to paraphrase appropriately.",

It also attempts to identify the most and least demotivating dimensions/factors of EFL Saudi male and female university students and to find out if there are statistically significant differences between male and female students in EFL demotivation dimensions/factors or not. To that end, a modified version of Sakai and Kikuchi (2008) Questionnaire of Demotivation of English Language Learners (DQELL) was administered to randomly selected 30 male EFL students and 30 females from third year Foreign Languages Department at Faculty of Arts and Humanities of Albaha University, KSA in the academic year 2021/2022. Results indicate that male students consider Learning contents and materials and Inadequate college facilities as their most EFL demotivating factors and the least ones were Teachers' competence and teaching styles, Lack of intrinsic motivation and Test scores. On the other hand, female students consider Inadequate college facilities the most demotivating factor, while Learning contents and materials, Teachers' competence and teaching styles and Test scores were their least demotivating ones. In addition, T-test results showed that there are statistically significant differences between male and female students on EFL demotivation factors Learning contents and materials and Teachers' competence and teaching styles in favor of females. There are not significant differences between males and females on Inadequate college facilities, while there are significant differences between them on Lack of intrinsic motivation and Test scores in favor of female university students. Finally, statistical results were discussed and implications for ELT were suggested.",

A total of 116 students, fifty four female, and sixty two male, participated in the study, in which the quantitative research model was used. In the first part, the Personal Information Form was used to determine the demographic characteristics of the participants, the second part used the Self-Efficacy Attitude Scale, and the third part used the Competence in Sports Scale. Frequency analysis, kurtosis, skewness test, One-Way ANOVA analysis, t-test, and correlation analysis were used in the research. A positive and moderately significant relationship was found between the Self-Efficacy Attitude Scale and the Competence in Sports Scale. According to gender, it was determined that male students' competence in sports was significantly higher than female students' sports competence. According to the branch variable, it was determined that the self-efficacy status of the students who do individual sports is significantly higher than the self-efficacy status of the students who do team sports and who do not have a branch. In addition, according to the age variable, no significant relationship was found between the competence status of the students in sports and their self-efficacy attitudes. As a result, it can be said that male students have higher proficiency in sports than female students, and they feel more competent. It has been determined that the self-efficacy attitudes of the students who do individual sports are higher than those who do team sports.",

In this SLSD plan, the strategy instruction was conducted in an integrated way into the content courses of the chemistry education curriculum. The strategy instruction was carried out in four parts: &quot;time management strategies&quot;, &quot;reading comprehension and summarization strategies&quot;, &quot;writing strategies&quot; and &quot;questioning strategies&quot;. In addition, metacognitive strategies used by the pre-service teachers during the strategy instruction were also examined. Semi-structured interviews, self-monitoring forms, field notes, and student-generated questions were used to collect data to identify the strategies that the pre-service teachers used and determine the changes that occurred as a result of the application of these strategies. The data were analyzed using descriptive and content analysis methods. It was determined that both the frequency of use and the diversity of the strategies used increased in time management strategies, reading comprehension and summarizing strategies, and writing strategies. In questioning strategies, when the quality of the questions created by pre-service teachers was examined, it was determined that there was an increase in the quality of these questions in terms of &quot;thinking level&quot; and &quot;content&quot;, but there was no regular trend in terms of &quot;chemistry understanding levels&quot;. It was observed that most of the pre-service teachers also applied metacognitive strategies during strategy instruction. In the light of the results of this study, suggestions on promoting self-regulated learning skills in pre-service teachers are provided for chemistry teacher education, and chemistry education researchers.",

The study group of the research consists of twenty-five pre-service teachers. While determining the study group, easily accessible sampling method was used. In the research, a questionnaire containing four open questions developed by the researchers was used as a data collection tool. Content analysis was used in the analysis of the data. As a result of the research, it was determined that the pandemic positively affected some values such as altruism, benevolence, solidarity, gratitude, resignation, cleanliness, giving importance to being healthy, and negatively affected some values such as hospitality, freedom, equality, kindness, perseverance, and aesthetics. On the other hand, it is seen that some values such as patience, solidarity, savings and being scientific take their place among the values that both erode and gain from due to the differences in the perspective of pre-service teachers towards life. In addition, it was concluded that the pre-service teachers have a concern that the eroded values will force humanity to face problems such as various health problems, an asocial life, emotional deprivation, depression, digital addiction, selfishness, unemployment, anxiety, and impoliteness in the future.",

The sample of the research consists of 523 higher education students. As a result of the literature review and analysis, the dimensions predicted as sub-dimensions in the scale are &quot;being curious/ investigative, reflecting, being open-minded, being planned, being patient. Within the scope of the validity studies of the Tendency to Be Open to Learning Scale (TOLS), exploratory factor analysis was performed and construct validity was determined. As a result of the exploratory factor analysis, a 5-point Likert-typetool with 22 items collected in four dimensions was reached. The resulting TOLS consists of &quot;F1. being patient, F2. being open-minded, F3. being curious, F4. being planned&quot; sub-dimensions. As a result of the exploratory factor analysis performed to determine the scale's validity, it is seen that the four dimensions included in the scale explain 49.31% of the total variance",

The aim of the study is to promote pre-service chemistry teachers' motivation and to enhance their knowledge of motivational regulation strategies. The study was conducted in organic chemistry courses with 18 pre-service chemistry teachers. A semi-structured interview, a semi-structured diary, and an open-ended scale were employed as data collection tools to identify motivational components and motivational regulation strategies used by the pre-service teachers. The qualitative data collected were analyzed using descriptive and content analysis techniques. Results showed that the pre-service chemistry teachers had positive motivational beliefs and were more persistent about academic activities. Moreover, improvements occurred in pre-service teachers' motivational regulation strategies. It was further found that the positive change in the pre-service chemistry teachers' motivations diversified their learning strategies and that they began to use these strategies more frequently.",

        "description":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, mandatory changes were required in the field of education, as in many other fields. One of these fields is a teacher training programme, which includes teaching practice. It has become of great importance that pre-service science teachers, who frequently include experiments in their teaching practices in face-to-face education, will carry out this process in online education. This process, experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, prompted pre-service science teachers to find something that could replace the wet labs. One of the solutions in this situation is for them to choose and use appropriate Web 2.0 tools in their online lab teaching practices. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine the Web 2.0 tools used by pre-service chemistry teachers in their online teaching practices in a distance education environment, the purposes of using these tools, and their justifications for preferences to use these tools. This study was conducted with 15 pre-service chemistry teachers. Data were collected via observations, a form filled out by the participants, and semi-structured interviews in this study. According to the results of this study, it was determined that the participants used 17 Web 2.0 tools during their online teaching practices. The findings highlighted that the most used Web 2.0 tools were Perculus+ chat, Google docs, and Quizizz. Moreover, it was determined that the participants used these tools for 21 different purposes such as drawing students' attention, getting hypotheses, and designing experiments. The results also indicated that the participants emphasised the ease of the Web 2.0 tool as a justification for the preference for almost all of the Web 2.0 tools they use, regardless of their purposes for using these tools. It is thought that the results can be used to show how to make online or face-to-face teaching practices in teacher training programmes by using Web 2.0 tools more effective in the future.",

The social networking site with most users is Facebook. Teenagers, particularly college students use Facebook most frequently to study, gain information, entertain themselves and connect with others through self-disclosing personal information on the Facebook profile page. This quantitative study aimed to analyze the attitude of pedagogical students regarding self-disclosure on Facebook as represented through cognition, emotion and behavior concerning academic achievement. The survey was completed by 535 university student's majority in pedagogy. There were 41 students who used it for less than three years between three to five years by 218 students and 276 students who use it more than five years. The questionnaire was self-reported by participants to assess university students' attitudes toward self-disclosure on Facebook. The results indicate that pedagogical students with excellent academic achievement and more than five years of Facebook experience had the highest-level attitude toward self-disclosure on Facebook. The results indicate a positive relationship between cognition, emotion and influence factors students' Facebook attitudes. Future research on methods that enhance student positive disclosure can benefit from this study. Future research should examine how self-disclosure on Facebook relates to other aspects, such as Facebook usage time, financial state and perception of advantages and its disadvantages of Facebook in order to evaluate students' attitudes objectively.",

        "description":"The evolution of wireless technology and the development of mobile applications cover more and more areas of human activity. These can be used not only for communication, but also for educational purposes. This research aims to analyze implications of Mobile Learning as a didactic strategy for the development of an inclusive education that is committed to improving education for sustainable development. Following the quality standards of the PRISMA statement, a systematic review of research focused on didactic experiences that use Mobile Learning for the attention of students with educational needs in the context of education for sustainable development has been carried out. The Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases have been used during the period 2010-2020, obtaining a sample of 21 publications. Results reveal the growing interest of the international scientific community in this research. It is a didactic strategy that facilitates the teaching-learning process for students with functional diversity, a tool to support the teaching task and a promoter of an inclusive education that is committed to sustainable learning. Among its limitations, aspects related to the teacher, the implementation of mobile technology in the teaching-learning process or its use as a learning tool stand out. Mobile Learning has become a new educational paradigm, which establishes a binomial between technology and education to respond to the objectives of the 2030 Agenda. It has become a new educational paradigm in line with our model of society based on information and knowledge and access to Information and Communication Technologies. In this way, a binomial has been established between technology and education that aims to implement benefits for the agents involved at a quantitative and qualitative level for the implementation of an inclusive education that caters to students with functional diversity and is committed to improving education for sustainable development.",

The samples were 665 EFL lower secondary students in Thailand as the online survey respondents and five high school teachers as the interviewees. The experiment samples were 35 EFL lower secondary students. The research instruments consist of the MALL application, the learning process, English writing tasks, English writing tests, scoring writing rubrics, and a questionnaire on student satisfaction. The experimental period lasted for 8 weeks. The data were analysed by using frequency, mean, standard deviation, priority needs index, dependent t-test, and one-way ANOVA with repeated measure analysis. The research result indicated that 1) lower secondary students were able to use the internet on a regular basis. Students wanted to learn writing skills relevant to the student's experience through the study of writing errors, writing samples, writing styles, peer assessment, and constructive feedback from teachers. 2) The learning process of mobile-assisted language learning application using a task-based approach and gamification to enhance lower secondary students' English writing skills consisted of 3 components: pre-task, task process, and language focus. The 7 steps are as follows: selecting themes, exploring topics, drafting ideas, editing tasks, giving feedback, reviewing submissions, and concluding findings. 3) The experiment results indicated that the samples' English writing skills in the post-test were higher than in the pre-test at the 0.05 level of significance. 4) The difference in mean scores in the English writing tasks showed that there was a difference between English writing scores at the 0.05 level of significance (F=1579.266, sig=0.000). 5) The result of satisfaction showed that the respondents were very satisfied with the learning process and MALL application.",

        "author":["Bello, Hassan",
          "Abdullah, Nor Athiyah"],
        "description":"It has been extensively researched how satisfied students are with the vast majority of goods and services offered by educational institutions of higher learning. However, there appears to be a paucity of research on students' satisfaction with the facilities and services of computer-based assessment (CBA) centers in higher education institutions, especially when the centers are equipped and staffed by third-party vendors. The CBA centers are public and private examination centers in developing countries that administer computer-based tests for higher education and other external organizations. Although satisfaction with the services and facilities is essential, it has been asserted that having the feeling of trust when using the CBA is even more critical to the students. Trust is essential for the success of any technological advancement, especially in the field of education. Any educational technology that lacks the stakeholders' trust, regardless of how effective it may be, is doomed to fail to be adopted on a large scale. However, limited studies have investigated how students' trust in the CBA affects their satisfaction. Therefore, this study aims to model and analyze the roles of CBA center service satisfaction and perceived trust in the CBA in attaining overall satisfaction by exploring their roles in influencing student satisfaction. A research framework based on the updated information system success model (ISSM) is validated using a survey incorporating system quality, service quality, question content, the cost-effectiveness of CBA services, CBA center service satisfaction, and perceived trust. A total of 459 survey responses collected from three higher education institutions in Nigeria were analyzed using structural equation modelling. As a result, the findings confirmed that students' satisfaction with services at the CBA centers is a mediator between service quality, system quality, and overall satisfaction with CBA. The correlation between CBA centre service satisfaction and overall CBA satisfaction was also found to be the strongest, indicating that student satisfaction with the services and facilities at the CBA centre is crucial. CBA center managers and institutions can utilize the findings from this study to successfully implement the CBA. In enhancing students' CBA satisfaction, higher education institutions should consider focusing on the necessary steps towards improving the conditions of the CBA centers in terms of infrastructure and services rendered. Meanwhile, to increase student satisfaction besides enhancing the system and service quality and cost-effectiveness, institutions should seriously consider promoting the CBA to the students by highlighting the personal impact of the CBA in terms of trust by improving the quality and features of the CBA.",

        "description":"The education sector was severely impacted due to the pandemic; thus, educational institutions had to shift toward an online learning system. This adaptation in the educational system posits a challenging question: which mode of learning would be best to engage and satisfy the students in the post-COVID-19 era? Therefore, drawing on the self-identity theory, this study explores the differential impact of intrinsic motivational factors (interest/enjoyment, competence, autonomy, and belongingness) on digital engagement and online class satisfaction versus on-campus psychological engagement and physical class satisfaction. Surveying 496 students from six Indonesian universities shows that digital technologies make the learning process interesting and joyful for students compared to on-campus classroom learning, thus resulting in more digitally engaged and satisfied students. Simultaneously, competence is found to be positively impacting online and on-campus students' engagement and satisfaction at an equal level. Moreover, autonomy and belongingness show more students' engagement and satisfaction within the campuses than in an online learning mode. These findings suggest that the post-COVID-19 era can take advantage of both these methods to incorporate a hybrid mix of blended learning to achieve the best learning outcomes in terms of engagement and students' satisfaction.

It adopted the level of ICT competencies from the UNESCO ICT-Competence Framework for Teachers. A self-rating questionnaire was used to collect numeric data involving 70 tutors. Two Focus group Interviews involving eight (8) participants in each college among the 70 respondents were used to collect qualitative data. Mean scores and independent sample t-test were used to compare respondents' level of ICT competencies. Standard multiple regression was used to evaluate the contribution of factors in predicting ICT-pedagogical competencies. The findings revealed that knowledge acquisition was high, which signifies confidence in basic ICT skills. Knowledge deepening was low, which signifies low application of ICT-pedagogical competencies in teaching across subjects. Regression results revealed that practice had a positive unique influence in predicting tutors' competencies in knowledge deepening. These findings suggest that tutors need more hands-on training in applying ICT-pedagogical competencies in their classroom practice.",

Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) School of Health Sciences (SOHS) launched a six months-long Certificate Programme in Yoga (CPY) in July 2019 for students who have cleared their 12th class. The objective of this study was to find out the effects of online yoga training on self-perceived stress among the students of the CPY programme enrolled during the academic year 2021. This was a study with both pre- and post-tests and was carried out on the students of the CPY programme between March and December 2021. A total of 69 and 81 students participated from the January 2021 and July 2021 batches, respectively. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used as a tool to measure the level of stress. A structured close-ended questionnaire was sent by Google Forms to ascertain self-perceived stress. The total mean value of the PSS score after online yoga training decreased from 18 [plus or minus] 5.9 SD in the pretest to 13.7 [plus or minus] 6.5 SD in the post-test of students from the January 2021 batch, and from 17.4 [plus or minus] 5.8 SD in the pre-test to 13.1 [plus or minus] 5.6 SD in the post-test of students from the July 2021 batch. The difference of mean value of pre-test and post-test of both the batches of students after online yoga training were significant (p value &lt; 0.0001). The online yoga training was effective in reduction of perceived stress score among the students of the Certificate Programme in Yoga (CPY).",

A qualitative study of the descriptive documentary type was conducted, where the information obtained from virtual education in times of crisis and outbreaks was collected and analysed. It was found that educational centers at different levels of schooling still continued to use traditional teaching methods and processes subject to old procedures as a basis for their incursion into virtuality, although other establishments began to handle combined modalities such as blended and hybrid online (e-learning) modes of learning. In conclusion, the deadly coronavirus disease (SARS-COV-2) abruptly halted much human activity worldwide. This forced hesitant educational systems that still used traditional face-to-face teaching methods in classrooms to move and change to online learning in many regions, regardless of the socioeconomic level and demographics of the students. Aside from determining how to deal with the problems and challenges of virtual education during epidemics and natural disasters, it is clear that the number of technology-driven educational start-ups has increased significantly.",

This paper reports the methodology and results in measuring the efficacy of this online training at individual and organisational levels. The ability of individuals and organisations to plan and implement transformative actions with a gender perspective require adequate knowledge, skills and a change in attitudes. Given this need, the commonly used Knowledge, Attitude, Skills (KAS) model was used to measure the efficacy of this online training at individual and organisational levels by defining different dimensions of capacities with three learning domains -- Cognitive, Affective, Psychomotor (Bloom's Taxonomy). The baseline and the end line of KAS at the individual level on the six core gender capacities was established for comparison. Two questionnaires were designed to assess the learning achievements of the participants and to measure the efficacy of the training. An analysis of the study registers a clear trend of positive outcomes at the individual level regarding improved knowledge, attitudes and skills on gender equality that could be applied in their work. Furthermore, the paper reports that the organisations demonstrate an enabling environment for more gender equal policies, structures and practices and proposes ways to convert the success of this training by integrating it into the broader gender equality strategy of these organisations.",

In particular, the professor of the Teaching of Mathematics II course needed to update the school activities because of the new educational demands caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To facilitate the educational process of math, this teacher decided to build a web application that presents the formulas and calculation of the mean, standard deviation and statistical error to understand the use of the t-test. This technological tool allows the personalisation of learning through the simulation of data. The participants were 42 students from a Mexican university. The results of machine learning indicated that the contents of the web application positively influenced the assimilation of knowledge, satisfaction during the learning process, development of mathematical skills and learning in the distance modality. The decision tree technique allows the construction of four (4) predictive models about the use of the web application for the educational process about the t-test.

        "description":"Today, conserving the natural environment is paramount. Educators have been striving to develop pedagogical approaches that facilitate greater engagement in conservation behaviors. However, many of these reforms have been targeted at an institutional level, without necessarily testing whether changes in proenvironmental perceptions, attitudes, or behaviors occur for students. This step seems important when developing conservation biology courses that provide well-rounded education that may better prepare students for future challenges in biodiverse conservation contexts. Our objective was to assess the proenvironmental attitudes and conservation values of undergraduate students enrolled in an undergraduate conservation biology course before and after instruction to determine whether a multidisciplinary curriculum, in conjunction with traditional conservation biology content, would alter their perceptions. Students in both the control and intervention groups felt relatively neutral about a range of environmental and conservation topics. No statistical significance between curricula and impact on student perception was revealed. However, in the experimental course, shifts were found concerning students' understanding of the complexity of conservation. Results also highlight longstanding issues related to conservation education, such as a bias toward mammal conservation, and suggest that guest lectures are insufficient to bring about attitude change related to sustainability. Further research on incorporating cross-disciplinary pedagogy into STEM courses is recommended.",

The method applied in this study is action research with a one-cycle framework with four phases of development: (a) planning, (b) action, (c) observing, and (d) reflection phases. This research tries to answer two questions: how to implement PJBL in a programming course to improve programming competency and how to ensure students' satisfaction in the learning process. The PJBL applied in this research consists of seven steps, including (a) a challenging problem or question; (b) sustained inquiry; (c) authenticity; (d) student voice &amp; choice; (e) reflection; (f) critique and revision; and (g) public product. We found that the PJBL implementation for the course, Introduction to Programming, supports the attainment of programming competence. We found that PJBL helps students retain programming knowledge and transfer the programming skills into real-life projects. The research also found that with the implementation of PJBL in Introduction to Programming, students' satisfaction with the learning experience increases. The result shows that PJBL is not only effective in improving computer programming competency, but also in increasing the student's engagement and passion for lifelong learning.",

Methods: The qualitative program evaluation approach, using the standards of utility, feasibility, accuracy, and propriety of a given program, inspired the design of the immediate appraisal of the workshops delivered within a Canadian school of nursing located in a major urban center. Workshop participants (n = 267) included undergraduate and graduate nursing students, contract instructors, and nurses holding administrative positions. Results: Workshops with high attendance included: (a) Structuring Effective Teaching-Learning Encounters in Healthcare Education and Practice; (b) Cancer Pain; (c) Fetal Health Surveillance; and (d) Nurses as Educators in the Clinical Setting. Concerns were raised by the attendees' low attendance to the following workshops: (a) Mindfulness for Students; (b) Horizontal Violence; and (d) Self-Care for Nursing Students: Alleviating Anxiety. Workshops offered opportunities for attendees to reflect on content and process as related to their future incorporation of learned knowledge in their own education and practice. Conclusions: High engagement in hands-on exercises, spontaneous construction of context, and relaxed moments shared by the attendees indicate a promising culture of sharing and receiving knowledge. A culture of collective, pleasurable learning among attendees was effective in mobilizing powerful forms of nursing knowledge.",

        "description":"Work-integrated learning (WIL) placement is increasingly being prioritized in university course curricula as industry, students and government seek improved employability skills, work-ready graduates and stronger graduate employability outcomes. For disciplines such as business, without industry accreditation mandating WIL placement experiences WIL placement are typically non-compulsory and administered through competitive or self-selection approaches which favor higher grade point average (GPA) and socioeconomic status (SES) students at the expense of less advantaged students. Despite well-documented benefits to multiple stakeholders, business schools' reluctance to embrace compulsory WIL placement is underpinned by internal challenges of cost, supply, and implementation. The dynamics of business schools' future sustainability is under threat by market disruptions, pandemic induced income and enrolment losses, and performance driven funding. Potentially the introduction of compulsory WIL placement could decrease existing discriminatory WIL placement practices and enhance student equity while delivering a powerful value proposition to combat future sustainability challenges.",

        "description":"Despite a growing demand for mental health/psychological support in the Australian community, there is a deficit of appropriately trained professionals, due in part to psychology graduates who are not afforded meaningful applied learning experiences during their degree. Systematic integration of authentic WIL into undergraduate psychology degrees may offset this lack of industry exposure, but such learning is scarcely implemented within current curricula. The proposed research sought to address this gap in the undergraduate curriculum by constructing a tangible framework of work-integrated learning (WIL) opportunities to enrich student education and preparedness for the workforce. Semi-structured interviews (n = 36) were conducted with four key stakeholder groups to elicit the current state of WIL in undergraduate psychology curricula and to generate industry specific WIL opportunities that will enhance the skillset and abilities of psychology undergraduates, heighten their psychological literacy, and endorse their transition to an increasingly diverse workforce.",

The government has not fully addressed the problems faced in providing inclusive education in elementary schools in Indonesia. It is necessary to involve all parties, including universities, to help solve these problems. Universities should play an important role in the implementation of inclusive education through practical ventures such as continuous mentoring programs to enable positive outcomes in inclusive elementary school education. Data were collected using in-depth interviews with seven lecturers from universities in Indonesia that have teacher education faculties. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The results provided insight into three areas of interest, namely the forms of mentoring activities, collaboration with inclusive elementary schools and the benefits of mentoring. An inclusive elementary school mentoring program based on university-school collaborative partnership is one that should produce mutual benefits for both parties. Universities are seen to be in a position to help inclusive elementary schools solve problems and provide appropriate solutions so that the implementation of inclusive education in elementary schools can follow government regulations. The government as the policy maker can be actively involved in evaluating inclusive education programs so that more flexible regulations can be introduced.",

This paper reports on the introduction of a techno-blended device for mathematics teaching in South African senior secondary classrooms. The research sample included 12 third-year mathematics education student teachers from a rural university. A qualitative case study design was employed. Participants were purposively selected. Data collection methods included non-participatory observation and in-depth individual interviews. The TPACK model and the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Framework guided the analysis of the data. The study found that the mathematics student teachers successfully implemented GammaTutor in their classrooms, thus demonstrating their proficiency and aptitude in utilising technology in the learning environment. The GammaTutor device also aided in teaching and learning mathematics by simplifying mathematical ideas for learners. Furthermore, it enabled the development of learner discourse as a crucial component for developing learners' problem-solving skills. Since the mathematics student teachers engaged the learners with a variety of mathematical exercises using the GammaTutor technology, the integration of GammaTutor in the mathematics classroom exhibited learner-centred provisioning. The study proposes a teaching model for creating innovative teaching spaces in rural schools in South Africa.",

This provides new learning opportunities for students and a talent pipeline for employers, but also requires participation in a competitive job market. This paper studies competition through a unique dataset from a large North American co-operative program, in which students and employers rank each other after a round of interviews, then a matching algorithm assigns students to jobs based on the ranks, and finally, they evaluate each other at the end of the work term. The results suggest that less experienced students and small employers are more strongly affected by competition and consider more options in their rankings, whereas senior students and large employers often only identify their top choice. Additionally, competition appears to affect satisfaction since students and employers give higher work term evaluations when matched with their top choice.",

To determine test-retest reliability and internal consistency, students (n = 39) completed the CPQS-S twice. Construct validity was then determined by factor analysis (n = 719). The factor analysis identified four discrete themes relating to the students' perception of what constitutes a quality clinical placement experience, furthermore, these quality indicators demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability.

With inclusion across a wide range of programs and courses, WIL is championed as providing authentic and transformative learning environments that may equip graduates for the world of work. Despite a rapid expansion in WIL scholarship, there remains scant attention at the postgraduate level, including its specific contributions in preparing students for life after completion of postgraduate studies. This paper contributes to nascent literature in this space. Taking the case of the University of Queensland's Master of Development Practice, this paper argues there are challenges in ensuring postgraduate WIL prepares graduates for careers in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world.

        "description":"High-quality student placements in rural areas can provide students with the opportunity to learn about, and become immersed in, a rural community and associated health service delivery. As long-term placements are often resource-intensive, the learning potential of short-term placements in rural areas deserves greater examination. This research examined the learning afforded to students during a short-term, rural, work-integrated learning experience and the attributes and practices that facilitated students' learning. Undergraduate students from three health disciplines who attended the placement participated in two focus groups at the end of their placement. Thematic analysis of the data was inductively informed by a situated learning approach. The results demonstrate several localized learning opportunities afforded by this short-term placement and the design elements that enabled that learning. These findings demonstrate the value of offering short-term placements to health students.",

Differentiated instruction is a student-centered technique in which instructors act as facilitators. It is doubtful, however, if differentiated instruction has a beneficial effect on the overall process of mathematical thinking. A disciplined approach to learning mathematics is deemed essential. In this study, a questionnaire was designed to assess students' motivation towards learning using differentiated instruction in mathematics, and a mathematics test was devised to assess students' mathematical thinking process. The study included 400 students who were identified as gifted and talented students; the data were analyzed using the SPSS software. The results suggest that statistically differentiated instruction has a significant effect on gifted and talented students' mathematical thinking processes. However, additional research is needed to discover which activities directly impact students' mathematical thinking processes positively and which should be avoided.",

        "description":"The financial planning profession has undergone significant change in recent years, where the focus has shifted from disclosure and consumer protection, to quality and education requirements. In Australia, there has been an increasing focus on the role that work-integrated learning (WIL) can play in financial planning education and preparing graduates for their professional year and subsequent registration as a financial planner. Emphasizing the centrality of student wellbeing, this paper identifies key considerations for, and potential alternatives to, incorporating extended work placements as a mandated WIL activity in financial planning education. It raises concerns regarding the potential for participation to negatively impact student wellbeing, identifies the equity challenges associated with placements, and discusses the need to ensure workplaces and students are adequately prepared for the placement. Finally, service learning is proposed as a practical alternative as it overcomes many of the disadvantages of traditional placements.",

This interpretive case study was conducted with 69 preservice science teachers studying at a university in eastern Turkey. The data of the study were collected using the teaching pedagogy preference form. The data analysis included descriptive analysis based on four instructional pedagogies: direct instruction, direct active, guided inquiry, and open inquiry. The research results revealed that preservice teachers did not sufficiently turn to inquiry-based teaching pedagogy for solving problem scenarios in both individual and teamwork. In addition, the results indicated that preservice science teachers' professional knowledge of teaching various science subjects is largely based on traditional teaching pedagogy. Based on these results, it is recommended that science educators use problem scenarios to reveal preservice teachers' inquiry-based teaching preferences.",

The design of the research is descriptive. The sample of the study consists of university students who take physical education and sport course in the first aid and emergency department of Artvin Coruh University in the 2018-2019 academic year. A total of 116 university students with a mean age of 20.64 participated in the study as voluntarily. Physical Education and Sport Attitude Scale was used to measure students' attitudes and the Rathus Assertiveness Inventory was used to measure assertiveness levels. In the study, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the distribution of normality, the Pearson correlation test was used to examine the relationship between students' attitudes towards physical education and sport and assertiveness levels, the independent sample t-test in parametric distributions, the Mann Whitney U test was used in non-parametric distributions. Kruskal Wallis test was used in more than two groups because the distributions are not normal. According to the findings, there was a negative correlation between the assertiveness levels of students and their attitudes toward physical education course. There was a significant difference between the attitudes towards physical education course in terms of gender, on the contrary, there was no significant difference between assertiveness levels in terms of gender. There was no significant difference between assertiveness levels and the attitudes towards physical education course in terms of doing regular sports and there was no significant difference between assertiveness levels and the attitudes towards physical education course in terms of academic achievement. As a result, although there was a negative relationship between attitudes of university students towards physical education and sports course and assertiveness levels, it was observed that attitudes towards the course are more positive in favor of male students. There were no significant differences between the levels of assertiveness and attitudes towards physical education and sports courses in terms of doing regular sports and academic achievement levels.",

The effectiveness of the methods for vocabulary learning was tested using three experimental learning conditions; the conditions were administered to all the participants for their learning of carefully selected 24 low-frequency English words. The results from the immediate post-tests indicated that the keyword technique provided the highest success in recalling the target words. Besides, the rote memorisation method was as successful as the keyword technique. However, the semantic mapping technique has created moderately lower scores both in immediate and delayed post-tests. After an interval of seven weeks, no significant differences were observed between methods. The study yielded suggestions for future larger-scale studies regarding the sample group's size, the field of study, and variety in the target language.",

While determining the teaching methods, various factors such as the general or specific objectives of the course, the characteristics of the subject to be taught, the characteristics of the student group, the material and the cost are effective, but especially the competence of the teachers in the teaching method is also an important issue. Because the planning and implementation of the teaching process in the classroom environment are directly related to the characteristics of the teacher. Based on what has been stated, in this study, the teaching methods used by geography teachers in Libya in teaching geography are discussed. The study aims to determine the opinions of teachers about the teaching methods used in geography teaching in Libyan schools. The research was carried out using the data obtained by the focus group interview method with 10 teachers working in educational institutions in Libya. According to the data obtained in the study, it was determined that geography teachers in Libyan schools mostly used traditional teaching methods and the education they received during university education had a significant effect on their choice of method. The geography teachers who participated in the study emphasized that the lack of auxiliary materials played an important role in determining the teaching method regarding the subject. Geography teachers stated that the problems related to the use of information and communication technology in schools and the realization of out-of-class learning activities are effective in determining the teaching methods.",

The aim of this article is to compare and contrast the experiences of university tutors who teach in two distance education universities with those who teach in a traditional university concerning their online lessons during lockdown. Forty university tutors participated in a survey to capture their teaching experiences. The survey was based on the transactional distance theory. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from both groups. Analysis of the quantitative data indicates no significant differences between the two groups in scores regarding course structure flexibility and the degree of student autonomy; however, significant difference with a high effect size was found regarding instructional dialogue, in favor of the distance tutors' group. Thematically analyzing the qualitative data allowed the researchers to group the data into three main themes focused on how the instructional dialogue was manifested in the classes of both groups: (a) the learning design approach adopted, (b) the tutor-led interaction for student support, and (b) learner-to-learner communication and the sense of an online community. Ensuing recommendations involve adopting social-constructivist approaches that can sustain high-quality instructional dialogue in online learning settings and creating distance education faculty development programs in traditional universities that will help tutors support dialogical forms of online pedagogy.",

The sudden transition has caused a chaos in the education sector in India. Many studies have been conducted on the issues faced by the students in online classes but not teachers. The higher secondary school teachers are a group who has to adapt immediately to the digital classrooms and resources since their students are at a stage of their prospective career choosing. The present study analyses the issues of teachers during online teaching who are suddenly pushed in to the digital environment. The case study method was adopted for the study with the support of a structured interview schedule. The sample of the study consisted of 50 higher secondary teachers in different disciplines and different schools across Kerala, India. Due to the pandemic restrictions the sample size has to be kept a minimum number. The study mainly focused on the problems faced by the higher secondary teachers during the online teaching. The findings of the study showed that the online teaching is a pressure for them rather than a pleasure experience. Major issues faced by the teachers are the lack of computer competency, technical issues such as lack of internet connectivity, students' access to the digital devices and the occupational stress due to the disruption of work- life balance. Based on the findings, practical and social implications are analyzed and discussed.",

There are five steps in the learning process: 1) reviewing 2) thinking 3) sharing 4) constructing and 5) applying and the results of checking the appropriateness of the teaching management plan that integrates with the analytical thinking process found that the experts assessed the quality of the teaching management plan integrated with the analytical thinking process. It was very appropriate ([x-bar] = 4.70) when students receive integrated teaching and learning management with the analytical thinking process of the course of learning management in computational science at primary and secondary levels. The students' analytical thinking ability after study was statistically significantly higher than before at the .05 level and were satisfied towards blended learning at a high level.",

        "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic induced a digital transformation of education and inspired both instructors and learners to adopt and leverage technology for learning. This led to online learning becoming an important component of the new normal, with home-based virtual learning an essential aspect for learners on various levels. This, in turn, has caused learners of varying levels to interact more frequently with virtual resources to supplement their learning. Even though virtual learning environments provide basic resources to help monitor the learners' online behaviour, there is room for more insights to be derived concerning individual learner performance. In this study, we propose a framework for visualising learners' online behaviour and use the data obtained to predict whether the learners would clear a course. We explored a variety of binary classifiers from which we achieved an overall accuracy of 80%-85%, thereby indicating the effectiveness of our approach and that learners' online behaviour had a significant effect on their academic performance. Further analysis showed that common patterns of behaviour among learners and/or anomalies in online behaviour could cause incorrect interpretations of a learner's performance, which gave us a better understanding of how our approach could be modified in the future.",

        "description":"Inclusive Education (IE) is a practical approach to effectively accommodate students with disabilities (SWDs) in the general education classroom, whereby educational equity is believed to be realized. To that effect, the Federal Government of Ethiopia (FDRE) developed and rolled out its 2012 Inclusive Education Strategy (IES). This study assessed the implementation status of the strategy after a decade of enactment in secondary schools of the Gofa zone in South Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Regional State (SNNPRS). This study aimed to examine the practice and challenges of implementing the IES in secondary schools to contribute its share to a better realization of inclusivity. The survey, FGDs and KIIs have been employed to generate quantitative and qualitative data; results analysis has been made using an independent t-test and the mean score interpretation using Bluma (2012) intervals; and SPSS version 21 for frequency counts and percentages for comparing and contrasting perceptions and opinions. The study's significant findings show that IES has not been effectively implemented in the Zone. Instead, challenged by different factors such as; lack of knowledge, understanding and awareness about the strategy; shortage of suitable inputs, physical facilities and teaching materials for the SWDs; leadership and management failure due to lack of understanding about the IES, and absence of reliable data about the CWD in the community. Filing the knowledge gaps of all the school community about the IES; conducting integrated leadership to make the schools suitable for SWDs; school-led- and community-assisted data collection on CWDs stand out as essential recommendations to improve the implementation.",

        "description":"The aim of this study was to compare the analytical thinking skills of the 8th grade students who received emergency distance and face-to-face education in a science course and to get student ideas concerning emergency distance education. An unequal control group model from the quasi-experimental models was used in the study. The study group consisted of 39 students. Fifteen students who received energy transformations and environmental science unit as emergency distance education constituted the first group and 24 students who received face-to-face education constituted the second group. The data were collected with ATAT, TATDL, and SOF. In conclusion, it was determined that the cognitive success of the students who received face-to-face education based on analytical thinking improved more. The ability to adapt analytical thinking to daily life developed equally in both groups. While the students who received emergency distance education did not express a negative opinion about the activities carried out in the teaching process, they stated negative opinions about the realization of this process online, such as internet shortage, lack of communication tools, noise, occasional power cuts, inefficiency compared to face-to-face education, difficulty in understanding the lesson, difficulty in speaking in front of the screen, inability of the teacher to be effective in distance education, and inability to experiment together. However, there were also students who expressed a positive opinion that the course was productive, interesting, calm, more comfortable than face-to-face education, and safer to protect from the disease. As a result, it is thought that emergency distance education cannot replace face-to-face education; however, it is an effective education process that can be applied to prevent students from being completely disconnected from school and education during periods when lessons cannot be continued due to extraordinary circumstances such as pandemic.",

The OCOI was designed to measure students' perceptions of cognitive overload in online courses. The SMFS was used to assess students' perceptions of mental fatigue while taking online courses. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted on a sample of 378 undergraduate students from various institutions offering online courses across the United States. Results of a factor and reliability analyses confirmed that the instruments are valid and reliable measures of students' perceived mental fatigue and overload from online course elements. The analysis supported the model that students' perceptions of overload in online courses consist of four constructs--information relevance, information overload, course design, and facilitation--in addition to the one-factor structure of the SMFS, which consists of the student mental fatigue construct.",

In this study, the screening model was used, which is one of the quantitative research methods. The reason for choosing the screening model in the research is to determine the relationship between different variables such as gender, parents' education level, and whether there is a person with disability in the student's immediate environment and the level of social acceptance. In the 2019-2020 academic year, 1083 6th, 7th, and 8th-grade students in inclusive classes in public secondary schools in Türkiye participated in the study. The Social Acceptance Scale was used in the study. The statistical package was used to analyze the data. The results of the study revealed that there was a significant difference in social acceptance levels of students with typical development towards their peers with special needs (p&lt;0.001) according to the variables as gender, father's education level, grade level, Having a person with disability among relatives, previous attendance to kindergarten and nursery in the past, family status. However, it was found out that there was no statistically significant difference between the mother's level of education of the students with typical development and their social acceptance levels towards their peers with special needs.

Anecdotally, responses from teachers and educators around the world range from heightened caution to being inspired by distance education as the &quot;new normal.&quot; Of all the challenges, face-to-face and formal teaching have been most heavily affected. Despite some education systems demonstrating resilience, a major challenge is sustaining quality and inclusiveness in formal education suddenly delivered at a distance. In probing these issues, this article profiles international perspectives on the role of open education in responding to the impact on formal school and higher education caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We proceed by highlighting and analysing practices and case studies from 13 countries representing all global regions, identifying and discussing the challenges and opportunities that have presented themselves. Reports cover the period from the beginning of 2020 until 11 March 2021, the first anniversary of the COVID-19 outbreak as declared by the World Health Organization. In our comparative study, we identify seven key aspects of which three (missing infrastructure and sharing OER, open education and access to OER, and urgent need for professional development and training for teachers) are directly related to open education at a distance. After comparing examples of existing practice, we make recommendations and offer insights into how open education strategies can lead to interventions that are effective and innovative--to improve formal education at a distance in schools and universities in the future.",

Pearson Chi-square tests yielded statistically significant differences in all 4 year comparisons of white and Hispanic students in all three states. White students from California had the highest percentage of students earn a 3 or higher for all 4 years, Arizona had the second highest percentage of white students earn a 3 or higher for all 4 years, and Texas had the lowest percentage of white students earn a 3 or higher for all 4 years of comparison.

The target population was doctoral students who had been registered at the ODeL university for more than a year. To conduct a quantitative investigation, data were collected by means of a 34-item six-dimensional standardized questionnaire. Data analysis methods included linear as well as stepwise regressions. Using the gaps model as the theoretical framework, findings showed that the doctoral students were dissatisfied with four aspects of the student support services, namely supervision support, infrastructure, administrative support, and academic facilitation. In contrast, students were satisfied with the corporate image (reputation) of the ODeL university. For this ODeL university to play an effective role that coheres with the country's socio-economic development plan, more attention should be given to the provision of supervision support, as there was strong dissatisfaction with this. The university could also build on or leverage aspects of their corporate image, for which there was strong satisfaction. Doing so will help the university make ongoing contributions and strengthen its commitment to the field of higher education and human capacity development in Ethiopia.",

        "description":"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have emerged as an affordable way to distribute knowledge and democratize education. The examination of online courses calls for theoretical models and instruments that contemplate its particularities. The community of inquiry (CoI) framework has been used in several studies to analyze the effectiveness of online education and hybrid education, including MOOCs. This study aimed to translate and validate the Community of Inquiry Survey instrument (Arbaugh et al., 2008) into Brazilian Portuguese, and used a two-stage methodological design for translating and validating a questionnaire. In the first stage, we carried out translation, back-translation, and cross-cultural adaptation. We translated the 34 items while maintaining the survey's original format. In the expert evaluation phase, all items were considered understandable and essential for inclusion in the Brazilian Portuguese version of the CoI instrument. In the second stage, a prospective cross-sectional study was conducted to validate the questionnaire, and data was collected from participants completing the &quot;Nursing Assessment&quot; MOOC available on the Lúmina platform. A total of 690 responses were gathered. The resulting instrument produced excellent results, and the three presences achieved high reliability indexes, clearly indicating their adequacy. Furthermore, this study proved the validation of the CoI instrument, maintaining the three-factor structure previously reported in the literature corresponding to the three presences: teaching, social, and cognitive presence. We recommend further studies to evaluate the need for excluding or altering cognitive presence items.",

        "description":"MOOCs (massive open online courses) have attracted considerable attention from researchers. Fueled by constant change and developments in educational technology, the trends of MOOCs have varied greatly over the years. To detect and visualize the developments and changes in MOOC research, 4,652 articles published between 2009 and 2021 were retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus with the aid of CiteSpace. This study sought to explore the number of publications, co-citation network, cluster analysis, timeline analysis, burstness analysis, and dual-map overlays based on co-citation relationships. The first finding was that the number of publications on MOOCs had increased consistently, and grew especially quickly between 2013 and 2015. Second, the main topic of the top 10 co-cited studies revolved around the problem of learner continuance. Third, blended programs, task-technology fit, and comparative analysis have emerged as popular subjects. Fourth, the development of MOOC research has followed distinct phases, with 2009 to 2012 the starting phase, 2013 to 2015 the high growth phase, 2016 to 2018 the plateau phase, and 2019 to 2021 another peak phase. Lastly, both cluster analysis and dual-map overlays provided empirical evidence of cross-disciplinary research. Our findings provided an in-depth and dynamic understanding of the development and evolution of MOOC research and also proposed novel ideas for future studies.",

This article proposes a method for comparative analysis based on network metrics such as information entropy and global network efficiency as more holistic measures characterizing social learning group dynamics. We applied social learning optimization analysis of networks (SLOAN) to a data set consisting of Coursera courses from a range of disciplines. We examined the relationship of discussion forum uses and measures of network efficiency, characterized by the information flow through the network. Discussion forums vary greatly in size and in use. Courses with a greater prevalence of subject-related versus procedural talk differed significantly in seeking but not disseminating behaviors in massive open online course discussion forums. Subject-related talk was related to higher network efficiency and had higher seeking and disseminating scores overall. We discuss the value of SLOAN for social learning and argue for the experimental study of online discussion optimization using a discussion post recommendation system for maximizing social learning.",

Under convenient sampling, 843 undergraduate students with rural and urban backgrounds participated in an online self-administered questionnaire. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to examine the hypothesized relationships. We found that students' online class intention is significantly influenced by their attitude towards online classes (AOC), perceived usefulness (PU), and facilitating conditions (FC). We further identified that external antecedents have significant indirect effects on the outcome variables. Our findings provide new insights and contribute to a learners' community on online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For many nursing students, distance learning is a new experience and an essential requirement if they hope to complete their programs. Two challenges that nursing students could face during e-learning are the lack of social presence and low satisfaction. This study aimed to assess students' sense of community and satisfaction during e-learning and determine their impacts on academic achievement. This cross-sectional descriptive study used convenience sampling to collect data via a student satisfaction survey and a classroom community scale. There was a positive and significant correlation between the sense of community, total satisfaction with elearning (p &lt; 0.001), and academic achievement (p &lt; 0.001). Academic achievement was positively and strongly correlated with satisfaction with teaching (p &lt; 0.001), assessment (p &lt; 0.001), generic skills and learning experiences (p &lt; 0.001), and total satisfaction with e-learning (p &lt; 0.001). Students who worked collaboratively with their classmates and were more engaged in their learning were more satisfied with elearning and had higher academic achievement (p &lt; 0.01). Female participants reported a strong sense of community and satisfaction with e-learning and greater academic achievement than males. Junior students perceived higher satisfaction scores and greater academic achievement (p &lt; 0.01) than senior students. The findings of this study suggest that failing to meet student expectations can lead to low levels of student involvement. Students' engagement and satisfaction are good indicators of the quality and effectiveness of online programs.",

        "description":"Recent research in the field of virtual reality (VR) education is dominated by the application, experience, and effectiveness of high-immersive environments. However, high-immersive VR may not be accessible to all learners, with online distance learning students in particular unable to fully engage without being supplied with appropriate accessories. These field notes shed light on the role of low-immersive VR as a desktop tool for online distance learning students, exploring student experience of using 360° virtual spaces to undertake a summative assessment. Primary data collection in the form of an anonymous online survey was employed to gather feedback from postgraduate environmental management students who used lowimmersive VR to undertake an environmental management system audit of a university campus. Quantitative results were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative responses using thematic analysis. Findings indicated that with guidance from the academic teaching staff and practice using the software, the majority of students felt both prepared and happy to undertake a summative assessment using VR spaces. Skills development and an appreciation of the effectiveness of the assessment approach were also highlighted as positive outcomes reinforcing findings from literature on the value of VR to improve learning outcomes particularly with practical tasks. Limitations of the assessment content and software were however noted by students, but both could be resolved with adaptations to the tool. It is hoped this research will be valuable to online education providers to demonstrate the value of using low-immersive VR within their programmes.",

Across different communities and contexts, the sudden and unplanned transition to distance learning induced by the pandemic has generated many challenges, but has simultaneously offered several opportunities. One of its most widely appreciated effects is the increased involvement of families in the school system. This study was conducted in a refugee community in Lebanon, addressing the needs of out-of-school Syrian children through a distance learning programme for early childhood education and basic literacy and numeracy. Through a phenomenological design, this study investigates the parents' or caregivers' role and the challenges they faced in facilitating the process of distance learning during the pandemic period. A total of 68 parents and caregivers participated in 07 focus group discussions. According to the findings, distance learning can be significantly hampered by the lack of a stable internet connection and a minimum level of digital devices. At the same time, the effectiveness of the process can be greatly affected by the caregivers' logistic and pedagogical readiness to support their children while they were enrolled in a distance learning programme. External support from schools or civil society organisations can improve the caregivers' readiness and positively affect the children's learning outcomes.",

Motivations were examined in terms of gender, grade level, school type, project experience, and biology laboratory experience. The research was planned according to the 'Survey design.' The sample consisted of 545 students studying at different grade levels (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades) of secondary education institutions in Turkey. The study data were collected through the 'Context-Based Biology Motivation Scale (CBBMS)' developed by Gül (2019). The measurement tool consists of 34 items in a five-point Likert type, and a total of three sub-factors: association and effect, participation and competence, and enjoyment and satisfaction. Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was determined ([alpha]= 0.943) for the entire measurement tool. For the sub-factors, it was [alpha] = 0.898 for association and effect, [alpha] = 0.914 for participation and competence, [alpha] = 0.846 and for enjoyment and satisfaction. For independent groups, the t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Tukey test were used in the data analysis. According to the research results, secondary school students' motivations toward context-based biology differed significantly according to gender, school type, biology laboratory experience, and grade level. On the contrary, motivations did not differ significantly according to their project experiences. The data obtained from the research will contribute to the literature in determining the factors affecting the motivation of secondary school students toward context-based biology.",

In these years, shared family experiences, social interaction, and safe, responsive, and nurturing environments provided to a child constitute the determining factor in their future life. The home environment is considered to be a place where the foundations of language and literacy skills are stimulated for many children. The COVID-19 pandemic, which affected the whole world, has caused non-formal education to be carried out remotely and via digital tools to an unprecedented extent. This situation has necessitated parents to be more aware of the possibilities of the home environment and its impact on children and to better understand the importance of taking responsibility. However, very few scholars in this pandemic situation have pointed out how language and literacy opportunities can be offered in the home environment, which is the first place of education for children. Therefore, this study aims to increase parents' home literacy skills and attitudes in order to develop opportunities and resources for children's participation in literacyrelated interactions. Over a semester, 11 preschool and 12 first-year elementary school parents participated in this action research from Buca district of Izmir province in Turkey. Before implementing the action plans, parental attitudes towards home literacy competencies were assessed using a semi-structured survey prepared by the researchers. After the action plan, the parents' developmental status and attitudes towards home literacy were again evaluated with a semi-structured survey, and all data were analyzed using descriptive, percentage, frequency, and Cramer V analysis methods. According to the results, the action plan steps had a positive impact on raising awareness of the home literacy environment, building language and literacy activities, and supporting extension skills in essential language development (listening/watching, speaking, reading, and writing).",

The part parents play in their children's math education are a largely untapped resource for improving the quality of mathematics education among Ghanaian children. In order to maximise this resource, there is the need for basic research on the nature of involvement of parents in their children's mathematical growth. In view of this, we employed case study design to explore ways by which parents involve themselves in their children's mathematical development and how these can be harnessed to improve students' mathematics achievement in Tano North Municipality. This study was guided by the Epstein's overlapping spheres of influence theory. A sample of 10 comprising 5 students and 5 parents was considered for the study. We employed a semi-structured interview to gather the required data which were analysed using inductive content analysis. Among the findings, it was revealed that some of the ways by which parents can help in the development of children's mathematical development is provision of learning resources and activity at home, helping with mathematics homework, encourage good study habits, monitor their school attendance, organize remedial classes, parents' participation in school activities, and teaching appropriate behaviour for academic success. Based on the findings of the study, we recommend the Tano North Municipal Directorate of Ghana Education Service to collaborate with headteachers at the basic schools to create family engagement programmes that highlight parents' role in the children's mathematics development and future success.",

Employing the phenomenology design, this study was conducted with participants determined through criterion sampling, one of the purposive sampling methods. The participants consist of 15 school administrators working in special education schools in Turkey. Data have been collected through semi-structured interviews, one of the qualitative data collection techniques. The results have indicated that coordination in special education schools is achieved through face-to-face communication among school administrators whilst it is established via digital platforms between teachers and students. It has also been determined that special education school administrators, teachers, and parents have various needs such as technological tools and internet support during the COVID-19 process. In addition, the results have revealed that the COVID-19 process has some benefits for school administrators such as affordability, experience in crisis management, opportunities to get to know the parents closely and to organize parent training programs, and effective participation of parents in their children's education. The study has concluded that distance education practices are not efficient in special education.",

Educational researchers have called for studies of how STEM programs engage girls. However, little research has embedded STEM education with girl education such as their emotional needs, identity, and self-expression. This study examined how crochet that was embedded in a STEM summer camp impacted their sense of belonging (SoBL), creativity, well-being, and STEAM learning. For this qualitative study, surveys were conducted with 37 student participants and Discord was used as part of the data sources. Findings indicated that crocheting enhanced students' SoBL, creativity, and well-being, as well as STEM learning. This study contributes to the STEM learning program design for girls in secondary schools with two closely related theories: Constructivist learning environment theory and SoBL theory. This study added new knowledge to the research of crochet in girl education and STEM program design.",

        "description":"The concept of self-directedness is a missing link in South African science classrooms, and as a result, science teachers are often not self-directed in employing innovative teaching and learning strategies such as blended problem-based learning (BPBL) that might enhance self-directed learning. The literature is replete with studies showing that science teachers in the United States, Indonesia, and South Africa, to name a few, lack the necessary technological skills to utilize simulations in the teaching and learning of physical sciences. This intervention-based explanatory mixed methods study was conducted in one of the nine education provinces of South Africa. Quantitative data were generated using a self-directed learning instrument (SDLI), the Physics Education Technology interactive simulations questionnaire, and a PBL questionnaire. Forty participants were sampled using both cluster and systematic random sampling techniques. Qualitative data were generated through a BPBL scenario, a reflective portfolio, and semi-structured interviews with two purposively selected participants. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and parametric statistics. The reflective portfolio was analyzed using performance standards scoring rubric adopted from Smith et al. (2001). The BPBL Scenario Evaluation Schedule and interviews were analyzed using Saldaña's (2013) code-to-theory analytical model. It was concluded that there was a significant difference in participants' perceptions of PBL, self-directedness, and interactive simulations after attending a teacher professional development intervention (TPDI) and implementing BPBL. The findings show that the utilization of interactive simulations and PBL in physical sciences classrooms was unknown to teachers -- suggesting that teachers were not self-directed in implementing BPBL. This study presents a model for designing BPBL activities and an evaluation schedule for assessing those activities for self-directedness in educational practices.",

        "description":"The study aimed to investigate the effects of a STEM-based course design on students' attitudes toward STEM and a science course. STEM activities were prepared per learning outcomes relating to the &quot;illumination and sound technologies&quot; learning domain in the Grade 4 science course. The study was carried out based on an experiment and control group quasi-experimental design. The study was carried out at a state school in Mersin in 2021. The experimental group of the study consisted of 32 and the control group consisted of 32 Grade 4 students. STEM-based activities were performed in the experimental group. However, non-STEM activities were performed based on usual experimental setups in the control group. At the end of the study, the experimental and control group students' attitudes toward STEM and science course were examined to determine whether there were statistically significant differences. As part of this study, student opinions on STEM were examined. A STEM attitude test and open-ended opinion form were used as data collection tools. Normality tests were conducted, and the homogeneity of variances was examined. Dependent and independent t-tests were conducted in quantitative data analysis and content analysis in the qualitative data analysis. The results suggested that STEM-based course design significantly increased students' STEM attitudes and their attitudes toward science course more than the attitudes of students not exposed to STEM-based course design. In addition, students considered STEM practices fun and informative. Accordingly preparing STEM-based course design for science course has been suggested.",

        "description":"The balance between personal life and work life is essential to achieve desired outcomes. However, the COVID-19 global pandemic changed the way people live and work and affected schools like other organizations. Teachers were expected to work from home and adapt to the tools and technologies used in distance education. Working from home has blurred the borders between work and personal life and might affect the work-life balance adversely. Although there are studies based on the work-life balance of academicians, there is a gap lack of in the experiences of teachers on work-life balance during emergency remote teaching, especially those who worked at private schools. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify teachers' experiences on work-life balance in emergency remote teaching. The current study was designed as phenomenological research. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 11 teachers who were selected through the purposive sampling. The obtained data were analyzed through content analysis. The findings of the study revealed that there were two themes as (i) challenges for work-life balance and (ii) ways of maintaining a work-life balance. It was found that the teachers, who had to work from home, did not maintain a balance between personal life and work because of such challenges as inadequacy of workspace, irregularity of working hours, lack of support and role conflicts. Consequently, they failed to achieve the desired outcomes of work and individual lives which adversely affected their well-being. Besides, working from home and distance education seem likely to continue even after the pandemic has ended. Hence, this study will provide practical and managerial implication for human resources, crisis management and work-life balance.",

The participants were eighth grade students from these three countries. The data were analyzed with Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and hierarchical multiple regression. The Singapore sample had an auto-correlation problem, so it was not included in the regression analysis. SES explained 16.6% and attitude towards science explained 9.8% of the change in the academic achievement in the United Kingdom sample while these values were 21.9% and 14.4% for the Turkey sample, respectively. The sub-dimensions of the independent variable were also examined in the study. One the most important factors associated with students' academic achievement in Turkey is their SES. In this sense, the limitations of students in their access to home resources for learning are reflected negatively to their academic performance.",

A quasi-experimental control group interrupted time series design was employed. Data were collected from 132 students, who were selected using a random sampling technique from three governmental secondary schools. Two experimental groups and one comparison group were involved in the study. A series of chemical equilibrium conceptual and procedural tests were used to collect data. A mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the test scores. The three groups had varied mean gain scores in conceptual and procedural examination scores as repeated measurements of time, as can be observed from the descriptive statistics. The two-way mixed ANOVA findings revealed that there was a significant main effect between groups on conceptual test scores. Furthermore, on conceptual knowledge test scores, there was a significant interaction between time point and intervention groups. On procedural examination scores, there was also a significant difference between the 3-time points and intervention groups. A significant interaction between time points and groups was also observed. Given that there was a significant difference between the pre-test, post-test, and follow-up post-test scores in the experimental group, with the difference favoring the post-test scores, it can be concluded that the technology-integrated formative assessment strategy is successful in raising secondary school students' conceptual and procedural test scores.",

        "description":"A lack of diversity permeates the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field. Under-representation within STEM fields can stifle innovation and progressive approaches to the future of STEM. Traditional STEM pathways focus on identifying participants who show academic promise in schools. One segment of young people, youth who have been &quot;pushed out&quot; of high schools, have often been excluded from STEM pathways. Alternative education programs have the potential to support youth who have been pushed out, to re-engage in STEM. The purpose of this study was to understand what factors contributed to the STEM aspirations of students at Xinaxtli Charter School (XCS), an alternative education program for youth who have been &quot;pushed out&quot; in South California. This quantitative study utilized Structural Equation Modeling to analyze a conceptual model for STEM aspirations at XCS. Specifically, this study looked at how each of the following areas -- student perception of their science teacher, critical science education, student sense of agency to create knowledge in science class, student engagement in science class, and the relevance of science to the student -- impacted student STEM aspirations. The best predictors of student STEM aspirations came from the following factors: (a) Relevance of science to students, (b) student sense of agency to create knowledge, (c) and critical science education. Findings from this study provide a framework for educators of STEM classrooms to re-engage youth who have previously &quot;pushed out&quot; of their traditional secondary schools.",

        "description":"When laboratory accidents in schools, especially in recent years, are examined, it is remarkable that many of these events resulted from the incorrect implementation of laboratory safety. The most significant role in the administration of laboratory safety belongs to science teachers. During this process, the necessity of laboratory safety training is for teachers to gain knowledge, skills, and attitude with regard to laboratory safety. This study aimed to investigate science teachers' knowledge level regarding laboratory safety and increase science teachers' knowledge level regarding laboratory safety through professional development seminars. Professional development seminars were carried out for teachers in eight modules which included both visual presentations and active learning-teaching activities. Training activities were planned in consideration of the subjects and experiments included in the current Turkish general science curriculum. The single-group pre-test post-test design, a semi-experimental design application, was used. To investigate the effects of laboratory safety professional development seminars, pre- and post-tests were applied to only one group. The &quot;Laboratory Safety Knowledge Test&quot; developed by the researchers was applied to determine teachers' improvement regarding laboratory safety. According to findings, there was a statistically significant difference between scores of changes in teachers' knowledge level regarding laboratory safety before and after professional seminars. Moreover, there was not a demographically significant difference between scores of changes in teachers' knowledge level. It is considered that the findings of the research will contribute to school laboratories being safer and more effective environments in which the activities of science lessons are carried out.",

The present study investigated the perception and experiences of undergraduate students and faculty members of the Civil Engineering program at the United Arab Emirates University concerning switching to OL during COVID-19. Quantitative questionnaires were distributed to faculty members and students following the end of the spring semester of 2020. Students and faculty members identified student engagement and online exams as major areas that require improvement. Online exams were challenging for students and difficult to prepare, control, and administer for faculty. Providing technical support is critical for the successful streaming of online courses. Initially, half of the surveyed students began the transition with a positive attitude toward OL, and this percentage increased during the transition. The capacity to continue learning during the COVID-19 crisis and the availability of recorded materials were perceived by the students as the main advantages of OL while challenging online examinations and the lack of social interaction were the main disadvantages.",

In a dictation, a passage is read aloud by the teacher and examinees write down what they hear. Due to the peculiar form of dictations, psychometric analysis of dictations is challenging. In a dictation, there is no clear boundary between the items and every word in the text is potentially an item. This makes the analysis of dictations with classical and modern test theories rather difficult. In this study, we suggest a procedure to make dictations analyzable with psychometric models. Our strategy entailed using several independent short passages instead of a single long passage. The number of mistakes in each passage was counted and entered into the analysis. Rasch model analysis was then applied to the passage scores (mistakes). Our findings showed that dictations fit the Rasch model very well and it is possible to measure examinees' ability on an interval scale using dictations.",

Due to their ease of construction and scoring, cloze tests are widely used in the context of second and foreign language testing. Previous research over the past decades has shown the reliability and validity of cloze tests in different contexts. However, due to the interdependent structure of cloze test items, item response theory models have not been applied to analyze cloze tests. In this research, we apply a method to circumvent the problem of local dependence for analyzing cloze tests with the Rasch model. Using this method, we applied the Rasch model to a cloze test composed of eight passages each containing 8-15 gaps. Findings showed that the Rasch model fits the data and thus it is possible to scale persons and cloze passages on an interval unidimensional scale. The test had high reliability and was well-targeted to the examinees. Implications of the study are discussed.",

        "description":"Inclusive education for children with special needs is considered fundamental for children to adapt more easily to their social environment. The humanistic inclusion education curriculum can be developed through a curriculum modification process that combines the national education curriculum, local content, and the characteristics of children with special needs. Al-Azhaar Islamic Primary School is one of the educational institutions that has successfully organized inclusive education to improve students' abilities academically and socially in a humanist manner. This research uses the field study and case study qualitative methods. Data collection techniques involve in-depth interviews, participant observations, and documentation studies. The results of this study show that effective inclusive education is designed and implemented by combining normal children with those with special needs. Learning requires adjustment (modification) of teaching materials, methods, media, funds, class management, and the learning environment. Teachers find it difficult to carry out learning if the curriculum is not modified; not only do students have to adapt to the situation and the substance of education, but learning must also adjust to the student's abilities, learning speed, difficulties, and interest in learning. A child with special needs is not forced to master competencies that are beyond his or her ability. Children with special learning needs are not asked to keep up with students without learning disabilities but neither are they left waiting for their slower friends. Students who fail in one method and learning technique may not necessarily fail in other different methods and techniques.",

        "description":"Argumentation is central to science learning. Students in every domain of science should have the opportunity to develop the ability to think and act in ways associated with argumentation. When engaged in argumentation, students learn how to puzzle through problems, to see multiple ways of finding solutions, to gather and evaluate evidence on different sides of issues, and communicate scientific knowledge. These skills can ultimately equip students with the ability to function effectively at work and in the everyday world. In this study, argumentation was processed as a dialogical interaction for students who are in a dialogical relation with others, and who contribute to a conversation by means of thinking, sense making, reasoning, and problem solving in the science classroom. Eighty-seven students completed 48 written tasks, twelve of which deal with problem-solving tasks on mechanics concepts and 36 other tasks concerned with features of how they make and defend arguments. The results show that about two-thirds of the students tended to place primacy on claim making and evidence evaluation on problem-solving tasks that have clear solutions. However, when they had to solve problem tasks that have multiple solutions or no clear-cut answers, regardless of the type of scenarios, their performance dropped considerably. These findings provided additional insight for where more emphasis needs to be placed in both students' arguments and pedagogical explanations on how argumentation in science classrooms can be conceptualized.",

The study conducted 21 interviews, 12 with first grades teachers and 9 with parents, of first grade children as well. The study used an analytical framework in order to identify the factors in the adaptation of students in the first grade as a problem of teachers and challenging factors in this regard, as well as the experience of parents in this regard. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to analyze the study findings. The results assumed a common opinion among the representatives of the sample, teachers and parents. The study makes us understand that parents are satisfied with the work of teachers in terms of adaptation of the child, but on the other hand we find that teachers consider that professionalism is still needed in this regard. The study also shows that teachers recommend training teachers for their professionalism in child adaptation.",

        "description":"This study developed an approach to assess the quality of education in &quot;Pondok Pesantren&quot; in Indonesia. The study used a descriptive qualitative methodology. The research location is Ma'had Darullughah Wadda'awah, Pasuruan City, East Java, Indonesia. The study results revealed that: (1) The planning of the &quot;Pondok Pesantren&quot;-based curriculum is carried out by the structural parties of an institution and the functionaries to synchronize the educational program in ma'had categorized into two classes, namely, internal and external; (2) The curriculum is implemented by the institution through continuous improvement in response to changing times, cultural changes, organization's quality standards, and harmonious relationships with stakeholders and guardians of students through the development of da'wah media, mastery of Arabic language skills, and application of deep Islamic values (&quot;dirasah al Islamiyyah&quot;) at both theological normative and ethical levels; (3) Pondok Pesantren conducts two types of evaluations to measure students' abilities: structural component evaluations and student learning competency evaluations. The former kind of evaluation aims to examine the curriculum that produces conclusions in the form of data, while the latter refers to the process when curriculum developers obtain the requisite data to revise the curriculum more effectively. It is possible to conclude that implementing total quality management (TQM) in &quot;Pondok Pesantren&quot; is one of the key approaches to achieving effective Islamic education goals. The government must devote significant attention and resources to TQM for the growth and development of &quot;Pondok Pesantren&quot; students in Indonesia.",

        "description":"In the past decade, scientific process skills and scientific attitudes are widely regarded as essential factors influencing students' achievement and their future career choices. Unfortunately, previous literature found that students' scientific skills and attitudes tend to be unsatisfactory. Thus, cultivating students' skills and attitudes is seen as a fundamental goal in science education. This research sought to promote scientific process skills and scientific attitudes of pre-service chemistry teachers using REORCILEA (Research-Oriented Collaborative Inquiry Learning). In this quasi-experimental research, a one-group pretest and posttest design was utilized. A total of 50 pre-service teachers (6 males and 44 females) at a medium-sized public university in Indonesia were recruited in this study. In order to gather data, the Scientific Process Skills Observation Checklist (SPSOC) and the Scientific Attitude Survey (SAS) were administered before and after the intervention. The data obtained in this study were analyzed through paired-samples t-test and Cohen's d. The results showed a significant increase from pretest to posttest in scientific process skills and scientific attitude scores during treatment, each with a high effect size. It can be summarized that REORCILEA is effective in fostering scientific skills and positive attitudes of pre-service chemistry teachers to a satisfactory level. It is recommended for educators to apply REORCILEA to other college chemistry courses to improve their performance.",

        "description":"The celebration of diversity is at the heart of global education initiatives. Yet, participation in study abroad and related programs in the United States--a purported 'melting pot' of races and cultures--remains, disproportionately, the domain of affluent whites. Against this background, this study seeks to learn from the experiences of underrepresented and hypersegregated students in international virtual exchange (IVE), an educational experience involving sustained interaction between geographically separated participants using technology and trained facilitators. Using a survey, semi-structured interviews, exchange field notes, and the researcher's own abroad experiences, the data revealed five main themes: 'Virtual connections beyond the classroom,' 'Bias reduction,' 'Color matters,' 'Equality in digital space,' and 'One step closer to abroad.' Findings suggest that U.S. universities and other educational institutions serving underrepresented groups can increase student international experiences by promoting IVE on their campuses and encouraging more professors to include exchange as a component in their courses.",

As educators collaborating on a transnational virtual exchange, we aim to investigate the process that teachers go through as they co-develop and collaborate in a transnational virtual exchange from our experiences and perceptions. We ask: To what extent do previous lived experiences mediate the process of teacher capacity building in a transnational virtual, collaborative exchange? This collaborative qualitative autoethnography case study explores our experiences as four instructors from the United States and Hong Kong, reflecting our experiences as they relate to teacher capacity building in transnational virtual exchange. The data suggests that previously lived international experiences assisted the instructors in capacity building within a virtual exchange and brought into question the role of cultural humility.",

        "description":"Information and communication technology (ICT) is used in all spheres of life, including education. Educators are encouraged to use ICT in the classroom, and their technology is constantly improving. The relevance of the study lies in the fact that ICT has become an essential issue and a powerful tool in the educational process. The ICT is applied from the preschool to the university level, facilitating the educational process, changes, and reforms in the field, especially under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ICT use causes crucial changes in education, visible in the very structure of the educational process and the roles of its stakeholders -- students and teachers. The importance of specific requirements for ICT use is proved by the necessity to adapt to a changing reality in secondary education according to modern requirements, especially for elderly educators. This fact is also critical for the school administration concerning the professional development of teachers. Our study aims to explore teachers' perspectives on using ICT in secondary school education and the relationship between teachers' age, education, work experience and the aptitude for using ICT in teaching practice. The primary research approach is an exploratory-descriptive research based on qualitative and quantitative methods for collecting information from secondary school teachers using a survey and on-site observations. The study's results depict that the technology used in the educational process affects the growth of teachers' professional competence and contributes to high motivation of students, valuable results in teaching, and a substantial improvement in the quality of education. However, it causes particular challenges for teachers and the school's administration. The research data provide possible solutions for refining the ICT use in education and offer insights into effective teaching using technology in secondary schools.",

These issues are examined through the lens of a domestic program offered by Empatico known as Empathy Across the US. Our findings point to several of the known barriers in the facilitation of virtual exchange, including technology access and pressing demands facing teachers, both of which impact accessibility. This study offers insights into how teachers in different settings perceive and experience the implementation of a domestic model of virtual exchange. As K-12 virtual exchange programs often rely on the willingness of teachers to implement these kinds of programs outside of the official school curriculum, our research indicated the importance of system-wide investment and structural support for domestic virtual exchange beyond individual champions.",

Using 150 MSME actors as the research sample and the ordinary least squares estimation technique, this study found that green policy, which includes policy targets, MSME group abilities, MSME resources, incentives, and security, has a positive and significant impact on green entrepreneurship in Ngawi Regency. This study proves that clear and relevant public policy objectives are a prerequisite for effective policy implementation. Clear policy targets make the target group of the policy understand the policy implications, thereby lowering the resistance to the policy. Therefore, in contrast to the top-down model, which emphasizes the role of authority institutions, this research empowerment model proves that, as one of the parties most responsible for policy, aspects related to MSME actors have a pivotal role in realizing effective policy implementation. Among the five factors under consideration, the ability and resources of MSMEs and incentives have a relatively more significant contribution than the other factors in encouraging green entrepreneurial behavior in the wood industry business in Ngawi regency. Thus, to strengthen the readiness of the wood industry MSME actors in implementing the green policy, the Ngawi Regency government needs to pay more attention to the condition of MSME resources, which include HR, financial, and technical aspects. Incentives in terms of financial and non-financial assistance can be an instrument for strengthening MSME resources.",

To meet this challenge, teachers' perceptions of their knowledge base for teaching force concepts should be probed because perceptions act as windows into teachers' practices. This study, therefore, explored physics teachers' perceptions of their knowledge base for teaching force concepts. Science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) frameworks were used to develop a questionnaire based on a 5-point Likert scale administered to 100 physical science teachers who were randomly selected from 54 schools in five districts in Lesotho. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. The results suggest that, even though teachers reported positive views about their knowledge base, there is no correlation between sub-components of curricular knowledge. It is concluded that teachers should build the curricular knowledge by participating in collaborative activities. It is, therefore, recommended that studies that probe teachers' actual knowledge of PCK constructs are executed, so that appropriate information is available when planning professional development activities targeting teachers' PCK.",

This study aimed to examine the extent to which students' attitude towards science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) contributes to 21st century learning skills. Data were collected from 779 students from three primary schools and two secondary schools with the S-STEM questionnaire. Quantitative data were analyzed with structural equation modelling. The results revealed that: (1) students' science attitude, and engineering and technology attitude had positive effects on 21st century learning skills; (2) students' science attitude and mathematics attitude positively affected 21st century learning skills indirectly through the mediating role of technology and engineering attitude; and (3) the school year partially played a moderating role. The finding highlights the importance of valuing STEM attitude across disciplines. In particular, students' engineering and technology attitude is more conducive to improving students' 21st century learning skills. It also suggests the need to pay attention to the changing effect of STEM attitude on 21st century learning skills driven by the school year.",

        "description":"The recent expansion of virtual exchange (VE) in lieu of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing advance of technology has resulted in considerably larger numbers of VE participants for those in certain areas and contexts, yet not all would-be participants have been so fortunate. In some regions and in various contexts, challenges in VE implementation have resulted in disadvantaged populations in terms of underrepresentation and marginalization in global VE networks. To illuminate such challenges, a mixed-method approach was utilized in the current study, beginning with a global survey to elucidate reasons for underrepresentation in terms of political, governmental, institutional, administrative, technological, pedagogical, cultural and personal challenges. Thereafter, semi-structured interviews with instructors, administrators, and educational decision makers were conducted to gain further insights. Although VE is now well established as an impactful mode of studying abroad, various region-specific challenges remain. We conclude with recommendations on how to overcome the challenges especially in those underrepresented regions and populations.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the PCK of science teachers with different teaching experiences and examine the effects of teachers' PCK on students' achievement and attitudes toward science. A mixed methods research design was used for the study. Participants were science teachers and their students from two middle schools. Interviews, observation forms, achievement tests, and attitude scales were used as instruments for data collection. Data were collected and analyzed using content analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings obtained from the quantitative and qualitative data showed some significant differences between teachers' PCKs according to their teaching experience. The results also showed that the PCK of a teacher with the least experience was lower than that of the other two experienced science teachers. The results indicated that experienced teachers who developed PCKs did not significantly impact student achievement and attitudes. Educational implications and recommendations for further studies are also provided.",

Therefore, the modeling and assessment of students' understanding of specific scientific concepts is important to promote students' problem-solving ability, as it can find students' understanding difficulties and explore breakthrough strategies accordingly. Inspired by the theory of knowledge integration and combined with the situational characteristics of science education in China, this study established a conceptual framework about buoyant force, which was applied to model students' different understandings of it. And based on the established framework, an assessment of buoyant force was designed and tested among 622 Chinese lower-secondary school students. Through the analysis of the test data and the interview outcomes, it was found that students' understanding of buoyant force could be divided into three levels of knowledge integration including novice, intermediate, and expert. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that an emphasis on the nature of buoyant force can be an effective strategy to help students achieve a deeper conceptual understanding of buoyant force, leading to a more integrated knowledge structure.",

This study investigated the knowledge structure regarding redox reaction from 459 Grade 10 students. The pool of 15 redox reaction concepts was developed by content analysis, questionnaire survey, and interview. Six initial competing models with 15 concepts were identified via exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and paper-pencil test. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test and modify the six competing models according to the rating data of the students. As a result, six modified models fit the data well. However, the high inter-factor correlations indicate that the two- and three-factor models are the students' knowledge structures of redox reaction. The two-factor model is comprised of two distinct but correlated factors: the process of redox reaction and metrology. The three-factor model is comprised of three factors: the process of redox reaction, reaction ability, and metrology. The finding inflects the abstract relationships between the concepts related to redox reaction in students' minds.",

The current study discusses the impact of the flipped and blended methods of instruction on students' creative thinking skills in comparison to the traditional instructional method. A quasi-experimental approach was used to assess three capabilities of 10th grade students in mathematics: fluency, flexibility, and originality. The participants, 540 students from private schools, were divided into one control group and two experimental groups. One of the experimental groups followed the blended learning strategy while the other used the flipped learning strategy. Students were given a 30-question test to assess their mathematical creative thinking skills. The scores' mean of the experimental groups was remarkably higher than the control group. Moreover, the performance of the experimental group that followed the flipped learning strategy was better than the group that used the blended strategy. This study informs educational institutions designing and producing educational virtual activities like 3D videos, helps them overcome the traditional classroom limitations, and investigates the role of these methods in enhancing students' mathematical creative thinking skills.",

The purpose of this study was to diagnose the prevalence of selected misconceptions about the particulate nature of matter among preservice primary school teachers and to compare the findings with the results of lower-secondary learners. The participants in the study were 197 pre-service primary school teachers and 170 ninth graders. The multiple-choice diagnostic test was developed to collect data. In the analysis of the test results, the paired difference test and Pearson's chi-square independence test for the contingency table were used. Frequency analysis was performed for individual questions in the test and percentages were calculated. The results obtained with primary school teacher trainees demonstrate the existence of a number of misconceptions similar to those observed with ninth graders; some misconceptions were observed to even be present significantly more frequently among pre-service primary school teachers. This study confirmed that age maturity and mere knowledge of scientific concepts such as atoms, molecules, etc. do not have to be sufficient to allow students to better understand the particulate nature of matter.",

A sample of 328 grade eleven students was selected using cluster random sampling. Two different study groups; the experimental and control groups, were composed and exposed to the guided inquiry and demonstration methods of teaching chemistry experiments respectively. The Non-equivalent control group research design was employed with instruction lasting six weeks. Data on pre-test and posttest attitudes were collected using a 25-itemattitude towards teaching and learning chemistry through experiment survey. Comparisons of mean attitude scores were made between the experimental and control groups, and between the pre-test and post-test for each group. The Mann-Whitney U test analyses indicated a higher mean attitude score for the control group. However, the difference in the mean scores was not statistically significant. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test analyses indicated statistically significant differences between the pre-test and post-test attitude mean scores for both independent groups. These outcomes show that both methods of teaching chemistry through experiments enhance students' attitudes to essentially the same extent.

Our findings also show that first-generation college students, financially disadvantaged students, female students, and Black and African American students who take IVE courses benefit more than their demographic counterparts who don't. Taken together, these results confirm that IVE is both a high impact practice and a pedagogy that offers significant benefits to under-resourced students and students who have historically been underrepresented in global learning activities.",

        "description":"Learners underperform in stoichiometry as they lack conceptual reasoning of the underlying concepts and the ability to solve stoichiometric problems. Therefore, it was necessary to determine if there is a statistical correlation between problem-solving skills and conceptual reasoning in stoichiometry and if so, whether one can significantly predict the other. The theoretical framework is the cognitive load theory (CLT). This theory expects teachers to know where to focus their teaching and how to assess their learners' work to avoid unnecessary overloading of the working memory, which might affect their performance. The explanatory sequential mixed-method research design was employed with 410 grade 11 Physical Science learners in their intact classes. The participants wrote the learner achievement test (LAT) and responded to a semi-structured interview. The learners' test scores were then used to run a statistical test. The Pearson correlation and regression showed that the justifications given by learners for choosing correct or incorrect multiple-choice options were not due to chance, and the results of the learner interviews supported the learners' performance in the test. Moreover, the findings indicated that there was a positive correlation between problem-solving skills and conceptual reasoning where statistically, conceptual reasoning predicted learners' problem-solving skills using regression analysis.",

For the experimental activity of 'determining temperature changes using the meridian altitude of the sun,' information regarding experimental behaviors, thinking aloud, discourse, and retrospective interview data were collected and analyzed. A model was derived and utilized for experimental activities to analyze peer scaffolding, wherein students internally structured their experiences with the experimental activities. The results indicated that students utilized seven means of peer scaffolding: 'demonstrating', 'assisting', 'monitoring', 'posing', 'questioning', 'explaining', and 'suggesting'. Three types of peer scaffolding emerged: task completion-, model elaboration-, and learning support-oriented scaffolding. Each type differed in purpose, main mean, and major explanation details. Additionally, this study has observed the level of the model for the experimental activities and the time that had been provided to understand the experimental procedure influenced the three peer scaffolding types. These outcomes indicate that providing ample time to students independently structure the experimental procedure and supporting other students during experimental activities are essential. Moreover, providing assistance to students in focusing on observable phenomena by reducing the cognitive load required to process the experimental procedure is crucial.",

The study showed that STEM undergraduates and those who attended a course in statistics interpreted the infographic better. However, between 46% and 65% of those misinterpreted the infographic which indicates that changes are needed in statistics education to improve statistical literacy. Concerning demographic characteristics, somewhat better results were achieved by the American students, while gender had weak significance. Students whose interpretations were more successful perceived their knowledge and use of statistics as better. An extremely low number of students, 7.5%, disagreed that statistics is often misused, while only 14.2% trusted the research results presented in the media.

Based on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 education dataset, the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model identifies and explains the factors. The study finds that there are 11 most influential common features in China and 9 in the United States. The two countries have 5 common features, the meta-cognition assess credibility, summarizing text ability, PISA test difficulty perception, science learning time, and school lessons numbers per week. Family economic status also impacts personal ability. Regarding subject characteristics, attitude towards failure is the determinant of reading and mathematics. Cooperation and competition among students help to improve mathematics and science. Furthermore, the comparison between the two countries concludes that self-awareness, family economic status, and school learning environment are critical to personal ability. The study concludes that it is necessary to foster a sense of healthy competition among students at the school level and provide more attention to students with low family socioeconomic status to improve their abilities.",

The implementation of cooperative learning could be useful for improving teaching. The aim of this research was to examine the effect of cooperative learning (specifically the jigsaw technique) on students' achievement in physics, metacognitive awareness, and motivation. An experiment with parallel groups (experimental and control) was carried out with 92 seventh-grade students (in lower secondary education). Jigsaw technique was implemented in the experimental group, while the control group was taught using teacher-directed teaching method. Students' physics achievement, metacognitive awareness and motivation were measured using knowledge tests and questionnaires (before and after the experiment). Statistical analysis included calculations of Cronbach's Alpha coefficient, performance of the Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. The research results showed that the implementation of jigsaw technique in physics classes significantly improved students' physics achievement, metacognitive awareness, and motivation. Therefore, it can be suggested that this technique is beneficial in lower secondary physics education, and it can be recommended to implement the jigsaw technique in everyday school practice.",

Their poor writing skills are also associated with a lack of teacher guidance The tasks given by teachers are sometimes beyond their capabilities. Students are not accustomed to writing long academic papers. As a result, they do not enjoy writing essays, and they are not confident in their writing skills. This research is intended to collect and analyze articles related to Academic Writing Courses and the teaching of academic writing at colleges. The design used is a literature review, articles are collected using search engines such as JStore, Academic One file, Sciencedirect, and Proquest. The criteria for the articles used are those published in 2008-2021. Based on the articles collected the result is that academic writing centers (AWC) does not guarantee better grades for the students. Instead, it is time to help them fulfill their needs: i) Becoming self-directed; ii) Independent writers; iii) Building the confidence of writers; and iv) Helping writers with advanced writing tasks.",

The contribution of this research is as a reference and input to develop the creativity of critical thinking of the quoters. The method used is listening and analyzing the journal's contents as a source of data; critically identifying the parts of the journal containing quotations, direct quotations, and paraphrasing of the theories being referenced. The results of the critical review show several weaknesses, including several quotes that are not accompanied by relevant data and references, errors in citing reference sources. In addition, quotations or paraphrases have paid attention to the integrity of meaning with several techniques, namely complete and partial paraphrasing techniques. Partial is divided into two; according to the research formulation, the theory is paraphrased and several points of the combined theory are paraphrased because they are closely related and complementary. This critical review implies that it is a follow-up study to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of a scientific article based on relevant theories, studies, and previous research results.",

        "description":"The COVID-19 crisis forced most educational institutes worldwide to deliver teaching via the internet. However, neither teachers nor students were prepared for such an abrupt disruption. Specifically, many teachers lacked the appropriate digital competencies to effectively teach online. So, what are the necessary digital competencies that teachers should have in order to effectively teach online via the internet? This study proposes a framework of such digital competencies for online teaching that outlines the essential digital competencies needed for online teachers to effectively implement the Online Teaching Preparation, Deliver, Evaluation, and Revision (Online Teaching PDER) framework. Based on this framework, online teachers can self-reflect on their digital competencies in a systematic way and then take appropriate training to enhance their skills. Also, educational institutes can be informed by this framework to prepare the appropriate syllabus and educational material for educating future teachers as well as training inservice teachers.",

The effectiveness and efficacy of the Learning Management System (LMS) represents a crucial component in such an environment. In light of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and the Diffusion of Innovation Model (DOI), this study aimed to scrutinize the perceived efficacy of Moodle as a learning management system as seen by instructors. It further aimed to reveal the degree to which instructors were actually using Moodle in the educational process in Jordan. A descriptive survey methodology was used for data collection purposes and statistical analysis revealed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence have significant impacts on the perceived efficacy of Moodle. Moreover, the results revealed that the actual use was highly driven by perceived efficacy, whereas it was moderately influenced by facilitating conditions. The effect of instructors' gender, experience, and field of study, as moderating factors, were also investigated.",

A total of 181 students from three public universities that applied the online flipped classroom approach participated in the study. The finds reveal that students did very well in their self-management through the online flipped classroom. They were methodical, self-disciplined, and confident in their ability to search out new information. Furthermore, they were systematic in organizing their learning activity. The students were able to access the lecture notes on their own time, which increased their understanding of the material. The synchronous aspect of the flipped classroom had a positive correlation with student desire for learning and self-control. This suggests that the more students are exposed to synchronous activities, the greater their desire for learning and their self-control in the process of learning. Therefore, synchronous experiences are essential for students to be self-controlled and for them to have a desire for learning",

The purpose of this study was to explore student and lecturer views, experiences, and beliefs on using social networks for teaching and learning in a rural context. Utilizing the mixed-methods approach, a questionnaire and face-to-face interviews were utilized to collect data. Stratified random sampling and purposive sampling were utilized to identify respondents currently using social networks in their teaching and learning. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software was used to analyze the quantitative data while content analysis was used to identify emerging themes from the collected data. We conclude that while students were very positive towards the use of social networks in class, not all lecturers have embraced the use of this technology in teaching and learning and have some apprehensive that social networks might disrupt learning. We recommend developing monitoring mechanisms to mitigate any negative use of social networks for learning and teaching and vigorous lecturer advocacy programs to develop positive attitudes and to encourage lecturers to embrace the use of social network platforms in teaching. We further recommend developing standards and procedures for using social network platforms in teaching and providing the tools to integrate them into learning and teaching. The impact of using these platforms need to be considered by designers and those who implement them in learning and teaching.",

This research was conducted at Universitas Negeri Padang and started with a needs analysis of 168 students to develop a blended learning prototype. The prototype was tested on six experts, six lecturers, and six students in the limited test and 50 students at the dissemination stage. The data collection instrument used observation and questionnaires. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis. The results show that the validity of the blended learning support system to improve the digital literacy of preservice teachers was in the very valid category. All indicators from the experts were higher than indicators from the lecturers. Although each support system was assessed differently by the experts and the lecturers, overall the digital literacy components in each support system were declared valid. The results of this study contribute to the development of digital literacy for preservice teachers by integrating digital literacy skills into a blended learning support system that includes lesson plans, content, and activities on the LMS as well as digital literacy-based assessments.",

To examine how power is communicated online by instructors and how receptive (or not) students are to this, I examined four online graduate seminars using two analytical tools: community of inquiry (COI) theory and McCroskey and Richmond's (1983) five bases of power framework. To communicate power, instructors drew from expert, referent, and legitimate power bases to cultivate teaching and social presence and to help students acquire cognitive presence. Direct instruction, feedback, and tools such as the syllabus and discussion board helped instructors communicate power.",

In order to increase student mobilisation and integration, it is important to know the potential challenges students from underrepresented continents are likely to face in an environment with severe sociocultural differences. This study examined experiences of 7 international students from East Africa studying in a larger city in Norway. Data was collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews, and grounded theory was applied. Analyses of the data resulted in the development of a process model, illustrating three main phases international students went through. The initial phase shows the financial, social, and emotional challenges that students faced. In the transitional phase, they found social support from students in similar situations, whereas in the settling phase they tended to mobilize individual and social resources for coping. The results are discussed in light of previous research and concluded with recommendations for higher education institutions.",

As such, the perspectives of local students toward socialization with international students remain less explored. Designed as a survey-based case study with 17 local students at a university in Ontario, this study sought to understand the perspectives of local students on how to improve socialization between the two groups. Additionally, this study investigated how local students conceptualized their experiences of multiculturalism and multilingualism at their university, considering the importance of diversity for the development of intercultural knowledge and intercultural relationships. Findings suggest that local students considered their university to be multicultural/multilingual primarily based on the availability of cultural events and different languages being spoken on campus. Moreover, local students ascribed much importance to socialization with international students but expected the university to assume a more formal role in developing structured opportunities for the two groups to come together.",

We used phenomenological research methodology to understand the mechanisms behind internationalization in each setting, and a research design that allowed us to engage in a detailed analysis of the decisions made by some of the key university figures in each country. The findings will be useful for higher education institutions that seek to better understand the myriad ways that internationalization goals can become operationalized, and the impact of particular goals and strategies in two contrasting settings. By illustrating one way that internationalization as a broad trend becomes implemented in local contexts and filtered down for use in six distinct institutions, this paper adds a new intercultural perspective to the existing literature.",

In recent years, the exploitation of ICTs in teaching and learning has been expanded in developing countries too. This study has made an attempt to explore the opportunities and challenges of using ICTs in English language teaching (ELT) in higher education in Nepal, a developing country in Asia. The English language teachers and students from two different colleges were the informants in this study, and interview and focus group discussion were used as the research methods. The study concluded that ICTs were useful for the participants in their teaching and learning activities mainly for accessing learning resources, preparing and presenting their lessons, and for conducting collaborative learning activities. However, it was found that the informants were not satisfied with their utilization of ICTs in teaching and learning of English. Access to ICT tools, and the skills needed to use ICTs were the main problems for them in the integration of ICTs in ELT. Therefore, these constraints need to be minimized to improve the integration of ICTs in ELT in higher education in Nepal.",

We applied a qualitative research design and used interviews, a focus group, and reflection papers for data collection. We found that Chinese undergraduate students focused on social behaviors and attitudes. They used comparison as a tool to make sense of new experiences. Their sensemaking process shifted from simple to complex concepts, and guided learning helped them understand complex social issues related to public health in the U.S. They did not consider learning related to public health knowledge, English language, or life skills as cultural learning.",

        "description":"Intuition is one of the main factors that drive our everyday decision-making which happens quickly and unconsciously. Individuals often rely on the use of intuition to solve either simple or complex problems. The purpose of this research study is to further break down an individual's thinking processes by understanding how different groups of individuals utilize intuition to make effective decisions. Major, gender, college year of classification, and ethnicity were the main factors analyzed in the study to identify if these factors have a significant impact on the use of each intuition type. The data collected from a survey distributed to undergraduate students at Purdue University (n=1109) was used to build a regression model for each intuition type: inferential (p = 3.524x10[superscript -11]), affective (p = 2.200x10[superscript -16]), holistic big picture (p = 1.755x10[superscript -4]), and holistic abstract (p = 3.195x10[superscript -7]). The results showed that inferential intuition was influenced by gender and ethnicity, while all four studied factors major, gender, ethnicity, and college year of classification have an impact on affective intuition. The holistic big-picture intuition model indicated that only gender and college influenced the use of this intuition type. In addition, gender, major, and ethnicity were the main drivers for holistic abstract intuition usage. The study suggests that intuition usage is driven by all four factors with gender as the main factor that have an impact on all four of the types of intuition. These findings provide a deeper insight into the main factors that influence the use of intuition.",

The system was also helpful in teaching the students to develop an impactful resumé and improve job interview skills (through mock interviews). The course ended with the development of business communication case studies written and taught by students. Some of the students published their case studies in a UK-based case publishing house.

Methods: The survey data were collected from 330 preschool and primary school (84 males, M[subscript age] = 38.3, SD = 9.14) teachers using a convenience sampling method. Results: The two-step cluster analysis revealed two distinct profiles. The first profile, &quot;high psychological resources, no burnout risk,&quot; was characterized by absent symptoms of burnout and increased levels of well-being, self-control, and positive emotionality. The second profile, &quot;moderate psychological resources, mild burnout,&quot; was associated with medium levels of well-being, self-control, and positive emotionality accompanied by mild burnout. Our findings highlighted that cluster one had a significantly higher score for the facilitator role and cluster two for the expert and coach roles. Additionally, teachers with less professional experience were more likely to belong to cluster one, considering their adequate skills in digital literacy. Conclusions: These findings provide new insights into the explanation of teacher burnout and the design of intervention programs.",

Included in the study were 296 children enrolled in independent kindergartens, who were within the five-year-old age group and were from similar socioeconomic families. Among them, 159 attended face-to-face and 137 attended online classes. At the beginning of their formal education, the Social Adaptation Skills Scale (SASS) was administered to the children in both groups as a pre-test. At the end of the trimester, the SASS was repeated as a posttest. A significant difference was found between the face-to-face education group and the online education group, in favor of the former, in terms of the social adaptation sub-factor of the SASS. Furthermore, the social incompatibility sub-factor scores of the face-to-face education group were significantly lower than those of the children in the online education group.",

        "author":["Evans, Nancy"],
        "description":"In computer technology, statistics, and business courses that I have taught over the past decade, students have worked in groups/teams. I assumed students communicated with teammates within the Learning Management System (LMS). In 2017, I was surprised to discover students were using GroupMe. To help me understand the attraction, I signed up for a GroupMe account. I was underwhelmed with its purpose but understood the ease of the application. I was also learning more about Slack, thinking it was a much better tool for communication and collaboration, and realizing that communicating within the LMS was not ideal, even awkward, and not real world. However, Slack was not readily available for student use, so when our institution introduced Microsoft Teams in 2020, I began exploring using Microsoft Teams for teamwork/projects because it is a real-world tool that students will likely use/encounter after college. I have been using Microsoft Teams consistently since Fall 2020. Using Microsoft Teams moves students from conceptual to applicable knowledge related to teamwork, communication, and even leadership skills. Microsoft Teams can supplement any content/course project. Requiring students to use Microsoft Teams as it would be used in the workplace allows teams to choose when they meet to collaborate, manage their &quot;channel,&quot; and ultimately create their project. All the work leading up to the final deliverable is archived in one space accessible by instructor (manager) as would be in the real world. The assessment(s) takes on a level of authenticity that is missing with a traditional LMS. In this reflective essay, I will show how Microsoft Teams supports authentic assessment while engaging students in a real-world technology that adds to their post-undergraduate toolkit and future success.",

This study provides an insight into the needs of students in adjusting to online teaching. This study presents the methodological design of the course &quot;Industrial Hygiene I,&quot; part of a technology-based engineering bachelor's degree from Universidad Católica del Norte (Chile). Once the theoretical framework was established, three surveys were designed throughout the course to measure students' perceptions of the access, use, and utility of digital tools used in online teaching during the pandemic. Thirty-five students participated in this quantitative study. Following a data analysis, it was observed that 46% of students use their cell phones to access virtual classes and more than 50% are dissatisfied with the internet connection; therefore, it was necessary to adapt the learning methodology. After that, more than 50% of the students said that they preferred a flipped classroom over traditional methodology. In addition, the quality of the course was not affected by using the internet (60%), and the methodology generates advantages in terms of learning (72%). These findings have several implications in both the design of different subjects in the engineering degree and the practice of different learning methods. Future hybrid teaching designs require taking up the challenges of both improving technology-supported teaching and assessing competence in the same context.",

        "description":"The realities of the 21st century have led professors and lecturers to renew their learning assessment practices so that they are more adapted to and contextualized in the current professional world. Despite advances in teaching and learning, assessment methods may still deviate from practice in authentic contexts. Although some instructors are already familiar with more authentic assessments, most are accustomed to using exams as standard practices to test students' achievement of course objectives and essays to prepare students for research or written argumentation. Nevertheless, such typical assessments often lack authenticity and do not develop the full potential of students' 21st-century learning or literacy skills such as communication, creativity, or working with technologies. The past decade has seen the beginnings of a broader reflection on teaching, learning, and evaluating with technologies, including more authentic assessments. In this reflective essay we present how technologies make it possible to diversify assessment methods, resulting in enhanced authenticity and development of 21st-century learning and literacy skills. Authentic assessment methods with technologies (e.g., recorded video presentations, explanatory interviews with descriptive assessment grids, PechaKucha presentations, blog posts, social media and e-portfolios) are illustrated with examples from several disciplines. We also explain how proposing a number of methods to students for the same assessment may help answer their various needs and preferences without increasing instructors' grading load. Furthermore, we discuss how diversifying assessment methods with technologies often results in a transformation of assessment modalities. Beyond assessments as an evaluation of knowledge and/or skills at a fixed time, authentic assessments with technologies may become continuous or iterative processes with multiple feedback occasions from instructors, thereby combining synchronous interactions and/or discussions with asynchronous reflections to improve students' involvement and active learning.",

To help students collaborate more effectively, I have used Google Docs, a free, online word-processing program accessible using almost any internet-connected device. Assessments that include real-world application problems are composed in Google Docs and shared with students via links. Google Docs has proven to be more efficient than pencil-and-paper assessment, encourages greater collaboration within student groups than is possible with tools embedded in a learning management system, and provides opportunities to give students just-in-time instruction and examine student metacognition, all of which are foundational for authentic assessment. Post-assessment grading is rapid, and corrected documents with instructor feedback can be easily shared with students. Students have adapted readily to the platform and have learned on their own how to use the software beyond my original conception. I describe how I have used Google Docs successfully in a molecular biology course, offer considerations for grading and distributing corrections, and report on students' perceptions of the assessments themselves.",

        "description":"A common challenge for clinical training programs is helping students apply academic knowledge to clinical settings. Authentic assessment using simulation offers a unique approach to bridging this gap. Miller's pyramid provides a framework for competency-based education that integrates formative assessment and feedback at each stage of student learning. A multi-part assignment that builds from gathering data following a specific protocol (i.e., basic level), moves through interpretation of data (i.e., intermediate level), and then using that data to direct next steps (i.e., advanced level) scaffolds student learning toward clinical practice. Review of past student assignments indicated better performance on intermediate and advanced skills when using a video-based, multicomponent assignment as compared to the original assignment design. Incorporating video components allows simulation of rare clinical populations, while also replicating current telepractice service provision. By simulating patient interactions, the instructor replicates real world challenges, allowing the students to demonstrate in-the-moment problem solving and clinical responsiveness.",

The purpose of this study is to determine the status of libraries in schools and to take the opinions of teachers towards school libraries. For this purpose, a case study design has been utilized in the current research and observation and interview techniques have been employed. In the research, the libraries of all schools in a city centre have been observed. Through stratified purposeful sampling and criterion sampling methods, interviews were carried out with teachers working in school libraries. The research data were analysed via content analysis. As a result of the research, it was determined that two-thirds of the schools had libraries. Besides, it was revealed that the capacity of the school libraries is inadequate due to the limited physical space of the libraries in schools. Although there were computers and the internet in libraries, digitalization was determined to be limited. It was also shown that there were mostly classical works and the libraries covered inadequate number of contemporary books. When examining the genres of the books in libraries, it may be said that there were novels and story book by a majority, referring to a limited variety of genres. It has been concluded that students can not effectively use school libraries as expected due to by virtue of the limited library facilities. Accordingly, in order to ensure the effective use of school libraries by students, the physical conditions of the libraries should be improved as well as the variety and quality of the documents should be increased.",

        "description":"Face-to-face education in many countries was suspended due to the global pandemic of COVID-19 declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2020. The pandemic led to new searches in the academic process, and distance education gained importance in Turkey. However, the Catch-Up Education Program in Primary Schools was not taken into account while it was stated that educational services provided in resource rooms within the scope of inclusive education were to be continued via distance education. Accordingly, it was aimed to examine the views of classroom teachers who had implemented IYEP before on whether IYEP could be performed via distance education and to make an evaluation based on the first-hand experiences of implementers. To that end, the research was conducted with 22 participants in accordance with the ethical principles. Ethics committee approval was obtained for the study with the decision of Agri Ibrahim Cecen University Scientific Research Ethics Committee dated 08.09.2021 and numbered 206. All of the participants are experienced classroom teachers who have experience with IYEP and have performed distance education. The research was performed with the phenomenological design of qualitative research designs. The data were collected with a semi-structured interview form, and the interview questions were finalized after having been reviewed by two academics who are subject-matter experts. The data obtained in the research were subjected to descriptive analysis individually by the researchers and evaluated. It was concluded that IYEP could be continued via distance education when the face-to-face education could not be performed, but there were several concerns about the matter at hand. The participants often mentioned that distance education could not substitute for and be as effective as face-to-face education. Nevertheless, despite certain disadvantages, considering the contributions of IYEP in face-to-face education, it was found that distance education could be utilized so that shortcomings in learning would not accumulate and extend to the next year and that experiencing IYEP via distance education could provide ideas about future practices.",

Data were gathered using an online survey aimed at parents or caregivers of young people aged 4-18. A total of 1009 adults completed the caregiver survey. Resulting data were analyzed using SPSS. Results suggest a high degree of openness to SDE. The data also elucidate several questions and concerns that parents and caregivers have about the approach. Data also highlighted differing perceptions of and attitudes towards SDE as a function of race.

Professionals in the field have been improving existing practices to prevent and intervene in young children's challenging behaviour. To this end, many social-emotional learning curriculums are developed and put into practice. One curriculum that supports children's social-emotional learning during the preschool period is the Second Step Early Learning. The present study looked into the practical experiences of preschool teachers implementing the second step social-emotional learning curriculum. The study group consists of 13 preschool teachers who have received educator training in this learning curriculum and implemented it at schools. The teachers were asked questions about the curriculum's general qualities, its effects on the children's development levels, and their professional development. According to the study results, all teachers stated that the second step curriculum positively contributed to children's emotional and behavioural reactions. It helped them in class management and implementation, such behaviour as having confidence, asking for help, taking responsibility, and taking responsibility-sharing improved. In addition, expressing that they observed differences in hindering anger and in-class problem-solving processes, teachers emphasised that the children were more understanding and polite to each other, especially in free-time activities. Their interaction was healthier than before, and their listening and attention spans increased. Overall, the findings show preschool teachers' experience in implementation. They recommended the curriculum to their colleagues, claiming that it contributed to their professional development.",

During the data analysis stage, frequency and percentage values for the variables were determined. Correlation, simple regression, and multiple regression analyses were then performed. The results revealed that although teacher candidates' reading and scientific text reading rates were insufficient, their attitudes toward scientific literacy and scientific text reading were &quot;good.&quot; The attitude toward reading scientific materials and the sub-dimensions of scientific literacy were found to be positively and statistically correlated. Along with the &quot;habits of mind&quot; and &quot;meta-cognition and self-direction&quot; sub-dimensions, it was also noted that scientific literacy is a statistically significant predictor of attitude toward reading scientific materials.

        "description":"STEM education (based on the integration of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines) has recently been an integral part of education system and curriculum in many countries aiming to be more technologically competitive in this age of innovation. While the importance of STEM education has gradually increasing in education system with the complexities of today's world, revealing pre-service teachers' mind maps on STEM education and preparing them for STEM education is a crucial issue since the readiness of the teachers affects the quality of education. In this context, the aim of this study is to reveal pre-service science and mathematics teachers' mind maps on STEM Education through STEM images. The research group consists of 6 pre-service teachers (3 of them are pre-service science teachers (PST) and 3 of them are pre-service mathematics teachers (PMT)) who are 4th grade level students from a public university in Istanbul, Turkey. In current research, case study design was used. The data of study were collected through drawings and focus group discussion. The data were analyzed with thematic analysis through Integrated Teaching (IT) Framework. As a result, 41 codes about pre-service teachers' mind maps on STEM education were determined under 14 categories of 5 themes of IT Framework. The results of this study are crucial in terms of having potential to guide educational policy makers, curriculum developers, researchers and in-service and pre-service teachers about STEM education.",

Consisting of qualitative and quantitative methods, the mixed research method has been adopted to acquire the required data. Qualitative phase the education administration systems applied in OECD member countries, documents and reports available in the literature were evaluated. To reach wider masses, an online survey aiming at collecting the views of teachers and administrators was carried out by using the quantitative phase of the mixed method. This study has laid it bare that the principles of good governance, common sense, transparency, accountability, participation, democracy, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability stand forefront in educational systems that adopt the participatory education boards model. Eventually, a board/commission oriented local education administration model has been designed and developed as an alternative for the Turkish educational administration system.",

In this process, the person learns the basic values and norms of the society in which he lives, as well as the skills necessary to sustain his life. This learning takes place through parents, siblings, relatives, neighbors, peers, teachers, and other people with whom the person interacts, although their levels of influence may differ. The transformation of a baby into a human depends on being given the opportunity to live in a human community and learn to be human. As a result of research on children like Victor, Kamala, Shamdev who were abandoned in the forest and isolated at home like Isabella, Anna, Genie and Danielle, it has been observed that individuals who were deprived of the opportunity to learn to be human could not speak, make strange sounds, lack human feelings, and could not fully perform even simple physical activities such as sitting, standing and walking on two legs. More interestingly, efforts to humanize these people have not been successful enough, with the exception of Isabella. Similar results have emerged in studies conducted on children living in orphanages in different countries of the world, especially in Romania, in case the interaction is not humane, it has been seen that it is not enough to meet the basic needs of children such as food, drink and shelter.",

        "description":"Perfectionism is defined as the tendency to have high goals and standards for one's self (Flett et al., 1989). Setting high and even unrealistic goals in education can be negative for students as this can cause anxiety, procrastination, and low self-efficacy. The present study aims to determine the relationship between academic perfectionism and research anxiety levels for preservice teachers and to compare both of these with variables such as gender, year of study, department, primary department preference on the university exam, and career plan, to demonstrate the links between these variables. The participants are 469 undergraduate students who study at the Aydin Adnan Menderes University Faculty of Education. The Academic Perfectionism Scale (Odaci et al., 2017), Research Anxiety Scale (Büyüköztürk, 1997), and a Personal Information Form were used as data collecting tools. The results have shown that female participants have significantly higher idealization scores than male participants. Early childhood education and art education students have significantly higher comparison scores than music education students. Fourth-year students have significantly higher scores on research anxiety than first-year students. Participants whose primary department preferences on their university entrance exams were not their present departments have significantly higher research anxiety scores than the participants whose first choice was the department where they study. Participants who plan to become academics have significantly higher idealization scores than participants who want to do a job outside of their fields of study. Participants who want to be academics have significantly lower research anxiety scores than those who want to be teachers and those who want to do a job outside of their fields of study. In addition, there is a significant medium relationship between the participants' self-doubt subscale scores and their research anxieties. Moreover, there is a significant but weak relationship between participants' comparison subscale scores, academic perfectionism total scores, and their research anxieties. The results were discussed in the light of the literature.",

The study was carried out with a convergent/parallel mixed-method research design. The study group consisted of 51 second-grade primary school students and their teacher. All research data were collected over a period of four weeks. In the quantitative part of the research, a quasi-experimental design with pretest and posttest control groups was carried out. Quantitative data were obtained with an achievement test specifically prepared for the research. All quantitative data were statistically analyzed using t-test. The qualitative part of the data involved audio and video recordings of students' interactions, teacher's diaries, and semi-structured interview forms collected from 26 second-grade primary school students in the experimental group. Quantitative data were analyzed using content analysis. The results showed that the game-based learning method was more effective than the conventional method. Students better understood the place value concept with gamification. Moreover, they increased their interest and motivation toward mathematics courses. Despite all these findings and the fact that many students declared that they had fun in the process, some students still preferred more traditional methods of teaching. This study was carried out on a new mathematical concept on which the effect of game-based teaching had not been tested before. The highlight of this study is the effectiveness of game-based mathematics teaching on the place value concept.",

This study sought to identify which subsets of post-secondary student populations were most impacted by COVID-19-related public health measures. Data from a large global survey were used to identify levels of stress and quality of life. These data were assessed against demographic variables to identify correlational relationships and odds-ratios. Results highlighted that student who identified as being from a low-income family, having special needs or living with non-COVID health issues, and/or self-reported as female or other gender, reported higher increases in stress and greater decreases in quality of life. The implications of these findings suggest that post-secondary institutions can proactively identify at-risk students and support them through these challenges. Such practices may reduce the negative impacts that adversities have on stress levels and quality of life of these populations, and mitigate the negative consequences associated with decreased mental health and well-being.",

With this point of departure, in order to measure the effect of intervention related to the use of online speaking tasks and podcasts through Canvas, a one-group pretest-posttest was employed. Data regarding participants' public speaking anxiety before and after the treatment were collected through the PRPSA (Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety) scale. Additionally, speaking rubrics were used as assessment tools for scoring learners' pre and post oral performances. For more detailed information related to the participants' learning experiences and changes in their emotional states, participants were encouraged to join online forums on Canvas. The results showed that the use of digital platforms and podcasts had a significant role in boosting learners' confidence and public speaking performances through alleviating their anxiety.",

The study adapted quantitative research design and the participants were composed of 114 (68 females, 46 males) social studies teachers candidates who were selected via convenience sampling, a purposive sampling method. The data were collected using the &quot;Empathy level determination scale&quot; adapted to Turkish language by Kaya &amp; Çolakoglu (2015) developed by Lawrence, et al. (2004) and the &quot;Interpersonal communication skills scale&quot; adapted to Turkish language by Cikrikçi &amp; Çinpolat (2021) developed by Huang &amp; Lin (2018). The obtained data were analyzed via the IBM SPSS 25 statistics software using such test as; arithmetic means, standard deviation the KolmogorovSmirnov test, and the non-parametric Spearman's rho test. In the study, the correlation between the empathy levels and interpersonal communication skills of social studies teacher candidates was analyzed via correlation analysis. The results revealed that based on the empathy levels scores the social studies teacher candidates had high emotional reaction levels, low social skills. In addition, based on interpersonal communication skills levels scores, it was understood that their listening skill levels were the highest, followed by empathy and expression skill levels, and their social comfort skills were the lowest. To sum up, it was found out that there was a positive medium-level and significant correlation between the empathy levels and interpersonal communication skills of the social studies teacher candidates.",

The study is a quasi-experimental study with two experimental groups, and a control group. Science achievement test, intellectual risk-taking observation form and reflections of students were used to collect data. The first experimental group involved just gifted students, while experimental group two and control group involved non-gifted students. Experimental applications of the study lasted for eight weeks; two independent observers made observations for intellectual risk-taking behaviors of the participants during the applications in science course. In data analysis, ANOVA and t-test for dependent groups were used to analyze achievement and gain scores. Also, frequencies of the behaviors were represented, and content of reflections form was analyzed by identifying examples of intellectual risk-taking. The result showed that not only the animations including role models provided a positive effect on increasing the frequency of intellectual risk-taking behaviors, but also, they contributed to the learning of gifted and non-gifted fourth-grade students in science.",

        "description":"The study aimed to examine the effect of service trainings performed with eyes closed on the target service success percentage in volleyball players. The study was carried out with 22 volunteer male volleyball players. The volleyball half court was divided into six zones, each zone with a distance of 3 meters. In the trainings, the athletes were asked to serve 10 to each predetermined target zone with their eyes tied with a black eye patch. In the pre-test and post-test application, following the appropriate warm-up process, the athletes were asked to serve 20 to each zone with their eyes open. For the statistical analysis of the data obtained, SPSS 21.0 package program was used. In the evaluation of the data; descriptive statistics, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Friedman test were used. P&lt;0.05 was accepted for statistical significance. As a result of the applications performed, it was found that the difference between the pre-test and post-test service success percentages in the zones 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 was significant. In the post-test values, the percentages of the total serve into the zones were higher than the pre-test serve percentages. In the applications, the percentage distribution of the serve with eyes closed was found to be higher according to the days. The service percentage values in the first and last training sessions increased significantly. As a result, it was determined that the service trainings performed with eyes closed affected the success percentage in the service.",

From the perspectives of teaching and learning, this requires that learning contexts and pedagogies enable learning in such learning environments, roles, and processes where the pupil can think and act authentically, according to his or her age (National Core Curriculum 2014). Thus, in this article we examine the integration of subject teaching with topic teaching in the frameworks of sociocultural learning, functional linguistics, and authentic learning, in the contextual-pedagogical learning landscape, where the individuality of learners as well as timely learning support (scaffolding) in the zone of proximal development (Vygotsky 1978) enable the learning of content as part of interdisciplinary learning. The subject Finnish language and literature is defined as a interdisciplinary, practical, theoretical, and cultural subject (National Core Curriculum 2014) that requires cooperation with other subjects. This article will present a interdisciplinary approach to learning, where the thematic context created for learning gives meaning to the subject related content that must be learned, and where the ability to acquire the core content of the subject becomes a prerequisite for the processing of the theme or topic presented through the thematic context.",

        "description":"In caring professions, such as childcare and healthcare, empathy and narrative underpin important aspects of the emotional work of early childhood educators and nurses (Rogers, Jefferies &amp; Ng, 2022). Unfortunately, they are not given much attention in scholarly articles, but it is important for practitioners to understand them (Barton &amp; Garvis, 2019). This cross-disciplinary paper discusses the virtue of empathy from a philosophical stance, and its relationship to narrative when building shared understandings. There is a sense in which empathy and narrative are interdependent: storytelling helps to cultivate empathy in others, and empathy can be essential if we are to elicit and understand the stories that others have to tell. In fact, when it comes to eliciting and understanding the kinds of stories that are of particular interest for this paper (i.e., the personal stories to be told by young children participating in a research project, and those of patients in a healthcare setting), empathy tends to be especially important. As we argue, these examples drawn from early childhood education and care and healthcare serve to illustrate certain ways in which empathy, storytelling, and the development of shared understandings can be of deep significance; not only for researchers, educators and healthcare professionals, but also for senior administrative and public policy officials.",

For this purpose, students' mathematics literacy levels and the variables that affect their mathematics literacy levels were analyzed separately for 6 different countries at different proficiency levels. The population of the research is 519334 students from 72 countries, who have taken PISA 2015 exam. The sample that was determined according to the purpose of the study consists of a total of 34,565 students from Singapore, Japan, Norway, the USA, Turkey, and the Dominican Republic, which have been observed to be at different proficiency levels. In the first stage of the study, analyzes were performed using data mining prediction methods. At this stage, WEKA program was employed and M5P algorithm, which is one of the most common methods, was used. In the second stage of the research, the output variable was predicted from the input variables using Artificial Neural Networks methods to determine the extent to which decision trees obtained by M5P prediction method produce valid results. In the analyzes carried out in MATLAB program, the relationship between students' actual math literacy scores and literacy scores predicted from input variables was examined. As a result of the study, the variables that affect mathematics literacy were found to be the socio-economic status index for Singapore, Norway, the United States, Turkey, and Dominic. On the other hand, the variables influencing mathematics literacy for Japan were found to be mathematics learning time and father's education level. The consistency of the results was as follows: 86.10% for Singapore, 40.26% for Japan, 30.10% for Norway, 39.15% for America, 26.43% for Turkey, and 29.24 % for Dominic. As a result of the study, a differentiation was found among the variables that affect mathematics literacy of the countries at different proficiency levels.",

In Universitat de Barcelona learning was developed in a mixed form after the first COVID crisis, doing some activities online and others, like final semester exams, in person. During this phase, we carried out a questionnaire among students and teachers to know their opinion on assessment tasks during these semesters when online learning was more important than ever before. The results we have recollected show that professors and students do not always share the same point of view about the usefulness of different assessment strategies or how they are related to competence and skills achievements.",

Among the most common claims is the development of a more active and competency-based teaching oriented to the development of professional and personal skills. The university institution responds to these claims, sometimes in a timid way, but others by embarking on great transformation projects. A good example of this is the project to build the European Higher Education Area. However, the challenge of developing a more active and competency-based teaching faces numerous difficulties and barriers because many of the necessary changes are in sharp contrast with a status quo that has been consolidated over centuries. Difficulties and barriers include a lack of deep understanding (and even lack of acceptance) of some of the implications of the challenges we are facing, the learning of new techniques and tools that are not easy to use or unsuitable organizational structures. In this paper, we explore the nature of some of the challenges and review the difficulties and barriers most often mentioned by those who dare to try. Anyone who wants to address the challenges or has a responsibility to facilitate changes should be aware of all these difficulties and barriers.",

It is also subject to important differences among countries due to at least two factors: a) the particular fabric of the productive system of the country and b) the involvement of social actors (employers and unions) as well as the labor market relations and the balance between capital and work. Historical and comparative vocational education and training has deployed a series of analytical tools which have contributed to identify different patterns of existing vocational education systems. Some institutions have also worked in order to help vocational education advance in the past decades: among these, the European Center for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) has twice devised future scenarios in Vocational education, at the turn of the 20th century and right before the COVID-19 pandemics. The combination of current VET systems and suggested scenarios indicate that transformations are subject to negotiation among actors within countries (administration, employers, unions, teachers) and across countries; as well as subject to legitimation of decisions before the wider society. The sociology of conventions is a useful approach to analyse processes of negotiation and legitimation behind historical developments in VET systems; we suggest applying it to tackle current VET scenarios.",

        "description":"The aim of this article is to explore methodological issues related to scenarios on vocational education and training (VET). In particular, we examine the extent to which VET scenarios depend or build on generalizable future expectations (&quot;myths of the future&quot;) or archetypes of the future. The analysis builds on a review of recent methodological literature on scenario building applied to three international scenario studies on VET carried out by the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop), in which the authors were partly involved. We argue that neither scenarios on a particular issue (&quot;issue-based&quot;) nor on the future of a particular society (&quot;area-based&quot;) do justice to diverse VET systems but that scenarios in VET need to be &quot;institution-based&quot;. Hence, both the relative independence of VET systems and their path dependency -- especially in transnational projects -- need to be taken into account. In conclusion, we propose that the regular application of the scenario approach could be a useful complement to various other prospective approaches used to guide European employment and vocational training policies.",

        "author":["Broek, Simon"],
        "description":"This article intends to show that while the strong VET-labour market link has a long tradition in the Netherlands and likely maintains strong in the future, the dynamics that substantiate this link, especially in terms of institutional arrangement have seen a radical shift in the last decades. To explore the shifts we make use of Rageth and Renold (2020) model of three ideal types of linkages between education and employment system and the ideas concerning vocational and academic drift (Hippach-Schneider, 2014; Cedefop, 2017, 2020). This article is based on a literature review and case studies conducted in recent years on the Dutch system in the context of various (European) research projects. The article concludes that while the ownership for VET of the employment system decreased, the VET schools, due to the high level of autonomy and institutional capacities, were effectively able to install cooperation mechanism, joint delivery mechanisms in VET programmes and effective feedback mechanisms. The article shows that powerbalancing on VET content and supporting vocational drift does not necessarily require powerbalancing institutionally. In doing so, the article offers reflections to other countries' VET systems on how to balance education and labour market systems in the determination of the VET content and the governance of the VET system.",

        "description":"Building on the findings of Cedefop's research project 'The changing nature and role of VET in Europe' (2015-18), this article outlines the development and transformation of European VET over the last two decades. Exploring change from epistemological-pedagogical, institutional and socio-economic perspectives, the research not only illustrates the stability and path dependence of national VET systems (and how this sustains overall VET-diversity in Europe), it also demonstrates how the combination of incremental change and major societal and economic shocks shift the orientation of VET. This mapping and analysis of the past is used to outline possible scenarios for the future of vocational education and training in Europe. Three main scenarios - pluralistic, distinctive and special-purpose VET - illustrate the different directions VET can take in the next two decades and the challenges and opportunities involved in this. The final part of the article discusses the potential use of the scenario-approach and how this is taken forward in Cedefop's follow-up project on the Future of VET (2019-2022).",

The discussion sets out from the question how vocational or professional knowledge may be distinguished from other forms of knowledge and what philosophical and epistemological traits may underpin this distinction. Building on an analysis of 'intrinsic' and 'extrinsic' conceptions of knowledge, the paper explores how appropriate descriptors for the classification of theoretical or propositional knowledge as well as practical knowledge may be identified. As a result, a proposal for structuring vocational knowledge is presented. The concluding part addresses the question how the proposed categories may serve to characterise changes in vocational knowledge and explores the requirements for applying the conceptual framework in empirical studies on the effects of technological innovation and societal developments.",

        "description":"Vocational education and training (VET) systems around the world serve many aims, the most important of which can be grouped into three main aims: economic, social and educational aims. These different aims find their roots in different socio-cultural and economic contexts and their importance in the functioning of the systems evolves according to the times. Our contribution proposes a reflection on the centrality of the notion of aims in order to better understand and describe the functioning of VET systems. By adopting an exploratory approach based on discourse analysis, we will show the interest in using this notion to build a theoretical framework that facilitates international comparisons between VET systems and also the description of their evolution from the past to the future. To exemplify the relevance of this exploratory approach, the contribution will propose a description of the evolution of the Swiss VET system from 1880 up to 2030, based on the articulation of economic, social and educational aims.",

        "description":"This article describes a study of 149 preservice chemistry teachers' misconceptions of concepts related to a reduction-oxidation reaction. A mixed-method approach was used to obtain data through the ROXCI (Redox Concept Inventory) instrument and interviews. Result indicated that the highest misconceptions were for item number 10 (4.03% or only 6 of 149 students answered correctly) and the lowest misconception occurred on item number 1 (94.63% or 141 of 149 students answered correctly). These results were supported by the analysis of the interviews where the respondents produced misconceptions when explaining the process of electron transfer in redox reactions. The highest percentage of consistent answers in the six ROXCI categories was obtained in the surface feature concept category (6.71% or 10 out of 149 respondents consistently answered correctly). This shows that preservice chemistry teachers are not able to connect the three levels of chemical representation, macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic in studying chemistry, especially for the redox concept. Analysis of the relationships between misconceptions and average student confidence shows that every distractor chosen by the respondents at every level was followed by a degree of confidence of between 50%-70%, indicating that misconceptions became stronger because the preservice chemistry teachers did not realize that a concept believed to be true is wrong.",

The sample of the research consists of 785 (333 female, 452 male) university students studying at Sivas Cumhuriyet University in the spring semester of 2021-2022 academic year. The study group of the research was determined by the random sampling method, which is one of the screening methods. &quot;California Critical Thinking Disposition Scale&quot; and &quot;Achievement Goal Orientations Scale&quot; were used to obtain the research data. Descriptive and normality analysis, independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, Tukey and multiple regression analysis were used to obtain the data. In the findings obtained, students' critical thinking dispositions were related to the variables of grade level, income status, and graduated school type; on the other hand, it was determined that achievement goal orientations differed statistically significantly according to the type of program studied, class level, income status, and type of school graduated. In addition, it was determined that the change in the sub-dimensions of the critical thinking dispositions scale explained the learning/approach goal orientation by 12.2%, the learning/avoidance goal orientation by 12.6%, the performance/approach goal orientation by about 10.6%, and the performance/avoidance goal orientation by about 15.2%.

Thanks to this approach students were able to perform [approximately]25 experiments during each one of the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters in an elective Electrochemistry and Corrosion course offered to Chemical Engineering undergraduates. In addition to performing traditional experiments, students were encouraged to design some of their own and have the entire group reproduce them. One of such student-designed experiments involved the capture of CO[subscript 2] and its reduction with a readily available active metal (i.e., Al foil) in aqueous media to generate potentially useful products. The highly negative standard potential of Al is exploited for the reduction of lab-generated CO[subscript 2], and the products are chemically tested. Al as a foil has been reported to be electrochemically inactive for carbon dioxide reduction. However, encouraged by an earlier report of the reduction of CO[subscript 2] to CO, the Al surface is activated in the present experiment by removal of its natural oxide layer with a solution of CuCl[subscript 2] produced in an electrochemical cell. This procedure enables Al to react with CO[subscript 2] and yield useful chemistry. This experiment turned to be a discovery trip. The detailed procedure is discussed here, as well as the teaching methodology, grading scheme, and student outcomes.",

We consider these activities and students' experiences therein through the lenses of Latinx leadership and Gloria Anzaldúa's notion of &quot;conocimiento.&quot; To do so, we rely on established methods in Chicanx Studies that center the voices of participants and communities to foreground emic systems of knowledge and activity qualitatively. Specifically, we examined students' experiences in programming undergirded by &quot;conocimiento&quot; (iterative and dialogic understanding of ourselves and others), &quot;cariño&quot; (care for self and others), and &quot;confianza&quot; (trust) in contrast to more traditionally individualistic, competitive, and transactional arrangements within higher education.",

The data collected for each of the articles were: year of publication, journal name, country, language of publication and type of published document (cross-sectional study, longitudinal, experimental, biographical review, systematic review and meta-analysis). The United States (USA) published more articles than any other country in the world (n = 28), followed by Italy with 13 studies, China and Spain with six studies. A total of 44 scientific journals were identified that have published a total of 89 scientific articles related to AB in children and adolescents with ASD. Regarding the type of published paper, 63 quantitative studies were identified (cross-sectional studies, 9 longitudinal studies, 15 experimental studies). In addition, 14 literature reviews, 9 systematic reviews, and 3 systematic reviews/meta-analyses were identified. These results suggest practitioners and researchers to address and decide where to read and publish scientific articles related to AB in youth with ASD.",

Using qualitative methods, we explore how Latinx students experience these elements of campus culture at a Predominantly White Institution (PWI) publicly committing to engaging in diversity work. We examine the university's ideas and institutional practices and compare them with the interactions and individual experiences of students. We discuss what Latinx students' experiences reveal about how the university's culture cycle considers and promotes the inclusion of Latinx perspectives, experiences, cultural traditions, histories, and challenges. We supplement our understanding of the culture cycle model with elements of Latinx Critical Race Theory (LatCrit) to account for the pervasive influence of race and racism. We conclude that a raceinformed Latinx cultural consciousness is only present in shallow ways within the culture cycle of the university studied. To facilitate an understanding of Latinx student perspectives, meaningfully serve Latinx students, and extend the benefits of diversity to all students, a Latinx cultural consciousness must be infused in &quot;all phases&quot; of the culture cycle.",

The objective was to design and validate an assessment rubric of relevant competencies for employability. Seven competencies were selected: problem-solving, teamwork, adaptive capacity, communication, creativity, leadership and decision-making. A rubric was designed in which three command levels were established: low, medium and high, along with their respective indicators. A content validation process was also used by means of expert judgement. Ten (10) expert judges were selected to carry out a quantitative and qualitative validation in three stages and the indicators were modified until Aiken's V coefficients of [greater than or equal to] 0.80 (p = 0.05) were obtained for all indicators of the established competencies. It is concluded that the rubric is valid enough to assess relevant competencies for employability in vocational training students.",

Yet, spaces have long been contested and not everyone has equal access to shared spaces. This paper examines the experiences of Mexican/Mexican American/Xicanx (MMAX) undergraduate students at a predominantly white university in the Northeast. Drawing on in-depth interviews, participant observations, &quot;pla´ticas,&quot; and document analyses, I argue that MMAX students do not have the right to their respective university because their university does not address their specific needs as Students of Color. The denial of the right to their university is experienced through a lack of resources and institutional support. This includes, but is not limited to, (a) Inconsiderate University Investment Patterns; (b) Inadequate University Services; (c) Unequal Housing Accessibility; and (d) Unfair Treatment by Campus Police.",

This research aims to investigate the attitudes of teacher candidates towards value education via distance education. The research was designed in accordance with the descriptive survey model. Gazi University Faculty of Education constitutes the universe of the research with the departments of foreign languages education, Turkish and social sciences education, mathematics and science education, and primary education. Research data were collected by using one of the non-probability sampling methods convenience sampling. Within this scope, data analysis was realized with 698 students and in the meantime, the &quot;Attitude Scale towards Distance Education&quot; developed by Demir and Çetin (2022) was applied in the research. During the data analysis, descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were implemented. It has been revealed that teacher candidates have positive attitudes about value teaching via distance education and they consider it to be a necessary, useful, and feasible result of the research. Female prospective teachers' attitudes towards the feasibility of value education via distance education are more positive than males. Students studying in the primary education department have more positive attitudes towards teaching values via distance education since they find it necessary and useful compared to the students studying in the fields of mathematics and science. The results obtained as a result of the research indicate that prospective teachers who already possess an affective readiness need to be supported in terms of developing themselves in the field of teaching values via distance education so that they can contribute to values education at a higher level.",

However, athletes lose weight compulsorily or tactically (to encounter weaker opponents, to be between two weights, to be faster and more agile, etc.). In many scientific studies, it is seen that the athletes lose their weight close to the competition scale, and generally they lose a lot of weight on the last day. In addition, it is stated that the rate of weight loss varies between 2-10% of the body weight of the athletes. Many methods are used to set weight before the competition scale. These; Reducing energy intake, reducing fluid consumption, not consuming anything especially the day before the competition scale, increasing the duration and intensity of exercise, loss of fluid with intense sweating, use of sauna, use of diuretic drugs. As the use of these harmful methods and the rate of weight loss increase, their negative effects on physical, physiological, psychological and performance increase at the same rate. In this study, studies in the literature on the effects of weight loss on strength, endurance, anaerobic performance, reaction and balance performance will be examined and the causes of possible effects will be determined.",

        "description":"More students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are pursuing higher education. Existing studies have investigated the postsecondary educational outcomes of college students with ADHD, finding that these students typically have lower academic performance and higher dropout rates than their non-ADHD peers. Far fewer studies address the reasons for these poor outcomes. The current study sought to better understand which pre-college and college factors are related to the (1) academic performance (i.e., cumulative grade point average) and (2) retention of college students with ADHD. Data collected through direct testing and self-report ratings were analyzed for 228 first year college students with ADHD. Results indicated that two pre-college factors, gender (i.e., being male) and lower standardized test scores, significantly predicted lower GPA. Conversely, only one college factor, greater motivation, was found to significantly predict higher GPA and retention. Taken together, findings draw attention to several variables that both secondary and postsecondary institutions can target for intervention to support a more successful transition to college. Additionally, findings highlight the need for future research to elucidate factors related to college academic success for students with ADHD.",

        "description":"Few qualitative studies have focused on the experiences of students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) pursuing postsecondary education, and in particular, how their academic difficulties manifest themselves. This study provides a better understanding of how ADHD affects students in their studies. In-depth interviews were conducted with 29 college and university students with ADHD, their relatives (n = 26), and their counselors (n = 9). Participants reported significant academic impairment (e.g., difficulties related to attention, emotional regulation, motivation, time management, inhibition, working memory, organization, and planning) and a complex relationship with the ADHD label. The difficulties experienced by students seem to be closely related to deficits in executive functions. This interrelation complicates the understanding of functional impairment. Implications for practice provide recommendations based on the literature on how to improve the academic success of students with ADHD in postsecondary education.",

        "description":"Education on sustainable education (ESD) is gaining momentum to ensure that SDGs are met by 2030. The educational institutions have significant role in fostering ESD. However, there is lack of educational resources to be used for ESD. Particularly, teaching the concept of SDGs needs an attention grabbing and engaging approach and Design Based Learning (DBL) holds much potential. The main objective of this investigation was to describe the development of SDGs education resources i.e., SDGs educational games using DBL approach. Besides, the generic skills of the students during DBL were assessed during game development phase. The outputs of DBL were Bingo Mat game, Carrom board game and Sugoroku game. These games were validated for their effectiveness as resource for teaching and learning SDGs. The results revealed the positive impact on the generic skills of students through DBL during game development phase. Moreover, the response results of the players highlighted that carrom board game offered them the gaming experience while Bingo and Sugoroku offered them learning experience. Another important finding of this study is the need to teach SDGs from the younger age as the level of education had significantly impacted on their knowledge about SDGs. The results of this study will contribute to the domain of ESD by articulating an alternative pedagogy of integrating DBL with SDGs as invigorating educational resources and faculty development method.",
