        "title":"Measuring Institutional Effectiveness.",
        "description":"The measurement of institutional effectiveness involves a systematic comparison of organizational purpose and performance. For community colleges, organizational purpose can be defined in terms of providing access to education, realizing student achievement, promoting student development, or addressing social needs. If all four purposes are acknowledged, then measures of effectiveness must be developed for each. At Macomb Community College (MCC), an effort was made to determine the institution's main purposes, select appropriate goals for each purpose, and identify the specific measures which accurately indicate institutional outcomes. The process included a survey of students to determine their definition of a successful college experience; the formation of four study teams to  develop lists of outcomes measures for successful transfer, completion of personal goals, employability, community impact, satisfaction indices, and human development; and the selection of five or six goals for each institutional purpose. The resulting statement of MCC's purposes and goals included the following: (1) provide opportunity through equitable access; effective services; social, cultural, and cross-cultural opportunities; student/client goal clarification; and student/client retention; (2) realize student achievement, as measured by completion of the student's goals, academic success, successful transfer, and successful employment; (3) promote student development in terms of learning and human potential; and (4) address societal needs, such as promoting quality of life and  well-being, institutional innovation in problem solving, developing the community, and student/client/community satisfaction. Many of the specific measures designated for initial implementation already have data collection in progress. The next step is to establish a routine and a format for annual distribution of this information, and to increase awareness and understanding of the project. A chart illustrating institutional purposes and goals, and related measures, data sources, tracking frequency, and anticipated uses is attached. (JMC)",

        "description":"In the San Jose/Evergreen Community College District, course and basic skills prerequisites have been established for all courses. Students with no record of completing these prerequisites cannot enroll unless they have been assessed by a counselor, have had their prerequisites verified in alternate ways, and have been granted override status for enrollment. In spring 1989, 11,307 overrides were granted based on completion of equivalent coursework, instructor evaluations, life experience, previous degrees, and other reasons. A study was conducted to compare the academic success of students who had completed all course and basic skills prerequisites with that of students who had enrolled on override status, and to determine whether experience and feedback had improved the  counselors' ability to appropriately place students. Study findings included the following: (1) 69% of the students who had completed all course and basic skills requirements (N=35,676) received a grade of A, B, C, or Credit, compared to 64% of those who enrolled on override status; (2) 64% of the counselors successfully placed their students, compared with 59% of the counselors in spring 1989; (3) the greatest proportion of A and B grades was achieved by students with existing transcripts (58%), students with previous degrees (44%), and life exierience (41%); and (4) students who insisted on taking a course above their prerequisite level had one of the lowest success rates (49%) and the highest course withdrawal rate (33%). Study findings supported the conclusion that counselors who  strictly enforce prerequisites, use a careful evaluation of relevant life experience, and rely on documented evidence of previous coursework can place students effectively.

Study findings included the following: (1) more than 75% of the respondents agreed that grading practices should reflect the student's skill and knowledge attainment and differentiate between levels of competence attained; that grades are a means of enforcing standards; that grades should be based on a standard established by the teacher and made known to the student in advance; that grades provide a reward system for the student who  accomplishes course objectives; that grades should be criterion referenced, and reflect the quality of work done and the level of responsibility accepted by the student; and that grades given in courses taught by several faculty should be reviewed periodically for consistency; (2) there was clear disagreement with statements that grades destroy student motivation, that a failing grade serves only as punishment, that grading creates damaging anxiety, and that grading should be curved; and (3) opinions were split or a large number of respondents had no opinion regarding the subjective/judgmental nature of grades, and the extent to which grades should reflect student motivation, attendance, and attitudes. A comparison of responses by instructional area and respondent group, the survey  instrument, and responses to open-ended questions are included. (JMC)",

        "description":"Before teachers begin to teach Standard American English (SAE), the schools must strive for a greater tolerance among the public and the school community toward Non-Standard American English (NSAE) dialects. Through the use of a number of motivational approaches, students retain the right to their own dialects and language while learning SAE as a new dialect. The use of positive strategies and attitudes precludes the eradication of the much needed cultural heritage of dialect variety. Such approaches include: (1) using a reading program that includes writing models from various heritages and cultures as well as mainstream authors; (2) assigning short, impromptu theme papers or essay examinations; (3) providing information about the meaning and nature of differences in American  dialects, the development and history of SAE and NSAE dialects, and the importance of tolerance for NSAE dialects; (4) using daily journal writing; (5) discussing and illustrating such verbal and rhetorical strategies as jiving, rapping, and playing the dozens; and (6) role playing in small dramatic situations that require SAE. The manner in which student essays are graded and student-teacher conferences are conducted can also affect students' success with SAE dialect and give them more respect for their own dialect. Adjustments to teachers' language attitudes, classroom activities, and evaluation strategies can increase students' fluency in SAE while respecting cultural, social, and regional dialects. (VVC)",

        "author":["Belcher, Marcia J."],
        "description":"Cutscores for certifying competence on the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) have been raised three times since the test was implemented in 1982. In 1989, a study was conducted at Miami-Dade Community College (MDCC) to challenge the contention that a vast majority of students taking the CLAST under the largest and most recent jump in cutscores would pass within a year. The study also investigated the effect that increased time limits for retaking the CLAST would have on passing rates. Associate-degree seeking students who took the CLAST for the first time at MDCC in fall 1987 (N=1,089) or fall 1988 (N=2,617) were selected for the study. While 72% of the 1987 group had completed the required mathematics and English curriculum, only 41% of the 1988 group had finished the  curriculum. The students' CLAST scores were analyzed in terms of three sets of cutscores: the standards that were implemented in 1986 and remained in effect through 1988; compromise standards that were imposed in 1989; and standards that will be imposed in 1990. Study findings included the following: (1) 72% of the 1987 students passed the CLAST the first time, compared to only 60% of the 1988 group; (2) after 1 year, 84% of the 1987 group and 74% of the 1988 group had passed the test; (3) considering only students who had completed the required curriculum, first-time passing rates were 86% for the 1987 group and 91% for the 1988 group; (4) of those who retook the test, 58% of the 1987 group and 78% of the 1988 group passed, indicating that increasing time limits did help the pass rate;  and (5) under 1989 standards, the pass rate for the 1988 group would have dropped from 60% to 35%, while under the 1990 standards only 19% of the students would have passed. Based on study findings, it was concluded that, under the 1990 cutscores, between 30% and 75% of the students would pass all four parts of the CLAST, and that allowing a second year to pass all four parts would only slightly improve the passing rate.

Audiovisual materials which document negative and/or stereotypical images of \"the other\" include: (1) the filmstrip, \"The Distorted Image,\" which consists of a series of historic images from American newspapers, magazines, art objects, and ads from 1850 to 1922, showing how stereotyped images formed harmful popular views of Blacks,  Italians, Jews, and others in the American consciousness; (2) the documentary, \"Ethnic Notions,\" which shows how caricatures in art and film were used to create negative images of Blacks during the past 200 years; (3) \"Rights and Reactions: Lesbian and Gay Rights on Trial,\" a videotape which presents footage from New York City Council hearings on a bill which proposed to eliminate discrimination in housing based on sexual preference; (4) the film, \"Killing Us Softly: Advertising's Image of Women,\" which offers a visual synthesis of hundreds of ads and analyzes the psychology of advertisers' use of sex, myths, and stereotypes to sell products; and (5) the video, \"Cold Water,\" which presents interviews with 13 Brown University students from 13 different countries discussing their images of  Americans.

        "description":"In spring 1989, 25 community colleges conducted a survey of their English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) students to project the need for ESL services at institutional and statewide levels, and to assess students' existing and desired levels of English proficiency, and the time and resources needed to achieve the desired level. In addition, the study sought to investigate the relationship between the students' use of existing programs and ESL instruction. Data from 10 major ethnic groups were examined. Study findings, based on responses from 13,076 ESL students, included the following: (1) 4,380 of the respondents were Mexican, 1,369 Chinese, 1,268 Central American, 1,163 Vietnamese, 621 Armenian, 593 South American, 473 Japanese, 446 Korean, 422 Persian, and 327 Laotian; (2) the  gender make up of the groups varied widely, with women predominating among Armenians, Chinese, Persians, Japanese, Koreans, and South Americans, and men predominating among Laotians, Vietnamese, and Mexicans; (3) the percentage of students not working ranged from a low of 18% for Central Americans to a high of 74% for the Japanese; (4) among Korean, Japanese, Persian, and South American respondents, less than 10% had 6 years of prior schooling or less, while 69% of the Laotians and 39% of the Mexicans had less than 7 years of schooling; (5) Amnesty students were twice as likely to have had 6 years or less of schooling before entering the United States as the overall sample; (6) all groups exhibited a high level of cultural and linguistic isolation; and (7) in general, respondents had  little contact with agencies that provide support to immigrants, though sizable proportions of Mexican and Central American students were involved with Amnesty programs. Item-by-item survey responses are appended. (JMC)",

        "description":"This study was performed to assess the effect of field independence/dependence on the successful use of mapping or outlining to take notes from textbooks. Success was measured in terms of student performance on a comprehension test and thoroughness of notetaking. The study sample of 38 students enrolled in reading and study skills courses at a community college in Western Pennsylvania was divided into three groups: a group who received training in mapping/networking, a group who received training in outlining/paraphrasing, and a control group that received no training in notetaking. In the first class session, students were taught either the mapping or outlining procedure and were told to take notes on a passage for homework. Two days later, students evaluated and discussed their  homework assignment in small groups. A week later, students were given the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) to assess relative field independence/dependence and were tested on the text material. In the final stage of the process, two raters assessed the thoroughness of the students' notes. Study findings included the following: (1) there were no statistically significant differences between the experimental groups in terms of mean scores on the comprehension test or thoroughness of notes; (2) field-independent students had higher mean test scores using the mapping technique, while field-dependent students had higher scores using outlining; and (3) while there was a significant positive correlation between the GEFT scores of students in the mapping group and their comprehension test  scores, there was no similar correlation for students in the outlining group. Based on study findings, teachers were urged to guide students into the notetaking technique best suited to them. (JMC)",

        "description":"In 1989, a study was conducted at Ocean County College (OCC) to determine the feasibility of establishing a branch campus in southern Ocean County, New Jersey. Specific factors examined in the study included Ocean County's demographic characteristics (e.g., land area and dispersion, population trends, public transportation, and economic trends); elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education; the history and future of OCC; and public opinion. Conclusions about public opinion were drawn from surveys of junior and senior public high school students, business firms, and a representative sample of 384 adult residents. Major study findings included the following: (1) 33% of the junior high school students and 39% of the high school students thought that they would definitely or  probably attend the proposed branch campus; (2) without the branch campus, 21% of the junior high students and 29% of the high school students thought they would attend OCC anyway; (3) approximately 84% of the high school students favored the establishment of the branch campus; (4) business firms were highly supportive of the branch campus, indicating that approximately 10 employees per firm could improve their job-related skills by taking courses at a southern Ocean County branch; and (5) the percentage of the community survey respondents who indicated that they would probably or definitely enroll in an OCC course jumped from 40% without the branch campus to 60% with the branch campus. Based on study findings, it was recommended that a branch campus of 27,000 square feet be established  to accommodate an enrollment of 1,000 students, on a 40- to 50-acre site directly behind the existing Southern Regional High School. The survey instruments, curriculum outlines, and data tables showing enrollment and population projections are attached. (JMC)",

        "description":"In June 1989, a study group was organized at Nassau Community College to encourage faculty to introduce the works of William Shakespeare in introductory literature courses. When the prospect of teaching Shakespeare to community college students was first considered, faculty expressed concern that their understanding of the issues surrounding Shakespearean studies was not current; that their time commitments would not allow them to update their knowledge; that their last attempts to teach Shakespeare had been unsuccessful; and that they needed assistance to branch out to more unfamiliar plays. The Shakespeare project was initiated to address these concerns. The first part of the project was the formation of a study group, which met for over 60 hours in June 1989. Each week, a  Master Mentor directed the study of a different play. The participants were placed in the position of students and assigned individual and group tasks. For example, during the first week, the study group was divided into four smaller groups, who were each assigned scenes from &quot;Hamlet&quot; to perform in any way they chose. Intense discussions arose from the choices and interpretations of the groups. After the scenes were performed and discussed, the Master Mentor raised &quot;essential&quot; questions about the play that had no definitive answers, entering into discussions with information and his own interpretations only as appropriate. As a result, many instructors used the discussion group approach in their classes, having students perform scenes and raising similar kinds of open questions.  (JMC)",

        "description":"Drawing from site visits conducted over a 2-year period, this study report assesses the current status of the 24 tribally controlled colleges in the United States. A foreword by Ernest L. Boyer summarizes the major study findings, including the following: (1) at almost all of the colleges, salaries were too low, libraries were underfunded, and budgets were inadequate; (2) in addition to conventional college curricula to prepare students to transfer to four-year institutions, the colleges offered programs for older students, transition programs for re-entry students, and enrichment programs for high school students; and (3) at the heart of the tribal college movement is a commitment by Native Americans to reclaim their cultural heritage. Chapter 1 provides a brief history of  tribal colleges and notes four characteristics common to all of the institutions. First, tribal colleges establish a learning environment that encourages participation and builds self-confidence in students who have come to view failure as the norm. Second, tribal colleges celebrate and help sustain Native American traditions. Third, they provide essential community services, and, fourth, they serve as centers for research and scholarship. Chapter 2 traces the history of Native American &quot;mis-education,&quot; noting the negative role played in the past by boarding schools. Chapter 3 provides a profile of the 24 tribal colleges in terms of educational philosophy, curriculum, enrollment, students, governance, faculty, physical facilities, and funding. In chapter 4, the role of these institutions  within their local communities is discussed, with respect to cultural change, health care, and economic empowerment. Chapter 5 considers their role in building communities and rebuilding a sense of heritage. Finally, chapter 6 presents a series of recommendations for ensuring educational quality and tribal renewal. A list of tribally controlled colleges is appended. (AYC)",

Chapter 1 provides introductory information on the recent approval of CSCC's change of status from a technical institute to a community college, the college's mission statement, and an organizational chart. Chapter 2 demonstrates that significant portions of CSCC's service area are underserved by the present system of higher education, including adult residents of Clark and Champaign counties, high school graduates, minorities, and current Clark Technical College (CTC) students. Chapter 3 explains the planning process used at CSCC,  which involved the use of external consultants and site visits to other colleges and universities. Chapter 4 examines efforts to establish articulation agreements with other colleges in its area and explains CSCC's articulation strategy. In chapter 5, strategies for meeting the student development needs of underserved populations are presented. Chapter 6 reports on the development of new degree programs, including sections on curriculum development and course offerings in the Division of Arts and Sciences. Chapter 7 focuses on fiscal needs and resources in terms of personnel, the library, facilities, equipment, laboratories, and projected enrollments and revenues. Finally, chapter 8 presents an evaluation plan. (JMC)",

        "description":"In 1988, Joliet Junior College (JJC) initiated a Set-Aside Loan Pool, designed to provide entrepreneurs, who traditionally would not be able to obtain a small business loan because of a lack of equity, with an alternate source of funding. Ten financial institutions were contacted and asked for contributions to the Loan Pool. Over the next five months, follow-up contracts were made to encourage participation and address bankers' reservations about making the contribution as a grant rather than a loan. Other obstacles concerned the size of the requested donation and the fact that monies received from a bank might not be loaned to an entrepreneur from that bank's geographical area. During the first year of the project: (1) the Loan Pool was established and institutionalized through  a $5,000 contribution from one local financial institution; (2) the application process and materials were developed and field tested; (3) announcements of ion of the project were publicized; (4) mechanisms for new and expanded partnerships with local financial institutions were developed; (5) a service incubator for entrepreneurs was established; and (6) one round of loan reviews was conducted, though no loans were issued. Full implementation of the program will take place in 1990. Attached is a formal prospectus on the Loan Pool and a description of JJC's Institute of Economic Technology, the administrative department within the college that is responsible for all JJC's economic development activities and that combines its six separate centers for economic related services into one  umbrella operation.

Part 1 describes a small business incubator as a facility which provides an opportunity for new and existing small businesses to reduce some of the risk involved in operating through shared services, reasonable rent, access to administrative support services, and access to management, financial, and technical assistance. The differences between public/not-for-profit, private, academic-related, and public/private incubators are noted. Part 2 describes the phases in the creation and  development process, including information on the establishment of a coordinating team and the conduct of a feasibility study. In part 3, financial considerations are reviewed, and a list of possible funding sources is provided. Part 4 lists the community/junior colleges currently associated with business incubators, and the North Carolina community colleges in the process of developing centers. This section also notes the services that community colleges can provide to developing businesses. In part 5, implementation concerns are discussed, including site acquisition, fund raising, &quot;incubators without walls,&quot; tenant graduation, data collection needs, marketing, and the roles of the incubator manager, advisory committee, and anchor tenants.

Approval was granted for eight new health occupations programs; four in engineering and related technologies; three in law; two each in business/management, communications, fine and applied arts, consumer education/home economics, and commercial services; and one in interdisciplinary honors. Over half of the new courses were in interdisciplinary studies, 30 were in foreign languages, 15 in health occupations, 13 in education, and 10 in computer and information sciences. The program and course additions brought the total of programs offered systemwide to more than 7,000 and the total of courses offered to more than  137,000. An analysis of trends in course and program approvals between 1981-82 and 1987-88 revealed that: (1) the number of credit programs approved was 63 in 1981-82, 16 in 1983-84, and 38 in 1985-86; (2) the number of credit courses approved was 76 in 1981-82, 71 in 1983-84, and 109 in 1985-86; (3) the number of colleges offering noncredit courses increased from 64 in 1977-78 to 94 in 1987-88; and (4) the number of noncredit offerings increased from 10,782 in 1977-78 to 13,128 in 1987-88, with 1978-79 and 1979-80 representing the lowest years.

The sequence emerged as a response to the predominantly White student body's lack of knowledge or curiosity about other cultures. The first of the four courses in the sequence is entitled &quot;Women in Literature,&quot; a team-taught course focusing on the works of women authors from four American ethnic groups: African Americans, Native Americans, Chicanas, and Asian Americans. The second course, entitled &quot;Literature: The Minority View,&quot; focuses on the literature of a different cultural group during each of three semesters, beginning with Black authors in America, followed by Asian American and and Central/South American  literature. The remaining two courses were deliberately designed to broaden students' cultural perspective. &quot;Myths of Our Western Culture&quot; uses literature, film, music, dance, and visual art to explore cultural myths and their changing relevance to society. The final course in the sequence, currently under development, will explore the social, cultural, economic, and political contributions of Hispanic peoples. DCCC intends to supplement this four-course sequence with interdisciplinary courses and a variety of extracurricular cultural activities, such as clubs and ethnic food festivals. Bibliographies for each of the four courses are attached. (JMC)",

Following introductory material outlining factors precipitating the college's review of its placement procedures, the report provides background on the GCC's use of the Comparative Guidance and Placement (CGP) test and the College Entrance Examination Board test to assess students' English skills. It also discusses changes in academic standards and students' skill levels and the complications inherent in refining the existing placement system. The next section reviews the statistical procedures  used to evaluate and create placement criteria. Several personal and academic characteristics were studied to determine those most highly correlated with success in English 101, including importance to self and others, years out of school, last English and math class, grade in high school math and English, gender, expected hours of employment, primary language, ethnicity, high school grade point average, years of English, age, orientation/guidance course, and CGP reading and sentence scores. The report also describes a second evaluation of the placement system involving a comparison of placement results with the holistic writing scores available on a sub-section of entering students. The final section reviews plans for ongoing evaluation of spring and fall 1989 students and the  development of a report on student characteristics for the use of counselors. (JMC)",

The approach to the course incorporates reader-response theory, feminist criticism, new historicism, and journal writing as the key means for enabling students to learn. Each student has a notebook divided into sections representing different areas of grammar. The first section focuses on grammar as presented by the course text, called &quot;grammar a&quot; for &quot;acceptable.&quot; Students formulate grammar rules by providing a sentence which illustrates the rules they have uncovered in their text. The second section is for grammar as presented in literary texts. Students are asked to describe how they feel about the literary works they read on one side of the page,  while summarizing the pieces and analyzing their grammar on the other side. Students quickly realize that some very good writers do not follow all of the rules of &quot;grammar a.&quot; The third section is for student's own grammar, called &quot;grammar p&quot; for &quot;personal.&quot; For this section, students create their own texts through free-writing, and analyze the extent to which they have followed or not followed specific rules of grammar. The fourth section is devoted to grammar found in the everyday world. For this section, &quot;MS. Magazine&quot; serves as the principal text, but students also copy sentences they hear on the street into their notebooks and study the use of grammar in newspapers. Examples of everyday grammar are compared with examples showing grammar rules from the textbook. The fifth part of the  journal is used to record due dates. The course emphasizes the historical and sociological bases of grammar. Students are graded on the basis of their journal and how well it reflects their awareness of grammar choices. (JMC)",

        "description":"Drawing from research conducted by the Academy for Educational Development and the College Board, this booklet presents nine recommendations to enhance the transfer function of community colleges, especially for minority students; provides a rationale for the recommendations; and describes two major programs to promote the transfer function. Chapter 1 sets forth the following recommendations: (1) the transfer function should be the central role of community colleges; (2) the culture of the urban community college should emphasize intellectual rigor and critical thinking; (3) urban community colleges must promote a vibrant on-campus community, especially for minority students; (4) dual admissions programs should be established; (5) databases using common definitions of \"transfer\"  and \"transfer student\" should be established; (6) community colleges should aggressively promote their upgraded transfer programs among high school students and staff; (7) each state should offer financial incentives to reward community colleges with successful transfer programs; (8) a federally funded scholarship for low-income students who transfer should be created; and (9) not-for-profit foundations should establish programs to enhance transfer rates. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the changing transfer function in community colleges, offering data on the percentages of students who wish to transfer, who actually do transfer, and who receive bachelor's degrees. In addition, student-centered, institutional, social, and political factors that have had a negative effect on transfer  rates are examined. Chapter 3 describes and reviews the achievements of the Upper Division Scholarship Program, which was initiated by the Ford Foundation to facilitate the transfer of academically well qualified, but economically disadvantaged, minority students; and finally, chapter 4 provides an overview of the Urban Community Colleges Transfer Opportunities Program, a two-phase program to help selected community colleges improve minority transfer rates. In each of these chapters, conclusions drawn from the successes of the projects are presented. Includes 36 references. (AYC)",

The section on hygiene gives particular attention to methods caregivers can use to deal with blood, saliva, tears, bites, faeces, urine, vomit, children's sex play, and the ritual by which children become blood brothers or sisters. Additional topics include: (1) the use of  gloves; (2) reasons why individuals may or may not inform child care personnel about HIV infections; (3) development of child care policies on AIDS, hygiene, first aid, and the process of informing parents of common infectious diseases at the caregiving site.

The topical synthesis examines: (1) what well-designed research studies reveal about the long- and short-term effects of ECE: (2) whether different effects are produced by different program models; and (3) whether different populations of students respond differently to ECE in general or to particular schooling. Each NREL close-up provides detailed information on a single topic. Close-ups include a definition, a discussion of practice, and an annotated bibliography. Close-ups in this collection  focus on classroom questioning and parent involvement in education. The NREL snapshots describe effective practices in the settings in which they are used. Snapshots collected here concern a literature-based reading instruction program at Pine Butte Elementary School in Colstrip, Montana; creative staffing arrangements at the Lynch Wood Elementary School in Portland, Oregon, and the Mukilteo School District in Everett, Washington; critical thinking across the curriculum at Aloha High School in a suburb near Portland, Oregon; and parent involvement at Spring Glen Elementary School in downtown Seattle, Washington.

Collected materials were organized in a text-oriented relational database. An attempt was made to avoid the replacement of raw data with coding categories by labeling each recorded interaction with tags by which the material could be easily retrieved. A morphology coding approach was used to maintain comparability with other studies. Also used was an analytic approach that assumed that social interaction involves interpersonal movements that cause changes in participants' status, intimacy, and openness.  The analysis revealed aspects of the organization of social behavior. Appended to the text are reproductions of a playground episode screen in the database, a chart of the organization of the database, and examples of interactions revealing movements of high status, shared outrage, ambivalent response to others' approaches, successful entry leading to rejection, and other dimensions of the children's social interaction.

Some of the ways in which teacher beliefs and intentions interact reflexively with contextual factors to produce particular social realities in preschool settings are examined. Four experienced early childhood teachers of acknowledged ability participated in the study. About 1,000 pages of data were accumulated on each teacher through observations and interviews. The first part of the paper describes the study's methodology. This part covers the decision to focus observations on the teacher's involvement in children's peer interactions, the implementation of a number of data-gathering strategies to provide triangulation, interviews exploring beliefs and intentions, pursuit  of interview themes in the observation data, idiosyncratic and regulated coding procedures, and development of case studies focusing on each teacher. The second section briefly discusses findings. Observations suggested that teacher involvement in children's peer interactions could be grouped in six areas: developing a sense of community; helping children gain access to peer play groups; involvement in children's dramatic play; use of social conduct rules; resolving peer conflict situations; arrangement of the physical environment to support peer interaction. Teachers identified a number of mental activities associated with teaching. Apparently similar situations were read in very different ways, indicating the importance of the teacher's definition of the situation. (RH)",

Four clear dimensions of beliefs emerged from a principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation: (1) generativity; (2) role strain; (3) parental self-restraint; and (4) a unidirectional parent effects model suggesting that parents  are responsible for &quot;how their children turn out.&quot; On approximately half of the items derived from LeMasters' (1974) and Veevers' (1973) work, parents' experiences disagreed with expert opinion. On most of these items, responses suggested large individual differences in adults' experiences as parents and acceptance of cultural messages about the role of parents. Parents and pretested students held similar beliefs about parenthood, with the exception that parents perceived significantly less role strain than did students. Generational differences in beliefs are discussed. (RH)",

        "description":"A study investigated several questions concerning the amount of viewing and types of programs children and parents watched alone and together and the relation of viewing patterns to children's development. Investigated over a 2-year period were coviewing patterns, differences between younger and older children in their viewing with parents, changes in coviewing patterns, and the relation of parental coviewing to children's: (1) language development; (2) social behavior toward peers and adults; and (3) cognitive processing of television. Participants were 271 children of 3-7 years of age and their families. It was found that when children watched adult programs, a parent was present 75 percent of the time; only 22 percent of children's viewing of child-oriented programs was done  with a parent. A history of coviewing informative programs with parents was positively related to children's attention to television and use of print. However, a history of coviewing general entertainment programs with parents was negatively associated with children's visual and auditory attention to television, preference for print media, and prosocial behavior. The paucity of findings favoring positive developmental outcomes from coviewing suggests that family viewing time is not used as an occasion for beneficial or instructional interactions.

The classes and matched comparison groups were pretested and posttested with qualitative and quantitative measures, including the Goodman Book Handling Task, a story retelling inventory, the Metropolitan Early School Inventory (ESI), and the Metropolitan Readiness Test. Findings indicated that the preschool experimental classes performed significantly better than comparison groups  on the Goodman Book Handling task, the story retelling inventory, and on subtest C of the ESI. Kindergarten experimental classes performed better than their comparison groups on the Goodman Book Handling task, subtests B, C, E, and F of the Metropolitan ESI, and the Metropolitan Readiness Test. Experimental subjects not only knew more than their comparison peers on meaningful aspects of reading, but exhibited enthusiasm for books and stories, and were observed developing attitudes toward literacy that are not measurable.

Practitioners are just beginning to see movement toward greater collaboration between government, donor agencies, and nongovernmental organizations.

It is concluded that even though the dichotomy between education and care is probably necessary for policy purposes, the dichotomy does not reflect the intrinsic interconnection of care and education. Because education and care are unified in the child, services should be  child-centered, and the viewpoints of families, agencies, and institutions that impinge on the child must be understood and respected.

Their communicative behaviors were recorded according to intent and level. Intent was classified as comment, request, and reject; levels were nonverbal, verbal-contextual, and verbal-decontextual. Findings were examined for an interaction of sex and age of subject with frequency of each intent at each level. There was a significant age x intent x level interaction. Rejects occurred significantly less often than either comments or requests, which did not differ significantly. A follow-up tally indicated that decontextual utterances by children were infrequent, as were maternal decontextual utterances. This finding appeared to be  a function of the play materials. Implications for the use of low-structured observation are discussed. (Author/RH)",

Initial sections of the paper concern activity as a basis for cognition of space, graphic representation, and mental imagery. Findings of studies that led to the formulation of the Hiatt Model of Graphic Representation revealed that children's understanding of space is different from adults'; acquisition of a concept of space occurs over many years; and graphic representation of space occurs in a developmental sequence related to age. Levels of the model included sensorimotor, preschematic, schematic, prerealistic, realistic, and conceptualistic. Drawings during the sensorimotor, scribble  stage suggest a movement from random scribbles to controlled scribbles, and support the idea that freedom of movement leads to self-control. At about the age of four, the child begins to differentiate objects from sensorimotor activity in its graphic representations. The emergence of the baseline and skyline at 7 years of age indicates that the older child perceives himself as part of his environment, but not the center of it. Levels of the model are described and illustrated. (RH)",

A total of 108 infants of 10, 15, and 29 months were observed playing with &quot;nonsocial&quot; and &quot;social&quot; versions of toy trains. Children could play with the nonsocial train alone, but the social train required the involvement of an adult. The 15-month-olds were expected to play more than the other subjects with the social toy and to attend more to the mother when playing with the toy. Records were made of subjects' looking time for the two toys and the mother. Toy preference was measured by comparing the time spent  looking at each train. Gazes to mother preceded and followed by gazes to a particular version of the toy were considered associated with that toy. Results, which offered moderate support of the hypothesized age change in toy preference, showed that 15-month- olds, but not younger and older infants, looked longer at the social toy than at the nonsocial toy. Furthermore, 15-month-olds organized more attention to mothers in relation to the social toy than to the nonsocial toy; more attention in relation to the social toy than 10-month-olds; and less in relation to the nonsocial toy than 29-month-olds.

Two age groups of preschool children between 3.5 and 5 years of age and a group of adults were asked to retrieve a small toy block from behind single &quot;rail&quot; fences which varied in height in steps of 15.2 cm from 15.2 cm above the floor to about head height. Each retrieval resulted in two traversals: going and returning. Over the course of 24 trials, at least three retrievals or six traversals were made at each height. In general, all three modes of locomotion were observed. For  very low heights, all subjects stepped over the fence. For very high heights, nearly all children and adults walked under the fence. For intermediate heights, all children crawled under the fence. For intermediate heights, adults were much more reluctant to crawl; some avoided that mode of locomotion completely. Results suggest that the locomotor behaviors of young children and adults may be constrained by environmental conditions in relation to body size. (RH)",

Specific attention was given to the dimensions of control and disorganization in attachment. It was postulated that mothers would positively evaluate their willingness to respond to their children, their ability to read and understand their children's signals, and the effectiveness of their caregiving strategies. The mother would view her child as one who wants and deserves her care, who clearly signals what is needed, and who needs and will  respond to her care. In a central relationship postulate, the mother would assert that she and her child are autonomous individuals in a relationship. The study collected data from 32 mothers and their kindergarten children by means of three home observations, a laboratory session, a caregiving interview, and 7-point helplessness and secure base scales. Results included findings that the mother's representations of herself as helpless and the child as beyond control are related to the child's control and disorganization. (RH)",

Positive responses to student behavior problems are discussed in terms of the following tips: use a preventive approach; establish fair limits; set a positive example; restore order when a problem occurs; avoid delegating classroom management problems to others whenever possible; locate the real problem; change the classroom environment when necessary; provide alternatives to undesirable behavior; help students understand the consequences of their behavior; make provisions for a time out; help students modify their  behavior; use group counseling procedures to promote positive behavior; avoid reinforcing negative behavior; invite students to succeed in the classroom; and know how to deal with pathological behavior. Five teacher behaviors--modeling, designing, interacting, responding, and assessing--are discussed as ways of introducing students to a way of life in the classroom. Concluding discussion concerns the influence of leadership style on student behavior, the relations between curriculum and student behavior problems, and student behavior problems and the community.

It presents a sampling of practical strategies that teachers can use to foster parent competence and responsibility in the education of their children. It also contains answers to some of teachers' questions about getting parents to visit the school and encouraging them to become involved in their children's education. An introduction in Chapter 1 is followed by a discussion of new roles and new facts about families and teachers in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 concerns what parents and teachers want. Chapter 4 discusses educational responsibility in the home. Chapter 5 describes what teachers can do to increase parent involvement. Chapter 6 provides tips concerning the parent-teacher conference. Chapter 7 deals with  special experiences and needs of single parents that teachers may want to consider. Chapter 8 articulates four basic rules for parent involvement programs. Appendices provide discussions of parent involvement strategies, the MegaSkills home curriculum, ways to meet family needs, and characteristics of effective families. Over 40 references, as well as 7 filmstrips, are cited. (RH)",

Chapter 1, on the significance of family involvement, covers increased student achievement; home learning activities; improved student behavior; family and teacher acceptance; benefits to parents, teachers, and the community; basic involvement models; and the process of translating research into action. Chapter 2 discusses what people want from schools in terms of public perspectives, parent concerns, schools and the needs of families, student and teacher perspectives, and similarities between parents and teachers. Chapter 3 offers recommendations for action concerning the family, teachers and schools, and the community. The effect of family demographics on schools is  discussed in Chapter 4, which emphasizes family changes and their implications for educational policy, characteristics of parents and children, and current and predicted numbers of school children. Sample home learning activities are described in Chapter 5, which focuses on thinking and reasoning, the development of discipline, and teaching about alcohol and tobacco.

        "description":"This monograph examines the phenomenon of young children who lack the socialization and academic preparation needed to meet the demands of schooling and take advantage of educational programs. Such children have inadequately nurtured bodies and incompletely or inappropriately stimulated minds. The changing nature of childhood is portrayed in subsections on poverty and young children, detachment from empowering adults, and pressures to flee childhood prematurely. Four prerequisites for academic success that involve nutrition and health, social and familial relationships, interaction with environments and adults, and a sense of individuality and self-worth are discussed. This discussion is followed by a consideration of four cornerstones of growth in the early years that must be  firmly established before formal schooling begins. The monograph then offers three case studies of at-risk children that illustrate today's challenges to traditional systems of early elementary schooling. Case studies focus on children who function only with difficulty as competent, independent learners in the classroom. Concluding discussion explores directions for change, including teacher-designed developmental interventions with at-risk children; teacher advocacy on behalf of children in need; and teacher intervention for change in educational and social administration and policy making.

Particular attention was given to: (1) the kinds of activities provided for children; (2) the use of grouping, textbooks, tests and examinations; (3) the allocation of homework; and (4) the role of the teacher. Data were gathered by means of interviews of principals of 69 preschools, 59 kindergartens, and 10 nurseries. Findings indicated that the program of Hong Kong preschools included both developmentally appropriate and inappropriate practices. Appropriate practices included the provision of a variety of activities for all areas of children's development. Children worked in small groups at least part of the time. These groups were in some cases determined by characteristics of the  child, such as age and skill level. The number of textbooks tended to increase with age. Developmentally inappropriate practices included early introduction of the three R's and assignment of homework as early as 3 years. Tests were extensively used. Student choices were restricted in such areas as seating and materials. Small groups, when formed, were often determined randomly, rather than by consideration of the child's interests, needs, and motivations. Of the two program types, nurseries appeared to offer a more developmentally paced curriculum up to the student's fifth year, when program differences disappeared. (RH)",

Four major groups of risk factors are considered: (1) sociocultural and demographic factors; (2) biomedical risks; (3) personal-social risk factors; and (4) family history factors. These risk factors intersect to increase negative outcomes. Where buffering or supportive elements are present, consequences of risk factors are ameliorated. The Syracuse Family Development Research Project found buffering results for a high quality infant-toddler-preschool care program combined with an outreach home visitation program that delivered sensorimotor games, and nutritional and positive discipline information to young, unwed, school-dropout mothers. At least 12 preventive  actions should be taken in regards to risk factors. These include mandatory parent education from the early grades, required child development courses in teacher training curriculums, bookmobiles in poor neighborhoods, provision of parental leave, job sharing, positive television programming, and high quality infant and toddler care.

Methodological deficiencies of the approaches are identified. The paper presents a new method of conceptualizing and assessing adolescents' understanding which involves the use of think aloud problem solving and related tools of cognitive psychology. This method produces graphic maps of adolescents' schemata of society, self, and others. Findings of a pilot study on schemata of the political system are reported. Further evidence for the use of think aloud problem solving and for the analysis of such problem solving by means of  schema-maps in studies of adolescents' understanding of the common good is provided through a reconceptualization of Adelson and others' (1969, 1966) research on adolescents' solutions to hypothetical dilemmas. Discussion concludes that schema-mapping offers a concrete way of operationalizing either a diffuse conceptualization of society or a complex and well-organized conceptualization which includes institutions, principles, and linkages between action and the public good.

Teachers were from inner-city, suburban, urban, and rural schools. Discussion focuses on differences in: (1) amount of content covered; (2) amount of instructional time on task; (2) monitoring of pupils' work; (4) ability to match level of instruction to the ability of individual pupils; (5) pacing of  instruction; (6) degree of active student-teacher academic interaction; (7) individual attention to students; (8) classroom social climate; (9) demands on available time; and (9) aspects of the use of the full-time teacher aide.

This review of the theoretical foundations of intersubjectivity argues that the problem lies in the developmental starting points of the theories. Either subjective experiences are seen to develop before communal ones, as in Schutz (1967), or vice versa, as in Mead (1934). It is asserted that the polarity of these positions works against the understanding of the processes of intersubjectivity. Evidence from research on infants is used to suggest a new starting point that acknowledges both shared and private experience. (Author/RH)",

In Southeast Asia, educators proposed to replace conventional educational components with programed instruction and learning, student and community volunteers, and instructional supervisors. In the comprehensive overview provided in this document, the history of the concept is examined by means of case studies of the implementation of the Philippines' IMPACT, Indonesia's PAMONG, Malaysia's InSPIRE, Jamaica's PRIMER,  Liberia's IEL, and Bangladesh's IMPACT projects. National differences in degree of diffusion were shown to be related to the soundness of arguments presented on IMPACT's behalf, project organization, readiness for reform of the educational bureaucracy, consistency of leadership, and identification of an educational need that IMPACT could fill better than other groups. The document also traces the role of international organizations and associated individuals in promoting IMPACT, reviews related research, identifies site differences affecting implementation, and discusses 26 lessons derived from the case studies.

        "description":"The newly developed, 72-item Q-Sort Inventory of Parenting Behaviors was administered to fathers and mothers of 84 young children in a 3-year longitudinal, cross-sectional study of stability and change in parents' child rearing priorities and the impact of the stability and change on child development during the first 5 years of life. Parents of infants showed more changes in their priorities than parents of preschoolers. Differences in parenting of infants and preschoolers were reflected in 15 highly significant infant-preschooler Q-Sort priority differences. Significant correlations were found between the first-year Q-Sort items and the third-year Denver Developmental Screening Test scores for both mothers and fathers. Similar longitudinal correlations were found between the  parental Q-Sort items and the McCarthy General Cognitive Index scores. Analyses of parent priorities in this sample revealed elements of stability and expected developmentally appropriate changes in parents' child rearing practices. It is concluded that parenting behaviors affect later cognitive functioning and that the findings support the hypothesis that parenting style changes in response to children's increasing maturity.

        "description":"These exploratory studies focused on child-pet bonding and the effect of the quality of chldren's home environments on the social development of preschoolers. Survey data from 88 parents regarding the parents, their homes, and their preschool child provided empirical support for the hypothesis that young children derive developmental benefits from their interactions with pets. Additional data from home interviews with some families provided further support for the general premise that there are developmental benefits to children from interacting with pets. Benefits were primarily in the social domain, and involved social competence, empathy, and attitudes towards pets. \"Pet bonding\" appeared to be a stronger determinant of pet-associated benefits than pet ownership. Other family  elements, including Environmental Assessment Index measures of the quality of home environments, were associated with pet ownership and bonding and the children's development. Children with pets and children with better home environments had higher age-adjusted child development scores. Further research is recommended for the purposes of replicating these results and clarifying their complex linkage. (RH)",

This booklet reports findings of a national research project to identify innovative school-based business projects. Seven schools were chosen for the range of innovative and promising school-based businesses they represented. A New York high school has a greenhouse, built by students, with annual plant sales of $1,000. In Iowa, high school students are operating a small-jobs subcontracting service. Students in Alaska plan an herbal export business; experience in searching for a feasible  enterprise was a substantial part of the educational enterprise. High school students in Georgia operate a child development center and a swine breeding farm that sells feeder pigs. In North Carolina, high school students run a delicatessen with a monthly payroll of $7,000. Students in Indiana have two businesses: a pedigree hog enterprise and a truck and tractor salvage business. A South Dakota high school has altered its curriculum to provide marketing opportunities for students in several classes. The booklet examines legal considerations and enterprise selection and planning, and provides 10 strategies for school-based economic development. (DHP)",

        "description":"Poor black young people in rural Mississippi contemplate their schooling with the same feelings as their friends who dare to jump the local ditches filled with alligators: the odds are against escaping the alligators, and the advantages of getting to the far side are not very apparent. Living in conditions of extreme poverty, these young people have few expectations for change in the future, and the school system reinforces their views. In Mississippi half the students attend schools that are on probation because they failed to meet the new accreditation standards. Some districts have financial difficulties. In others there is little concern for the nearly all-black public schools, as whites have set up their own private academies. There is a general attitude that the schools'  job is to force kids to put in their time but to get rid of them if they cause trouble. The high school dropout rate exceeds 50% in one of every four districts and exceeds 75% in some districts. Students who get through to the end must pass a competency test to get a diploma. Only 20% of black graduates took the college preparatory curriculum; the rest find little opportunity for employment in small towns. They return to the shack they have called home and, like their parents, hope to get agricultural work. Giving these young people hope for the future requires: (1) attractive schools that foster students' self-worth and nurture their dreams; (2) public policy that improves family life, income, and housing; and (3) role models that help students see life as an opportunity to make  something happen.

The survey gathered information on the extent of current training, the importance of including foster parents and workers in a training program, types of training that should be used, and an assessment of current written materials and their dissemination. Six foster care workers and six foster care families were used in the study. Data on the foster care families was provided by the foster mother in all cases. Foster care had been provided by two families for less than a year, and between 1 and 4 years by three families. One foster care woman had been providing care for 13 years. About 66% of respondent foster care workers were  married, with most being between the ages of 40 and 45. Other findings illustrated a generally poor quality of orientation and training. It is extremely important to train foster care workers and parents according to a standard, which has not been the case in Colorado. This study also found little or no standard reference material for rural issues, minorities, or gender differences as they relate to foster children. A proposed model incorporates the ideas and suggestions offered by workers and foster care families. This model, with three educational levels, would be designed to be offered in a traditional classroom setting or as an at-home training process. (TES)",

        "description":"The 15 papers presented in this conference report explore changes in Appalachian mountain life over the preceding three decades; the persistence of old problems, economic and cultural; and alternative paths for the future. Opening remarks by Wendell Berry focus on the value of community and on the survival of a community in an externally controlled economy. Other participants describe the persistent relationships between &quot;bad economics&quot; and bad local politics, the demise of the mountain farm, the crisis in the coal industry, the feminization of poverty, environmental assaults on national forest lands, and the decline of organized labor in Appalachia. Some papers propose alternative development strategies for Appalachia based on the concept of a sustainable society and on  deliberate developmental efforts, reshaping economic development to overcome geographic determinism, particularly with community efforts. One paper considers the role of the local liberal arts college as a resource for progress through rural adult education; another profiles the Appalachian economy and places it in the national context. In his introduction, Ronald D. Eller comments that the current Appalachian economic crisis may foreshadow the permanent &quot;Appalachianizing&quot; of other regions of America as well.

The paper is presented in four parts. Part 1 provides an overview of the locale designations and their definitions. Results of the locale assignment process are presented by type of locale and state in table form. Part 2 analyzes the National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data Public School Universe by locale setting. Along with general observations about national school locales, states are  clustered geographically and by wealth for school locale comparison. Part 3 is an appendix describing the methodology for assigning locale codes to the School Universe file. And Part 4 is an appendix containing tables of the results of the locale assignment. It is pointed out that code assignment is the first step in developing a uniform designation system and that several additional steps are planned or in progress to improve the designations. This paper contains nine tables. (Author/DHP)",

Lack of funding for American Indian education was the most important national issue identified, followed by need for qualified Indian administrators and educators, curriculum issues, financial aid for students in higher education, and academic achievement. Locally, however, parent/family involvement and recruitment, retention, advisement, and counseling were rated among the top five needs. Nationally 35.1% of respondents felt that American Indian education has improved in the past five years, whereas 33.3% felt it has gotten worse. Comparable data are reported for improvement at  the state and local levels. A majority of the respondents supported raising achievement standards but felt that Indian education fared poorly under the Reagan administration. Ninety-three percent believed that culture and language as well as academic studies should be the focus of Indian education programs. Almost 100% supported bilingual education for American Indians. While 92.7% believed there is a need to do more research in Indian education, only 21.8% knew of meaningful research being conducted. Results are presented in tables, but include summaries of comments on each question. The text of each question in the survey is included in this report. (DHP)",

        "author":["Dubin, Elliott J."],
        "description":"During the 1980s, federal spending for procurement, particularly defense procurement, retirement and survivors' benefits, medical benefits, and agricultural assistance payments grew dramatically, while spending for grants and salaries and wages lagged. But, the overall distribution of funding between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas remained fairly stable. Per capita federal funding, excluding loans, was approximately 7% above the national average in metro counties and approximately 18% below the national average in nonmetro counties in both fiscal years 1980 and 1985. This booklet reports in detail the metro/nonmetro distribution of federal funds and distribution of federal funds by type of state, providing numerous tables and graphs. It interprets the data in terms of  costs of federal funds, benefit spillovers, income and employment effects, and loans versus spending, taking into account metro/nonmetro reporting biases. The report concludes that federal funds provide a smaller stimulus for economic development in nonmetro counties than in metro counties. Nonmetro areas rely much more heavily on income redistribution programs. Developmental impact of federal funding in nonmetro areas would be greater if they received their share of funds from a different mix of programs. This report contains 13 references and many tables.

Papers in this collection examine rural development choices in six major areas: income and employment; education, retraining and relocation; utilizing natural resources effectively; reducing rural poverty; improving rural health delivery systems; and financing and providing rural public services. Generally, papers cover the history and current status of policy in the subject area, critical issues that need to be addressed, justifications for a federal role, policy options and their  consequences, and priorities that may be drawn. In each area, workshop participants arrived at a consensus on the preferred policy options in each policy area and these choices are also presented. Papers also consider the federal and state roles in rural development policy in the western, northeastern, north central, and southern regions of the country. The final paper, \"Toward a Comprehensive Rural Development Policy,\" outlines major workshop conclusions regarding rural development, federal policy alternatives, and the requirements for policy change. Appendices present program agendas, biographies of program personalities, members of the national steering committee, members of regional planning committees, a copy of the preconference mail-in survey of participants, participants by state,  and an alphabetical listing of participants.

        "author":["Swiger, John R."],
        "description":"Since 1965, Washington has recognized that small schools need special financial consideration if their students are to receive educational opportunities comparable to those in larger districts. In 1977, after school districts brought suit against the state for failing fully to fund basic education, the state legislature passed the Basic Education Act, which placed new program and funding requirements on school district operations. In 1989 small school districts continue to receive enhanced funding to maintain parity with other schools. Although more dollars per pupil are spent, problems in providing equal opportunity for rural students persist. A statistical profile shows Washington to contain districts with quite varied needs. The state funds an average of 80% of the districts'  costs of maintenance and operations, in accord with provisions of the state funding formula. Since enrollments in many small school districts are low, the formula is adjusted to determine certificated and classified staff units. The additional funding to small districts, however, has allowed some of them to save excess sums. For others, the added funds have not kept pace with the demands of equal educational opportunities. Difficulties include: (1) shortages of administrative and teaching staff; (2) increased graduation requirements; (3) professional isolation of school practitioners; and (4) the emergence of at-risk youth and lack of resources to deal with the problem. Although some remedies to financial problems can be found by generating cooperative efforts with business, such  arrangements do not lessen the need to consider small schools in the overall state apportionment formula.

This study examined the effect of left and right brain hemispheric lateralization exercises upon course grades in two sections of Analysis I (beginning calculus for mathematics/science majors) at a small liberal arts college for black women. In one section, 25 students were given two different types of logical-verbal left brain activities. In the other section, 30 students were given two different types of viseo-spatial right brain activities. Torrance's \"Style of Learning and Thinking\" was used to assess students' lateralization preferences. There was no significant difference in course grade means between the two treatment groups.  However, left dominant subjects in the left brain treatment group scored higher on course grade than left dominant subjects in the right brain treatment group. Also, right dominant subjects in the right brain treatment scored higher than right dominant subjects in the left brain treatment group. Laterality differences in course grades, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, high school grade point average (GPA), and college GPA were also examined. Included are 27 references and examples of right brain and left brain activities. (DC)",

This paper provides descriptive and evaluative data on a 9-month inservice program in mathematics for 89 elementary school teachers and 6 elementary school principals from 22 different schools. The primary delivery system for the project was six 4-hour workshops by nationally known experts in elementary mathematics education. Topics for the workshops included cooperative learning, teaching problem solving, use of manipulatives, teaching basic skills, and teaching estimation skills. There was extensive interaction and follow-up with the 24 teachers at one elementary school while follow-up at other schools was limited. In addition to  documenting the effectiveness of the program, this report is intended as a \"how to\" guide for school personnel interested in carrying out a similar inservice workshop series. Major sections included are: (1) \"Background\"; (2) \"Need for the Project\"; (3) \"Overview of the Project\"; (4) \"Project Objectives\"; (5) \"Project Activities\"; (6) \"Project Evaluation\"; and (7) \"Budget Summary.\" Appendices include: \"Description of the National Science Foundation Project Currently Under Way at the Mathematics Education Development Center\"; \"Workshop Series Brochure\"; and \"Evaluation Instruments.\" (Author/YP)",

Eight instructional units include: (1) &quot;Recognizing Groundwater Concerns&quot;; (2) &quot;Describing the Water Connection&quot;; (3) &quot;Locating Direct Connections&quot;; (4) &quot;Managing Nitrogen Fertilizers&quot;; (5) &quot;Managing Agricultural Pesticides&quot;; (6) &quot;Managing Underground Tanks and Pipelines&quot;; (7) &quot;Managing Natural Fertilizers&quot;; and (8) &quot;Managing Urban Fertilizers and  Pesticides.&quot; Each unit includes lesson plans that feature objectives, interest approach, a list of materials needed, and teaching procedures. Additional information is provided by information sheets, activities, visual masters, references, and videos. A glossary is included to assist in learning terms related to groundwater. Also included is a list of careers in which people may use groundwater knowledge and skills. Lists of water testing laboratories, videos related to groundwater, and a list of farmers participating in the 1989 Resourceful Farming Demonstration are appended. The Groundwater Act and a manual for a groundwater flow model are also provided. (YP)",

Previous research points to teacher conceptions as a crucial variable guiding curriculum decisions. Data for the study were collected through survey questionnaires and interviews. Data were analyzed by content analysis of fieldnotes, frequency analysis, and cross tabulation of survey questionnaires. The questionnaires were mailed to 160 secondary school history teachers in six central and eastern Maine counties and were returned by 71 respondents. Thirty subjects were selected for interviews. The data collected from interviews and questionnaires indicate that there are five composite teacher typologies: (1) storyteller, (2) scientific historian, (3) relativist/reformer, (4) cosmic philosopher, and  (5) eclectic. Each category emphasizes a distinctly different conception of the purposes for studying history. The data also indicates that: teacher conceptions of history are related to background, belief, and knowledge; teaching methods and teacher views may relate to conceptions of history; and further research is needed. A 35-item bibliography and 5 figures detailing characteristics of the 5 teacher typologies using quotes from interviews are included. (CT)",

Gang experts believe that establishing codes of conduct, diligent awareness of gang rivalries, prevention courses, and community and parental involvement can make an impact in keeping gangs away from campus. Chapter 1, &quot;Gangs in Perspective,&quot; discusses general characteristics and attractions of gangs, and how to recognize potential gang involvement in a juvenile. Chapter 2, &quot;Gang Characteristics,&quot; explains specific characteristics of Hispanic, Black, Asian, punk and heavy metal gangs, and satanic cults, including typical dress, behavior, style of graffiti, and the favored kinds of gang activities. Chapter 3, &quot;Prevention and Intervention Strategies,&quot;  suggests crisis intervention and conflict resolution techniques. Prevention is the best way to avoid the disruption youth gangs cause. Once educators are familiar with the kinds of gangs on campus, they can effectively plan their responses to inhibit threatening gang activity. Chapter 4 lists 22 school and community programs involved in work with anti-gang programs, and 43 reference sources and publications are cited at the end of the handbook. (PPB)",

        "title":"The Keynesian Diagram: A Cross to Bear?",
        "author":["Fleck, Juergen"],
        "description":"In elementary economics courses students are often introduced to the basic concepts of macroeconomics through very simplified static models, and the concept of a macroeconomic equilibrium is generally explained with the help of an aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) model and an income/expenditure model (via the Keynesian cross diagram). Although the AD/AS model does not provide a perfect way to explain the adjustment processes that lead to a new equilibrium national income after a change in spending, it is, in its simplicity, nonetheless a very useful pedagogical tool. The usefulness of the Keynesian cross diagram, however, is highly overrated. Its extensive coverage in introductory economics textbooks is not warranted since it does not seem to contribute significantly to  undergraduates' general understanding of economic reasoning. While the chain reaction process of the expenditure multiplier is generally understood intuitively when it is explained in plain English with the help of a real life example, many introductory level students seem to experience considerable difficulty in understanding the diagramatical and mathematical analysis required by the Keynesian diagram. Heavy reliance on mathematical and diagramatical analysis at such an early stage probably does little more than contribute to the general confusion often experienced by beginning economics students. Simply supplementing the AD/AS framework, which is often presented before the Keynesian diagram, with a thorough discussion of the actual adjustment processes that take place when spending  increases occur, will in most cases lead to a better comprehension of the material discussed than the use of the Keynesian diagram. The text includes four diagrams and several equations to illustrate the AD/AS framework. (PPB)",

The purpose of this study was to identify differences in the value priorities of individuals who spontaneously expressed a concern about nuclear war and those who did not. A written questionnaire was administered to adolescents (N=5,435) from grades 6 through 12 in the rural inland northwest. This questionnaire included the Rokeach Value Survey (RVS) and the Spontaneous Concern about the Nuclear Threat Scale (SCANTS). A total of 24.3 percent of the adolescents expressed concern about nuclear war on the SCANTS while the remaining 75.7 percent did not. Using the Mann-Whitney U statistic, 10 of the 18 value priorities were found to significantly differentiate between the two groups.  Adolescents who expressed concern about a nuclear war placed higher priorities on the social values of equality and world peace. Adolescents who did not express a concern about nuclear war placed higher priorities on the individual values of health, a comfortable life, self-respect, an exciting life, wisdom, mature love, pleasure, and inner harmony. The results are discussed in terms of belief system theory. One table and an 11-item bibliography are included. (JB)",

        "description":"The hearing was opened by Representative Pat Williams of Montana, who explained that the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education of which he is chairman, has jurisdiction over the National Endowments for Arts and Humanities and the Institute of Museum Services (IMS), and that programs in these agencies account for the largest portion of federal funds that assist museums in the United States. The Subcommittee, which was especially interested in access to federal resources for rural and small museums, heard testimony from six Montana residents. Wes Hardin, director of the Historical Museum at Fort Missoula, pointed out that federal dollars spent in Montana are often used to leverage in funds from other sources and commented on two proposed IMS-funded projects that would benefit all  of Montana's museums, most of which are small. Margaret C. Kingsland, executive director of the Montana Committee for the Humanities, presented observations on the work of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the efficacy of its museum-related programming, commented on conditions in rural states and their museums, and offered suggestions for improving services to museums. David E. Nelson, executive director of the Montana Arts Council, discussed some of Montana's funding programs for the arts and museums. Michael W. Hager, former director of the Museum of the Rockies, and Donna Forbes, director of the Yellowstone Art Center offered testimony on the funding of those two institutions.

        "description":"Art education in the United States has constantly sought some degree of reinforcement of purpose throughout its history. By closely examining some of the experiences of the past, insights into the validity of a discipline-based approach to art education should emerge. Such knowledge should enlighten the profession, so that rational and valid decisions, based on sound research and thoughtful consideration, may be made for the future. This study shows that while child-centered curriculum has dominated art educational practice since the 1940s, recent concern with the lack of focus and intellectual challenge in art education has generated a new examination of the purpose of art education. Discipline-based art education, as proposed by the Getty Center for Education in the Arts, is  one means of accomplishing this reversion. The annotations section of this paper is presented in two parts. Part 1 reviews the literature pertaining to selected early elements of subject-centered art education (29 citations). Part 2 reviews research on aesthetic education as the problematic sub-discipline of discipline-based art education (15 citations). In the concluding section, it is recommended that research be continued in these areas so that a consensus among art educators can be reached, and advocacy for increased art education nurtured.

        "description":"Basic arts education must give students the essence of their civilization, the civilizations that contributed to it, and the more distant civilizations that enriched world civilizations as a whole. All students are potentially capable of experiencing and analyzing the fundamental qualitativeness of art; therefore, it is realistic to propose qualitative art education for all students at all grade levels. Basic arts education is not now being delivered to the majority of students. The artistic heritage that belongs to the students and the opportunity to contribute to its evolution are being lost to young people. Qualitative art education focuses on the development of the basic competencies of artistic intelligence, namely, qualitative differentiation and the grasp of structural  dynamics. A sequentially organized program of qualitative learning activities, from primary through high school, should allow the student to develop a number of progressively more complex basic competencies. A variety of elementary, middle, and high school art experiences, developed from analysis of such works as Picasso's &quot;Guernica&quot; or a comparison of the works of Henry Moore and Georgia O'Keefe, are described. The qualitative way of perceiving, thinking, and knowing that is developed through inductive and constructive processes of effective school art education should not be limited to the visual arts program, and suggestions are made for interdisciplinary qualitative art education. The book closes with a chapter on techniques for evaluating qualitative art education, and includes  sample evaluative charts. A bibliography cites 57 references. (PPB)",

        "description":"Grouse Creek is a small Mormon ranching community in the extreme northwest corner of Utah. A survey of that community was conducted during 1985 by a team of folklorists, architectural historians, and historians, with the purpose of testing the idea of combining in the same fieldwork a concern for architecture, folk arts, and folklife. The work was motivated by a growing commitment among public sector historians and folklorists to a more comprehensive approach to preservation that includes both tangible and intangible cultural resources and embraces both the historical past and the cultural present. The focus of this report is not on history or ethnography, but on concept and method. It examines one project, reviewing its background and genesis, describing its planning and  execution, reporting its findings (which comprise approximately one half of the document), and judging what may be learned from it. The benefits of the Grouse Creek project extended to all of the participating agencies, and the survey's findings and the development of the extensive project archive will encourage future exhibits or publications. An integrated survey is more time-consuming and costly than a less elaborate architectural survey; an appendix offers an overview of the project's costs. A brief summary of the project archive and a 17-item bibliography are also included. Document contains black and white photographs. (JB)",

This activities guide, which was designed to accompany the poster, &quot;California Women: Courage, Compassion, Conviction,&quot; provides students with the opportunity to learn more about 12 women who exhibited those qualities, who lived in different eras of California's history and who represent many racial and ethnic groups. Their names are: Bernarda Ruiz, Biddy Mason, Helen Hunt Jackson, Annie E. K. Bidwell, Frona E. Wait Colburn, Grace Carpenter Hudson, Katherine Philips Edson, Delilah Beasley, Julia Morgan, Tye Leung Schultze, Marie Mason Potts, and Mine Okubo. Each of these  women exhibited courage, compassion, and conviction in a different way. Each chose her life's work for a different reason. Each woman was shaped by different historical events and changing attitudes toward race and sex; yet each made a significant contribution to California's history. Each of the six sections includes information about specific women with photographs of each and suggestions for classroom activities. The information is not inclusive. Teachers are encouraged to provide students with additional information about these 12 women. Historical notes are also included with lists of 8 audiovisual and 75 print resource materials that might be used to help understand the spirit of the times in which these women lived. (JB)",

The goal of the institute was to train 45 selected elementary and high school teachers in the central documents of the founding of the United States and in the teaching of the U.S. Constitution. The institute aimed to help teachers become familiar with the arguments for constitutional democracy as they were understood by the Founding Fathers. They attended a daily seminar that focused on the study and analysis of the documents in which the history of the deliberations leading to the formation and adoption of the U.S. Constitution were recorded. The  teachers met in small working groups to review teaching materials and to develop lesson plans dealing with various constitutional themes. Another activity of the institute was a presentation on the newly adopted History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools by a panel composed of people instrumental in its development. A summary of this presentation is given. Also included are some comments and recommendations made by institute participants. Two appendices contain the names and addresses of the participants and an annotated list of 85 resources (books, periodicals, and associations and foundations). (JB)",

        "description":"While the capacity to recognize and appreciate beauty may be inborn in all of us, participation in the arts as an audience or artist usually involves a learning process. What is the relationship between childhood and early adult experiences with the arts and later participation? In 1982, with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Census Bureau conducted a \"Survey of Public Participation in the Arts\" (SPPA) to gather preliminary information. The SPPA data permits analysis of three basic subjects: the patterns of socialization in the arts, the relationship of those patterns to adult participation in arts-related activities, and the relationship of socialization patterns to increased participation. The SPPA asked 11 questions about arts-related experiences occurring  prior to age 24, covering the areas of arts lessons, appreciation classes, and attendance at arts-related events. About 70 percent of all respondents had some kind of socialization experience. Patterns of adult participation are measured through audience participation, media-related participation, and direct participation. The data reveal a general downward trend with increasing age with some exceptions in intermediate age groups. The SPPA data draw these conclusions: (1) early socialization in the arts is reflected in higher rates of adult participation; (2) socialization between the ages of 18 and 24 is an especially important predictor; (3) audience participation predictors do not work as well as artist or performer predictors; and (4) lessons and appreciation classes are more closely  related to high levels of adult participation than audience-socialization activities. Twelve tables and five figures showing SPPA data are included. (PPB)",

        "description":"Only an educated people can command the skills necessary for sustainable economic growth and for a better quality of life. Recognizing this, African governments have placed heavy emphasis on expanding educational opportunities. Even so, education in Sub-Saharan Africa is in crisis. Rapid population growth has resulted in more children than ever seeking places in schools already pressed for resources because of the financial crises of the 1980s. Already, many Sub-Saharan African countries allocate over 20 percent of the government budget to education. Further increases would cut too deeply into other pressing demands for public funds. African countries will need to strike a balance between demands for education and the scarcity of resources, and they will need to develop  country-specific, comprehensive, and internally consistent sets of policies along three dimensions: (1) adjustment to current demographic and fiscal realities, (2) revitalization of the existing educational infrastructure to restore quality, and (3) selective expansion to meet further demands. The analysis and recommendations contained in this study should contribute to this educational planning process, as the study attempts to diagnose the problems of erosion of quality and recent stagnation of enrollment and to offer a set of policy responses commensurate with the severity of these problems. A framework is presented within which countries may formulate strategies tailored to their own needs and circumstances. Numerous tables, graphs, and maps are included. (JB)",

Interviews were conducted in eight school districts in four states and narrative case studies were created for each site. These case studies were examined to look for patterns, develop hypotheses, note trends, discover contradictions, and test generalizations. This report contains four main sections. (1) \"Institutionalization: A Preliminary Model of Educational Change\" summarizes the secondary research and describes the theoretical model developed by Matthew B. Miles and used in this study. (2) \"Case Study Digests\" distills and  reorganizes the information from the case studies. Thumbnail sketches of the eight sites provide relevant demographic information. The information for each case study has been organized according to the characteristics that have an impact on institutionalization. (3) \"Case Study Narratives\" contains the full case studies, providing detailed, context-rich information about each site. (4) The final section of the report, \"Discussion,\" attempts to derive meaning by extrapolating from the research data. It is here that researchers suggest patterns that seem to emerge, contradictions that require explanation, hypotheses that might be instructive, or phenomena observed, which, if characteristic, would be important to consider in implementing or maintaining LRE programs.

In an effort to ascertain whether past criticisms were true of current research as well, a review was conducted of 118 studies published in \"Theory and Research in Social Education\" (TRSE), the \"Journal of Social Studies Research\" (JSSR), and the research section of \"Social Education\" (SE) for the years 1979-1986. This monograph, the first in a series designed to provide \"cutting edge\" information to the social studies profession, presents the results of this investigation. Chapter 1 critiques the 118 studies. Chapter 2 offers some observations, based on the  analysis in chapter 1, about the nature of current social studies research. Chapter 3 discusses how the quality of social studies research might be improved. The remarks in this chapter are directed to three groups of social studies educators: (1) professors who direct master's theses or doctoral dissertations, but who do not teach courses in educational research, (2) graduate students who intend to do research, and (3) classroom teachers who have an interest in research. Chapter 4 contains an in-depth evaluation of a single study using the same criteria discussed in chapter 1. Chapter 5 presents some ideas about how classroom teachers of social studies might become more involved in research in their classrooms and schools. Chapter 6 lists the studies reviewed.

Patrick dealing with teaching about the voyages of Christopher Columbus. Part 2, &quot;Columbus and Ecological Imperialism,&quot; by Alfred W. Crosby, provides an ecological perspective on the conditions and consequences of the Columbian exchange. It discusses how plants, pathogens, and animals moved from one hemisphere to the other and changed natural environments and cultures. The devastating effects of Old World microbes on New World peoples and the subsequent shifts in the genetic composition of populations in the Americas are described. Part 3, &quot;Christopher Columbus: The Hero and the Historian,&quot; by Helen Nader  points out that one key to understanding the Columbian voyages and their consequences is accurate information about Columbus and his deeds. This requires reliable documents, but in the past, the editions and translations of the pertinent documents have not been trustworthy. Nader uses her own translation of the &quot;Book of Royal Privileges&quot; to provide a reinterpretation of the history of Columbus and his accomplishments. Two abbreviated versions of these primary sources are presented in the appendix along with a chronology of events in the life of Columbus, the family tree of Columbus, and a map of the first voyage of Columbus.

It is hypothesized that there is a difference in the pace of occupational socialization which ranges from \"instant\" (acting and feeling as a professional from the beginning), \"incremental\" (seeing process as a series of skills to be learned with enhanced professional status granted at each step), and \"deferred\" (little sense of developing a professional \"self,\" professional status conferred upon qualification). Interviews and questionnaires were used to obtain information from first-year student teachers and nurses on how they perceive their progress toward attaining a sense of becoming professional in their fields. The material  is reviewed under three headings: (1) different conceptions of self; (2) different conceptions of role; and (3) different conceptions of the process by which self and role come together. Some general conclusions are drawn on differences between the two groups and the way in which they are trained. A transcript is appended of a conversation with a student nurse. (JD)",

Four papers were presented, each dealing with an acknowledged approach to teaching. The first paper emphasizes the importance of effective curriculum design, a facet of direct instruction that assists teachers, through the use of explicit frameworks and specific instructional examples, in making connections for students. The second paper presents aspects of 4MAT, a system that assists educators in designing instruction that focuses on all four learning styles. Brain dominance differences are discussed. In the third paper, a model for invitational education is presented, emphasizing the collaborative and cooperative processes in developing a  school climate in which learning can be enhanced. The fourth paper explores connections between the need to develop the thinking skills of all students and each of the four instructional approaches, including cooperative learning, direct instruction, invitational education, and learning styles. Graphic notes, \"mind maps\", accompany the papers to facilitate an organizing schema.

Given the budgetary constraints it is natural to seek to increase efficiency and to reduce the cost of inputs. Teachers' salaries account for over 90 percent of the primary school recurrent budget. Therefore, the analysis of teachers' salaries is crucial to forecasting primary school expenditures and developing policies to rationalize teachers' cost. Until now a comparative study of teachers' salaries for SSA did not exist. The present study remedies this situation. The study analyzes factors affecting teachers' salaries in general, and describes categories of teachers, salary structures, and pay supplements in SSA countries. With the use of a computer  forecasting model this study provides forecasts of teacher cost for the next 2 decades for 20 SSA countries under varying hypotheses, and suggests steps to facilitate planning of teacher salaries in SSA.

Building on the results of the first year's statewide evaluation, the second year evaluation design was set to pursue many of the same questions that guided the collection of data in the first year, particularly those which bore directly or indirectly on the mentor-intern relationship. Six survey instruments were developed. Interns and mentors were the chief sources of information; local project coordinators were also surveyed for perspective. Interviews at selected sites provided further insight. The first  section of the report reviews the backgrounds of the teacher participants. The second section reviews several matters regarding the matches made between interns and mentors. In the third section, descriptions are presented of how the relationships were begun, followed by a section on the problems encountered in the projects. The fifth section reviews experiences in the relationships generally, and expectations regarding the continuation of the relationships in the coming year. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper discusses teaching psychological foundations courses to undergraduate preservice teachers. It is argued that the current approach to pedagogy in this area is ineffective because it does not take account of the fact that most prospective teachers, after years of acting as participant observers of the acts of teaching and learning, have implicit and limiting assumptions about the nature of teaching and learning. There is considerable evidence to suggest that the way courses such as educational psychology typically are taught actually serves to reinforce and confirm the narrow, unexamined and often mythical assumptions preservice students hold. The primary focus of this paper is on a critical pedagogy that is developmentally appropriate, provides optimal facilitation of  further cognitive and epistemological development, and that takes as its starting point preservice teachers' existing conceptions of knowing, learning and teaching. Among the instructional techniques used in this form of pedagogy are class participation, journal writing, formal writing for a variety of audiences, and the extensive use of large and small group discussions. Syllabi of several courses in educational psychology are appended. (JD)",

Test results performed on the static balance data indicated a significant difference in the sums of the score ranks of the two groups with Stork Stand Eyes Open test. The nonhandicapped group balanced longer than the learning disabled group with both static balance tests.

No published paradigm-related study provides a comprehensive framework for staff development. This paper synthesizes and develops a set of classes and models into a pretheoretical system and offers a conceptual framework that may be applied by school personnel to improve their planning and conducting of staff development programs. Fifteen operationally defined inservice models are synthesized from published literature and a taxonomic key is provided to classify each model and establish a planning \"decision tree.\" Dissemination and application of this paradigm could improve staff development efforts for  teachers, administrators, and other members working in the education community.

        "description":"A description is given of the Critical Needs Certification Program (CNCP), established in 1984 in South Carolina, which trains teachers in content areas experiencing critical teacher shortages. Under its provisions, college graduates with degrees in mathematics, science, library science, or foreign language begin teaching without the normally required education courses or student teaching. Accelerated teacher training is provided for individuals who have strong academic credentials. Because program participants must obtain a teaching position in an appropriate content area before they are trained, CNCP activities occur before, during and after the first year of teaching. Participants go through 2 years of supervised on-the-job training with a preservice 2-week institute. During  the first 8 months of teaching, participants also attend monthly seminars where they work with teaching specialists to solve problems encountered on the job. Data is provided on several demographic characteristics of CNCP participants and some conclusions are drawn on the success of the program. (JD)",

It examines some ideas about how teachers should be prepared and offers some frameworks for looking at distinctive approaches and alternatives. It also discusses the state of the art concerning programs of initial teacher preparation and indicates where conceptual, empirical, and practical work is needed. In discussing needed changes in teacher preparation, people tend to emphasize either structural or conceptual issues. Tied to policy mandates and questions of supply and demand, structural alternatives reflect political and economic considerations more than what teachers need to know. On the other hand, conceptual alternatives reflect different views of teaching and learning to teach and  suggest different orientations to the preparation of teachers. A review of research-in-progress is presented, designed to generate information about different approaches and alternatives. (JD)",

        "author":["Buchmann, Margret"],
        "description":"The idea that breaks from experience are necessary and salutary in teacher education is a response to an enduring problem of teacher education: the fact that aspiring teachers come to their preparation with set ideas about teaching, learning, and schooling that fit with the larger ideal and institutional order into which they were born. Typically, the pedagogy and school learning aspiring teachers are well versed in is not the sort that teacher educators want them to promote, and novices' understanding of children is limited, based on their own experiences. This paper examines the justifications for breaking with experience that center, first, on the limitations of what teachers learn about their work through their experience of schools and, second, on comparisons of teacher  learning with socialization processes in other professions. In assessing the call for breaks in experience in teacher education, comparisons of teaching with other professions ignore the extent to which teaching is a general human activity, and thus close to common sense. Not all that is learned through experience is without value, and neither are replacements for the lessons of experience necessarily available or teachable. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"Legal issues associated with competency testing of teachers are reviewed, with an emphasis on the problem of bias against minority examinees taking standardized tests. The central legislative foci of legal activity in this area are Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII requires employers to show, with validation studies, that occupational tests are predictive of the work behavior of the job for which the examinee is being considered. Title VI requires defendants to demonstrate a statistically significant correlation between the test and the examinees' success in a job training program. Cases reviewed include &quot;Griggs v. Duke Power Co.&quot; (1971), &quot;Ablemarle Paper Co. v. Moody&quot; (1975), &quot;Washington v. Davis&quot; (1976), &quot;United States v. State of South Carolina&quot;  (1977), &quot;Debra P. v. Turlington&quot; (1979), &quot;United States v. &quot;LULAC&quot; (1986), and &quot;Anderson v. City of Bessemer&quot; (1985). Use of the National Teacher Examinations (NTE) and the Pre Professional Skills Test and the involvement of the Educational Testing Service (ETS) in test construction and validation efforts are outlined in the context of the case reviews. A new multiple-choice examination--to be developed by ETS to supersede the NTE--which concentrates on successful classroom performance, does not purport to be useful as the sole criterion for teacher certification.

Based on a research paper, \"Course-Taking Patterns in the 1980s,\" by Margaret E. Goertz, the report's focus is on what is being studied and how this has changed over time (generally between 1982 and 1987) for high school graduates and college-bound high school seniors. Information on subjects studied by high school graduates and college-bound seniors is presented. Course-taking pattern information focuses on fourth-, eighth-, and 11th-grade students. The information is placed in context via a brief discussion of school reform trends. Data are broken down variously by subject, race, parents' educational attainment, and/or sex. Racial  groups represented include White, Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American; some detail is provided for English-versus non-English speakers and for Asian Americans and Hispanics. It is concluded that a principal element of educational reform in the 1980s has been the increase in course-taking requirements for high school graduation, primarily the increase in the number of years that students are required to study academic subjects. Beyond that, strong recommendations have been made to require academic courses for students expecting to go to college and to increase attention in the elementary and junior high school years to subjects supporting an increasingly technological economy. Twenty-three data tables, mostly showing data between 1982 and 1987; 20 graphs; and technical  notes on the study methodology are included. (TJH)",

The Testing Code of Ethics is intended to enhance the awareness of school personnel regarding proper testing procedures and to emphasize the unrelenting attention necessary to provide accurate test data for decision making. Aspects of the North Carolina Statewide Testing Program that are essential to fulfilling the testing mandate are: test security; test administration; scoring; reporting; and interpreting results. Specific points are discussed in each of these areas. It is crucial that teachers and administrators adhere to certain standards in fulfilling testing responsibilities. These recommended practices include: (1) being factual in discussing  standardized tests; (2) fulfilling the requirements of the standard curriculum, and not focusing solely on preparing students for standardized testing; (3) encouraging students to do their best and not to worry about not knowing the answer to a test question; (4) informing students about characteristics of norm-referenced and criterion-referenced tests; (5) making students aware of tests and the material they cover without coaching on specific content; (6) avoiding the use of pressure or threats in presenting tests to students; (7) not attempting to raise test scores by excluding low-scoring students or groups of students from testing; (8) not using scores on standardized tests as a sole determinant of whether a student is retained or promoted; (9) considering weaknesses revealed by tests  in curriculum planning; (10) using and interpreting tests correctly; and (11) limiting access to test results to those occasions when parents and guardians have a strong need, in which case, tests may be examined in the presence of a school representative.

Ethnography includes the perspectives and methods associated with anthropology and sociology through which researchers try to develop an understanding of: (1) how people live and work together; (2) the meanings these people perceive or construct in the activities they share; and (3) the practices by which they affirm, refine, or give life to such meaning. Educational administrators engage in many activities that parallel the activities of school ethnographers. The similarities in tasks include: (1) the dependence of both on knowledge about the culture and structure of  schools; (2) the challenge of communicating private information to a larger public; and (3) the need for good ideas about the school in its community context. Although there are contrasts in practice and in structure between the work of administrators and ethnographers, these parallels suggest the value of ethnographic training for educational administrators. Reframing the assumption that research and practice are exclusive fields can promote interaction between researchers and administrators. A 45-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

        "description":"In July 1986, the Portland (Oregon) Public Schools began a 3-year study of the use of evaluative data in instructional planning and decision making in schools. This report summarizes the second year of the investigation, in which case studies of evaluative data use were conducted in one elementary school (kindergarten through grade 5) and one middle school (grades 6 through 8) in the Portland district. In the fall of 1987, the enrollment of the elementary school was 450 students and that of the middle school was 550 students. The case studies collected and analyzed ethnographic data on the use of formal tests and informal classroom assessments. Interviews and surveys with 239 teachers and 35 principals provided information on the wide range of evaluative data sources used in  instructional planning and decision making. Study findings provide the basis for a Teacher Support Guide and technical support materials on the effective use of assessment information being developed in 1988-89. More evidence of data use was found than anticipated. A key factor in the use of evaluative data was the principal's attitude about and comfort with the data. Questions remain about whether the behaviors of principals and teachers in schools with high use of data are observably different from those with lower data use in schools. Further study of these questions will enhance the development of the assessment guide. Eight tables and three figures give study findings. Appendices A, B, and C present the case study survey, a summary of frequency tables, and the case study interview  protocol, respectively. (SLD)",

The sample was composed of 216 public high schools, 32 Catholic high schools, and 24 other private high schools in Northern California, all of which gave their students at least five AP examinations. Subsamples were used to compare schools in the same locality. In the sample as a whole, private school students slightly (but not significantly) outperformed public school students. In a subsample of 148 schools, comprised of 44 schools with highly developed preparation programs and 104 schools which might compete for students with these schools, Catholic school students were outperformed by public school students, and  public school students were outperformed by other private school students. Catholic schools were less likely than other private schools to have highly developed programs of preparation for the tests. This study demonstrates that the sector the school occupies has no significant influence on this aspect of student performance and illustrates the importance of the quality of the school's program on performance on AP tests. Four tables give information on students test results. (SLD)",

        "description":"Three papers and a sample outline of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) represent the work of the Monitoring and Improving Testing and Evaluation Innovations (MITEI) Project during 1988. The skeleton of a sample RFP outline for large-scale assessment was expanded to provide a checklist of the type of information that should be included in a RFP. The checklist presented is a guide to RFP writing. Revisions were made to two papers written by members of the joint Task Force of the Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing/National Council on Measurement in Education concerning critical technical issues in large-scale assessment. The first paper, &quot;Issues To Be Considered in the Equating Portions of Requests for Proposals for Large-Scale Assessment Programs&quot;  (Richard M. Jaeger), discusses placing multiple test forms on the same scale to make them useful for comparing performances and examining trends (test equating). The second paper, &quot;Issues To Be Considered in the Content Validity Portions of Request for Proposals for Large-Scale Assessment Programs&quot; (Ronald K. Hambleton), discusses the construct validity information that should be included in a RFP. The third paper, &quot;Report on the MITEI Project Panel Given at the NCSL/ECS Meeting,&quot; reviews the November 12, 1988 meeting in Annapolis (Maryland) of the Education Staff Network of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) and the Education Commission of the States (ECS). An overview of large-scale assessment programs throughout the United States is provided. Sample rating/review  forms and summary sheets; the Annapolis meeting agenda; and the &quot;Code of Fair Testing Practices in Education&quot; are presented. (SLD)",

Three issues were addressed in this study: (1) how the alpha components for data from the FEFT compare across studies; (2) how test and item difficulty and discrimination coefficients compare across test administrations; and (3) how variables such as gender and grade levels of middle school students influence FEFT performance. Analyses were based on data from 69 undergraduates tested in a 1988 supply format study, 155 undergraduates who completed the multiple-choice format  in 1989, and 1,528 middle school students who completed the multiple-choice format in this study. Coefficient alpha for the FEFT ranged between 0.81 and 0.90 across samples and administration formats. Items generally had desirable psychometric characteristics across studies. Construct validity analyses suggested that the measure is reasonably valid. Four tables present data from the study and three appendices give the FEFT composite scores. (SLD)",

        "description":"The ways in which teachers' cognitions about classroom practice vary with the developmental level of the children they teach and the subject matter taught were studied through interviews with 40 teachers. Participants were 8 teachers of kindergarten and grade 1, 10 teachers of grade 2, 11 teachers of grade 3, and 11 teachers of grades 4, 5, and 6. Interviews contained a set of questions to determine teachers' views of effective procedures for encouraging children's study and retention of spelling and mathematics materials. A set of 13 strategies was formulated to summarize the kinds of study activity teachers said they suggested to children and parents. Analysis indicated that strategies were more likely to be described during discussions of spelling instruction than in remarks  about mathematics. Mention of particular strategies varied as a function of grade and subject matter. Teachers valued the development of strategies and attributed the success of high achievers to their use of study strategies, their reliance on assistance from other persons, and their ability. However, poor performance was seldom attributed to failure to use strategies effectively. Results indicate that teachers were sensitive to developmental changes in children across the elementary years as reflected in the strategies they suggested. A table summarizes the strategies suggested, and a bar graph illustrates teacher attributions for the success of high achievers. (SLD)",

        "description":"Preliminary psychometric data assessing the reliability and validity of a method used to measure the diagnostic reasoning and problem-solving skills of predoctoral students in orthodontia are described. The measurement approach consisted of sets of patient demographic data and dental photos and x-rays, accompanied by a set of 33 multiple-choice items with from 2 to 10 options. Students were only able to complete two exercises in a 50-minute testing period, so that content specificity of any sizable magnitude might be a problem. Members of a second-year dental school class were divided into two groups, of 35 and 33 students, to take two versions (each containing two different cases) of the examination for a total of four different cases. Prescriptive items showed uniformly higher  internal consistency reliability estimates than did the descriptive items. The intercorrelations among data from the same test administration, correlations between scores for different problems at different testing times, and correlations of class attendance with test scores were all sufficiently large to support the construct validity of the measurement procedure. The method appears to offer a viable method of assessing problem-solving skills in orthodontics, with potential for uses beyond undergraduate education. Three tables present reliability data. (SLD)",

Examinees were 1,135 clients of the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation who, during 1985, completed at least one of the six CS tests. Information is provided on measure reliability; relationships among CS measures; relationships with standard battery aptitude measures; and relationships to sex, age, education, and laterality. Measurement precision appears adequate for the Rod-and-Frame Test and the Matching Familiar Figures Test style score. For the Stroop Color and Word Test, the reliability was a little low but could be raised by lengthening the test. These three measures appear to be independent of each other and of the standard battery measures and may be useful additions to the battery  if further research indicates that they predict vocational/avocational performance. The Verbalizer/Visualizer Questionnaire requires further investigation and development prior to use. The measure of global-analytic style did not have adequate reliability, and the measure of global-analytic ability showed overlap with current battery measures, but might prove useful as a measure of general reasoning ability. Item statistics, the calculation routine for over- and under-correction on the Rod and Frame Test, and descriptive statistics for the standard battery measures are appended. (TJH)",

Three problems relate to the use of \"OVA\" methods (analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, multivariate analysis of variance, and multivariate analysis of covariance) in general. These are: (1) the wasting of information when intervally scaled independent variables are converted to the nominal level; (2) the distortion of distribution shapes of and relationships among the non-interval predictor variables; and (3) the reduction of power against Type II error. Three other problems are associated with the use of ANCOVA as a statistical control technique: the need for very reliable measurement of the control variables; the regard many researchers have for ANCOVA  as an almost magical technique for equalizing dissimilar groups; and the fact that researchers frequently disregard the critical homogeneity of regression assumption. If the regression equations of the groups are not reasonably similar, the single regression equation calculated by ignoring group membership will result in underadjustment for the experimental group.

First-order and second-order results give different and informative pictures of data dynamics. Several aspects of good practice in interpretation of second-order results are presented using data from 487 subjects responding to the Love Relationships Scale (LRS) of B. Thompson and G. M. Borrello (1987, 1989). Fifty-one of the subjects participated in this study, and the rest of the subjects participated in previous studies of the LRS. It is suggested that interpreting only the rotated second-order factor matrix is not good practice. It is also suggested that interpretation can be aided by consulting both the unrotated and the rotated S(VxS) product  matrix obtained by post-multiplying the first-order factor pattern matrix by the second-order factor pattern matrix. It is further suggested that orthogonalizing the first-order factors using the algorithm of J. Schmid and J. Leiman (1957) is helpful in interpreting second-order results. Seven tables present product matrices and listings of items from product matrices, one figure illustrates culturally-defined stereotypic love, and the LRS is appended. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The evolution of California's school accountability program, its current status, and some future directions are discussed. Public recognition of the need for school improvement resulted in California's Hughes Hart Education Reform Act (SB 813) of 1983, leading to the development of the California accountability program. Program components include: (1) an annual statewide performance report on the status of uniform educational quality indicators; (2) annual individual school progress reports; (3) suggested goals for improvement in performance; (4) school self-reports on local quality indicators; and (5) an active program of school recognition. School performance reports are considered public information and are used in screening schools for the California School Recognition  Program to reward achievement. New directions for the accountability program include: the preparation and distribution of school accountability report cards each year; the development of strategies for identifying and improving at-risk schools; and the development of a state plan for program improvement to encompass accountability standards for school programs under the federal reauthorization of Chapter 1 (Public Law 100-297, 1988). California's schools are presently undergoing enormous changes. However, despite these changes, accountability has proven to be a continuing theme in California's educational policy discussions. Accountability, conceived as the measurement of performance and the setting of goals, is providing for the effective and fair use of school resources.  (SLD)",

Participants were 149 undergraduate teacher-training students in human development and learning classes. Students randomly received and were asked to memorize one of three 15-item lists: nonsense syllables, unrelated words, or related words. A brief questionnaire evaluated the students' attributional assignment for success and failure and their fluency, flexibility, and originality. Three sets of multiple regressions run on nonsense and unrelated word lists tested the idea that students' attributional preferences would vary with measures of divergent thinking and that both would predict word retention. For nonsense syllables, success and failure attributions significantly predicted  fluency and flexibility but not originality. For unrelated words, fluency and originality scores were significantly predicted by attributions. Flexibility was positively correlated with, and significantly predicted, word retention. Success at retaining nonsense words was related more to chance and ease of task attributions, while ability, knowledge, and effort attributions were chosen for unrelated words. Results suggest that encouraging students to bring personal meaning to low-meaning tasks can increase retention. (Author/SLD)",

Other methods (e.g., statistical regression) are used more often in a research context to make conditional statements about performance given a certain demographic context. This paper illustrates a method for the construction of differentiated school norms and the computation of percentiles on the basis of demographic background factors. These differentiated norms facilitate reports of performance that take into account demographic conditions that are beyond the control of schools. With this approach each school is located at the median of its own norm group with regard to an index of socioeconomic status. The computation of percentiles is illustrated with science achievement test scores for all  eighth-grade students in 1,573 public schools in California. The effects of varying the size of the norm group are illustrated with reading achievement test scores for all 12th-grade students in 797 public high schools in California. The computing and reporting of differentiated norms are complex and may be difficult to communicate to general audiences. Local authorities in California, however, have reported few difficulties so far in communicating the concept of differentiated norms. Two tables and one figure illustrate the study data.

The data reflect the 1985-86 and the 1986-87 school years. Most of the high schools involved contain grades 9 and above, but they may infrequently include grades 7 and 8 as well. Both percent AFDC and total enrollment were associated with higher dropout rates. Higher achievement was associated with lower dropout rates even  after statistically controlling percent AFDC and total enrollment. The year-to-year stability of school dropout rates and their correlations with other study variables were assessed.

Two forms of the instrument, a self-report form to be completed by the teacher and an observation form to be completed by a supervisor or administrator contained the same thirty-six items. The items were included on three subscales: (1) student to teacher relationships; (2) professional attitude; and (3) professional skills. Response patterns were scored on a scale from one to five. The effectiveness of 204 teachers as observed by their principals on the Observation Form of the IMP and the effectiveness of 211 teachers as reported on the Self-Report Form of the IMP were assessed. Data for both forms were collected for  teachers from public elementary and secondary schools in Colorado. Both forms appeared to fit the Rasch model quite well. The teacher effectiveness variable was defined on both instruments, providing construct validity to the IMP. Item calibrations sufficiently spread the person measures to ensure an adequate fit of the model on both forms. Having person measures contributed to the diagnostic potential of the IMP. Results suggest that the Rasch model provides a major breakthrough in analyzing the variable of teacher effectiveness in the use of item calibrations on a hierarchical continuum. Instructions for both forms of the instrument are included. A table and six figures illustrate the study results. (SLD)",

        "description":"Researchers as well as others evaluating teachers or programs are often interested in the verbal and non-verbal behaviors related to the learning of students in classrooms. The Student Record of Behavior (StRoBe) is a classroom observation instrument designed to provide simple low inference information concerning student behaviors related to engagement in learning. The StRoBe protocol grid indicates the physical location of the students in the classroom, and data are recorded for one student approximately every 10 seconds. This allows a great deal of data to be collected for a large number of students in a short amount of time. The instrument is most useful with traditional classroom lessons or other classroom activities that require students to remain relatively fixed in their  seats or in one place. With repeated observations, data can be collected that allow for classroom, teacher, and student comparisons based on: (1) verbal and non-verbal behavior; (2) appropriate and inappropriate behavior; and (3) interactions. These comparisons can serve as the basis for research and evaluation. The simplicity of the StRoBe and the limited number of entry choices provide a measure that has high interrater reliability. Definitions of variables, steps for variable assignment, one table, and two StRoBe protocols are provided. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"This paper presents staff development implications for elementary and secondary school teachers which were gleaned from assessments of classroom teachers' testing needs, resources, practices, and proficiencies made by 586 supervisors and principals and 326 teachers in an Ohio study. These assessments included direct analyses of teacher-made tests as well as perceptual assessments of teachers' testing needs and proficiencies. It was generally agreed that testing proficiencies were not adequate to meet classroom needs. Analyses revealed that typical teachers gave 50 or more formal teacher-made tests each year, for which they wrote most of their own questions. Matching exercises on teacher-made tests were particularly prone to error. Most teacher-made tests, except in mathematics  and science, functioned primarily at the knowledge level. Administrators' and teachers' perceptual assessments of teachers' testing skills were negatively correlated with the results of direct analysis of teacher testing skills as displayed in their teacher-made tests. Standardized tests were reported to be less needed in the secondary than in the elementary grades. Schools had very limited support services, such as typing and duplication, available to support the testing responsibilities of their teachers. Two tables present study data. (Author/SLD)",

The total eighth-grade enrollment for the NELS:88 sample of schools was 203,002; of these, 10,583 students were excluded due to limitations in their language proficiency or to mental or physical disabilities. As in the 1980 High School and Beyond (HSB) Study, the NELS:88 sample included about 70% initial selections and 30% replacement schools. NELS:88 non-respondents were 51.96% male and 43.07% female, with the gender of 4.96% not indicated, while NELS:88 respondents were 49.8% male and 50.2% female. Part 1 of this  paper gives a brief overview of the study and its sample design, and outlines the main non-response issues, namely: (1) school and individual ineligibility for the study; (2) unit non-response, i.e., the fact that some schools and individuals declined to participate; and (3) item non-response in the student questionnaires and cognitive tests. Part 2 describes the methodology used for adjusting school level non-response in the NELS:88. Actual estimators are given, along with a method for evaluating the estimators and a method for deriving the estimate of response propensities for each school. Part 3 reports the results of an item non-response analysis of the student questionnaire data and the cognitive tests. Some comparisons are offered with non-response in the first year of the HSB  survey. (SLD)",

Sanctions, such as negative evaluations of educational programs associated with such tests, used to fall most heavily on schools and staff, but tests are increasingly becoming prerequisites for promotion and graduation, with increasing impact on students. Proponents of competency tests believe that they will motivate students, bring much-needed educational reform, and stimulate general improvements and public support for the public schools. The most serious issues include: the effects of testing on the achievement of students who are at risk and on the dropout rate; the effects of such tests on curricula; the effects of such testing on the teaching profession; and the impact of the tests on  public support for education. Empirical evidence about these concerns is not widely available but several conclusions can be drawn: (1) such tests are here to stay; (2) tests will not resolve the issues of equity that still plague public education because these are political issues; (3) there may, in fact, be associated with the use of tests serious effects that must be monitored. The solutions to these problems appear to lie, not in less testing, but in more and better testing to yield accountability and motivation effects without curricular distortion. (SLD)",

The conventional tests were the Seashore Tonal Memory Test and three tests (peaked, rectangular, and maximum discrimination) constructed from items in the 278-item adaptive test pool. The results were based on data from 468 high school and college students. The 30-item adaptive test provided comparable or, in the vast majority of cases, superior measurement precision to the conventional tests at all ability levels. Measurement precision comparable to the conventional tests was achieved by the adaptive test using 34% to 69% fewer items. Although differences tended to be small, in most cases adaptive test validities exceeded  those of the conventional tests. The findings suggest that adaptive testing procedures, which, prior to this study had been limited to written items, can provide significant improvements in the measurement of listening skills.

This evaluation was designed to obtain outcome assessments of a National Science Foundation Workshop, which was working with 20 high school chemistry teachers and 20 high school biology teachers to stimulate effective teaching, assist teachers in developing instructional modules, and provide a broader network of scientists to relate to high school science activities. The initial evaluation design called for self-reports of program impact from participants, but hard data, in terms of test scores, became necessary to document impact more directly. Three measures were selected to gather data on workshop impact: (1) a questionnaire determining the reactions of participants; (2) a  questionnaire examining the utility for teachers of activities in the workshop as translated into their teaching; and (3) an instrument, Our Class and Its Work (OCIW), developed by M. J. Eash and H. Waxman (1983), which was used to gather information from students of workshop teachers (N=442) and students of control teachers (N=384). Students' perceptions of classroom approach paralleled teacher self-reports; when teachers reported a change in classroom behavior, OCIW student data suppored a change. The problems in outcome evaluation illustrated by this study indicate the need to rely on more than just test scores in evaluating program impact. (SLD)",

The listening test consists of responses to taped statements that would reveal how accurately respondents had understood the statement's intended meaning. Pretest scores indicated that extension staff did not generally have adequate listening skills. The 30-item posttest indicated that extension personnel improved  significantly in listening ability, with the greatest increases in the scores of males and those working in agriculture rather than home economics. No significant relationship was found between educational level and posttest scores. In addition, listening skills improved more for some geographic areas than for other areas, perhaps a reflection of higher personal contact in some areas. (SLD)",

This study examines a low-income black neighborhood to discover the extent to which blacks think of themselves as members of a subordinate caste and the effect of these feelings on their living and academic strategies. Among theories attempting to explain black underrepresentation in higher education, those centering on black culture, slavery and post-slavery experiences, and black family structure are reviewed and rejected. More appropriate is John Ogbu's caste system theory which holds that, being relegated to menial jobs and denied assimilation in American society, blacks  have developed a folk theory and subsequent strategies for &quot;getting ahead,&quot; which do not encourage perseverance in schooling. Residents of the Franklin Square neighborhood of Baltimore (Maryland) were studied to determine the applicability of Ogbu's theory. The study indicates that Franklin Square residents adopt alternative strategies for &quot;making it&quot; over traditional ones, and that an oppositional relationship to mainstream career paths and daily living patterns is strongly evidenced. In addition, clientship relationships reflect resident attitudes toward the system. Both coping and expressive responses of the Franklin Square community strongly confirm the minority caste thesis and underscore the limited value of traditional educational paths within this framework.

        "description":"This study is an empirical analysis of urban employment changes in the United States between 1980 and 1984. The paper follows other recent work on the economics of urban and regional employment growth. Particular attention is paid to the effects on employment of schooling attainment and per pupil schooling expenditures. In addition, the effect of relatively high concentrations of black employees is studied. The paper is divided into four sections. The first section presents a brief theoretical framework. The second section discusses the empirical models and data. The third section reviews empirical results of the study. The fourth section presents some brief observations on employment growth in semi-urban counties. Results indicate that jobs are generated disproportionately in  urban areas that have a higher quality human infrastructure as reflected by educational attainment and per pupil expenditures. A relative increase in the black population is shown to have a negative effect on employment. The study also indicates that the South appears to be gaining jobs relative to the rest of the United States. Results suggest that schooling may not contribute significantly to growth in rural areas. The study includes 12 formulae and statistical data on three tables. A list of eight references is appended. (AF)",

The following positive views about school quality and effectiveness are reported: (1) high percentages of staff, parents, and students rated their schools as &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;above average&quot;; (2) nearly all staff agree that they have high expectations for student success and that school climates were conducive to learning, student progress was monitored frequently to improve performance, and students were actively engaged in learning in classrooms; (3) parents believe that home/school  relationships are positive and believe also that AISD's greatest strengths include the instructional staff and high academic quality; and (4) in general, elementary staff and parents are more positive than secondary, and administrators are more positive than professionals. A few areas were identified for possible improvement. Staff, parents, and students most frequently identified pupils' lack of interest and lack of respect for teachers and other students as the biggest problems; and professionals were least positive about the quantity of paperwork and staff morale. About half of the professionals surveyed in 1988-89 and 1987-88 perceived the teaching profession as declining compared to five years ago, and two out of three teachers plan to stay with teaching as a career.

Transiency refers to the adjusted numbers of entrants and leavers, expressed as a percentage (rate); stability refers to the student population that has remained in the school all year, expressed as a percentage (rate) of the starting enrollment. Information on the number of students who entered and left each month was gathered from all regular and magnet schools. Rankings were computed for elementary, secondary, and magnet schools by administrative region, with a district summary. Transiency rates reported in this study cannot be directly compared to previous years because a new formula was used to compute transiency. Overall, the  stability rate declined from 1978-79 to 1980-81, from 76.6 percent to 74.1 percent, with noteworthy improvements over the next two years. The overall transiency rate for 1982-83, 39.1 percent, can be used as a baseline for comparing future rates. Historical data are reported for 1968-1978 and 1978-1982.

        "description":"This report on transiency and stability in the Los Angeles Unified School District continues a series that has been augmented annually since 1968-69. Transiency refers to the adjusted numbers of entrants and leavers, expressed as a percentage (rate); stability refers to the student population that has remained in the school all year, expressed as a percentage (rate) of the starting enrollment. Information on the number of students who entered and left each month was gathered from all regular and magnet schools. Rankings were computed for elementary, secondary, and magnet schools, by administrative region and division, with a district summary. Transiency rates reported in this study cannot be directly compared to previous years because a new formula used to compute transiency for  1982-83 was further refined for this study. Also, this report introduces a new formula to compute the stability rate, so rates reported cannot be directly compared to previous years' rates. Overall, the stability rate declined from 1978-79 to 1980-81, from 76.6 percent to 74.1 percent, with noteworthy improvements over the next 2 years. The overall transiency rate for 1983-84, 40.8 percent, can be used as a baseline for comparing future rates. Historical data are reported for 1968-1978 and 1978-1984. Statistical data are included on seven tables. (FMW)",

The areas covered are Chicago (Illinois), Houston (Texas), Miami (Florida), and New York (New York). The study sought to determine if for the 1988-89 school year these areas offered enough English/civics classes to accommodate all the temporary residents who need to take them in order to become permanent residents. Chapter I contains an executive summary of the research. Chapter II presents the data on the availability of English/civics courses in the four metropolitan areas. Chapter III provides background information on the English/civics requirement of the Immigration  Reform and Control Act. Chapter IV discusses the implementation of options for complying with the English/civics knowledge requirement. Chapter V explains the methodology of the amnesty class survey. Chapter VI contains the policy recommendations for the utilization of English/civics classes and testing options. Appendix 1 contains Form I-698, an application to adjust status from temporary to permanent residence. Appendix 2 provides a table reflecting the temporary residence populations of metropolitan areas in the amnesty class survey. Five figures, one table, endnotes, and a list of background papers on Latino issues are also included. (JS)",

Data were analyzed from the High School and Beyond study and all findings were proven to be statistically significant after multiple regression analyses. The term &quot;athletes&quot; refers to those individuals who reported participating on varsity athletic teams both in their sophomore year (1980) and in their senior year (1982); &quot;nonathletes&quot; refers to individuals who either participated only in the sophomore year or not at all. The following findings are discussed: (1) minority athletes are more active in the affairs of their schools and communities than nonathletes; (2) Black and Hispanic athletes scored higher on standardized tests than nonathletes; (3) athletic  participation was significantly related to lower dropout rates for Black males and Hispanic females in rural schools and for Whites in suburban school, but demonstrated no &quot;holding power&quot; in urban schools; (4) the upward mobility of minority athletes after high school is limited compared to that of Whites, with the exception of Hispanic female athletes; (5) females benefit from sports much the same as males; and (6) high school athletes stay involved with sports as young adults. Recommendations for educational policy are included. The appendices provide statistical data on 14 graphs, a discussion of the research methodology, and a list of the members of the policy advisory board. (FMW)",

        "description":"This study, part of a larger ethnographic study of elementary students categorized as at-risk, attempts to determine whether the labelling of students affects teachers' expectations of, and behavior toward, at-risk students. The beliefs of a teacher sample of five women, three Hispanic and two Anglo, at two urban schools in the Southwest with large populations of minority and low-income students were assessed in two different ways. Teachers were asked first about the notions of \"at-risk\" in general, and then asked to identify and describe their at-risk students. The first set of questions was designed to elicit their \"declared,\" or public beliefs; the second set was designed to elicit their more private beliefs by asking them to think of specific examples. Later in the year the  teachers were asked if their concept of at-risk had changed and whether the students categorized as such still deserved the label. The major findings from analysis of the teachers' perceptions are the following: (1) their concept of at-risk was fluid, with the definition changing from a sociocultural perspective initially to one more focused on a student's ability to learn at the end of the term; (2) teachers' decisions to refer students to special education were based on expectations for academic performance and norms for appropriate classroom conduct rather than on the students' behavior; (3) teachers understood that at-risk status could be situation-specific, with the same student considered at-risk in one classroom but not in another; (4) they tended to blame students' parents and  homelife for academic failure rather than the students' personal shortcomings or their own inability to teach effectively; and (5) they failed to see their own role in the creation of an environment and set of expectations that affected both the labelling of at-risk students and the students' behavior and that they themselves may limit the students' potential for academic achievement. The teachers' limited awareness of the problems of the social constructivist nature of their labelling can result in programs that deal with students' individual problems but fail to implement structural changes in classrooms and schools. Two tables and 30 references are appended. (WS)",

        "description":"This document presents a report on the educational needs of homeless children in New York City. Data were analyzed from the following sources: (1) review of the current literature on the impact of homelessness on the physical and emotional well-being of children; (2) field-based interviews with 277 families in New York's shelters and hotels; and (3) an analysis of statistical data collected and maintained by the New York City Board of Education on 9,659 children in temporary housing. The following effects of homelessness were identified: (1) hunger and poor nutrition; (2) health problems and inadequate health care; (3) developmental delays; (4) psychological problems; and (5) denial of access to educational services. The following characteristics of the homeless were identified:  (1) the average length of homelessness was 16 months; (2) the majority listed New York as their last permanent address; (3) most did not have a pattern of frequent moves prior to homelessness; and (4) many had lived with family or friends prior to requesting emergency shelter. The following effects of homelessness on education were identified: (1) placements in facilities are made without regard to community ties which results in a school transfer; (2) families are moved among facilities resulting in multiple school transfers; (3) many parents are not informed of their choices regarding educational placement; and (4) multiple moves increase school attendance problems, cause academic performance to suffer, and disrupt continuity of services. Recommendations for improvement are made in the  following broad areas: (1) housing; (2) education for homeless children; and (3) education for relocated students. Statistical data are included on 17 tables. A list of 85 references and a 141-item bibliography are appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"This document comprises a study of how inner city adolescent males who used and/or sold drugs or had been involved in other criminal activities differed from those who had not, in order to design prevention and treatment programs and policies. The study sample consisted of 387 minority male youth (96 percent Black; 4 percent Hispanic) of ninth and tenth grade age who lived in economically distressed neighborhoods of the District of Columbia. Surveys were administered in person by minority interviewers in 1988. The following findings are discussed: (1) 20 percent reported involvement in drug use and/or sales in the past year; (2) 50 percent of the respondents committed a crime, other than the use and sale of drugs, in the past year; (3) both drug use and criminal activity were  significantly related to peer, school, home, and personality factors; and (4) less than half of the respondents (40 percent) reported having received substance abuse information as part of their regular classroom activities, despite the fact that such information is included in mandatory health education classes. Based on these findings, drug intervention programs should be targeted for the following distinct categories of youth: (1) those who used but did not sell drugs; (2) those who sold but did not use drugs; (3) those who both used and sold drugs; and (4) those who neither used nor sold drugs. Programs should also be conducted on a multifaceted front involving the school, the home, the mass media, and the community. A list of 74 references is included. The appendices comprise the  following materials: (1) a copy of the interview questionnaire; (2) a table referencing questionnaire contents to sources; and (3) a discussion of statistical comparisons used in the report.

These data were compiled from information collected in the March 1989 Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the Bureau of the Census. The report is comprised of an introduction, highlights, and seven sections. The first section discusses household income in terms of region, type of residence, and type of household. The second section analyzes family income on the basis of race, Hispanic origin, family composition, and age of householder. The third section examines earnings of year-round, full-time workers. The fourth section presents per capita income figures. The fifth section examines poverty status in terms of the following  factors: (1) age; (2) race and Hispanic origin; (3) regions; (4) farm/nonfarm residence; (5) metropolitan/nonmetropolitan residence; (6) poverty areas; (7) families, family composition, and unrelated individuals; (8) work experience of family householders; (9) educational attainment of family householders; and (10) income deficit. The sixth section compares trends in income and poverty using the official Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) and an experimental series (CPI-U-X1). The seventh section discusses the effects of revisions in the March CPS processing system. The report inlcudes 65 tables and 5 charts. The seven appendices, which comprise about half the document, include information on incorporating taxes and noncash benefits into the definition of income, estimates of income and poverty  using the CPI-U-X1, and sources and accuracy of data, as well as copies of CPS questionnaires.

The report assesses different national experiences in order to pinpoint weaknesses, trace key mistakes, and define corrective actions. The report opens with a brief historical overview of problems that have arisen in the use of community health workers and reasons for these problems. Noting that governments frequently fail to decide what community health workers are expected to achieve, the second section proposes an explicit definition of the place, role, and functions of community health workers within the context of a national health system. The report then identifies and explores eight  weaknesses, ranging from policy and organizational errors that have built failure into the system to problems of poor selection, insufficient training, inadequate motivation, and lack of reward. Strategies to overcome each problem are proposed. Specific recommendations drawn from national experiences are also included. The final sections condense the contents into a series of conclusions and recommendations intended to guide the reshaping of national programs.

The goal is to improve vocational school preparation of students and the job site training of new employees. In the first phase, the use of videotapes as a training medium is explored. A teacher and an employer analyze typical training problems that might be solved by the creation of a training videotape and written support materials. These materials are designed for specific job sites (hence the name \"Job Site-Specific Training Tapes\"). In the second phase, the teacher begins a second type of collaboration devoted to training experienced employees in the art of teaching newer employees. This phase involves conducting \"train-the-trainers\" seminars in which experienced workers  learn how to become peer teachers on the job site. The teacher's role is to demonstrate effective teaching techniques and help employees develop training lesson-plans. In the third phase, a program for mentoring new employees completes the cycle of the program. New employees would participate in a planned mentoring program. Mentors would be chosen from those employees demonstrating talents as peer teachers. The teacher could also refer students for training. The benefits of this approach include reduced training time for employees; improved productivity; enriching existing employee incentives; making learning more engaging for special needs students; and exposure to new equipment and speaker services.

An introduction gives an overview of the department's mission, previous studies of the physical plant, and this study's purpose and objectives. (The purpose was to identify or update the requests for repairs and renovations from a 1987 study and to identify new construction needs.) A section on methodology explains the instrumentation, database, data collection procedures, on-site inspections, data  compilation, cost estimation, and report design and generation used in the study. The document reports the findings in a two-page narrative and 14 tables, each of which focuses on one category of repair or renovation. Included is information on safety and health hazards such as asbestos, faulty alarm systems, and the storage of flammable items; roofs; mechanical systems; mobile units and other substandard facilities; general appearance; and cost estimates. The tables typically report a description as well as the estimated cost of a repair or construction request for a particular campus building. Following a conclusion, an appendix contains a copy of the survey instrument used in the study. (CML)",

In addition, it was recommended that a statewide inventory system, such as the one called INVENTORY FIRST-ASSESS ALL developed during the study, be used for periodic assessment of the equipment in all state technical institutes and for development of an exact profile of each institute's equipment, a discrepancy analysis, and specific recommendations for surplusing and purchasing,  based on state standards and state technical committee equipment recommendations. This model would cost $5,000 per program if 20 program areas were assessed per year, or $530 per program if all 660 state programs were assessed. (The document consists of lists of members of the technical equipment assessment steering committee, the automotive technology equipment advisory group, and the information and office technology equipment advisory group; an introduction that explains the study and the model it produced; the findings of the assessment concerning the automative technology and the information and office technology programs in six institutes; a summary; and an appendix that details the study's methodology.)

The other question addressed quality measurement and asked for appropriate process and outcome measures to ensure high quality training in future apprenticeship programs.) Among the issues discussed in part 1 are program structure and quality standards. Part 2 reports the responses to the second focus paper, which sought ways to expand the apprenticeship model significantly. Among the issues discussed in part 2 are support activities that might overcome barriers to training, the degree to which strengthened or additional linkages are needed to improve or expand apprenticeship programs, and ways the federal/state apprenticeship systems might be strengthened.

An evaluation was made of the program, using quarterly reports, program records, and telephone surveys. The evaluation assessed the relationship between participant outcomes and factors such as enrollee characteristics; the ability of the program to reach disadvantaged workers and minorities; the type and duration of program participation and costs; the satisfaction of enrollees with their jobs and of agencies with the program; the effect of rural-urban differences and state-national sponsorship; the potential of the program to transfer enrollees to unsubsidized jobs; and coordination between SCSEP and other programs.  Some of the major findings of the study were as follows: (1) SCSEP participants were more disadvantaged than the eligible population; (2) most participants were in clerical or service jobs during the program; (3) the median length of stay was 11 months, with 40 percent staying in the programs 18 months or longer; (4) little formal training was provided or sought by the participants; (5) about one-fourth of the participants were placed after 1 year; (6) upward occupational mobility did not occur for participants who were placed; (7) most placements were in subsidized jobs; (8) older enrollees were harder to place; (9) programs operated by national sponsors tended to have higher placement rates; and (10) the major benefit of the program to participants was in-program employment.

The committee found that two interdependent problems face the United States: a widening gap between the skills of the work force and the changing requirements of the economy and an opportunity to offer gainful employment to all citizens, especially those who formerly were marginally employed or on welfare. It also found that JTPA has strengths that should be retained, such as the public-private partnership, the pivotal role of the states in JTPA management, and a local system accountable to the public. However, it also found areas  in which the JTPA could be strengthened and proposed 28 recommendations to that end. Of these, seven major proposals were advanced, concerning (1) targeting programs more directly on disadvantaged persons with serious skills deficiencies; (2) individualizing services; (3) consolidating youth services and increasing funding; (4) redesigning outcome measures to reflect the goal of long-term economic self-sufficiency for participants; (5) relaxing program constraints to increase the responsiveness of the system, especially to clients with serious employment barriers; (6) improving staff training; and (7) creating public-private partnerships between JTPA and other resource programs.

Access to higher education is an important indicator. Currently, 50 percent of the Swedish adult population takes part in some organized learning activity every year and 50 percent of the student population in higher education is composed of adults 25 years old or older. Two principal channels through which adults prepare for higher education are the residential college for adults called the Swedish Folk High School and, most important, the system of municipal adult education called Kumvux. About 13 percent of the Kumvux students begin studies at levels of higher education. The National Board of Education provides an orientation  course for adult students and a national education admission test, which gives potential adult students a chance to take university courses. Compulsory school ends at age 16, but more than 90 percent of students continue to the upper secondary level and two-thirds of them take vocational programs for 2 years. A few programs aim at increasing access to higher education for &quot;earmarked&quot; groups of adult students, such as trade union members, women, technicians, and disabled students. Sweden faces a strategic decision about whether to renew the system of higher education as it is or concentrate on developing recruitment strategies for neglected or underrepresented learners.

        "description":"Impressions of Atlantic City can be used as an interesting case study for a discussion of the notion of a learning society and its survival in a policy-driven system like Sweden's and a market-influenced context such as Atlantic City. It would be interesting to draw a map of the different learning support systems that are available in various countries. It is a great challenge to analyze to what extent different societal contexts in the family, at work or at leisure, stimulate the curiosity and search for new knowledge. A majority of workplaces do not seem designed to enhance learning on the job and instead have a &quot;low competence ceiling&quot; and few expectations of individual initiatives. One's images of a learning society are greatly affected by the ideas, values, and economic  motivation of different cultural and political systems. Atlantic City is an extreme outpost of a market-driven system with a very narrow-minded curriculum. The shortages of that learning context could be used to point out the need for learning rights for citizens. Among the learning rights could be free choice of subject and learning mission (particularly relevant in the face of employer-sponsored adult education), paid educational leave, and the option of full-time studies without staking one's total financial situation and security, day care, and social support.

For example, there is an increase in the number of small businesses in the service industry, and a greater number of women than men are starting businesses. Training youth and adults for employment in existing businesses has been a traditional role for vocational education, but there has been little consideration of this training as a basis for self-employment. Given recent trends, entrepreneurship education should be incorporated into the vocational and technical curriculum. Vocational education can help prepare youth for roles as entrepreneurs as well as for employment in small businesses.

        "description":"During the last years of this century, the work force will grow more slowly, becoming older, more female, and more disadvantaged. An increasing number of minority groups and immigrants will enter the work force. Despite public demands for reform, education lags behind in preparing youth for employment. The changing work force has many implications for providers of education and training programs that prepare individuals for the workplace. Such programs must accommodate a greater diversity of learners, including women, Hispanics, Blacks, limited-English-proficient persons, and older adults. In developing effective programs for these populations, providers must address a number of specific issues in such areas as access, program quality, support services, interagency coordination,  family influence, and employers. In addition, each population has specific characteristics and needs that must be considered. Changes in the composition of the work force are exacerbated by changes in the skill requirements of jobs. However, understanding and addressing the needs of the work force of the future is a critical task for providers of employment-related education and training programs. (This report lists 17 print resources and 9 organizations that can be consulted for further information on the new work force.) (KC)",

        "description":"This document analyzes the labor market problems of displaced older workers. Chapter 1 is an introduction. Chapter 2 describes the magnitude of the problems of unemployment, discouragement, and displacement of older workers. The outcomes of unemployment are discussed, with attention to the duration of unemployment, the effects of displacement, and the effects of recessions. The special problems of older women (labor market re-entry, low wage employment, and occupational segregation) are addressed. Chapter 3 covers institutional impediments to employment of older workers, including Social Security regulations and pension plan provisions, the market for part-time jobs, and age discrimination. Chapter 4 offers conclusions. The conclusions are that (1) older workers are not as  protected from job loss as is often assumed; (2) labor supply factors may be more important in explaining labor market difference between groups than is usually credited; (3) older workers who continue with their long-term employers or at least in their same occupations increase their chances of being paid properly; (4) older workers who have college education have greater flexibility in the job market; and (5) overall economic expansion is the factor that will most strongly influence the job market for older workers. An appendix gives a method for estimating duration of unemployment. A 64-item bibliography is included. (CML)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to investigate the future of woodworking in primary schools in Zimbabwe. Although such subjects have generally been organized along the same lines as traditional academic subjects, strategies vary from one country to another and so do the problems. The investigation covered all the primary schools in Zimbabwe teaching woodworking. Data were collected using questionnaires, interviews, and such documents as course syllabi and schemes of work. Responses were obtained from 36 woodworking teachers, 4 primary school headmasters, and 3 curriculum development officers. Findings from the study indicate that some aspects of woodworking can be taught in primary school; in Zimbabwe they are taught in very few urban primary schools. The course, when taught, emphasizes  skill training, while suffering from insufficient funds and a shortage of tools, often as a result of theft. The study concludes by suggesting steps that can be taken to improve the present situation, such as increasing the financial and material support or embarking on the design of a broad primary school technical subjects course. (Document includes 35 references, questionnaires and interview forms, and examples of woodworking exercises.) (Author/KC)",

After an introduction, the first section of the report describes how the alliance originated in response to AT&amp;T employees' need to find jobs, transfer skills, and acquire new skills after court-ordered divestiture of the company in 1982. The alliance mission statement is also provided. The second section explains the relationship between the national co-executive directors, the director, and the 226 alliance local committees. The third and fourth sections describe the first alliance activity, which was to respond to the announced  closing of AT&amp;T's international operators, center in Springfield, Massachusetts, in October 1987. The alliance program model is also described. The next sections describe alliance activities that followed the announcement of layoffs at the Merrimack Valley Works in North Andover, Massachusetts and the closing of AT&amp;T facilities at Rapid City, South Dakota, both in 1987; and the transition of AT&amp;T operator services to new technology in 1988, which necessitated retraining or finding jobs for approximately 8,000 former operators. The last section emphasizes that the alliance is intended to help employees manage their careers at all times, not only when they are faced with a layoff. (CML)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to investigate the traffic engineering factors that influence speed variance and to determine to what extent speed variance affects accident rates. Detailed analyses were carried out to relate speed variance with posted speed limit, design speeds, and other traffic variables. The major factor identified was the difference between the design speed of the highway and the posted speed limit. It was determined that speed variance will be minimal if the posted speed limit is between 6 and 12 miles per hour lower than the design speed, and that outside this range, speed variance increases with increasing difference between the design speed and the posted speed limit. Other findings were that: (1) drivers tend to go at increasing speeds as roadway geometric  characteristics improve, regardless of the posted speed limit; and (2) accident rates do not necessarily increase with increase in average speed but do increase with increase in speed variance. The results can be used to estimate changes in speed variance due to changes in traffic characteristics and, therefore, can provide traffic engineers with a means for controlling speed variance due minimize accidents.

The JIF program undertook an extensive analysis of economic and work force issues which involved the following tasks: preparing a comprehensive economic analysis of Indiana and each of 12 substate regions; convening meetings of key collectors and users of labor market information; administering a survey to 7,000 business firms; conducting in-depth interviews with chief executive officers and other key personnel in firms whose competitiveness is essential to the Indiana economy; holding  interviews and discussions with educators, economic development planners, and other state and local leaders from business and labor; conducting a series of focused discussions with Indiana citizens; administering a survey to Indiana workers; and preparing an extensive communication program for the public. The resulting action plan was based on the following six strategies for success: (1) build a vocational learning system; (2) target job related learning to the jobs and skills of the future, not of the past; (3) ensure the quality of vocational education graduates so that being a vocational education graduate is synonymous with having state-of-the-art critical thinking and other future skills; (4) support and strengthen economic development activities within the state; (5) encourage  greater involvement from the private sector; and (6) communicate the need to prepare Indiana for a competitive future.

At the same time, industrial arts courses, which could provide the skills needed by more students, are less favored. Even if most new jobs are in the service and sales sectors, workers will need to understand the products they sell. Industrial arts and technology are not diametrically opposed. A great deal of common ground exists between the two possible extremes. For example, several proponents of technology believe that a hands-on, project-oriented approach is necessary in  order to reach the student. The real difference between industrial technology education and industrial arts is focus. Industrial technology education advocates want to focus on technology, its effects on society, and the effects of people on it. Industrial arts supporters prefer a focus on the materials and processes of industry. However, the current focus in the United States is on educating the whole child, and it would seem necessary to include both industrial technology and traditional skills as a sufficiently diverse background to allow students to grow and change. Therefore, the best of each approach should be selected and included in an overall strategy for educating students of all ages. (KC)",

Through an advertisement in the student newsletter, 200 students with at least 4 years of learning English were recruited. It was decided that (1) tutors would correct assignments on the day they arrived  from students; (2) tutors would provide personal comments to students to increase the feeling of personal contact; and (3) tutors would provide error-oriented tutoring. Other objectives were professionalization of commenting, keeping the system open, and decentralized handling and documentation. Evaluation of the course showed that completion rates nearly doubled compared with a similar course the year before, the only difference being the individualized correction service via personal computer.

How well do employers think vocational education is preparing its graduates? Results of studies conducted since 1985 demonstrate that employers continue to view vocational graduates favorably. The following recommendations for improving vocational education were offered by three recent studies: (1) more communication and closer collaboration between business/industry and education; (2) more and better publicity concerning vocational education so that its image  can be improved; (3) integration of reading, writing, and math instruction into vocational instruction; (4) identification of and instruction in a common core of employability skills that are transferable across occupations, including problem-solving and decision-making skills necessary for getting and keeping a job; (5) more opportunities for supervised work experience; and (6) emphasis on applied basic skills and employability skills in secondary programs and technical skills in postsecondary programs.

        "description":"Cooperative education can enhance classroom instruction by providing practical work experience that is relevant to students' career goals. Among co-op's benefits to students are increased relevance of learning and motivation for study; improved self-reliance, self-confidence, and responsibility; contacts with potential employers; and higher starting salary after graduation. Among the benefits to participating institutions are improved relationships with business and the community; enhanced student retention and graduate placement; workplace-tested curriculum; and less need to maintain expensive state-of-the-art facilities. Among the benefits to employers are effective screening and recruitment; higher employee retention and productivity; and improved public relations. Co-op  education appears to work best in metropolitan settings, in community colleges, and for students who major in engineering, business, and health occupations. However, fewer than 2 percent of all full-time postsecondary students and no more than 10 percent of all secondary vocational education students are involved in co-op programs. Some research on the effects of co-op education has been criticized for methodological weaknesses. Among the suggestions for increasing co-op's impact are to recruit larger numbers of the students most likely to benefit from it and to promote co-op as a viable alternative to heavy borrowing for college expenses.

        "description":"The numbers of women with low literacy levels, the increased labor force participation of women, and increasing literacy requirements on the job make the case for the inclusion of a literacy component in employment programs for women. Such programs should strive to be comprehensive, learner-centered, flexible, standards-based, and linked to activities that advocate public policy issues that shape literacy services. Wider Opportunities for Women, an organization that seeks to expand employment opportunities for women, developed a program model based on case studies of five literacy programs that focus on the needs of low-income single mothers. The model, which can be used with other women, attacks the many internal barriers (such as low self-esteem, self-doubt about ability to  learn, and guilt about taking time from their families for self-improvement) and external barriers (such as housing problems, financial and health difficulties, and the need for child care and transportation) faced by women in need of both literacy and job training. The five steps to the model (assessing, shaping the program, getting started, delivering services, measuring impact, and advocating public policy changes) are influenced by research showing that the comprehensive needs of the woman and her family must be addressed in order to have success in both literacy and employment readiness--because the women usually cannot focus on literacy as an isolated goal.

The following are among suggestions for institutions and employers: (1) meet regularly with panels of experts who can suggest curricula and evaluation criteria; (2) obtain the necessary tools to assess learners' current performance and to evaluate their expected performance; (3) recognize and reward learners when they have met their learning objectives; and (4) promote learning networks.

These initiatives include the provision of programs to retain jobs and encourage economic development, as well as reemployment assistance provided directly to workers in the form of retraining programs and job search workshops. The focus is on more innovative state initiatives. The monograph is organized in six chapters. The first chapter defines the problem and continues with an overview of some of the policy issues relating to worker displacement, especially the incidence of displacement and whether government should be expected to provide displaced workers with special assistance. Chapter 2 focuses on state initiatives to upgrade the vocational skills of displaced workers through classroom  and on-the-job training programs. Chapter 3 describes the component services of a broadly defined job search assistance program and discusses the results from several demonstration projects that measure the net impact of this type of assistance. Chapter 4 considers the timing and location of program intervention, including state laws, federal laws, and state onsite assistance programs. Chapter 5 includes a consideration of other initiatives, such as programs providing assistance to employee groups to save jobs, enterprise zone proposals, and British and French plans to promote entrepreneurism. The final chapter pulls together the results of the study and suggests answers to six key policy questions, concluding with a consideration of what appears to be the best mix of programs to meet the  needs of displaced workers.

It investigates under what conditions educational programs are likely to be effective and which are likely to shift resources without any net effects on employment, wage levels, productivity, or economic growth. This six-chapter issue paper examines several interpretations of economic development and analyzes their implications for the role of vocational education. The oldest approach to economic development, luring employment from neighboring localities or states (&quot;smokestack chasing&quot;), is the subject of Chapter 1. This notion has been superseded in many places by a superior one--that regions should increase employment by generating  new employment. The different ways of enhancing employment in the aggregate are explained from either a macroeconomic approach (Chapter 2) or a microeconomic approach (Chapter 3). A new role for vocational education--customized training for specific firms--is the subject of Chapter 4, and technology transfer programs and small business development centers are the topic of Chapter 5. In the concluding chapter, these conceptions of economic development clarify what education programs can and cannot do to enhance economic development and clarify the conditions under which vocational education can be truly effective as a mechanism for economic development. An appendix discusses the microeconomics of vocational education. A 36-item reference list is included. (KC)",

The following are among the predictions concerning  educational attainment: (1) 85 percent of those 25 years and older will have completed 4 years of high school; (2) more than 30 percent of Blacks and 50 percent of Hispanics will not have completed high school; and (3) 24 percent of the region's adult population will have completed 4 or more years of college. The following are among the predictions concerning employment and the labor force: (1) there could be 10.6 million new jobs in the region and 9 million more workers; (2) all states in the region will have experienced declines in agriculture employment and rapid gains in service industries; and (3) 64 percent of every 100 new workers will be women, and 23 of every 100 will be nonwhite.

Following an introduction, the first three sections answer the questions What are learning disabilities? How do learning disabilities affect reading? and How is a learning disability diagnosed? A section on how to teach reading to learning-disabled students includes eight general points to remember. The description of Educational Diagnosis provided by the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit (ALBSU) in the United Kingdom explains the use of a learning history, miscue analysis, spelling error analysis, and writing analysis. The section on learning about learning lists ways in which good readers use metacognition as they read.  Metacognition skills that are covered in ALBSU learning support classes are listed. The section on learning styles directs literacy coordinators to help their tutors deal with this aspect of teaching learning disabled adults. The conclusion includes the notion that much of what is useful for adults with learning disabilities is useful for all adult learners. The document includes a 17-item annotated bibliography and appendices that explain miscue analysis and summarize the Fernald multisensory approach, strategies for teaching learning disabled adults, and spelling teaching techniques.

The second chapter explains the five stages, each with multiple steps, in the consortium development process. Chapter 3 tells how to create the structure for interaction among consortium members and others, including determining the scope of interaction, creating operating procedures, creating a business  image, removing the risk associated with the consortium, determining member capabilities, and using systems analysis to examine the procedures for interaction once they are set up. Chapter 4 addresses how to accomplish the interaction, once its structure has been established. Among the topics discussed are pricing, advertising, product planning, and distribution. Chapter 5 tells how to evaluate the consortium so that members will know whether it is beneficial to their facilities. The appendices include an eight-item bibliography and work sheets intended to help readers make marketing decisions relevant to their particular consortium. (CML)",

The exemplary schools studied are in New York City, Chicago, and a suburb of Los Angeles (Torrance). Ten success factors were identified: (1) a safe and orderly environment conducive to teaching and learning; (2) a businesslike attitude that creates an atmosphere of constructive energy in the school; (3) a warm and caring school climate; (4) an admissions process that makes students feel special and that is based  on student interest in the career specialty or set of subjects and not solely on student test scores; (5) a dual mission--to prepare each student for an occupation and for college; (6) high expectations for all students to succeed, accompanied by attempts to minimize grouping of students by ability; (7) a curriculum organized around an industry or a discrete set of subjects; (8) the integration of theory and practice in instruction; (9) strong links with business and industry and with local institutions of higher education; and (10) leadership in the office of the principal that is at the same time inspiring, sensitive, and firm.

The study examined the recidivism trends among inmates released after completion of vocational-technical training, compared to inmates who did not receive such training. The vocational-technical group consisted of all participants who had completed a training program and who were released between January 1, 1982 and July 31, 1986 (2,372 inmates). The comparison group, released during the same period, consisted of 9,851 released inmates. The study found that of the vo-tech group released during the study period, 26  percent were reincarcerated, compared to 22 percent of the comparison group. The study concluded that further research is needed to determine why the recidivism rate is higher for the vo-tech group and to determine what other factors, such as age, classification, need areas, and criminal history, might account for the higher recidivism of the treated group.

Data were gathered for 10 educational services programs through logs prepared by teachers and principals. Results were reported in five parts: (1) information concerning the need for educational programs in the Department of Corrections based on the test data provided by psychological staff; (2) a summary of the delivery of educational services to inmates in terms of the number of inmates served; (3) a summary of movement through educational programs; (4) information about the individuals who participated; and (5) the results of the quarterly test  data as a measure of program impact. The study concluded that although a great many educational services had been provided, the completion rate was very low. It recommended a series of action steps to improve educational services for incarcerated persons in Oklahoma.

New Jersey received $1.5 million from this program for antiviral drugs for low-income people with AIDS and AIDS Related Complex lacking other public assistance. The Emergency Retrovir Reimbursement Program (ERRP) provided 175 person-years of Aziodothymidine (AZT). Other sources of funds for AZT in New Jersey included General Assistance, Medicaid, and a Pharmaceutical Assistance Program for the Aged and Disabled (PAAD). The ERRP was arranged to maximize convenience for applicants. With federal approval, income levels for ERRP were substantially higher than for other  assistance programs. The program was publicized widely; application processing took 2 weeks. The existing mechanism for reviewing applications for Medicaid and PAAD was used for ERRP. The centralized processing allowed non-qualifying clients to get on other appropriate programs. Approximately 15 percent of those applying for ERRP in its first year were approved for Medicaid or PAAD coverage of AZT. The ERRP also covered co-payment for AZT required of clients with third party coverage who met income criteria. The program made direct payments for AZT to pharmacies. Characteristics of enrollees in the various AZT entitlement programs in New Jersey are described. (Author/ABL)",

Most of these young mothers fail to finish high school, thereby embarking on marginal, nonproductive lives characterized by low earning power, long-term welfare dependency, more unplanned-for babies, and high-risk infants. In 1982 the Board of Cooperative Educational Services of Nassau County established the Teenage Pregnancy Program (TAP) to address the problems which put these young people at risk. TAP was a multidimensional program tailored to the needs of pregnant teenagers and oriented towards building positive futures. By providing intensive academic and psychological support, TAP aimed to help students develop self-confidence, better family relationships, parenting skills, and success in  school. A program evaluation of 71 mothers previously served by TAP demonstrated the effectiveness of the program. Of the mothers served by TAP, 40% had graduated from high school, most had minimal substance abuse, and there was a low rate of giving birth to additional children. The results revealed a critical need for sustaining young mothers in the program over a longer time, i.e., beyond the school year in which they gave birth. (ABL)",

        "description":"This study considered broadly the problem of homelessness by examining the housing difficulties of one at-risk population, the elderly, who presented needs to one city emergency service agency. A random sampling of some 500 emergency case files identified the prevalence of a wide range of emergency situations affecting the city's elderly. At least 50 percent had problems immediately related to housing: evictions, landlord-tenant disputes, utility shutoffs, deplorable housing conditions, need for temporary or emergency shelter, and being chronically undomiciled. From 126 cases involving either need for shelter or deplorable housing conditions, researchers were able to develop 91 case studies. Three risk factors for homelessness were found to be: (1) living alone and lacking social  supports; (2) diminished mental functioning; and (3) having very low incomes. Coping patterns which were identified included daily life pattern, degree of autonomy, nature and meanings of attachments, denial, lifestyle theme, external factors, and overall ability to cope. The study revealed the magnitude of the deprivation some elderly individuals endure; the extent to which agency workers' behaviors, options, and interests are limited due to finite resources; and the importance of informal, long-term, often mutually satisfying helping relationships maintained by people in neighborhoods.

        "description":"Homelessness is growing among the elderly as it is among every other age cohort in America, but the elderly appear to be underrepresented. This underrepresentation is puzzling, since the elderly appear to have unique vulnerabilities to homelessness. This study explored the connection between the growing shortage of low rent housing, the unique housing related problems of the elderly, and homelessness itself. A sample of seniors who had experienced serious housing problems was identified from persons who had been served by the Chicago Department of Human Services Emergency Services. Two &quot;housing risk&quot; samples (N=91) were identified: those who had needed temporary housing and those who had lived in deplorable conditions. These at-risk persons were compared with similarly aged  low-income residents of Single Rooms Occupancy units throughout the city who had not necessarily experienced housing emergencies. The results indicated that: (1) shelter use by the elderly was usually very short-term; (2) a significant proportion of the elderly were vulnerable to loss of their homes; (3) factors that precipitate the loss of and incapacity to manage their homes included living alone and lacking social supports, diminished mental functioning, and very low income; and (4) there was a shrinking supply of low-income housing and scarcity of supported living environments. These findings suggest a need for more innovative and intensive outreach and service delivery to elderly persons before their housing condition or the effects of various losses force them to lose their  residence also.

The use of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III (DSM-III) diagnostic categories for depression with children and adolescents was investigated using archival classification data spanning an 8-year time period. Records were located for inpatients (N=260) and outpatients (N=128) ranging in age from 5 to 18 years who received one of five DSM-III diagnoses for depression. The overall sex ratio for the sample was approximately equal. However, sex differences were identified within specific DSM-III diagnostic categories. Children and preadolescents rarely received a diagnosis of depression, whereas Major Depressive and Comorbid disorders were  diagnosed at a higher rate after puberty and required inpatient care. The overuse of the Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood diagnostic category in this sample suggests that modified adult diagnostic criteria are not adequate for the classification of depression in childhood and adolescence. Developmentally appropriate and empirically sound diagnostic criteria are needed to determine the etiology and sequelae of these disorders. (Author/ABL)",

The findings, which cover the high school classes of 1975 through 1988, come from an ongoing national research and reporting program entitled \"Monitoring the Future: A Continuing Study of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth.\" Two of the major topics which continue to be included in this series are the current prevalence of drug use among American high school seniors and trends in use by seniors since the study began in 1975. Distinctions among important demographic subgroups in the population are made, and this year for the first time distinctions among various socioeconomic levels are included. Also reported are data on  grade of first use, trends in use at lower grade levels, intensity of drug use, attitudes and beliefs among seniors concerning various types of drug use, and their perceptions of certain relevant aspects of the social environment. Data on the prevalence and trends in drug use among young adults (late teens to the late twenties) who have completed high school are also incorporated into this report series. The continuing epidemic of cocaine use among young adults makes this an age group of particular importance. Two chapters in this report present data on college students specifically. Trends are presented on drug use among college students since 1980--the first year in which a good national sample of college students 1 to 4 years past high school was available from the follow-up survey.

Task perception was treated as a between-subjects variable in this study. Subjects (N=120) were undergraduate psychology college students who responded to a questionnaire measuring self-esteem, labeled an anagram-solving tasks as difficult or easy in two work periods, and had their task performance measured on the anagrams. Subjects set  lower goals in the difficult condition than they did in the easy condition in the first period, however, no difference was found in the second period. High self-esteem subjects had higher self-efficacy than those with low self-esteem. For high self-esteem subjects, feedback had strong impacts on subjects' liking of a difficult task, whereas for those with low self-esteem, feedback had strong impacts on subjects' liking of an easy task. After positive feedback of performing a difficult task, those with high self-esteem increased their task liking, whereas those with low self-esteem decreased their liking. Subjects also showed higher intrinsic motivation after positive feedback than after negative feedback. (ABL)",

A stratified random sample of children ages 6 to 11 was drawn from registration lists of all public, private, and parochial schools. Of 79 schools, 56 were sampled, and 54 agreed to participate in the survey. Questionnaires were distributed with six phases of notification and follow-up for parents, and three for teachers. Parents (N=822) and teachers (N=501) completed questionnaires covering such areas as demographic and social characteristics; emotional and behavioral symptomatolgy; perceived need for services and service utilization profiles; barriers to treatment; and academic data on school performance. The results indicated that 11 percent  of parents in this inner city population reported at least one barrier to treatment, with the most commonly cited barrier being that the parent did not know how to obtain services for their child, followed by cost of services. A second set of descriptive analyses examined the profile of treatment barriers among children who were screened as potentially needing mental health services. At least one barrier to treatment was reported by parents for 30 percent of children who were screened as needing mental health services. Lack of knowledge about services and cost were the most frequently reported barriers. The results suggest that there are distinct different treatment barriers experienced by different high-risk populations in the inner city. (ABL)",

        "description":"It has been estimated that 20 to 38% of females and 10% of males have been sexually abused prior to age 18. This study reviewed the treatment literature to determine any differential interests in the topic of child sexual abuse across the disciplines of social work, psychology, psychiatry, and medicine. Ten professional journals, considered representative of these four disciplines or likely to contain a high frequency of articles on sexual abuse, were reviewed for articles relevant to child or adolescent sexual abuse. Articles addressing sexual abuse were reviewed for professional affiliation of the senior author; signs, symptoms, and effects of ongoing or past abuse; and treatment approaches. One issue from each volume of each journal was also randomly selected to gather  baseline data on professional disciplines of all authors publishing in that journal. A total of 118 articles focusing directly on the signs, symptoms, effects, and treatment of child sexual abuse were found. A total of 1,327 articles were sampled to form the baseline for professional disciplines. The findings from chi-square analyses revealed a differential responsiveness to sexual abuse across professional disciplines. Articles from psychiatry and medicine were represented in the child abuse literature to the same degree as they were represented in the literature in general. Social work contributed 12% of the articles in the baseline sample and almost 33% of the sexual abuse papers reviewed. Psychology provided 38% of articles in the baseline sample, but only 18% of the sexual abuse  articles. (Tables are included which list signs and symptoms of ongoing abuse, signs and symptoms of past abuse, parental signs of child sexual abuse, and therapeutic interventions described in the sample. Two bibliographies are included: one lists the 118 articles reviewed in the study, the other lists 85 related references.) (NB)",

Chapter 1, An Overview of Elderly Housing, provides an overview of the demographics of the aging population and their housing needs by examining differences between owners and renters, the issue of housing affordability, and the impact of changing health on housing. Chapter 2, Planning for Elderly Housing, discusses general housing characteristics, current and future, as well as elderly housing needs as part of the planning process.  Chapter 3, Getting Started: Tools and Techniques, describes census and other data and reference materials, and techniques for using existing data to identify characteristics of the city's elderly population. Chapter 4, Techniques to Assess Elderly Housing Needs, describes special housing considerations of the elderly and methods for measuring degree of elderly housing needs in the community. Methods for assessing the elderly's health and wealth, their living expenses, the compatibility of neighborhoods, and the suitability of the housing unit are described. Chapter 5, Expanding Choices in Living Arrangements, describes some of the emerging alternative living arrangements for older persons. Chapter 6, Developing a Community Strategy for Elderly Housing, addresses strategies which a  community may take to respond to elderly housing needs. Sixteen sections of the appendices include: major programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to assist the elderly; state property tax programs for the elderly; and sample calculation for estimating the housing tenure (owner/renter) of elderly occupied units.

This study examined the bereavement patterns of widows whose husbands had died from various causes including cancer, heart disease, and suicide. Subjects (N=117) were randomly assigned to a Bereavement Crisis Intervention Group, Social Adjustment Group or Control Group. The results indicated that feelings of loneliness, depression, and guilt were common in all subjects, but two of the three suicide survivors wished for, as well as developed a fear of, death. The overwhelming feeling expressed by widows was loneliness which became intolerable at nighttime. In the area of socialization widows' reactions revolved  around the family, children, friends, co-workers, and neighbors. The need for intimacy became unfulfilled. They also reported their children suddenly became indifferent to them and considered them useless. Material and economic issues also confronted the widows. The symptoms suffered by the three suicide survivors were more serious and overwhelming compared with non-suicide survivor widows. Widows of suicide victims may have special psychosocial needs best served in a homogeneous group in which all group members are suicide survivors. A second study is proposed which would evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic activity that would alleviate depression, psychological distress, grief, and social isolation in suicide survivors. (ABL)",

This predominantly low-income minority population had a high incidence of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) and teenage pregnancies. The spread of HIV from IVDAs to their sexual partners is a known mechanism for viral access to the larger, heterosexual, non-IVDA population. In order to understand the population to plan an educational intervention, the community's beliefs concerning the transmission and prevention of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) were assessed. By using a population proportionate sampling technique, responses were obtained by high and low income  subjects, teenagers, adults, and older people. Subjects (N=301) responded to questionnaires. The main findings of the report were: (1) nearly one in three black residents worried about AIDS all the time or several times a day while only one in 25 whites did; (2) two out of three people thought one could get AIDS from receiving blood and 43 percent thought one could get AIDS from donating blood; (3) 15 percent thought it was possible to catch AIDS by shaking hands; (4) 22 percent thought sharing needles with friends was not a risky behavior; (5) 28 percent did not think abstinence lowered risk; (6) 36 percent never use condoms; and (7) one of three would not refuse sex without a condom. The educational intervention will be designed based on survey results. The Dixwell AIDS questionnaire is  appended. (ABL)",

        "description":"Surveys of married and dating couples find that women assault their male partners at about the same rate as men assault female partners. When assaults serious enough to cause death were examined, it was found that in contrast to the extreme rarity of homicide by women outside the family, women kill their male partners at a rate that approaches the rate at which men kill their female partners. These findings based on family survey data and homicide data are in marked contrast to the findings from studies using data produced in the context of the criminal justice system on non-lethal assaults. The criminal justice data yield low rates of domestic assault by men, and even lower rates of domestic assault by women. The criminal justice data are so low because those rates are based on  differential definitions of the appropriateness of reporting incidents to the police or to a National Crime Survey interviewer. Most domestic assaults by men, and almost all domestic assaults by women are filtered out because there is no injury and the victim therefore does not consider them a \"real crime.\" In addition, the rates for women are particularly low because both male victims and the police may be especially reluctant to invoke the criminal justice system against women who assault their husbands. However, women produce less injury than do men. Domestic assaults by women need to be added to efforts to prevent assaults on women due to the moral wrongness of the act, the modeling of assaultive behavior, and to reduce the danger to women themselves. Further research is needed on  gender differences in the objectives, meaning, and consequences of domestic assaults. (ABL)",

This study evaluated both of these assumptions. In the first part of the study, normal weight women were divided into groups of unrestrained nondieters, restrained nondieters, and restrained dieters. Subjects' food consumption in a standard forced paradigm (Herman and Mack, 1975) was tested. A significant Restraint/Dieting x Preload interaction was found. While restrained dieters ate much more in the no preload than in the preload condition, both nondieting groups showed the opposite tendency. In the second part of the study, the hypothesis that dieting accounts for the eating behavior of overweight individuals was  tested. The normal weight subjects described above were reclassified as dieters or nondieters (ignoring restraint level) and groups of dieting and nondieting overweight individuals were run through the preload manipulation (creating a Dieting x Preload x Weight factorial). A three-way interaction was found, indicating that dieting had different effects on eating regulation in normal weight and overweight subjects. Among normal weight subjects, nonpreloaded dieters overate; among overweight subjects, nonpreloaded nondieters overate. (Author)",

A survey administered in 1987 to Iowa students in grades 6, 8, 10, and 12 focused on substance use, parent modeling behaviors, parent normative standards, peer modeling behaviors, school normative standards, perceived school influence, and intervening variables related to adolescent preferences and norms. The findings of the 1987-88 Iowa Study of Alcohol and Drug Attitudes and Behaviors among Youth will be presented in three reports focusing on: (1) normative data for 1987 and relevant comparisons with previous  studies; (2) individual district reports of student responses to selected survey items; and (3) normative data packets for the four size categories of districts. This report presents normative data for the 1987 survey and comparisons with prior studies. An introduction is followed by a description of study procedures and sections on findings for self-reported substance use and norms, external influences, and personal variables. A summary and recommendations section presents findings relevant to four research questions dealing with the present status of substance use, attitudes, and knowledge; important trends in these areas; the major influences in a youth's decision to use substances; and actions suggested by the findings for school persons.

It describes the number and characteristics of delinquency and status offense cases disposed during 1985 by courts with juvenile jurisdiction and addresses some important national characteristics, trends and issues. Chapters 1 and 2 present national estimates of the delinquency and status offense cases formally handled by courts with juvenile jurisdiction in 1985. They provide a detailed portrait of these cases including the offenses involved, sources of referral, detention practices and case dispositions. The picture is based on analyses of over 337,000 individual case records from 1,133 courts with  jurisdiction over 49% of the nation's juvenile population at risk and court-level statistics from an additional 345 courts with jurisdiction over 10% of the nation's juvenile population at risk. A description of the statistical procedures used to generate these estimates is found in Appendix A. Chapter 3, Data Briefs, contains a large set of subnational tables which shed light on many aspects of juvenile court delinquency and status offense caseloads not found in the first two chapters. Appendix B contains a glossary of terms used in the report. Appendix C presents a listing of the number of delinquency/status and dependency cases handled by individual juvenile courts in 1985. Each data set is footnoted to indicate the source of the data and its unit or units of count. Sixty-eight tables  and 52 figures are included. (NB)",

        "description":"Past research has shown that a relatively small number of youths are responsible for a large proportion of the offenses committed by juveniles, leading juvenile justice practitioners to ask what the courts can do to intervene early to deter these youth from committing further serious delinquent acts. To answer this question, a research study was undertaken to examine, from the court's perspective, the delinquent careers of chronic juvenile offenders. The research involved the analysis of the court career and offense patterns of nearly 70,000 youth in Phoenix, Arizona and the state of Utah. The findings suggest that juvenile courts have an opportunity to intervene in the lives of a large percentage of youth at a time when problems are apparent and also have the authority to effect  change. The finding that a youth referred to court for a second time before the age of 16 could, with a high degree of certainty, be considered a chronic offender implies that the courts should not wait until the youth has returned for the fourth or fifth time before taking strong action. This report describes the research conducted in Arizona and Utah and the findings revealed. Chapter 1 discusses the need for court career research. Chapter 2 explains the sources of juvenile court career data. Chapter 3 describes youth with juvenile court careers; chapter 4 explores the development of juvenile court careers; and chapter 5 characterizes juvenile court career types. Chapter 6 presents a summary and conclusions. The appendix explains the recoding of offense codes into reporting codes.  Numerous tables display the statistical data. (NB)",

It is based upon empirical research findings from books, papers presented at professional meetings, doctoral dissertations, works in progress, and more than 75 articles in professional journals. Most of the research referred to has been conducted during the past 10 years. The report examines three categories of missing children: runaways, victims of parental kidnapping, and victims of nonfamily abduction. It focuses on five interrelated issues: prevalence, dynamics, risk factors, effects, and future research. Although the primary focus of this report is on forms of sexual exploitation that occur after a child is missing, studies of  sexually abused children who subsequently become missing are also reviewed. An executive summary and introduction and a list of definitions of terms are followed by nine sections which focus on: (1) how many children are missing; (2) the sexual exploitation of missing children; (3) runaways and other forms of sexual exploitation; (4) long-term effects on runaways of sexual exploitation; (5) sexual exploitation of parentally kidnapped victims; (6) short- and long-term effects of sexual victimization on parentally kidnapped children; (7) sexual exploitation of nonfamily abducted children; (8) short- and long-term effects of sexual exploitation on nonfamily abducted children; and (9) a research agenda for examining the sexual exploitation of missing children.

The findings revealed that the content of networks and perceived support from network members differed by parenting status; pregnant teenagers were more involved with peers while parenting teenagers were more involved with family. Further, parenting adolescents received more  support from family members than did pregnant adolescents. The differences between pregnant and parenting teenagers appear to be linked to the construct of status transitions. In addition, black respondents were more likely to receive support from family than were white respondents. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Adolescent offspring of alcoholics have been found to have higher alcohol reinforcement expectancies than do teenagers from nonalcoholic families. In particular, those with a positive family history of alcoholism expect more cognitive and motor enhancement with alcohol consumption. This study examined the alcohol expectancies of 58 matched pairs of young adult males from alcoholic and nonalcoholic families to ascertain whether a similar expectancy pattern exists and the degree to which expectancies can differentiate family history groups. All subjects completed a questionnaire on demographic background; drinking history; personal and family psychiatric history; and past history of medical, drug, and alcohol related life problems. Subjects also completed a shortened version of the  Alcohol Expectancy Question. The results indicated that even when individually matched on demographic and drinking pattern variables, men with alcoholic fathers expect slightly more reinforcement from alcohol, particularly in the realm of sexual enhancement, than did peers with no alcoholic family members. The discriminant function analysis using expectancy items as predictors correctly classified 71% of the men from alcoholic facmilies and 85% of men from nonalcoholic families. Theoretical and research implications of these findings are discussed. (Author/NB)",

It notes that the incidence of non-fatal suicide attempts in children is even harder to determine than is the incidence of suicide. Studies are cited which suggest that, while preadolescent boys appeared to attempt suicide with much greater frequency that girls, the level of lethality in younger boys and girls was about equal. Reasons for a child to attempt suicide are considered, including self-punishment, escape, reunion with a significant other, rectification of an unbearable life situation, and avoidance of an impending punishment. Factors in suicidal behavior which are addressed include the child's conceptualization of  death, depression, and familial factors (parental depression, family history of suicidal behavior, abuse, family instability, and life stress). It is concluded that there is no one cause of suicidal behavior in children, but that a number of determinants are involved. It is recommended that future research concentrate on providing a more accurate calculation of the incidence of suicidal behavior in children. Thirty-two references are included. (NB)",

This study was undertaken to determine whether these findings would hold true using attitudinal measures (observing someone being touched rather than actually being touched). Subjects were 15 male and 15 female employees of a data processing service. Subjects examined a photograph of a man and woman standing at a normal conversation distance and were told to consider this photograph as a 4 on a 1 to 7 scale. Subjects were shown eight additional  photographs and asked to rate them as being more negative or positive than the first photograph. These photographs varied by gender of individuals in the photograph and by degree of touching (shaking hands, hugging). Findings were consistent with previous behavioral studies in that high intimacy appeared to be more pleasant in the eyes of others when the participants were of the opposite sex than when they were of the same sex. Reactions to same sex intimacy was affected by the sex of the observer and high same sex intimacy led to less positive ratings than did low same sex intimacy. The significant findings were due to hugging males being viewed more negatively by males than any other type of interaction. The results support the contention that people hold a less conservative attitude  when observing others interact in a touching situation than when they are the object of the touch. (NB)",

Subjects were 1,465 students from 22 schools in three regions of New York State who were in the seventh grade during the 1985-1986 school year. Students completed questionnaires in September 1985, January 1986, and May 1987. Data were obtained on these factors: basic demographic information; self-reported use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana; and various measures of cognitive, attitudinal, and personality variables believed to be correlated with the use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. Data from Time 1 and Time 3 suggest substantial and interesting gender differences in the correlates of substance  use. Differences were especially apparent when examining alcohol use as compared to the use of tobacco and marijuana, suggesting that the roots of the difficulties men have with alcohol are probably to be found in adolescence. Decision-making skill was negatively correlated with the use of tobacco and alcohol for boys only. Self-esteem, problem-solving confidence, and academic esteem were related to the use of all three substances for girls only. Risk-taking, a lack of self-control, and an inability to refuse requests from peers were related to substance use for both genders. These findings have implications for prevention efforts with this age group. (NB)",

        "description":"An attempt to integrate the career counseling outcome literature (Spokane & Oliver, 1983) indicated that career counseling was definitely beneficial overall. Subsequent updating and additional analyses of the literature confirmed the usefulness of career counseling and led to further findings. Intensity of treatment (\"time on task\") was found to be a very important variable. Although individual career counseling was considered more effective per unit of time from the perspective of the individual client, group approaches were found to be generally more economical. A lack of standardized measures for many outcomes of interest was revealed, and a particular need for behavioral measures and cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness measures was found. Practitioners are encouraged to  assess the outcomes of their career counseling and to follow up clients who appear to have terminated prematurely. This paper reviews the results of this research integration effort and notes some implications of the findings for enhancing career counseling interventions in the areas of diagnosis, treatment, outcome assessment, and follow-up.

Where Are We Going?: An Annotated GSA Bibliography of Aging and the Humanities&quot; reveals three principal characteristics. First, with the exception of some literature on spiritual well-being, the material cannot be dated or sequenced on the basis of content, indicating that approaches to religion and aging are diffuse. The analysis reveals that only 3% of the authors had published three or more pieces and there was neither a group of authors in dialogue nor a coherent body of literature usually associated with an identifiable professional field. Second, spiritual well-being began as a concept rooted in dependence on God and relationship to a community of  faith, became secularized, and emerged as a highly individual understanding of aging. This suggests that the term became both weaker and more individual over the 11-year span from 1975 to 1986. This shift is blamed on: the attempt by the 1981 White House Conference on Aging to broaden the base of support; a shift in the political scene; the use of the term in a more individual way causing it to become part of the prevailing cultural ethos; and the economic changes since the time the term was coined. Third, with few exceptions, meaning and value are spoken of in personal or individual ways rather than in dialogue with and grounded in collective systems, reinforcing the identification of meaning as an individual reality. Religious meaning, however, is socially constructed and must be  socially supported. (NB)",

The training program, designed as five 90-minute group learning modules, was implemented in two Western Pennsylvania nursing homes over a 5-month period. Topics covered within the training program included basic principles of behavioral management as they apply to depressed, disoriented, and agitated resident behaviors. Performance on eight mental health questionnaires, administered serially as pretests and posttests for each of the training modules, was used to evaluate nurse aides' acquisition and retention of this new knowledge. For three of the five training sessions, there was a significant pretest to posttest improvement (p&lt;.0001). In  addition, one test was administered twice: once at the beginning of the training program and again at the end of the training program, 4 months later. There was a significant improvement on this measure (p&lt;.0001). Several of these test scores were also found to correlate significantly with caregiver self-ratings of their tendency to use behavior management skills in caregiving. The results have implications for improving the caregiving knowledge of nursing assistants, improving actual caregiving behaviors, and determining the limitations of inservice education in the nursing home context.

Particularly in studies of older adults, sampling effects can adversely affect attempts to estimate true ontogenetic change. Selective attrition effects were examined in 636 Pennsylvania adults (138 males, 498 females), aged 58-91, who were tested in 1978-1979; and 232 subjects who returned and were retested in 1986-1987. On both occasions, subjects received measures of intellectual ability, locus of control beliefs, and attitudes toward aging. Comparison of the Time One ability performances of returning and non-returning subjects indicated significantly lower performance levels for dropouts on measures of Verbal Ability, Figural Relations, Induction, Experiential Evaluation,  Memory Span, and Perceptual Speed (p<.05). Logistic multiple regression procedures identified significant control belief and demographic predictors of attrition status (\"R\"=.25) and attrition type (\"R\"=.327). The group of non-returning subjects tended to be older, contained a higher proportion of males, were more likely to believe that chance controlled intellectual performance, had lower intellectual achievement motivation levels, were less likely to be employed, and reported lower levels of subjective health. The effects of these predictors were partialled out of the abilities showing significant attrition effects; this eliminated the significant attrition effect on four of the six abilities. These results suggest a possible procedure for examining selective attrition effects and  quantifying sample bias in longitudinal studies of the elderly. (Author/NB)",

Response rates were highest for those residents living in board and care facilities and lowest for those residents living in skilled nursing facilities. Global satisfaction measures produced little variance across facilities. More than 70% of the respondents in all facilities reported being satisfied with their current living arrangements. Items with lower  ratings included questions about the variety of foods served, the amount of involvement residents had with other nursing home residents, and the availability of varied recreational activities. Feelings of personal autonomy were found to be directly related to the level of nursing home care, with skilled care residents feeling much less autonomy than residents of board and care facilities. Lack of privacy was mentioned as a cause for dissatisfaction by one-quarter of the residents in facilities with semi-private rooms. Information provided by the survey of nursing home residents was used by facility administrators to prepare a series of in-service education programs for staff, develop performance expectations, and focus staff attention on overall program quality.

What has failed to occur in this debate is any movement away from the simplistic claims for improving reading instruction. Some teachers have already discovered ways to combine the strengths of several approaches to reading.

In both experiments, the experimental (expanded LEA) and the control (traditional LEA) conditions were implemented by the same two teachers. A total of 44 kindergarteners were involved in the first experiment (22 experimental and 22 control) and a total of 47 kindergarteners were involved in the second experiment  (23 experimental and 24 control). The two LEA conditions differed only in the kinds of follow-up activities associated with each of the conditions. The results of both experiments favored the use of an expanded LEA. The oral cloze results of experiment 1 revealed significant differences between the experimental and control groups on beginning (p&lt;.05), medial (p&lt;.01), and total cloze (p&lt;.01) scores. In experiment 2, the experimental and control groups differed significantly (p&lt;.05) on beginning, medial, and total cloze scores.

Results indicated that the use of an expanded LEA is likely to be more effective than the traditional LEA in facilitating development of  listening comprehension skills.

At the text level, the few-argument strategy versus the many-argument strategy and the physical and the syntactic strategies were evaluated. The absolute proportion of the lag effect was small but was greater for fast than for slow readers. If readers exhibited lagged processing for words, there was an expectation that some higher level processes would also occur with a lag. Analysis showed that there was no difference between reader groups in the processing of new argument nouns. Reading times for both fast and slow readers increased with the number of new argument nouns in the sentences. There was a trade-off  between reading speed and comprehension. In every experiment and every condition, the retention scores were poorer for the fast readers than for the slow readers. There were specific reading patterns in fast readers that were not reflected in the average profile of readers. Results demonstrated how important it is to examine comprehension strategies for different reader groups. Results indicated that readers do not necessarily pause at clause and sentence boundaries.

The paper presents four higher reasoning skills and one classroom activity for each: (1) synthesis or summary; (2) analysis or problem solving; (3) argumentation; and (4) experimentation. The paper concludes that it is beginning to become apparent that the nationwide tests which reveal students'  inabilities to invoke higher reasoning skills rest upon educators' not knowing what those higher skills are and how to put them into the classroom.

Straight news and sports stories can be used to teach or reinforce the skills of attending to detail, comparing and contrasting, categorizing, determining the main idea, understanding vocabulary, sequencing, establishing a purpose for reading, cause and effect, drawing conclusions/predicting outcomes, critical reading, and dictionary skills. The editorials are well suited to teach and reinforce the skill of distinguishing between fact and opinion. Skills which can be taught or reinforced through the use of the editorial cartoons include: making inferences, drawing conclusions, understanding symbols, summarizing, and critical thinking. The  classified ads, comics, and the index can also be used to teach and reinforce basic reading skills. The ability to read and interpret the visual displays presented in newspapers is important if students are to become independent learners and thinkers. The key to using the newspaper to enhance instruction lies in teachers' abilities to be creative and in their abilities to see a match between the objective to be taught and the type of article which best fits the intended objective.

Through use of this model the teacher can encourage the student to make judgments, to use these initial judgment makings as materials for discussion about an individual's art of judgment, and to differentiate a well-made judgment from a poorly made one. The six steps include: clarifying the meaning; bracketing and numbering relevant sentences or phrases; diagramming the argument; evaluating the evidence in the argument; evaluating the inferences; and assessing the overall soundness of the argument.  These six skills necessarily require textbook reading, some homework and class discussion, some of which is necessarily didactic, in a sequence whose steps are to be justified, whereby the student may practice skills and acquire proficiency.

Results indicated that a connection did exist between the  Carter human rights policy and coverage of Central and South America.

According to the paper, the Agent has developed as a consequence of the shift from object (culture) as governor to mentality as governor of human action. The paper argues that controlling the Agent in a text analysis is the only possible way of controlling consciousness. The main point put forward in the paper is that consciousness is  bound to syntax, and thus it follows that lexically carried linguistic information cannot be used for intentionally based text analyses.

The inadequacies of the psycholinguistic theories of language processing which rest on the assumption according to which language is the expression of a relatively autonomous cognitive activity are highlighted in the interpretation of metaphors as anomalous sentences. The rejection of the thesis of the anomalous character of metaphors because of the acknowledgement of the role of the semantic component of words, of the extra-linguistic context in which metaphors are produced, and more generally of the pragmatic factors influencing comprehension, invited the new view according to which metaphors are to be conceived as conveying some cognitive reorganization. The  ecological approach to cognitive activity stressing the role played by the &quot;events&quot; in modeling comprehension can be regarded as the best theoretical frame according to which it is possible to establish a link between language and perception and redefine the whole problem of language use.

        "description":"A process-oriented freshman composition instructor who stresses invention, drafting, and revision can simultaneously integrate a form of grammatical instruction. Various methods and strategies, both from experience and research on grammar from the classical to the contemporary era, suggest such a creative integration. First, the teaching of grammatical structures should proceed with a minimum of terminology in order to minimize student confusion. Second, dictation is a good way to integrate production with proofreading. The instructor dictates a passage laden with troublesome forms, either having students write exactly what they hear and then correct it or having students consciously think and proofread as they write. Third, numerous creatively designed and grammatically oriented  follow-ups to writing assignments also work well to bring production and editing together. A fourth strategy includes imitation, in which students match sentence types with their own original sentences. This encourages students to generate structure as well as an appropriate context. Finally, allowing students to discover their own grammatical problems and solutions is a valuable integration of grammar and writing. (KEH)",

        "description":"A study explored the general patterns of discourse during discussions of literature in secondary classrooms, and investigated teachers' and students' perceptions of the purposes that guide those discussions. Six teacher-researchers each studied one teacher as that teacher taught an instructional unit on a literary text, videotaping class sessions, and interviewing the teacher and several students per class. Interviews were analyzed, and videotaped discussions were coded to distinguish three levels of organization (classroom episode, speaker turn, and communication unit) and to analyze each communication unit for linguistic function, knowledge base, and kind of reasoning. Results indicated that teachers typically saw discussions as serving at least two major purposes--lively  interaction, and deep analysis of text--and they saw themselves playing at least two roles which reflected those purposes--facilitators and guides. Analyses of classroom talk suggested that: (1) in terms of quantity, teachers dominated most of the large-group discussions observed, with the floor returned to the teacher after each student's contribution, and with teachers' turns two to five times longer than students' turns; (2) teachers mostly used their turns to inform, question, and respond to students' contributions; (3) students' informative remarks were largely reflective of the kinds of questions teachers asked, and dominated by the description and interpretation of textual information; and (4) teachers used their responses to students' contributions to weave the discussion into a  coherent and sustained examination of general topics, controlling the direction, pace, and organization of discussion.

Five secondary assumptions were established for the analysis: (1) that the importance of communicating technical information effectively is equally significant to aerospace managers and nonmanagers; (2) that the use and production of technical information and technical information products are different for managers and nonmanagers; (3) that the content for an undergraduate course in technical communications should be viewed differently by both groups; (4) that the use of libraries, technical information centers,  and on-line (electronic) databases differs for managers and nonmanagers; and (5) that the use and importance of computer and information technology differs for aerospace managers and nonmanagers. Results indicated that aerospace managers and nonmanagers were found to have different technical communications practices for second, fourth, and fifth of the five assumptions tested. However, the evidence was neither conclusive nor compelling that the presumption of &quot;difference&quot; in &quot;practices&quot; could be attributed to the duties performed by aerospace managers and nonmanagers.

Following ethnographic procedures, the study examined naturally occurring conferences in a ninth-grade English class for six case study students. Covering an observation period of 6 weeks, collected data included audio and video tapes of conference talk, audio and video tapes of all other class activities, observational field notes, interviews with the teacher and focal students, and all drafts of focal student writing. A descriptive quantitative discourse analysis of conference talk across students and descriptive  qualitative case study analyses for each of the six students showed the writing conference to occasion a kind of teacher-student collaboration in which the teacher assumed a special leadership role. Collaboration was seen as a shifting process shaped not only by conference participants but by the rhetorical circumstances of their talk; and collaboration was described along a continuum, varying both across students and with each student at different times.

        "description":"This paper connects recent research with common student problems in writing research papers and offers an analysis of the range of synthesis tasks and some reasons why students have difficulty with the demands of these tasks. The paper focuses on the student's problem of not knowing how to think about material in ways that allow him or her to say something original or persuasive and suggests that this problem may be reduced if students learn to read their sources rhetorically. The paper argues that such a strategy would allow readers to identify interesting conflicts, discrepancies, and rhetorical problems, as dissonances (gaps) of communication between writer/reader or reader/audience. Teaching students to think about such dissonances could help them to find original things to  say about their sources and rhetorically purposeful reasons to discuss their topics with specifically imagined audiences. The fictional composite Shirley, a college sophomore derived from published research and personal experience, is used in the paper to discuss common student problems in the context of a real term paper.

Yet the manner in which television programs are produced for international viewers is still casual and often careless. Neither the message nor the way in which the medium shapes the message take into account the basic cultural barriers that cause communication difficulties. Studies on intercultural communication have revealed that cross-cultural barriers such as people's attitudes; their social organization; their patterns of thoughts; the roles and role expectations they have; their language; and their sense of space, time, and non-verbal expressions must be considered by media communicators. Also, knowing television's idiosyncratic nature, its unique features, and its specific  components, and understanding the grammar and syntax of television will aid in the production of better, less casual, and more cohesive television programs. Problems imposed by careless television programming are being considered more and more by major international agencies and governments, and scholarly works on the subject are now being more frequently published. Modern technology and advancements in television hardware now allow television producers to generate programs with a broader, more international scope, greater aesthetic value, and artistic balance, and which are directly related to the needs of the inhabitants of the global village. Television software for people of various cultures should be produced and broadcast by the various channels now available. (MM)",

The study sought to discover the extent to which research ethics courses are being taught, identify the research ethics issues that are discussed in these courses or in research methods coursework, specify the reading material that are assigned in the area of research ethics, and inquire as to how instructors of research ethics acquired their own knowledge of research ethics. Fifty-nine Ph.D. communication programs in the United States were surveyed through a mail questionnaire. A 77% response rate was achieved. Results indicate that no Ph.D. communication program in the survey currently devotes an entire course to communication research ethics. Seventy percent of the programs  surveyed offer a course partly dealing with ethics. In these courses, research ethics tend to be discussed 15% or less of total course time. &quot;Lack of room in the curriculum&quot; and &quot;ethics issues adequately addressed in other courses&quot; were the primary reasons cited for not devoting an entire course to research ethics. Issues dealing with confidentiality, informed consent, subjects' rights to withdraw, and institutional review boards were discussed to the greatest extent in coursework related to research ethics. The least discussed issues were involuntary self knowledge, the importance of information in final write-ups allowing for the assessment of ethical conduct, misinformation, &quot;fudging&quot; of data, the responsibility of the researcher to benefit society, physical/psychological harm, and the  mechanics of debriefing. A limited range of reading materials on research ethics appear to be used, largely drawn from outside the discipline. Most instructors acquired their research ethics knowledge from experience doing research, personal reading, and informal conversation with colleagues. No instructors in the survey who teach coursework at least partially devoted to research ethics have themselves taken a separate course in research ethics at the graduate level. Approximately 67% indicated having taken a course at the graduate level partially devoted to research ethics. (Author)",

        "description":"A two-part radio communications survey was conducted to test the effect of the government owned and operated radio station on Pohnpei, a Micronesian island state. The first phase was conducted in the capital city, while the second phase was conducted in rural areas of the state. The purpose of the survey was to determine the extent of radio and other media use in the homes of the respondents, to find out where they got their news, and to determine their attitudes toward different styles of programming. In the city of Kolonia, the 84 interviews were taken at places of commerce. Results indicated 94.2% of those interviewed owned a radio and 60.7% owned a television. Radio was given as a source of news by 71.4%, newspaper and magazine 31.0%, and friends 22.6%. It appears that the  best market for broadcasting service is one that broadcasts in both English and Pohnpeian and carries mostly announcements, country music, weather reports, local sports, world news, and religious programming. When examining the results of the survey instrument and interviews with rural inhabitants of Pohnpei, it was seen that 84.3% owned radio and 15.7% owned televisions. The news sources included: radio 52.8%, friends 35.7%, and newspapers and magazines 11.4%. Sixty percent preferred the Pohnpeian language only and 34.3% preferred Pohnpeian and English. It appears that the radio system on which most of the nation depends does a reasonably good job in meeting the challenge of information dissemination. (MG)",

        "description":"A revision of the Westley-MacLean model of 1957 for communication research accommodates an incorporation of some of the research areas that have blossomed during the last three decades. The revision concentrates on two aspects of the original: (1) organizational features within the advocate, communicator and audience roles; and (2) environmental factors that influence these roles. The organizational features deal primarily with interaction among individuals and groups in organizations. The environmental factors include the economic, regulatory, social, cultural and technological developments, as well as interaction among individuals who represent the various communicator and audience roles. The extended model incorporates the interaction of people within the subsystems and  includes the interaction of individuals in various roles across the subsystems. The extended model specifies environmental factors that affect news and the objects of orientations and includes the possibility that messages need not be entirely mediated. Some can be experienced directly. By including the developments, the model may contribute further to the purpose of the original to order existing mass communications research, to point to strengths and weaknesses in our knowledge, and to stimulate further effort.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine how to reach out in an effective manner via televised public service announcements (PSAs) to particular at-risk audiences to motivate participation in drug abuse prevention programs. The subjects (207 young adults in Fayette County, Kentucky) responded to the M. Zuckerman sensation-seeking questionnaire. They also viewed a video of several televised messages and filled out a questionnaire packet consisting of 37-item mood scale, followed by administration of the behavioral intention, attitude, and drug use scales. Analysis of variance showed no significant main effects of sensation seeking, message sensation value, or drug use on the index of behavioral intention. A strong main effect emerged for motivational introduction. The results indicated  that careful attention should be paid to the verbal audio characteristics of the introductory portion of televised anti-drug PSAs. The behavioral intention of low sensation seekers was more affected by the low sensation message than by the high sensation PSA. It was also found that high sensation seeking users of illicit drugs displayed by far the strongest behavioral intention to call the hotline advocated in the PSA compared to the appropriate control group. Results provided convincing evidence that two related factors, sensation seeking and message sensation value, can be employed in concert to target televised anti-drug PSAs at young adults who are users of illicit drugs or who are at risk of becoming users.

Each conversation contained either no error or one of the three error types. All subjects heard 12 different conversations. Following the taped conversations, the subjects evaluated the speakers and rated the realism of the conversation. They then engaged in a 2-minute distractor task before being asked to recall the errors. Forty-four additional subjects were asked to read transcripts of the conversations before participating in the remainder of the activities. The  immediate evaluations of the participants were most strongly affected by the presence of pragmatic errors. In contrast, later memory for the conversations that were read was best when they contained phonological errors. This suggests that different kinds of errors influence conversation in different ways.

Journalists play a variety of roles in this persuasive atmosphere and are deeply involved in the construction of rhetorical visions about terrorism and its perpetrators. Journalists amplify, arbitrate, and create their own rhetoric about terrorist acts. In the role of rhetorical amplifiers, journalists gain the attention of audiences and convey messages about political violence by providing the platform and amplification system by which this can be accomplished. As arbitrators of rhetoric, journalists have limited success. Evidence of arbitration is seen in comparisons between how  media personnel describe terrorist events and their perpetrators and how government officials make similar descriptions. Journalists serve as creators of rhetoric whenever they report terrorist events. The rhetorical tradition employed determines the nature of that rhetoric. The role of formats, the presentation conventions that are used to package information and determine the significance and the information that news packages carry, are also important. The effects of these roles are beginning to receive appropriate scrutiny. Journalists must be made sensitive to the power of what they report, but when dealing with the volatile area of reporting on terrorism, they must be especially sensitive to how they report the news as well.

Elements of bias and ethnocentrism and media reductionism are more widely reported than in previous decades.

A total of 258 reports of 127 incidents of political violence were collected and analyzed. Findings revealed that a significant difference exists in the ways media personnel, government officials, and witnesses characterize acts of political violence and perpetrators of those acts. Media personnel and witnesses to the violence tend to use nominal characterizations (generally more neutral than those used by government officials), and government officials tend  to use descriptive characterizations (often words that are more judgmental, inflammatory, and highly colored). Witness characterizations were, in fact, completely nominal. Further, findings showed that 94.3% of the characterizations were media characterizations (including headline characterizations and description, observation, and paraphrase in the article), while only 3% were direct quotes of government officials, and 2% were direct quotes of witnesses. This finding means that media quoted primary sources less than 6% of the time. (Ten tables of data are included.) (SR)",

Through the myth of the hero, the news stories invoked the symbol of the self, inviting intense identification of the individual reader with the terrorist victim. But in doing so, the news stories also provided the terror of terrorism. The news stories that drew from the myth of the hero, that invoked the symbol of the self in response to terrorism, helped the terrorists establish the link between the victim and the self. The symbolism of terrorism was also aided by the actions of public officials portrayed in the media. The victim was the terrorists' symbol of the nation, and  was so honored by the media, and mourned by officials. Other political implications from news portrayals of the myth of the hero, and the mourning of the victim as a symbol of nation or community, might be suggested: (1) policy makers could appeal to the power of myth to arouse support for measures of prevention and reprisal; and (2) mythic images in the news might also help public officials create a powerful climate for revenge.

Forty-one students at a midwestern university completed the terrorism Q-sort. Results showed that Q-methodology provided a useful tool for examining perceptions of international terrorism and for focusing future studies of unanswered questions about the effects of media coverage of terrorism on audiences. Q-factor analysis revealed four  patterns of perceptions regarding terrorism. Viewing terrorists as driven by human needs and possibly noble motives distinguished the &quot;Humanist/Cold-War Patriot&quot; and the &quot;Pacifist-Isolationist&quot; from the &quot;Frightened Philosopher&quot; and the &quot;Aggressive Patriot.&quot; Generally, however, attitudes that distinguished the types, such as concern with U.S. or Soviet involvement, perception of threat, and advocacy of military action, tended to be similar in three of four types. Similarities across three types combined with consensus across all four types resulted in half of the subjects' loading on two types. Information from this preliminary investigation should provide useful information for revision of the terrorism Q-sort--a process already underway.

The paper argues that the very self-referentiality implied by any discussion of language renders impossible any certain knowledge of the subject. In the first section, the paper locates Habermas within a tradition stretching from the Enlightenment to the present, and sketches the way in which his theory is tied up with a conception of human nature which privileges rationality. The next section explicates Habermas' theory, with some marginal comments which are intended to serve both as limited  critiques and as points of clarification. In the paper's third section, the central critique of Habermas' theory is developed, attempting to demonstrate the impossibility of &quot;rationally&quot; reconstructing the universal conditions of understanding, since the results of a seemingly rational analysis are always already interpreted within language.

The study was a secondary analysis of a survey of the International Association of Business Communicators conducted in August 1987. Questionnaires were mailed to 760 people from the 1987 membership directory of the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC). Of the 760 persons in the valid sample, 211 returned useable questionnaires, a 27.8% response rate. Respondents were asked to categorize their organization according to a 12-item typology. Of the total sample, about 18% of the organizations were classified as service and 17% were classified as manufacturing. Findings indicated that service organizations use  both scientific research and content-based mixed research to scan the environment and evaluate public relations programs. Service and manufacturing organizations do not differ significantly in their use of informal research. Future studies should consider differences in the information and non-information subsectors of the service sector as they relate to program research.

        "description":"The ability to record sound is power over sound. Musicians, producers, recording engineers, and the popular music audience often refer to the sound of a recording as something distinct from the music it contains. Popular music is primarily mediated via electronics, via sound, and not by means of written notes. The ability to preserve or modify organized sound is a means of controlling sound independent of its creation or creator. Recording enables the fixation of music based on improvisation, one of popular music's most important characteristics. Recording technology has greatly affected the recreation of studio sound in a performance setting--it is now common for a group to make a digital sample of the sounds created in the studio and use those in performance. Popular music  production has traditionally been concerned with finding new sounds and reconfiguring old ones. This search for new sounds is at the heart of modern musical instrument technology. Authenticity is again at stake, for there is a rift between those who create their own sounds and those who buy others' sounds. Record producers as well as the identity of a group or artist can be associated with sound. Recording technology, as the means by which sound is manipulated and reproduced, is the site of control over sound, and therefore the site of musical and political power in popular music.

Fifteen students at San Diego State University volunteered to participate in the study. Questionnaires were distributed to parents, designed to elicit their evaluations of the effectiveness of the video report cards as a method for communicating information about grades and the process of assigning grades. Fifty-seven percent of the parents returned questionnaires. About 95% of these parents said video report cards (VRC) were a good idea for college students. In general, mothers tended to react more favorably to the concept of VRCs than did fathers. The  problems associated with production were related to obtaining video cassette recorders and equipment to prepare the tapes. The parents of college students in this survey overwhelmingly approved of the concept of video report cards. Such a response warrants further study and experimentation with VRCs. One of the greatest benefits of VRCs may be their ability to enhance the outreach programs of colleges and universities. (One table of data is included and 21 references are attached.) (MG)",

Two peripheral municipalities with development problems are compared. The municipalities have a shared history and culture and a similar economic life, yet they seem to have different developmental strategies. Depth interviews with two significant actors were analyzed using Perspective Text Analysis, applicable to natural text. The two actors (A and B) were alike with respect to traditional characteristics. Their general conceptions, however, could be ascribed to different traditions of ideas. The actors had disparate views of nature. There were differences in perspectives on time, in  enacted problems, in perception of what is rational and reasonable, as well as contradictions in society. Consequently they saw different solutions to the development problems. Actor A favored adaptation to markets and structures and technical entrepreneurship. Actor B advocated an ecological approach to development and demanded more radical changes in values and structures. One conclusion of the study is that there is an established connection between the significant actors' general conceptions and the local strategies. (Five figures and one table are included.

An innovative new program was set up between West Georgia College and the Atlanta Branch of the National Archives. A pilot project involved six teams of two students each in a scriptwriting class. Students were expected to visit the Atlanta facility, meet the director and his staff, select an appropriate historical record, transform it into a dramatization, create a script, and produce a 10-15 minute tape suitable for radio broadcast. That is, each student was to function as a sort of part-time intern, learning the techniques of archival research from the director and his staff, and learning the process of scriptwriting from the classroom  instructor. Another project involved four students (in a combined internship and advanced radio production course) in the creation of a half-hour radio variety program along the lines of &quot;All Things Considered,&quot; but emphasizing historical events. Such projects (1) allow students to continue to enroll in coursework while getting intern experience; (2) place students in a genuine writer-client relationship; and (3) emphasize creativity and writing skills.

Specifically, the paper argues that a longitudinal, processual sensitivity can be achieved through a reorientation to mediated communication. The paper is in six sections, as follows: (1) Introduction; (2) Where We Are vs. Whre We Want To Be:  The Traditional Model; (3) What's the Use?

        "description":"A study was conducted to test the hypothesis that individuals who rely solely on interactive channels for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevention information will have different levels of accurate Tactical Mobilizing Information (MI) on HIV prevention than those who rely solely on non-interactive channels. The hypothesis was tested using data collected in a telephone survey of 358 undergraduate students at the University of Oregon in late February and early March 1988. The survey questions dealt with the mass media, AIDS, and sexual and drug-use behavior. The response rate for the survey was 68%. A one-way analysis of variance was done with Tactical MI as the dependent variable, channel reliance as the factor, and concern and attention as covariates. Results showed no  evidence that reliance on interactive or non-interactive information channels predicts to higher levels of tactical mobilizing information on HIV transmission. This finding would be consistent with suggestions that &quot;pitting&quot; information channels against each other in a search for various effects tends to reify the role of the sender in the communication process. Findings are lacking in that they do not illuminate much about what channel reliance might mean in terms of the strategies or mechanisms individuals use to negotiate their communication environment or the antecedent conditions for reliance on one kind of channel versus another for information on HIV transmission.

        "description":"The pressure to assess educational outcomes comes from a variety of national, regional, and state forces. The primary thrust of most current state initiatives is to encourage institutions to undertake their own appropriate local assessment efforts. The narrow view of assessment focuses upon the use of standardized tests to show the outcomes of learning, while the broader view suggests that effective assessment involves many measurement methods spaced over a period of time. The primary issue regarding the purpose of assessment seems to be: Is the student being tested or is the institution being tested? The favored purpose appears to be a formative one which gathers information on the quality of college programs in attaining broadly defined outcomes and promoting change to improve  that quality. A secondary purpose appears to be the need to determine whether or not students have the abilities that their degrees are supposed to certify. Each speech communication department around the country will probably be faced with the assessment issue in one form or another. Administrtors and faculty members need: (1) a clear statement of anticipated outcomes; (2) to be actively involved in planning college assessment programs; and (3) to acquaint themselves with the various standardized measures which they might choose or which might be chosen for them.

        "description":"A pilot study was conducted to develop a reasonably complete picture of young women as they assessed their parent's influence on them, viewed their futures, and reported on their own communicative behavior. Eighteen single, white, midwestern college women between the ages of 18 and 23 were the subjects of the study. To obtain a maximum amount of information from the subject sample a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies was employed. Both the interviews and the correlation results point to interesting directions for study with a larger number of subjects. The mother's educational status, but not her occupation, seemed to correlate with commitment to career on the part of the daughters. Results indicated that a relationship might exist between &quot;overt concern&quot;  from father and career commitment, and &quot;overt concern&quot; from mother and a desire for marriage and family. With regard to the finding of relationship between commitment to career and the self report of a communicator style factor labeled &quot;dramatic&quot;, reactions were varied and it was felt this area would profit from further study. Evidence of sex role attitudes that were communicated in the interviews will also continue to be explored. Based on these preliminary findings, subsequent research might involve developing a new self-report instrument aimed at further exploration of the above-mentioned factors associated with clarity of life aspirations.

Subjects, 5 black women ranging in age from 65 to 78, participated in 2 videotaped free-style discussions and completed a sociogram that was developed to depict the order of choices the 5 subjects made in choosing each other as partners for 10 social activities. Conversational patterns were examined by determining the number of times each subject talked, the amount of time spoken during the 2 conversational periods, and the sequential order of the speakers. Results showed that subjects who  placed medially in terms of quantity and frequency of conversational talk were the subjects most often selected as partners for social activities in both studies.

Knowledge and awareness of a child's background and problems gives teachers, counselors, administrators, police, and other legal professionals guidance in developing proper education, programs, and counsel for the child. Confidential information should be shared on a routine, ongoing basis when specific needs warrant such sharing. Currently our juvenile justice system protects the privacy of the youthful offender convicted of serious crime to such an extent that the rest of society often is left at risk. In the first of two sections, this document outlines eight steps for the development of information management policies and interagency cooperation; included  among these steps are: (1) determining what information is maintained by each member of the interagency partnership; (2) designating an \"information management liaison\" at each agency; and (3) periodically reviewing the effectiveness and appropriateness of the policies established. The second portion of this document generally examines each state's juvenile records statutes. Appended is a guide for the use of state statute tables, a model of a juvenile records code, a model of Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 legislation, and a collection of sample forms.

Bullying is defined as one or more individuals inflicting physical, verbal, or emotional abuse upon another individual or individuals. Subliminal abuses related to bullying--such as being teased, intimidated, or intentionally excluded or ostricized--can create fear, anxiety, and pain tantamount to that resulting from physical abuse. In fact, fear of other students motivated 1 of every 12 student dropouts. This book, divided into two sections and four chapters, examines the bullying problem and defines solutions. Chapter 1 discusses the serious and widespread bullying phenomenon; highlighted  is the escalation of the problem, if ignored. Chapter 2 pinpoints bully and victim characteristics, causes, and manifestations; permanent scars for the victim and a gloomy future for the bully are predicted. Chapter 3 suggests heightened public awareness to generate support for handling the antisocial bullying phenomenon and chapter 4 explores the intervention strategies of educator action, parental action, and student action. A list of resources is included, and the appendices contain both a student and an adult bully awareness survey. (102 references) (KM)",

Nevertheless, the public expects school districts and other school bus operators to take all reasonable precautions to protect children as they travel to and from school. Although a variety of safety improvements have been made to school bus design and operation, further improvements are always possible. Effective April 1977, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued and modified a number of federal motor vehicle safety standards to enhance the safety of school bus transportation. For post-1977 school buses weighing less than 10,000 pounds, these standards require that passenger seats be equipped with seat  belts. For school buses weighing more than 10,000 pounds, the standards do not require seat belts, but instead rely on strong, well-padded, energy-absorbing seats and higher seat backs to protect passengers during a crash. Prohibiting standees and raising the minimum height of seat backs from 20 to 24 inches can improve passenger safety during crashes. Measures to improve the safety of bus loading zones include school bus driver training, stop sign arms, school bus routing, and pedestrian safety. Appendices contain details about (1) school bus accidents; (2) brief narratives of fatal school bus accidents in three states; (3) supplemental information on 26 fatal school bus accidents; (4) narratives of 13 fatal school bus accidents in Texas; and (5) cost-effectiveness analysis of school bus  safety measures.

With radical changes taking place in society, the introduction of the theme of interdependence by Pope John XXIII was both timely and prophetic. The evolution to a more collaborative church organizational style does not imply the elimination of authority, but a more discerning use of authority. The first of three sections comprising this document describes the present situation and outlines: the establishment of a common language; perceptions of organizational style, roles, and partnerships; and the external and internal influences that impact educational effort. The second section is devoted to analyzing organizational style, roles and relationships, and external and internal  influences. The third section contains a guide to developing workable strategies for future planning. Background reading on change, partnership/collaboration, community, and values is also provided. (KM)",

First, an organizational analysis of the history and organization, the administrative tools, and the functions and dysfunction of the former MOE is presented. Second, a discussion of the establishment of the SEC includes an examination of the three distinct differences between the SEC and the former MOE: (1) an increase in power and responsibilities; (2) a stronger central educational administration; and (3) a clearer outline of goals and tasks. Finally, the prospects for future reform in the areas of organization structure, power distribution, administrative principles, staff quality, and administrator supervision  are assessed.

        "author":["Hodgkinson, Harold L."],
        "description":"In the United States, services (such as education, health care, housing, and transportation) are provided for citizens by a bewildering array of agencies at many government levels. Service organizations must learn to communicate across functional lines, and educators must become familiar with other service providers at various levels. This means perceiving the client as the most important part of the organizations providing services to that person, family, or group. The rationale is that these agencies are all serving the same children and families as clients. This approach is the most efficient, effective, and humane way to deliver services in an era of diminishing financial resources. Drawing on numerous maps, tables, and statistics, this report explores the complex  interrelationships among family demography, housing, transportation, health, crime, and education. Interagency cooperation and taxpayer investment in families' basic needs are essential to prevent future problems (like crime, illiteracy, mental retardation) and reduce the need for costly programs to deal with them. For example, it would be more cost-effective to help low-income families secure affordable housing and to supply small grants to cover broken down cars and medical emergencies than to maintain these same families on welfare. Prisons are another costly service that might be reduced by investing more heavily in early education and college access programs. Recent occupational and demographic trends (including metropolitan areas moving across state lines) are provided to support an  interactive, client-centered agenda and recommendations for achieving it.

        "description":"The empowerment of teachers through collaboration, a supervisory trend currently receiving much attention and emphasis, employs variability and encourages cooperative decisionmaking. Despite its apparent popularity, collaboration can be viewed as unwieldy and difficult to manage with teachers who are already working under less than desirable conditions and further burdened by excessive paperwork and other duties associated with accountability and the reform movements under way in many states. To investigate Mississippi teachers' perceptions of burnout and the possibility of a relationship between teacher burnout and principals' directive, collaborative, or nondirective supervision methods, the Supervisory Behavior Description Questionnaire (form 1) and the Maslach Burnout  Inventory Form Ed were mailed to a random sample of 192 teachers of grades 9 through 12. The response rate was 62 percent. Analyses of data collected indicated greater teacher emotional exhaustion and depersonalization under collaborative supervision. It is possible to attribute this to several existing problems, all of which have increased teachers' duties and the demands on their time. Perhaps the greatest difficulty lies with the traditional supervision methods, where principals' directive supervisory behaviors did not permit teachers to develop appropriate decisionmaking and group interaction skills to participate in collaboration.

As a result of using standardized test scores for comparative purposes, however, &quot;teaching to the test&quot; is becoming a common practice in our nation's schools. Performance-based assessments offer an alternative to standardized testing by requiring students to demonstrate active skills. Because performance-based assessments are more easily scored using a criterion- rather than a norm-referenced approach, to maintain assessment reliability comparisons must be made with similar assessments made  by other teachers in other settings, the adoption of an exemplary system involving regular meetings between teachers responsible for scoring would be necessary. Such a shift in testing methodology sacrifices reliability for the benefits of validity. (9 references) (KM)",

Tutoring is probably the best way for parents to participate in public education, but parental attitudes and expectations toward academic achievement can be as important as explicit teaching activities. The term &quot;at-risk&quot; is not synonymous with minority student, student in poverty, or student in single parent or restructured household; however, some family characteristics do inhibit academic achievement. The design of a program that allows parents to interact with school professionals as colleagues or peers would be a positive way to foster parental involvement in education.  Further, to stimulate parental participation, administrators can hire staff sympathetic to parent involvement, alert parents to home education's advantages, and use signed parent/teacher education contracts.

Without understanding the nature and extent of this phenomenon, the severity and impact on society of the dropout problem may be overstated. According to survey data obtained from the third followup of the National Center for Education Statistics' High School and Beyond longitudinal study of 30,030 tenth grade students begun in 1980, 4 out of 9 dropouts (44 percent) returned and either completed high school diploma requirements or obtained a General Educational Development (GED) certificate by the spring of 1986. Of the dropouts who returned,  approximately one-third received an institutional diploma and two-thirds passed the GED examination. Those dropouts who, in 1982, reported no further educational plans were less likely to complete high school later than were those who reported plans to pursue further education. Moreover, among early high school dropouts, only 28 percent later completed their education as compared to 42 percent of eleventh grade and 53 percent of twelfth grade dropouts who later obtained a diploma or GED certificate.

        "description":"A drug and alcohol survey was administered to 283 secondary school students in a large suburban school district in the eastern United States. The survey covered demographic information, life events, coping strategies, and prevalence of substance abuse, asking students about initial and current use of a wide range of substances including alcohol, cigarettes, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, marijuana, opiates, PCP, illicit prescription medications, and tranquilizers. Of the 283 students, 55 were students with behavior disorders enrolled in special schools, and 99 students (primarily learning disabled) were enrolled in special education classes. A series of analyses were conducted, with age and race as covariates and student status as the independent variable. Students attending  residential or day programs for behavioral disorders showed a higher percentage of use of hard drugs than students enrolled in regular schools. Mildly handicapped students served in special education programs and identified primarily as learning disabled did not report using controlled substances with any greater frequency than non-identified schoolmates. An exception to this was the greater prevalence of alcohol use by non-identified high-school students. A discussion of implications for special educators concludes the paper. (JDD)",

Fifty-five high-risk children between the ages of 2.6 and 8 years participated in a speech assessment; 34 high-risk 5-year-olds participated in a language assessment. The children were socioeconomically disadvantaged and attended a day care program at a child development center. Results did not show a relationship between the number of days of OME in the first 3 years of life and either the total number of common phonological processes observed during the preschool years or language measures at age 5. Early OME was associated with the total number of  phonological processes used by children between the ages of 4.6 and 8 years. In summary, for socioeconomically disadvantaged children attending day care centers, the magnitude of any adverse speech or language outcome associated with early childhood OME is small and more likely when children are of school age.

Data were collected from 29 school districts or schools located throughout the United States. Telephone interviews were conducted with representatives from each site; case studies were conducted at nine sites. The analysis revealed a number of effective approaches for serving these students. Many of the programs identified students through a pre-selection process and the use of multiple criteria. The programs provided both enrichment activities and accelerated courses involving extension of time students spend learning, operation of special programs, use of hands-on  learning techniques, and provision of out-of-school activities. Support activities included setting external goals, providing career awareness programs, providing social-emotional support, and encouraging parent participation. Processes used to manage and maintain programs included using a district-school co-management approach; involving community organizations, businesses, industries, and universities; and recruiting parents and school alumni to support the program. School districts permitted flexibility in program implementation, provided staff support, and recruited qualified staff.

The project developed materials and procedures to assist school personnel in: (1) how to use previously developed instructional materials; and (2) how to utilize parents and other family members of handicapped children to train their children in social skills. The role of family members consisted of prompting students to use social skills and reinforcing students' attempts. Study results showed increases in school use of such  social skills as saying &quot;thank you&quot; and praising, and also showed generalization to home settings.

Approximately 280 families were part of the research: 55 parents attended parent groups, 139 received written materials, and 86 served as controls. Results from the parent involvement assessment indicated that approximately 70% of parents with children enrolled in special education programs attended Individualized Education Program conferences; 60% of these parents attended two or more school conferences  annually; and 30% maintained written/telephone contact with schools. Implementation of the training models indicated that parents receiving some level of information (written materials or workshop presentations) from parent trainers participated more actively in the special education process than control group parents. Overall attendance at parent workshops averaged 17% of parents invited. Workshops having community persons as trainers showed highest attendance at 20%, then teachers at 17%, and parent trainers at 13%. Thirteen appendices make up the bulk of the document.

Individuals' vocational situations and living arrangements are discussed, along with reasons for lack of work activity, parents' preference for youngsters' living arrangements and  eventual employment situation, relationship of present situation to in-school vocational training, and relationship of number of parents to employment status. It is concluded that: (1) an extremely high percent of youngsters live with their parents and guardians after completing school; (2) a great deal still needs to be done to create satisfactory vocational outcomes for mentally retarded youngsters who have completed school; and (3) mentally retarded youngsters from one-parent families are less likely than those from two-parent families to be working 1 year after completing school.

A program for students with physical impairments was developed to link educational services with community resources and to encourage collaborative efforts of various disciplines inside and outside of the school system. The program offers vocational courses, expanded occupational therapy services, on-the-job training programs, driver evaluation and education, vocational evaluations, vocational rehabilitation services, post-secondary education/placement options, collaboration  with the local community college, and access to the local Center for Independent Living. In the junior year, students, parents, and community agency representatives are encouraged to attend the annual review of the Individualized Education Program, and an Individual Transition Plan is developed. This serves as a vehicle to identify areas of continued or potential need that the student will have as an adult and to address how and by whom needed services can be provided. (JDD)",

Also examined was the predictive ability of various statistical models with respect to the eventual diagnostic outcomes of the students. File data were collected for 1,319 Hispanic students in grades K-12, with the analyses focusing on the 1,154 elementary students. Findings showed that the majority of the referrals were in the early elementary grades, were male, and were born in the United States, while the majority of parents were born in Mexico. Most frequent reasons for referral were low academic achievement and reading problems, followed by poor oral skills. The most frequent eventual diagnostic  classifications were learning disabled (63% of the sample) and language impaired (20%). A predictive analysis using path analytic procedures examined factors leading to eventual classification, and accounted for about 40% of the variance in the dependent variable. In addition, there appeared to be two &quot;tracks&quot; leading to the eventual classification, one for diagnosis of learning disabilities and one for diagnosis of language impairments.

Results indicated that the psychometric properties of the instruments were within acceptable ranges for use with students such as those in the sample. In addition, in general, the patterns of scores on the  instruments were in the expected directions, given the diagnostic classifications assigned to the students in the school setting. A second part of the analysis utilized California state eligibility criteria to calculate the numbers of students in the school-assigned diagnostic groups who met the state requirements for these designations. Results indicated large discrepancies between the school-assigned categories and the categories suggested through the use of the study instruments in conjunction with applicable state guidelines.

Four questions framed the study: (1) How do teachers of young children define a whole language program? (2) What kind of whole language activities have the teachers tried in their classroom, and how did teachers feel about the outcomes of the activities they used? (3) What concerns did the teachers have about whole language instruction? and (4) What kind of assistance did the teachers believe would be helpful to them as they began to make changes in their literacy program? A survey was designed to assess a general level of knowledge and concerns about whole language programs among kindergarten-second grade teachers teaching in a rural or a suburban midwestern school  district. Twenty-eight surveys were returned. One finding suggests that most teachers from this small sample accept whole language instruction as being an effective means of instruction, but as a supplement to a skills-based approach. It seems imperative that whole language advocates address teachers' beliefs concerning how children become literate. Without doing so, whole language activities may be viewed as additional instructional experiences which are \"fun\" but not a means for developing capable literate children.

Creative Reading Program was designed to improve students' literacy skills through participation in creative arts activities integrated with instruction in reading and writing. Operating at sites in Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx, the 1988-89 program served 334 students in second through fifth grade. Each student was involved in three types of sessions--an art workshop, a plan and review session, and a story room (small group) session. The impact of the program on student achievement in reading and writing was determined by evaluating students' performance on standardized and norm-referenced reading tests and holistically scored writing tests against the program objectives. Second grade students exceeded the program's criteria  for success in reading: 97% of the students mastered 3 or more skills, 83% mastered 4 or more skills, and 69% mastered 5 or more skills. Third grade students did not meet the program's criterion for success. All mean differences for the fourth and fifth grade students were statistically significant and educationally meaningful. Students in grades 2, 3, and 4 achieved statistically significant mean gains on holistically scored writing tests. Overall, 52% of the students improved in writing, meeting the program's criterion for success. During the past 4 years, approximately one-half of the program participants attained five or more reading skills and approximately one-half to two-thirds of the program participants improved in their writing performance.

The DRP and several criterion measures (the Virginia Literacy Testing Program Writing Battery, the Burke Reading Interview, the Estes Attitude Scales, and the Study Habits Inventory) were administered to 54 students attending sixth grade at two different middle schools in rural central Virginia. One-half of the students were identified as poor readers and one-half were classified as above average readers. The Informal Reading Inventory (IRI) was also  administered to the 27 students identified as poor readers. The coorelation between DRP scores and Informal Reading Inventory instructional levels proved to be modest but significant. The data collected to show that poor readers exhibit similar strategies for dealing with printed material is still being interpreted. All correlations of DRP scores with tests of writing ability are of moderate to high magnitude; all are statistically significant. Results indicated children who achieve higher DRP scores exhibit more positive attitudes toward the subjects they study, especially toward reading. Results support the construct validity of the DRP as a measure of reading proficiency. (Three tables of data are included and 10 references are attached.

Specifically, the study investigated (1) the effect the PReP has on learning when used with predominantly Anglo and Hispanic high school students in conjunction with a social studies textbook reading assignment; (2) whether there is evidence that the PReP activity has lasting effects on the amount and organization of topic knowledge in high school readers; and (3) similarity of treatment effects for students possessing varying amounts (high, middle, or low) of background knowledge. Five teachers in two urban and suburban high schools were trained to engage 125 ninth and tenth grade students in the PReP discussion in 11 social studies classrooms. Analysis of  data collected revealed that the PReP treatment did not affect free and probed recall scores obtained immediately after reading but did significantly impact scores on a topic-specific knowledge measure administered after a one-week delay, independent of reading ability or existing background knowledge of the topic, suggesting the usefulness of the activity in helping students to develop well-organized domain knowledge. Furthermore, consistent with schema-theoretic views of reading comprehension, high knowledge subjects appeared to benefit most from the activity. No differences between ethnic groups emerged, implying that the PReP benefited both groups equally on delayed topic knowledge.

Subjects were asked general prompting questions at the end of each section. The verbal reports from each story were combined to form a protocol for each student. Protocols were examined to determine the type of inferencing strategies used. Results indicated that (1) children frequently engaged in a number of inferencing strategies; (2) good and poor readers appeared to use a similar repertoire of inferencing strategies; however, (3)  poor readers appeared to accept unconventional interpretations of stories.

        "description":"This study examined the influence of literacy-enriched play centers on preschoolers' conceptions of print. Subjects, 25 boys and 12 girls aged 4 and 5 years from 2 urban preschool classes, were systematically observed before and after 5 basic design changes were made in the classrooms. Four distinct play centers (post office, library, office, and kitchen) were created, and the subjects were allowed to play freely in any of the centers. No attempt was made to obtain a matched sample as a control group at this stage of the project. Quantitative and qualitative results indicated that (1) children spontaneously used almost twice as much print for play purposes than prior to the intervention; (2) childrens' scores on a test of print awareness rose considerably; (3) the duration and  density of literacy demonstrations increased considerably after intervention; and (4) literacy-related play themes in the enriched play centers appeared more instrumental to the play experience. Findings suggest that literacy-enriched play centers have the potential to influence young children's literacy activities in early childhood settings.

To develop student interest in reading literature, teachers might try the following techniques: (1) suggest books that match student interest; (2) read literature aloud to the students; (3) give students time to read in class; and (4) make a great number of books available to students.

It is intended to supplement standard histories of the development of free expression and to recover its history as part of the political project of postmodernism. The paper resurrects Galileo's encounters with entrenched beliefs in order to position free expression historically as an ideal that arose with the secularization of thought and the birth of modern science in the seventeenth century. Noting that in many respects Galileo's worldview is distinctly premodern, the paper concludes that many of the principles first articulated by Galileo are now deeply ingrained ideals of Western culture.

        "description":"A study examined the effects of intervention strategies on the revisions minority students made in narrative essays in a process-oriented classroom. Thirteen African-American and Latino students enrolled in a private boarding school in New England participated in the research. The effect of teacher interventions was explored through two mini-lessons, one peer conference, and one set of teacher comments written directly on student papers. At the end of the essay sequence, students participated in individual interviews, and student papers were analyzed to measure the absolute number of changes, type of changes, and level of changes after each intervention. Results revealed that teacher intervention generated numerous changes and revisions primarily on a sentence level, while the  peer conference produced fewer changes, mostly of word and word unit substitutions. These changes were more closely related to the types of revisions students made when no interventions were present. Findings suggest (1) that for these minority students, in contrast to earlier findings regarding process writing, the input of a teacher is greatly valued as long as that input is perceived as providing new information; and (2) that peer conferences were not valued because these students did not generally perceive peers as being able to help. These findings further suggest that directive instruction gives minority students access to a power with writing that they do not have as long as they are confined by their own insecurities about written expression.

A total of 294,859 essays were scored at 6 regional scoring sites by 384 teachers; this number includes a 5% sample of papers that was double-scored for reliability studies. Approximately 96% of the students who took the essay test comprehended the writing tasks and responded to the topic. Scores were assigned for rhetorical effectiveness, special features (such as coherence or elaboration), and conventions. Results  revealed that most students wrote adequate or marginally adequate essays (62%), some wrote exceptionally well (12%), and others wrote poorly (22%). Eighth graders were most competent at reporting information, less competent at writing autobiography and firsthand biography, and least able to write a story and to produce the two kinds of persuasive writing. Also, students exhibited better control of conventions than of rhetorical strategies. Overall, students' scores increased. Recommendations for school administrators, teachers, and parents are included. (KEH)",

        "description":"A number of noninstructional factors appear to determine the extent to which computers make a difference in writing instruction. Once computers have been purchased and installed, it is generally school administrators who make management decisions, often from an uninformed pedagogical orientation. Issues such as what hardware and software to buy, where to locate the computer lab, the scheduling priority for use of the computer facility, and even the replacement of teachers by computers are determined by administrative considerations rather than by teacher input. Practical implications for the writing classroom include poorly conceived computer lab design which impedes collaborative learning, frequent equipment failure, inappropriate software programs dressed up as &quot;process&quot; or&quot;whole language&quot; material, inadequate user orientation, and insufficient time for many writing activities. Moreover, school management decisions are often influenced by software suppliers and corporate sales persons. Eventually teachers must become involved in informed decision-making and insist on theoretically sound application of technology.

Titles are listed within these sections by traditional categories  that are generally well-known by high school teachers. Categories are: biographies; drama; folklore, mythology, and epics; nonfiction, essays, and speeches; novels; poetry; short stories; and books in languages other than English. Books are listed alphabetically by author, and a matrix is used to give helpful information that will assist selectors when searching for a title. Works in the core and extended section are coded by type of entry--core or extended; grade span and culture--literary contributions of specific ethnic or cultural groups (Black, Chinese, Filipino, Hispanic, Hmong, American Indian, Japanese, Korean, Khmer, Samoan, Vietnamese).

The study used a pretest/posttest, quasi-experimental design with both qualitative and quantitative analyses with statistical analysis. The analysis of overall coherence showed that the form-centered students had a statistically significant gain over the process-centered students, suggesting that writing instruction in discourse forms or structure had a significant effect on the form-centered students for learning \"organizational schemata\" to guide them in writing connected, coherent discourse. An analysis  using the Discourse Matrix showed that the process-centered group made statistically significant gains over the from-centered group in the number and percent of T-units contributing to local and global coherence. Results indicate that combining traditional teaching of discourse forms with modern process-centered instruction may be of substantial benefit for the writing growth of college freshmen in discourse coherence.

        "description":"The North Carolina Annual Testing Program assessed the writing skills of students in Grade 6 and Grade 8 in the 1989-90 school year. Sixth-grade students were asked to write a clarification composition focusing on a special day and explaining to the reader why the day is special, and eighth-grade students were asked to write a letter to their principal persuading the principal, with sufficient elaboration, that a new subject of their choice should be taught at their school. Each of the 80,902 sixth-grade student papers and the 77,976 eighth-grade papers was read by two readers, who determined the quality of the compositions based on the composing characteristics of main idea, supporting detail, organization, and coherence. Essays were scored using a focused holistic score scale  of 1 to 4 and a second, independent score of plus/minus with respect to conventions and mechanics. Results revealed that the majority of students wrote well enough to score at or above the mid-point of the 4-point scale. About 9.02% of the sixth graders and 12.59% of the eighth graders received a score of 3.5 or 4.0; approximately 15.34 sixth graders and 10.36 eighth graders scored 1.0 or 1.5. A majority of the students also displayed a reasonable command of English conventions. Writing scores have improved at the sixth grade level at 2.5 and above from previous years, but there was a slight decline in grade eight scores. Also, regional scores varied somewhat but were in line with statewide averages. (Ten tables and four figures of data are included; an appendix containing summary reports  of Grade 6 and Grade 8 writing assessment from eight regions of the state is attached.) (KEH)",

By teaching about speaking and writing, educators are potentially teaching students how to learn. Language functions to represent the experiences of the learner. Language is not only representational; it is also instrumental in cognitive development. Teachers of speaking and writing must understand the process of discovery (expression) as well as the mechanics of the transaction that is communication. Students must be helped to understand the variables that influence the communicative choices they make, which in turn affect the discovery process as well as the  end product. In struggling with the problems associated with teaching individuals to become more competent communicators, whether in writing or speaking, educators would do well to focus attention equally on the interaction of communication and learning.

An examination of the internship programs at two universities (university &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) demonstrates how such programs can become ineffective. Through poor planning, organization, and supervision, all too often interns are treated like new employees doing only one job with minimal, if any, on-site training and supervision, and not enough to justify the academic credits to be earned. If a college or university department of communication, media studies, or broadcasting desires to create an effective internship program that can meet the needs of the student, the university and industry working  together must provide the following: (1) the work experience must be real and established by contract; (2) guidance, direction, and support must be provided to the student to insure an educational and professional experience; (3) the internship must be structured to insure a learning experience worthy of the academic credit awarded; and (4) a student counselor/advisor must be appointed to instruct, supervise, and visit the intern on the job to evaluate the experience and to act as an intermediary between the intern, the work supervisor, and the sponsoring company.

Feminist criticism is used as one of the three methods that focus on the first question. The unit involves three steps: analysis of the conception of gender presented in the rhetorical artifact, discovery of the effects of the artifact's conception of gender on the audience, and discussion of how the artifact may be used to improve women's lives. A four-step method is used to cover the unit: a lecture explaining the method, an in-class analysis of two or three rhetorical artifacts, the reading by students of  critical essays in which the method has been used, and the writing by students of their own short essays of criticism, analyzing artifacts of their choice, using the method being studied. Two problems encountered when teaching this unit are the students' varying commitments to feminism and whether the teacher is doing students a disservice by teaching them feminist criticism. The inclusion of feminist criticism as a part of the rhetorical criticism course places special and difficult demands on the professor. (Two samples of feminist criticism are attached.) (MG)",

        "author":["Dowling, Ralph E."],
        "description":"Recurring pressures for fiscal restraint threaten the existence of educational programs, such as competitive debate, which are not publicly perceived to produce worthwhile outcomes. Since debate is misunderstood and expensive, its advocates must be prepared to provide solid evidence of its benefits. Unfortunately, methodological weaknesses in debate research have prevented the accumulation of such evidence. The atheoretical nature of the critical thinking concept, particularly as measured in existing debate studies, exacerbates this problem. The critical thinking measure now used, the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal (WGCTA) offers a limited range of scores for assessing college students' critical thinking abilities, and the choice of behavior measured is not grounded in  any particular theoretical formulation of human cognition. A promising new approach from the field of cognitive development--the reflective judgment model--provides an alternative that may remedy these deficiencies and secure a promising future for debate in higher education. The model has a clear foundation in cognitive developmental theory, philosophy, definitions, and theorization, and has been validated by a growing body of empirical data. It suggests that the skills it measures (which resemble those practiced in academic debate) are teachable. The model deals with problem-solving skills most useful to the real world and which develop in late adolescence and young adulthood--the age of interest to debate educators.

Through the use of rhetorical techniques (such as those known to contemporary feminists as elements of &quot;consciousness raising&quot;), Grimke empowers herself and her women listeners through the act of speaking. Most important, her speech transforms then-current definitions of woman's proper role through the related and mutually enforcing concepts of &quot;enactment&quot; and &quot;iconicity,&quot; thus continuing to provide a model of rhetorical empowerment for the oppressed. What emerges is a model of empowerment not only for Grimke's contemporaries, but for her rhetorical heirs as well. (Thirty-one notes are included, and excerpts from the Grimke address are attached.)

        "author":["Johnstone, Christopher Lyle"],
        "description":"Concern with academic freedom in the speech communication classroom is concern with the aims, matter, and methods of teaching. Academic freedom is a condition of relatively unconstrained inquiry and instruction upon which the pursuit and transmission of knowledge depend. Three ideas are worth noting: (1) academic freedom is grounded in some basic conception of the function or mission of the academy; (2) this mission historically has been understood as the creation and dissemination of knowledge; and (3) stress on the external element in academic freedom invites faculty to ignore an equally important internal element. Academic freedom involves not only a relative absence of external constraints; it must also be understood as an absence of internal constraints on inquiry and  teaching. This understanding of the necessary conditions for inquiry and learning calls attention to the mental aspects of freedom: to the attitudes that are requisite to genuine questioning, experimentation, testing of ideas, and knowing. The intrapersonal aspect of academic freedom comprises a pair of mental habits or attitudes--the commitments to growth and adventure. Implications can be examined in three areas: the aims or objectives of instruction, the content of coursework, and the methods by which that content is managed. If individuals are genuinely committed to the ideal of academic freedom, they must strive for it themselves every bit as vigorously as they attempt to nurture it in students. For scholars and teachers, the highest responsibility is to strive to be free.  (MG)",

Results revealed that communication apprehension is not limited to United States business populations but  is also prevalent in the Japanese business culture as well. Results also showed that similar self-reported nonverbal behaviors are perceived by both cultures, thus suggesting the possibility of &quot;cultural universals.&quot; The frequent occurrence of communication apprehension related nonverbal behaviors suggests that a universal attitude exists toward the fear of speaking to groups of people.

The model proposes that universities develop and operate their own Centers for Applied Communication. Through such centers the roles of the communication professor as educator, researcher, and consultant are integrated. The centers also could serve as an apprenticeship for students and junior faculty. Furthermore, the centers could provide outreach programs for the community and bridge the gap between the academic and the business communities. Rather than viewing consulting as an extracurricular or separate activity from teaching and research,  faculty and students are better served through the center because consulting would be perceived as part of the educational process.

Accordingly, this document begins by identifying the &quot;four C's&quot; that must be taken into account if any strategy for school improvement is to succeed: complexity, comprehensibility, conflict, and change. It then presents and describes a change framework that directly addresses the &quot;four C's.&quot; An instrument is included to help school officials understand where their school lies within this conceptual framework. After an extensive introductory discussion of the organizational dynamics of change, chapter II provides a review of the literature on change processes and the history of school, district, and state  organizational structures. Chapter III is the instrument itself, how to administer it, and how to score it. The tryouts of the instrument in a variety of schools and districts are also discussed. Chapter IV provides a set of strategies that help the reader make sense of the scores from the instrument. Chapter V moves from the concrete steps of the strategy to the overarching elements that the models have in common and that give them larger meaning: collaboration, vision-building, action, and reflection/sense-making. Chapter VI contains concluding remarks and a wish-list for the next stages of development. Appended are a review of educational change and a list of instruments for school renewal, along with a bibliography. (TE)",

        "description":"The benefits of a collaborative work setting--including such practices as mutual help, exchange of ideas, joint planning, and participative decision-making--have been consistently confirmed by studies of effective schools and successful businesses. However, teacher isolation remains the norm. Drawing on recent research and educators' firsthand experiences, this book explores the benefits of collaboration, describes various collaborative practices and programs already occurring in schools, and shows how these practices can be introduced using currently available resources. As chapter 1 shows, collaboration has no single model and can occur in formal programs or informally among a few faculty members. Collaboration cannot be imposed from above, but depends on educators' voluntary  efforts at self-improvement through teamwork. Collaborative schools foster help-related exchange, harmonize teachers' professional autonomy and principals' managerial authority, and convert teacher accountability to a self-policing policy. The second chapter shows the costs of self-imposed, professionally sanctioned teacher isolation, as contrasted with the benefits of collaboration, including increased professional development opportunities, improved student cooperation, and a more collegial learning environment. The third chapter surveys current collaborative practices in such areas as school improvement, professional development, teacher evaluation, and school decision-making. Chapter 4 shows that developing new practices is itself a collaborative process involving all school  professionals. Strategies are suggested for principals desiring to encourage collaboration and for comprehensive and modest undertakings. Policymakers' promotion of instructional leadership might help principals create a truly professional teaching environment. (84 references) (MLH)",

The literature review on retention effects contained within this document concludes that retention shows no clear benefits for students in terms of academic gains, personal and/or social growth, or attitude improvement toward school; furthermore, the review indicates that the policy of retention has increasingly been criticized for having negative effects in all these areas, and it has recently become associated with an increased risk of dropping out of school. While it may be that retention helps some  small percentage of students, our ability to predict exactly which students will benefit is exceedingly limited. Given this lack of convincing evidence supporting the use of retention, this document suggests that it is imperative that school psychologists and educators give careful consideration to other options and alternatives that will better meet the needs of low-achieving students.

These systems have been widely used for inservice teacher education for a decade or more, and each has adherents and practitioners who support its efficacy; but testimony and endorsement are subject to expectation effects and other biases. School districts, teachers, and teacher educators should have better evidence upon which to base decisions about implementation of specific methods or teacher training. In addition to summarizing research on the models, the paper presents a brief description of each system. Considered as a whole, the  research on the four classroom discipline models indicates that teachers (after training) frequently exhibit positive changes in attitude or in perceptions. This implies that the training programs are apparently successful in eliciting teacher enthusiasm and support and are consistent with the teachers' role expectations or preferences. The results also suggest that these systems do provide teachers and administrators with strategies for dealing with major threats to school and classroom order and they provide rational, systematic means of communication with students about expectations and consequences. The appendix offers four tables summarizing evaluation studies of the four approaches. (52 references) (KM)",

        "description":"Data from the 1986 Current Population Survey (CPS) and a 1987 survey of public and private enterprises in Orangeburg, South Carolina, provide the basis for estimating a salary schedule for lead teachers in Orangeburg School District 5. The underlying rationale for the development of lead teacher positions is described in terms of salary gaps between experienced teachers and other college graduates with similar attributes. Regression analysis is used to predict the earnings that lead teachers with given attributes (e.g., age, race, sex, schooling, and experience) would be expected to earn in nonteaching positions, and a salary schedule is developed for lead teachers with a minimum of 5 years of teaching experience and a master's degree. The proposed 1988-89 salary schedule for  persons with a master's degree ranges from $34,500 to $41,300 (and higher salaries for teachers with more schooling), compared to the actual 1987-88 schedule in the district for teachers' with a Master's degree, ranging from $22,820 to $28,498. The proposed salary schedule allows teachers to earn as much as (and in some cases even more than) some of the principals or administrators, reducing the incentives of outstanding teachers to seek either administrative positions in the school system or jobs outside the school system.

The study looked carefully at the effects of these sorting practices on low-income, minority, limited English-proficient, handicapped, and low-achieving students (described as at risk). Three key systems were examined: (1) admissions to high school; (2) tracking and grouping within high schools; and (3) promotion and non-promotion from grade to grade. The overall effect of the 46 observed program and policy deficiencies was restriction of educational opportunities available to students, especially high risk students. Many so-called  reforms proved to be nonbeneficial. For example, some schools increased graduation requirements without helping students meet the new standards. Others had abolished rigid tracking only to institute educational options programs that segregated students. A few recommendations are summarized, including the need for: (1) strengthening groups supporting equity; (2) analyzing the equity and effectiveness of student placement and labeling practices; (3) halting the development of additional options schools and programs; and (4) designing an effective strategy for implementing changes in current placement and labeling practices.

Study conclusions and related recommendations are based on data-gathering and analysis in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston. The study focuses on low-income, minority, limited-English-proficient, handicapped, and low-achieving students, termed students at risk. Results underscore the need for comprehensive school restructuring and express major concerns about how restructuring will be implemented. Will restructuring benefit high-risk students or institutionalize new  custodial arrangements for them? Following a study overview, the second chapter presents basic facts about the four school systems. Chapter 3 discusses student placement and labeling practices for all school levels, and chapter 4 examines high school admissions policies and practices. Chapter 5 explores tracking and grouping within high schools, showing that options schools and programs represent a newer, more sophisticated student categorization system. Chapter 6 examines student promotion and retention practices and &quot;reforms&quot; in the four school systems.

This study tries to identify what principals do, through their actions and decisions, to affect teachers' working conditions. Since teacher engagement in their work affects student learning, the quality of teacher work life bears directly on this engagement--in turn influenced by the principals' actions. The research team observed, interacted with, and formally interviewed the principal, vice principals, and selected department heads in eight &quot;ordinary&quot; secondary schools located in midwestern metropolitan areas. Six were public schools, and two were Catholic schools. The study was guided by eight quality-of-work-life indicators:  (1) respect from relevant adults; (2) participation in decision-making; (3) frequent and stimulating professional interactions among peers; (4) organizational structures and procedures allowing performance feedback; (5) opportunity to use skills and knowledge, learn new skills, and experiment; (6) adequate resources to carry out the job; and (7) congruence between personal and school goals. Although principals rarely mentioned the quality of teachers' work life as a high priority concern, their actions in nine specific areas did reveal this concern. The ways that administrators worked with students and dealt with classroom misbehavior affected teachers' work lives in two areas: (1) the respect teachers were accorded by students and administrators; and (2) teachers' ability to maintain a  pleasant, orderly working environment.

This paper provides education policy makers with an overall understanding of the Western Region dropout problem, reviews available research, analyzes alternative change strategies, and briefly describes three categories of specific policy options. Students' decisions to leave school are shaped by numerous interrelated factors, including personal reasons, family characteristics, and disappointments in the school. Schools contribute to school leaving by creating dull and uninspiring programs, allowing staff insensitivity to student needs, and failing to develop effective management systems to identify, track, and serve the needs  of at-risk students. Promising approaches to reducing early exit behavior must deal with student &quot;disconnectedness&quot; and address three policy levels--the community, the school, and the individual staff member. Coordinated change at all levels is required for maximum effectiveness. Six strategies for reducing school leaving can be identified: risk management, environmental management, incentive management, program management, staff management, and culture management. Three policy options are available: (1) strengthening school cultures and programs; (2) retaining at-risk youth; and (3) enhancing career and vocational programs. (134 references) (MLH)",

U.S. population is growing by about 1 percent per year; since the 1980 census, population has increased by 231 million (10.2 percent) to an estimated 249.6 million on January 1, 1990. Population growth will slow and possibly stop within the next 50 years. The South and West are the most rapidly growing regions, having experienced 87 percent of the nation's growth between 1980 and 1989, compared with 61 percent in the 1960s. A large percentage (51 percent) of growth during the 1980s has occurred in California, Texas, and Florida. Population growth is concentrated in metropolitan areas, but the long decline of the farm population has stopped. Average household size has  reached a record low; the average number of people per household in 1989 was 2.62, compared with 2.76 in 1980 and 3.14 in 1970. There were 92.8 million households in 1989, up by 15 percent since 1980. Women with newborns have increased their labor force participation. In 1988, 51 percent of women 18 to 44 years old with infants under 1 year old were in the labor force, compared with 38 percent in 1980 and 31 percent in 1976. Voter turnout hit a new low in the last presidential election, with only 57 percent of the voting age populaton going to the polls in November 1988. Poverty and median family income in 1988 are not significantly different from the 1987 figures, and the home ownership rate held steady in 1989. (MLH)",

While it appears that manufacturing is again becoming viable in Ohio, the state must do more to diversify its economy and to further reduce unemployment, particularly in the creation of new businesses, where progress has already been made.

Since  1980, retention to high school graduation in the state has improved while college-going rates remained roughly the same. The next decade will witness a steady increase of minorities in Ohio schools.

        "description":"New York State is a good example of a diversified economy for a diversified population. Minority middle classes can be found in many places in the state, which has relied heavily on education as a policy tool to increase its human potential resources. Just as the middle of the income scale has been declining nationally, so New York's education system--by having such a high number of high school dropouts and an excellent record of access to higher education--may be inadvertently contributing to an increase in the low end and a corresponding increase in the high end of the income levels in the state. There is much stability in New York as the divorce and crime rates are actually quite low, but this stability could be threatened if New York becomes a state for the rich and the poor.  The parts of the state's educational system do not mesh as well as they might. New Yorkers are used to receiving quality services for their higher taxes, and it may be time to look strategically at how the investment in education could yield a greater return. Weak points include retention levels to high school graduation and early childhood education. (15 references) (KM)",

        "description":"In Minnesota, democracy really works. A higher percentage of voters go to the polls, the business leaders genuinely care about the community, and the legislature works harder than most to provide for the people's welfare. Behind all of this is an energetic, well-educated citizenry who pay fairly high taxes and receive excellent services in return. If making lots of money and driving a fancy car are your goals, however, Minnesota is not the state for you. Income levels are moderate, and Minnesota is not in the top 10 states in terms of increased income (data from 1980-87). The excellent diversification of the state's economy was exemplified by its survival of the 1982 recession. Minnesota leads the nation in the percentage of young people who graduate from high school; however,  demographics indicate some problems on the horizon. Youth poverty in the state has increased dramatically since 1980, and many women are raising children alone without much job skill training. Additionally, minority populations are concentrated in the Minneapolis and St. Paul city limits, and their movement to the wealthy and successful suburbs has been slow. Currently the state does not have a strategy for stemming this increase in poor children. (25 references) (KM)",

Although the work force is still too dependent on auto manufacturing, the economy is diversifying into trade, distribution, and financial and business services. The new jobs created are mostly in small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The state's population is very stable with few migrations either in or out; however, the percentages of children in poverty and of kids being raised by single parents are increasing. A Baby Boomlet has not occurred in Michigan as it has in other parts of the country, so the state's youth population will not increase in the next decade. While the state's high school graduation rate is low, the rate of college attendance for those students who do graduate is high. Black suburbanization in Detroit has  proceeded very slowly; during the 1982 recession, the city became more than 60 percent black due--in large part--to the &quot;landlocked&quot; status of urban blacks. Because Michigan continued to fund higher education even in difficult economic times, the system &quot;weathered&quot; the recession comparatively well. (12 references) (KM)",

The rich and the poor people are unequally distributed throughout the state. Because only half of the adults possess a high school diploma, one can assume that many Kentuckians are not avid readers, and only 57 percent vote in national elections. Politics have been localized, and schools have played the role of providing jobs for politicians. That era is coming to an end in most of the state, but the problems of an educational system heavily political in nature remain. While higher education has expanded and diversified in the last decade, the next decade will see further growth in adults returning for  additional education, plus the possibility of increasing the percentage of Kentucky youth who graduate from high school. The ultimate cause of Kentucky's problems is rural poverty. A systematic attack on this issue (pulling together local, county, and state leadership) through a strategy focused on early childhood preschool programs would have the best chance for success.

The state's diverse economy allows it to ride through recessions with ease. Housing costs are so high, though, that some of the benefits of the high income levels are negated. The state's population is the fourth oldest in the nation mainly due to the small number of children. Moreover, the fastest growing portion of the population is made up of people over 85, which could force future trade-offs between programs for children and those for senior citizens unless some action is taken now. Connecticut's youth population has declined sharply for a decade, but a turnaround has already begun in the early elementary grades. The state has a diverse and flexible educational  system from kindergarten through graduate school, but it is not coordinated in a particularly effective way. The higher education system seems to be meeting the needs of Connecticut's citizens. Some encouraging recent developments suggest increasing articulation and collaboration across the educational segments in the state. Additionally, promising starts have been made on cooperation among business, public schools, and higher education, as well as on the state's minority advancement program. (22 references) (KM)",

Delaware has been unusually popular with American businesses, leading to more Fortune 500 companies being incorporated there than in any other state. The economy shows a healthy balance between the sectors, with diversification a major factor in the state's relative economic stability. Delaware's manufacturing capacity will not need the retraining and job creation efforts that have characterized Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. The state's youth population has proportionately more blacks than the state as a whole, suggesting a gradual increase in the adult nonwhite population. Public schools in  Delaware seem to graduate a higher percentage of black students than the nation as a whole; however, the retention rate to high school graduation for all children could be improved. The higher education system in the state is diverse, with both a &quot;flagship&quot; and a traditionally black university, as well as some private institutions and community colleges. Increased voluntary coordination is necessary between public and independent schools, institutions of higher learning, and those representing business education and training programs. (KM)",

While its population total has dropped from fourth largest in 1980 to fifth largest in 1987, Pennsylvania is still one of the 10 states in the nation that contain half of the country's residents. The state's two major metropolitan areas, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, seem to have &quot;bottomed out&quot; in terms of manufacturing job losses and unemployment rates. Approximately 79 percent of the students in Pittsburgh's schools are thought to be below the poverty line. Pennsylvania's schools, however, do extremely well in retaining youth to high school graduation. Although total enrollments are going down, an increase has turned up in the early grades of school that will work its way up through the  system. Higher education in Pennsylvania is marked by richness and diversity, both in public and in private institutions. One problem, though, is the small number of minorities--as well as Caucasians--who go on to higher education. In general, Pennsylvania education is doing a number of things right. Investments in the system have been high, and--except for minorities--the investments seem to pay off. (22 references) (KM)",

Youth poverty is a major state problem, affecting the white and black and the rural and urban residents alike. The state's economy needs more diversification as there is little activity in the well-paying end of the service sector at the present; however, while most other states have been losing manufacturing jobs, Arkansas has held onto--and even added to--the jobs in this sector. This base can provide some stability as the state diversifies its work force by moving into other areas of business. Education does not make jobs, but a lack of education can certainly make jobs disappear. While raising educational standards is reasonably cheap, getting a larger percentage of youth to achieve these  higher standards is quite costly but well worth it. Additional efforts must be made to fund educational programs, including those for the vital preschool years. Arkansas' higher education is in comparatively better shape than the public schools, and would benefit greatly if more talented and well-prepared graduates from the state's high schools could attend its colleges and universities.

The schools are doing well according to the high school graduation rates, standardized test scores, the low percentages of at-risk children, and the state's relatively stable family structures; however, if energy prices remain depressed, the rates of family pathology are likely to increase as they are likely to do when there is an  increase in unemployment. The higher education system in Wyoming is simple: a single university and seven community colleges. College attendance rates are reasonably high; most residents go to college in Wyoming where the educational costs are somewhat of a bargain. Several more years, though, of economic declines could push the higher education system to some dangerous decisions due to the inflexibilty of financial resources. (19 references) (KM)",

Because equal opportunities must start at a very early age, a statewide Head Start-type program would be a wise and cost-effective investment. All through the Texas educational system, local leadership has been frustrated by the continuing attempt to run things from the top of the political structure, and local school  principals have been unable to develop new curricula that are geared to the specific needs of their students. The higher education system in Texas greatly emphasizes the &quot;flagship&quot; institution.

This urgency is reinforced by a national anti-drug campaign and Congressional passage of the Drug-Free Workplace Act (1988) and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (1986, with 1989 amendments) tying institutional compliance to federal funding eligibility requirements. Drug testing raises issues pertaining to the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Although an earlier appellate court case upheld the need for a &quot;factual basis&quot; of suspicion before subjecting a teacher to urinalysis, two 1989 U.S. Supreme Court cases involving public employees ruled that public safety  considerations outweighed privacy and individualized suspicion requirements. Attempts to pretest student athletes raise the issue of whether extracurricular activities are rights or privileges. Also, urinalysis and breathilizer tests can inaccurately reflect an individual's use or abuse of a controlled substance, particularly marijuana. According to one case analysis, school officials have no authority to regulate offcampus conduct having no bearing on properly maintaining the educational process. Mandatory urinalysis should be based only on individualized suspicion and satisfy both prongs of the T.L.O. v. New Jersey test for search and seizure constitutionality (i.e., reasonable suspicion and appropriate circumstances). Various drug education and prevention measures are recommended.

A program that is student-centered and that better responds to the unique social and learning needs of preadolescents is more appropriate. In response to a recommendation from the Governor's Commission on Excellence in Education, the Virginia Department of Education developed a 4-year (1988-92) plan that permitted individual schools to determine, within guidelines, the most effective organizational plan and instructional methods for their students. Chronicled within this document are the experiences of  chosen core committees from Monelison Junior High School in Amherst County and Prince Edward Middle School in Prince Edward County as they worked with their faculties and administrators to redesign their schools' organization and programs and begin the transition to true middle schools. Additionally, the responses to 15 open-ended questions of the committee members regarding their experiences during the first year of restructuring are included.

        "description":"The goal of this 2-year project was to examine applications of microcomputer technology in classrooms for students with severe handicaps. Staff members in 12 classrooms in the School District of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) were taught to use Apple IIe microcomputer systems and various peripheral devices. Teachers in these classrooms found word processing software helpful in assisting home-school communication, but data management applications were not viewed as time efficient. In the area of student instruction, the computer was useful as a means for developing motor skills and learning response/reinforcement contingency relationships. The physical arrangement of the equipment and the match between student and input device emerged as important considerations in promoting  successful student-computer interaction. Only a small proportion of students in project classrooms were able to use software intended to teach basic concepts and language skills. In addition to summaries of project activities and outcomes, this report contains the following appendices: (1) a paper titled \"The Use of Technology in Educational Programs for Students with Multiple Handicaps\" by Gail McGregor; (2) abstracts of other papers; and (3) a manual titled \"Introduction to the Apple\" which discusses peripheral devices, computer applications in special education, and activities for instruction and management.

The research studies cited have explored such influences on maternal reactions as her feelings of lack of control over external forces and her feelings of guilt that the deformity was her fault. Delays in the formation of the mother-child bond due to these reactions are evaluated, along with the impact of the parents' feelings of guilt and anxiety on the child's early emotional and social development. Other studies compare the effect of a facial defect (cleft lip) versus a hidden anomaly (cleft palate), and compare the adjustment of parents of older cleft lip/palate children with that of parents of younger cleft lip/palate children.  Frustrations in the feeding process, from both the child's and the parents' perspective, are addressed. Other influences on parents' reactions, such as the amount of time which passed before being told of the condition and the way in which the mother was told, are also considered. Finally, the influence of counseling is examined, with special emphasis on the roles of the speech pathologist and psychologist. 21 references. (JDD)",

In regard to the characteristics of research in the immediate future, it is likely to be: (1) collaborative; (2) interdisciplinary; (3) naturalistic; (4) intervention-focused; (5) conducted in centers and large independent behavioral research organizations; and (6) of limited short-term usefulness to school personnel. It is also likely that there will be: improvement in researcher training; a need to train professionals who can do quality research, integrate research, and translate research into practice; a need to train policy researchers; and a need to provide research training that simulates future roles.

Reasons given for this failure include lack of linguistic access to curricular content and the cycle of low expectations.

Twelve principles of the proposed model educational program include: sign language as the first language of deaf children, separation of sign and spoken language in the curriculum, second language (English) learning through reading and writing; and the least restrictive environment as one in which deaf children acquire a natural sign language and thus, access to spoken language and curriculum content.  Program components include: (1) Family Support Program (assisting children and families in language learning); (2) Family-Infant-Toddler Program (organized activities and training to foster ASL acquisition and socio-emotional development); (3) a preschool-kindergarten curriculum designed to prepare the children for the regular primary school; (4) a grades 1-12 component taught in such a way as to enable deaf students to acquire the regular curriculum; (5) a Child Development Center providing day-care and developmental experiences for children through the third grade; (6) an administration, research and development component; and (7) a component focused on materials and resources development.

This paper summarizes activities of the Coordinated Planning Committee including analysis of 2,136 consumer surveys which indicated that more than half of the disabled respondents needed more information regarding assistive devices and services and most spent less than $1,000 per year for technology devices and services. A concomitant survey of 444 Arkansas  rehabilitation professionals indicated professionals, too, felt a need for more information with 67% reporting they had received insufficient training in the area of technology and persons with disabilities. A Consumer Advisory Committee was also established with such goals as establishment of an information system, physically and programmatically accessible to all Arkansans. Finally, a proposal reflecting multi-agency and consumer involvement was prepared that delineated nine goals to address the priorities of the Consumer Committee.

        "description":"This review of the literature, litigation, and legislation summarizes special education classification patterns for children with disabilities in the rural Southeast. Focus is particularly on those socially constructed and culture bound disabilities (such as specific learning disabilities (SLD), educable mental retardation (EMR), and mild emotional disturbance) for which individual classifications are derived subjectively and whose identification varies accordingly from state to state, district to district, and school to school. It is concluded that, although much has been done through litigation and legislation during the last 15 to 20 years, discrepancies still exist in the placement of students in EMR and SLD classes with black students still being overrepresented in special  education placements, especially EMR placements. Socioeconomic status is a significant factor in determining into which category of special education a student is placed, with low socioeconomic status often leading to the EMR classification and middle or higher socioeconomic status more commonly leading to the SLD classification. Other issues identified include test bias, the need for prereferral interventions, and the importance of quality educational services in all special education placements. Contains 19 references.

The project produced a 15-minute training videotape as well as written instructional materials from which a safety training handbook was compiled. Following preliminary assessments, the videotape and training materials were field-tested with a total of 160 special education teacher aides in a series of three 10-hour workshops. The handbook developed through the project addressed classroom management skills and provided information for effective management of daily classroom and crisis situations. To assess the effectiveness of the training after program implementation, figures were gathered on accident frequency  throughout the Nassau Board of Cooperative Education Services (BOCES), measured in terms of days lost from work. Results found that accidents among special education personnel tended to be more frequent and severe than those in other BOCES divisions. Accident frequencies were found to have decreased somewhat following training. Results of the field testing are detailed in 3 figures and 16 tables. (PB)",

The combination of academic limitations and difficulties in getting along with others provide continuing problems for these young adults. Instructional and counseling services need to help these students become increasingly more self-sufficient, independent thinkers who can self-advocate and be responsible for their actions. The literature review and discussion also considers such issues as the need to teach the generalization of learning strategies, the need for student placement teams to stress development of independence and responsibility, careful consideration of implications for future options when  simplified or modified courses are taken, and the critical importance of social skill development. Eight suggestions offered by learning disabled college students for college-bound learning disabled high school students are listed.

Introductory information covers the purposes of testing (e.g., referral, screening, eligibility determination, instructional planning); types of tests and characteristics (group versus individual, norm-referenced versus criterion-referenced, and formal versus informal); student centered vs environmental centered assessment; kinds of assessment information; areas of concern for assessment (e.g., academic or behavior problems); test reliability and validity;  and protection in evaluation procedures. Tests are then described under the following categories: intelligence, speech and language, perceptual motor skills, adaptive behavior, diagnostic systems, reading, mathematics, written expression and spelling, academic achievement, personality, instruments and procedures for assessing young children, and vocational assessment and evaluation. Usually provided for each test is name, address of publisher and phone number, type of test, method of assessment, age/population test is intended for, and purpose. An index of tests is provided.

Requirements of basic federal legislation (The Education for All Handicapped Children Act) and recent amendments are briefly described. Incidence information as well as a listing of program options are provided for gifted students, children with physical handicaps, children with mental handicaps, children with behavior disorders, children with speech and language disabilities, children with learning disabilities, and children with specialized health care needs. Two trends in special education are also identified. First, children with  disabilities are receiving special education services earlier and second, a change in the public's attitude toward employment of people with handicaps has led to more instruction in vocational skills and assistance in the transition from school to community life and work.

Among findings were: an increase of 29% in the number of administrative hearings held during this period; educational placement issues were the most frequent type of complaint; parents prevailed in all or part of about 43% of administrative decisions and civil action cases; and parents who were represented by attorneys accounted for 59% of the cases in which parents prevailed. Incomplete data concerning award of attorney fees suggests a significant increase in amount of attorney fees  awarded, possibly related to 1986 passage of the Handicapped Children's Protection Act (Public Law 99-372) which authorized courts to award reasonable attorney fees to prevailing parents.

Discussed are: (1) the role of memory in learning; (2) simple associative learning (Pavlovian Conditioning and Operant Conditioning); (3) Piaget's concept of the moderate novelty principle, also called a mis-match of expectations; (4) the orienting response or reflex; (5) habituation, which allows the nervous system to focus on relevant events and not be overwhelmed by trivial types of stimulation; (6) the role of the emotions in learning and memory via the limbic system; and (7) procedural memory or habit memory which enables individuals to perform a series of automatically executed  motoric behaviors through a non-cognitive kind of behavior. Implications for teaching include stopping stimulus bombardment, giving anticipatory cues and waiting for a response, using routine objects/people in daily events, designing a routine with predictable pleasurable events, and looking for preferences and intentional communication.

Guidelines and sample activities are presented for use in a cognitive/visual/multi-sensory stimulation program to produce progress in cortically blind infants. The importance of using the eyes from birth through early development in order to form the nerve pathways responsible for visual perception is stressed. It is also emphasized that a child's visual skills can never be greater than his or her overall mental ability. In order for progress to be made in visual stimulation, three elements are necessary: a capacity for memory, a way for the child to signal a definite response, and motivation. General guidelines are offered to teachers and parents to develop infant visual skills in the areas of awareness and fixation,  following and tracking, and cognitive/visual skills. Cognitive/visual skills involve recognition of familiar people, things, and events; anticipation of routine events; development of behaviors that produce changes in the child's environment; and memory for things and people not present.

Results indicated most programs offered preparation at the bachelor's/master's level only. Almost half of the programs prepared students in only one area of special education; at the undergraduate, master's and advanced graduate levels, the most common areas of preparation were intellectual handicaps, learning disabilities and general special education respectively. A greater variety of areas of specialty was available at the master's level than the  bachelor's. General special education, intellectual handicaps and learning disabilities were the largest areas of enrollment in that order. Data on faculty, enrollment levels, graduation, and full- versus part-time staff are also offered by state and region.

An introductory section chronicles the history of artificial intelligence, focusing on its use with natural languages, and discusses its application to textual syntax. The first chapter examines computational linguistics in greater detail, looking at its relationship to several areas of language study (literature, artificial intelligence, and analysis of verb tense), the technological requirements, and specific aspects of the automated recognition of verb forms in a text. The second chapter outlines the automation of tense analysis using a model proposed by Harald Weinrich. Subsections discuss automated recognition of verb forms, statistical analyses, and the interactive role of the investigator with this  model. The third chapter contains the results of an analysis performed on Gustave Flaubert's &quot;Un Coeur Simple,&quot; accomplished in four stages: (1) analysis of the overall &quot;landscape&quot; of verbs in each chapter of the story; (2) the narrative tempo; (3) the speaker's attitude; and (4) transitions in tense within the text. The brief time taken for the computerized analysis is emphasized, and the approach used is seen as useful in bringing together literature and the study of natural languages through artificial intelligence.

The study also investigated the variation in achievement among children in the same program. Fifth and sixth graders from nine programs were included in the sample: 85 immersion students, 75 FLES students, and 265 FLEX (foreign language experience) program students. Major differences in oral proficiency scores were found between and within program types, with immersion students outperforming their FLES peers by more than four to one. The consistent differences are attributed to the amount of foreign language exposure in the program types. Both  groups of students scored highest in comprehension, followed by fluency and vocabulary, and were weakest in grammar. Intensive FLES program students scored higher than regular FLES students. Students from all program types had positive attitudes toward Spanish and Spanish-speaking people. Immersion students reported the most parental encouragement, followed by FLES and then FLEX students. (Author/MSE)",

The study focuses on key points at which decisions were made concerning instructional goals, staff development, teaching materials, and evaluation methods, emphasizing the change process. The study documents the conversion of the school district from one with low achievement scores among the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking students and low staff morale to one that has gained a national reputation as exemplary in its application of principles of curriculum design.

The SOPI is a tape-recorded test consisting of six parts. It begins with simple, personal background questions posed on a tape in a simulated initial encounter with a native speaker of the target language. Part one of the SOPI is analogous to the warm-up phase of the OPI, and the other five parts are designed to elicit language that is similar to language that would be elicited during the check and probe phases of the OPI. An examination of the SOPI research shows that the SOPI correlates so highly with the OPI that it is safe  to say that the tests measure the same abilities. A comparison of the advantages of each test suggests that the SOPI offers certain practical and psychometric advantages over the OPI. (VWL)",

It is proposed that consideration of joking repeats forces reanalysis of the organization of conversational repair. The preference analysis theory is rejected in favor of a locally governed analysis of conversational repair in which participants negotiate the course of repair based on how they perceive their respective abilities to successfully complete a correction. In joking repair, one participant pretends to misunderstand something a second speaker, with whom the participant is involved in conversation, has said in order to make a pun before providing a serious response. A crucial word or phrase is repeated, incorporating some change to bring out a new meaning. Because  speakers are accountable for their own speech, any correction by another speaker naturally presents a challenge; the pretended misunderstanding and correction by the second speaker presents the additional challenge of discovering the unintended meaning, correlating with joking's test function. The humor of joking repairs arises from simultaneous application of conflicting frames to one single stretch of talk. It is the rapid alternation between such mutually incompatible frames that leads to laughter. This analysis of conversational joking also led to re-evaluation of the general purpose and goals of everyday speech. (MSE)",

The program's aim was to develop English literacy skills and appreciation of cultural diversity, and to prepare students for the psychosocial dimensions of the workplace. The program provided instruction in English as a Second Language (ESL) to all students, computer-assisted tutorials in ESL and mainstream content area, vocational classes, and social studies courses taught with an ESL approach. The program's non-instructional component included career orientation, conferences, and guidance and counseling. Most participants were recent immigrants. The project met its objectives  in ESL and content-area learning, partially achieved its objectives in career-oriented activities and curriculum development, but failed to meet the attendance objective. Whether objectives were met in dropout rate, staff development, or parental involvement could not be determined. Recommendations for program improvement include attempts to increase student attendance and parent participation, and completion of curriculum materials. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The correlation of syntactic form with discourse function has become a central research area in linguistic pragmatics and discourse analysis. Most studies have proceeded on a construction-by-construction basis, failing to note significant generalizations across sentence types. One significant exception identifies a set presuppositional constructions in English that mark an \"open proposition\" in discourse as salient shared knowledge. This generalization is applied here to the class of inversion constructions. An inversion is a sentence in which the logical subject noun phrase appears in the post-verbal position. It is proposed that two semantically distinct types of inversion exist, corresponding to two distinct discourse functions. Non-locative inversion serves to mark an open  proposition as salient shared knowledge in the discourse, and locative inversion serves to present relatively familiar information in subject position. Moreover, the fact that locative inversion does not require a salient open proposition suggests that the two inversion types may have distinct syntactic representation as well.

This study is a collection of examples of alternatives to this traditional training model, and is not offered as a representative or exemplary sample. A discussion of the programs addresses these variables: coordination and consolidation within adult language training; equality of access, equality of condition, coordination with other settlement services; teacher development and  recognition; and input from and accountability to users and deliverers. It is concluded that two initiatives are critically needed: (1) action to permit, encourage, and support the development of programs to specifically facilitate language learning among immigrant groups not now well served; and (2) a major injection of leadership, funding, and administrative attention from the highest levels of government to lend coherence to a currently chaotic and wasteful system of immigrant language training.

The use of &quot;he&quot; and &quot;man&quot; and their derivatives to refer to people or animals of both sexes is seen as inaccurate. It is argued that while in formal writing, a pronoun should agree with its antecedent in both number and gender, the situation in speech is not parallel. The &quot;singular they&quot; is used widely and facilitates clear  communication among native speakers, and should therefore be taught to ESL students as one acceptable form of pronoun usage.

ESL composition teachers should act not as guardians of &quot;correct&quot; English but as cultural or ideological critics. ESL students need to be taught that even the most seemingly innocent discourse is actually aimed at gaining student adherence to the values of the culture's dominant ideology. This approach, termed the rhetoric of accommodation, fails to challenge or change the discourse communities not in the student's or society's best interest. Pedagogy informed by the rhetoric of resistance, such as process approaches using free writing, looping, or journal keeping, fail to realize  that the self is a social construct. If members of the ESL community are to be more than second class citizens in academe, the strategies of cultural criticism must be put to use to examine the ideological forces at work in current pedagogy and institutions.

It is concluded that interlanguage is a poor vehicle for the communication of representational information, and that this weakness is not peculiar to any one group of learners. Rather it is a feature of all interlanguage, including dialects, languages of wider communication, and pidgins and creoles.

The approach is described, and three phases of curriculum development are outlined: initial design, ongoing reform, and radical renewal. The history of ITA program design since the 1970s is briefly reviewed for changes in the system as a whole, in program purpose and mission, in measures of the system's performance, in resource allocation, and in system boundaries. It is concluded that much progress has been made in a short period, including a more proactive approach, more specific aims, improved quality and quantity of offerings to ITAs, and expansion of the boundaries of ITA training activities. A need  for additional work in this area is seen, based on five persistent problem areas: lack of a model for effective ITA training, inadequate program evaluation, doubts about the validity of a commonly-used language proficiency test, neglect of the ITA's roles other than as lecturer, and whether American undergraduates' attitudes toward racial stereotypes affect their comprehension of ITAs.

Based on a survey of teachers' opinions and student characteristics, the program was restructured to provide greater flexibility and adaptability, greater agreement between the aims of students and of the curriculum, and greater agreement between student characteristics and specific course offerings. The program uses a T-model curriculum, which provides a graded syllabus at six lower and intermediate levels leading to a broader  curriculum of electives at the highest level. Of three implementation strategies considered, only one, the normative-evaluative, which assumes that change involves alteration in attitudes, values and skills, and significant relationships, is seen as suitable for a university-based intensive ESL program. The curriculum will take considerably longer to implement than was originally estimated.

The OPI is a method of assessing general speaking proficiency in a second language. The SOPI is a tape-recorded test consisting of six parts: simple personal background questions posed in a simulated initial encounter with a native speaker, and five parts designed to elicit language similar to that elicited during the level check and probe phases of the OPI. Three of these parts use pictures in a test booklet to assess the speaker's ability to perform intermediate and advanced level functions. The last two parts require the examinee to tailor his discourse strategies to selected topics and real-life situations. The tape is scored by a  trained rater using a standard scale. In five studies involving different test development teams and different languages, the SOPI has been shown to be a valid and reliable surrogate of the OPI. The SOPI offers certain practical and psychometric advantages over the OPI, including administration without a trained interviewer, simultaneous administration to a group by a single administrator, and reduced cost.

Data for 83 high schools show that 23% of total allocations for ESL teachers were Chapter 1, 32% were PCEN funds, 40% were from tax levy, and 5% were from other sources. Most Chapter 1 and PCEN funds were used to support ESL teachers and paraprofessionals. Tax-levy funds were fairly evenly distributed among ESL, ESL and bilingual content area, and native language arts teachers. The Office of Research, Evaluation, and Assessment used ESL coordinators' responses on questionnaires to evaluate ESL programs. Responses show that Chapter 1  funds were used to extend rather than add supplemental instruction. Class size was generally in accordance with regulations. Field consultants noted that beginning-level ESL students participated less in class and used less English than did the more advanced students. At the intermediate level and beyond, English predominated as the medium of instruction. Program staff expressed a desire for more flexibility in fund allocation. Specific recommendations for program improvement are made. (MSE)",

The writing measure consists of a holistically scored essay on an educationally relevant topic and task, and a multiple-choice portion requiring the prospective teacher to identify errors in three simulated student essays. The speaking measure is an oral proficiency interview. The report describes the needs  assessment, test construction, field testing and revision, and the setting of appropriate passing scores on each test section.

Its objectives were to allow students to remain on or get back to their grade level, enable enrichment through additional school courses, and provide sufficiently mature and able students the opportunity to complete their high school programs in less than the normally required time. The program operated in conjunction with regularly-scheduled summer school sessions at each site.  Program evaluation was accomplished by staff interviews and observation.

Delays and lack of appropriate space were problems. Recommendations for program improvement include exchange of ideas between resource specialists and paraprofessionals, allocation of appropriate spaces at both sites, arrangement for computer science courses at both sites, and hiring of a full-time bilingual guidance counselor.

Simply knowing the language of instruction and the required math skills may not be sufficient for solving math problems. Cultural issues are present as well. It is suggested that instruction should be sensitive to both the cultural and linguistic needs of language minority students. Instruction that emphasizes language activities should be incorporated into content area lessons and curricula. This requires development in teacher training, curricula and materials, assessment, and cooperation between content and language educators. (Author/VWL)",

        "description":"Language learners use different learning strategies, specific actions and behaviors to help them learn, at least partly because their general learning styles, or overall approaches to learning and the environment, are so varied. Learning style encompasses: cognitive style; patterns of attitudes and interests; a tendency to seek situations compatible with one's own learning patterns; and a tendency to use certain learning strategies and avoid others. At least twenty dimensions of learning styles have been identified. Language learning strategies are often-conscious steps or behaviors used to enhance acquisition, storage, retention, recall, and the use of new information. Strategies can be assessed in a variety of ways. Language learning research has suffered from overemphasis on  metacognitive and cognitive strategies at the expense of other important considerations. Research has focused on the relationship between learning strategy use and language proficiency, individual differences in the use of learning strategies, and the value of training in the use of language learning strategies. Language learning styles and strategies appear to be among the most important variables influencing second language performance. A 30-item bibliography is included. (MSE)",

        "description":"Students at all levels of literacy learning can express their ideas in print. Teachers working with student writers have found that the attempt to express, organize, and understand personal experience is also a powerful language learning device. When students publish their writings, they can see their own thoughts and concerns, and those of others like them, represented and validated in print. Many literacy programs compile student writings into booklets, newsletters, or magazines both for in-house distribution and for external audiences. When adult learners publish for outside audiences, they are motivated to produce interesting and clearly-written texts and gain self-esteem. When students serve on editorial boards to categorize, select, edit, and prepare pieces for publication,  they have opportunities to identify and reflect on good writing. The readers of learner-produced materials benefit from the simplicity of text and topic, are inspired to write, and are provided with an inexpensive source of needed reading material. A successful writing program for limited-English-proficient adult literacy learners requires a process approach to writing, conversation as an essential part of the process, personal experience and the community as resources for material, and a well-developed publication system.

The full report provides a definitive review of the literature and institutional practice on the topic. Recent scholars have new ideas challenging traditional notions that organizations are driven by leadership or that the quality of leadership greatly affects organizational performance. Research traditions in leadership can be grouped into six categories of theories: trait, power and influence, behavioral, contingency, cultural and symbolic, and cognitive. One useful organizational typology from the perspective of leadership suggests that organizations can be viewed from four vantage points (structural, human resources, political, and symbolic frames). Study of leadership in  colleges and universities is problematic because of the dual control systems, conflicts between professional and administrative authority, unclear goals, and other properties of professional organizations. Leadership in higher education can be examined from the perspective of leadership theories and organizational frames, though an explicit conceptual orientation is absent in many of the works. Contemporary works indicate understanding of leadership in academic organizations may be undergoing a paradigmatic shift from a rational perspective toward a cultural and symbolic perspective. Cultural and symbolic theories deserve serious attention because they present a view of leadership that is highly compatible with the characteristics of academic organizations.

The full report provides a definitive review of the literature and institutional practice on the topic. Postsecondary developmental programs at institutions of higher education encompass a variety of courses and services that are conducted to provide assistance to individuals who have been denied regular admission to the institution because of failure to meet specified admission and placement requirements or because of predicted risk in meeting the requirements of college-level courses. These services focus primarily on skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and study and test-taking strategies, as well as personal adjustment and other affective variables crucial to  success in the college curriculum. Such programs began evolving as early as the mid-1800s when in response to the needs of underprepared students, programs classified as college preparatory served many of the same goals. Changes in labeling of preparatory programs are associated with the changes in student populations (reflecting the wide range of student statuses). Many developmental program models have emerged as a result of the growing diversity among enrollees. Remedial programs are perceived by their supporters as additions to, not replacements for, a required curriculum. They have helped fulfill the mission of providing equal educational opportunity in a democratic society. Enrollment in these programs has increased in recent years, and the trend will most likely continue into the  1990s and beyond. Contains 6 references. (SM)",

Handicapped access policies at private or independent institutions of higher education can be broadly characterized by two different policy approaches: policies that are primarily compliance-oriented, and policies that are more proactive and more service-oriented. Private institutions of postsecondary education in Texas must be in compliance with various state laws and regulations and with federal legislation if any form of federal financial assistance is received. In a compliance-oriented approach, provision for handicapped access is governed by the concept of &quot;reasonable accommodation.&quot; A broader,  proactive policy regarding handicapped accessibility recognizes that access goes beyond architecture, and addresses the areas of admissions, general services, and instructional services. This type of policy might make such provisions as permitting submission of scores from untimed college admission examinations, providing special off-campus transportation and homebound academic courses, and providing separate registration for disabled students. Advantages and disadvantages of each policy approach are discussed. A review of the literature documents the importance of social integration, the problems with institutional attitudes, and issues in program accessibility. 23 references. (JDD)",

Trends are identified in the areas of enrollment, financial aid, curricula, faculty, financial status, and assessment. Trends affecting enrollment include recruiting practices, increased publicity about institutions, emphasis on student retention, and demographic changes in the pool of potential applicants. Enrollment rates in general are analyzed, with special emphasis to racial/ethnic group students, adult learners, and part-time students. The number of students receiving financial aid has declined, and recipients have shifted from long-term degree programs to short-term vocational  programs. Changes in curricula are taking place, especially in the areas of general education and critical thinking skill development. Trends in employment include the increase in the number of part-time faculty, the underrepresentation of minority faculty members, and shortages of faculty in certain subject areas. The financial status of colleges and universities is being impacted by tuition rates, inflation, and faculty salaries.

        "description":"This paper explores the relationship of developmental advising and frequency of faculty-student contact to college students' cognitive growth. The study involved freshmen at two metropolitan Atlanta (Georgia) women's colleges: Agnes Scott College and Brenau College. Brenau freshmen participate in a two-quarter seminar which includes academic advising. At Agnes Scott College, advising groups meet occasionally, and individual conferences are held. The Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal was completed by the freshmen as a pretest. In the spring, the Watson-Glaser was administered again, and the Academic Advising Inventory was administered to measure advisor style and frequency of faculty-student contact for advising purposes. Multiple regression investigated the variance in  pre- and post-test Watson-Glaser scores explained by scores on the advising inventory and by frequency of contact. Quite high levels of developmental advising were revealed at both colleges. Significant variance in cognitive growth scores explained by advising style was found on two scales of the Watson-Glaser at Agnes Scott College, but not at Brenau. No sgnificant results were detected between frequency of contact and developmental advising at either institution. The paper concludes with recommendations for planning advising programs, future research topics, and 11 references. (JDD)",

        "description":"Helping students take active responsibility for their education may depend on how well educators link their classroom goals with the goals students hold for themselves. Goals are not fixed, but change as individuals change. Helping students revise their goals and improve their control of behavior are valid educational goals. Most institutions collect information about broad student goals as they enter, but few measure how they change from entrance to graduation. Current efforts to measure student outcomes foster the connection of goals and outcomes at course and program levels. Research on student goals continues to have a psychological orientation. Recent research has identified goal attributes, such as specificity, clarity, source, commitment, and temporality. that may be  helpful in better defining goals or relating college experience to goal attainment. Ideally, an inventory of student goals for achievement in particular courses would include broad goals, expectancies, self-concept, and goals specific to the course type. Faculty can use course-level goals to improve teaching by understanding the diversity and intensity of student effort in a particular class, apply teaching approaches appropriate for student expectations and interest, and refine the assessment process. An inventory will soon be available for use by classroom teachers and researchers. Appendixes list broad student goals identified in several major surveys as well as details of some common typologies. Contains about 220 references. (MSE)",

Literature on the academic needs and problems of low-income, first-generation, and disabled students is reviewed. These needs  include counseling, other forms of academic support, and financial aid. A survey of BSU freshmen documented the need for tutorial assistance in academic areas and in study skills. The role of the Student Support Services Project and the University Counseling Center in improving student retention and graduation rates is described.

The five private institutions which responded indicated that financing and compensation were based on student enrollment and special fees. Forty-one of the land grant respondents indicated that their summer schools were self-supporting. The 36 land-grant institutions receiving external support provided higher compensation for their faculty and allowed greater programmatic freedom. These institutions tended to use percentages of salaries in  determining faculty compensation, while self-supporting programs utilized funds per credit hour. Self-supporting programs tended to have more restrictions and paperwork. Management patterns of the summer school programs varied, with most being directed by the academic vice president, provost, or dean and some having part-time summer sessions directors. Thirty-one different combinations of summer session times were reported, with four basic patterns predominating. Most institutions reported a maximum number of credits a student could take during the summer. Eighty percent of the institutions indicated that faculty were limited to teaching a certain number of courses or credits per session. Four references. (JDD)",

The UC Davis Student Affirmative Action (SAA) Plan identifies the following groups as underrepresented in both the Graduate Division and professional schools: American Indian, Black/African-American, Chicano/Mexican American, Filipino/Pilipino, and Latino/Spanish-American. The report refers to this group collectively as SAA students. The Plan also designates Asian students to be underrepresented in certain graduate fields as well as in Management and Veterinary Medicine. The number of students from underrepresented ethnic groups applying to and enrolling in the UC Davis Graduate Division increased dramatically between 1981 and 1988, resulting in a doubling  of the proportion of SAA students. Applications to UC Davis professional schools of Management, Law, Medicine, and Veterinary Medicine declined overall from 1981 to 1988; the number of SAA applicants declined by a smaller amount, while total enrollment of SAA students increased. The proportion of SAA students enrolled in the UC Davis professional schools (12%) now equals the proportion in which they receive baccalaureate degrees in the state of California. SAA students are less well represented in the Graduate Division (7%), but disparity between baccalaureate degrees received and graduate enrollment has narrowed considerably. The disparity between proportions of Asian students receiving baccalaureate degrees (11%) and enrolling in UC Davis professional schools (10%) has been reduced but  continues. (JDD)",

The survey questionnaire was distributed to approximately 3,000 institutions of higher education in the United States. Characteristics of the over 800 respondents are analyzed. A section on job analysis practices presents data on the existence of individual job descriptions, group classification descriptions, the frequency of routine review of job information, and the percentage of job descriptions currently accurate and up-to-date. A section on job evaluation methods discusses the use of such methods as position classification and the point system, skill factors commonly used in job evaluation, and the position or department that is responsible for  job evaluation. Issues in wage and salary administration include use and sources of external salary information, frequency of use of survey data to price benchmark positions, salary comparisons to industry averages, the role of internal equity versus market rates in determining salaries, fiscal 1987-88 salary increase ranges, salary range widths, methods used to adjust individual salary rates, and the use of narrative or numeric performance appraisals. The final section analyzes considerations in determining the need for a new job evaluation system. Statistical data is presented in numerous graphs and tables. (JDD)",

The first concept, the tuition prepayment plan, was pioneered by the state of Michigan by passage of legislation in December 1986. The second concept, college savings bonds, was created and enacted the following year in Illinois. When questions arose about the tax status of tuition prepayment plans, other state legislatures began to prefer the college savings bond concept. This report describes how both types of savings plans work and lists a contact person or persons in each state that has passed savings bond plan or prepaid tuition plan legislation. The bulk of the report is composed of descriptions of the specific provisions of each state's program as of November 1989. For the 22 states  with savings bond plans, information provided generally includes title of program, operational status, description, price, and implementation status. For each of the 11 states with prepaid tuition plans, information provided includes: title of program, operational status, description, price of the tuition prepayment, portability to another higher education institution, terminations and refunds, transferability to another person, and administrative authority.

Many campuses do not effectively integrate students who are different. Institutions that are successful in this area tend to: (1) focus on student success and provide the tools for success; (2) enhance coordination and articulation with other educational levels; (3) dedicate resources to fostering acceptance; (4) have access to good information on institution and students; and (5) have leaders in the faculty and administration who provide direction for these efforts. Transformation of the institution into a system that is organized for diversity means addressing a number of issues, including faculty  and staff diversity, institutional mission and values, educating for diversity, dealing with conflict, the quality of interaction between students and faculty and institution, and the perceived conflict between quality and diversity. Institutions and policymakers can take these steps to respond to diversity: undertaking comprehensive institutional assessment and cross-institutional research, coordinating among sectors, increasing the numbers of students entering teaching, involving organizations successfully meeting the challenge, improving access, providing sustained commitment, and providing leadership.

        "description":"As the United States debates what it expects of college graduates and how to measure the achievement of these expectations, the goals of students frequently are overlooked. Goals are what individuals hope to achieve and accomplish. Currently most colleges collect information about the broad goals students hold for attending college as they enter, and the information is used for administrative planning or developing strategies to recruit and retain students. Some institutions also collect perceptions from graduating seniors and alumni about the extent to which they achieved their academic, personal, social, and vocational goals in college. Few institutions measure how student goals change from entrance to graduation or as a result of specific programs of study. Scholars have  developed typologies related to student characteristics, which have been criticized for perpetuating stereotypes. New developments in social science can help guide development of a comprehensive course-specific goals inventory capable of illuminating the multidimensional goal patterns students bring to college and the classroom. Faculty can use course-level goals to improve teaching and assessment. An inventory will soon be available for use by classroom teachers and researchers. (MSE)",

Of the 317 current and former fellows, 189, or 60%, responded to the survey. The survey instrument gathered data on completion of degrees, fields of study, demographic characteristics, gender, sources of financial support (with special emphasis on student loans), and employment status. The report concludes that the fellowship program had made it possible for approximately 100 graduate students to complete Ph.D. degrees (in an average of 5 years) and a somewhat larger number to earn Master's degrees. The program kept graduate student loan borrowing at a much lower level than  undergraduate borrowing. Seventy percent of respondents considered the fellowship to have been very important in the decision to choose a New Jersey graduate school. Only half of those who earned a Ph.D. were employed in New Jersey or the immediate region, compared to 80% of those who did not complete a Ph.D. A copy of the survey form and detailed tabulations of the results are found in the Appendix.

        "description":"Advances in educational technology have brought about changes in the scope of learning facilitated by technology, the roles of teachers and learners, and the sophistication of the processes used in developing instruction which will be communicated by technology. This paper considers these issues from the viewpoint of the learner. The first section describes the importance of technology in meeting the growing educational needs of society. The second section addresses the impact of technology in determining where and when learning can occur, and provides guidelines for systems of instruction that bridge gaps of time and space. The third section presents a model of the teaching and learning process that accommodates physical distance and discusses the implications of the model for  the role of the teacher. In the fourth section, the implications of new educational technologies for the learner are presented, together with a three-stage model of the learning process (acquisition of information, transmutation of information, and evaluation/application of information). It is argued that the classroom model emphasized the first stage of learning, with the teacher as information and law-giver, assuming extrinsically-motivated passive learners. It is further argued that the new model made possible through technology will not work unless the teacher is seen as the developer of learners, preserving their integrity and their responsibility for self-direction. It assumes active learners who are intrinsically motivated and an equal emphasis on all three stages of learning. (21  references) (GL)",

Learning is seen as a change in the conception of some aspect of reality and it is argued that learning has to be described in terms of its content. This line of research is intended to represent the learner's perspective and the description made from this point of view will thus differ radically from descriptions arrived at from the expert psychologist's perspective. Rather than characterizing underlying \"processes\" or \"mechanisms,\" it is important to characterize the qualitatively different ways in which individuals understand concepts, principles, and aspects of reality dealt with in their studies. Even the act of learning appears in qualitatively different ways in the  learner's consciousness. For some, learning involves memorizing a given text, but for others, learning implies finding out something about reality by reading that text. The qualitative differences in the experience of learning are closely correlated with qualitative differences in the outcome of learning. In order to improve learning, it is necessary to find out the different ways in which students think about the content and to raise their consciousness of the way they set about the learning task.

The project's goals were to: (1) determine the areas where microcomputers could be effectively used within the accounting curriculum and to develop particular teaching applications; (2) evaluate commercially available software and select representative business applications packages; (3) create the databases for an integrated study environment in collaboration with local  industrial companies and professional accounting firms; and (4) disseminate the case studies and accounting problems developed to other universities. This report describes the processes of information gathering, software selection, and courseware development, as well as the integration of computers into six accounting courses. Possible future developments are highlighted, and new educational practices necessitated by the integration of the microcomputer are discussed. The rationale for and methods of dissemination are outlined, and the evaluation of network installation, project implementation, and courseware is discussed.

Data were collected using student questionnaires, student interviews, institutional questionnaires, and discussion with staff members at each institution. Specific aims included were to: (1) determine the types of facilities and services currently available at study centers and the level and nature of their utilization; (2) determine the facility and service needs of students and institutions; (3) identify the cost of providing additional facilities and services; and (4) formulate recommendations on preferred configurations of a  study center, facilities which should be provided, provision of support staff and services, and arrangements for forming individual study centers into a network. Questionnaire and interview data are presented in separate chapters. The instruments used in the study are appended. (31 references) (GL)",

        "description":"Providing researchers, especially those in the social sciences, with access to publicly collected microdata furthers research while advancing public policy goals in a democratic society. However, while technological improvements have eased remote access to these databases and enabled computer using researchers to perform sophisticated statistical analyses, they have also increased the likelihood that individual records can be re-identified. Government agencies that sponsor the collection of microdata files containing personal and sensitive data are under increased pressure to form policies that allow continued improvements in data access while protecting subject confidentiality. Based on recent developments, this paper reflects on what the near future holds for the resolution of  this issue in five arenas: statistical, computer, legal, administrative, and ethical. In the statistical arena, agencies will develop methods of masking data through disclosure limiting and linear affine masking approaches. Electronic gatekeepers and monitors for remote access will be applied in the computer arena. Legal involvement will include legislation that ensures research access and provides sanctions for improper data use. In the administrative arena, agencies will place more responsibility on researchers as data stewards. Finally, ethical concerns will be addressed by developing a researcher's code of conduct.

Subjects included 105 at-risk eleventh graders in a remedial program funded by Holiday Inn. In a 5-week period during the summer, subjects were required to attend 5 CAI instructional sessions delivered by a WICAT S-300 computer system. Subjects studied mathematics, language, and reading CAI lessons. They were randomly assigned to either the report or the no-report group. Reports were provided individually, and the no-report group was unaware of the availability of reports. Math calculation tests served as the achievement dependent variable. Course completion served as the attendance dependent variable. Achievement data  ANOVA revealed a significant difference between the report and no-report groups. Analyses of attendance data revealed that providing students with reports increased course completion rates across all levels of ability and locus of control. This study provides empirical support for the often advised practice of providing students with CAI progress reports. (2 references) (GL)",

IMTS is designed to support training on the operation and maintenance of complex devices. Simulations are authored by device experts, who use the IMTS tools to draw the components of the device to describe their behavior, and to create simulations made up of the components. IMTS provides special support for maintenance training. An artificial expert on troubleshooting strategy, called &quot;Profile,&quot; generates instruction and advice for students. RAPIDS is an additional set of tools, built on the foundation of IMTS, that enables the authoring of a wide variety of simulation-based training  courses. Using RAPIDS, an expert creates lessons by performing in the simulation tasks that are to be taught to students. This technical report includes: (1) an overview of IMTS; (2) a description of the development and applications of derivative simulations; (3) a discussion of surface simulation authoring; and (4) a description of the use of RAPIDS to author instruction.

The limitations of rule-based knowledge systems are discussed and illustrated by means of an expert system built to calculate and diagnose standard cost variances. It is argued that, because of the nature of human intelligence as intuitive and reasoning rather than rule-based, such a system is, at best, a proficient or competent system.

General background outlining the increasing need for microcomputers in the accounting curriculum (including financial modelling tools and decision support systems such as linear programming, statistical packages, and simulation) is followed by a description of the process by which information was gathered on the use of microcomputer application packages by the accounting profession and industry in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The educational implications of microcomputer use are then addressed, including: (1) the need for training students in their use; (2) effects on the social process of learning and on the complexity of case study material that can  be employed; (3) effects on the organization and scheduling of classes; and (4) effects of word processing on students' writing skills. The applications of microcomputers in the curriculum are outlined. It is noted that finance, management, and financial accounting were the most appropriate subject areas for microcomputer applications and that spreadsheets and database management systems were the most obvious software packages. Plans for future development of computer applications are described. Two appendixes provide data on the use of microcomputers in the accounting profession. (3 references) (GL)",

College students worked on category-search or electronic troubleshooting tasks. Problems were presented, responses were recorded, and performance feedback was given using microcomputers. The studies examined the impact of receiving information about (1) temporal trends in one's own performance (i.e., intrapersonal feedback alone), and (2) temporal trends in both one's own and others' performance (i.e., joint intrapersonal and interpersonal feedback). In regard to intrapersonal feedback alone, the effects on students' learning of different types of \"absolute\" performance  information (e.g., weighted versus unweighted averages of reaction times on previous trials) were assessed. Results indicated that these manipulations had only weak effects. In regard to joint intrapersonal and interpersonal feedback, the effects on students' learning of different types of \"relative\" performance information (superiority versus inferiority as compared to others) were assessed. Here, evidence revealed that the type of feedback students received influenced how well they performed. It is suggested that the impact of intrapersonal and interpersonal feedback will be affected by the amount of practice time needed to achieve proficiency, and that feedback may have a larger effect with extended training periods representative of normal classroom instruction. Data are presented in  both tabular and graphical form. (65 references) (Author/GL)",

That plan may be based on either a computer literacy course model, a scope and sequence model, or an integrated model. Each of these models involves some combination of five categories of computer-related instruction: (1) teaching about computers as the subject of the instruction; (2) teaching computer science (programing language); (3) teaching productivity software (word processing, databases, and spreadsheets); (4) teaching about social issues related to computers; and (5) teaching with a computer to accomplish other instructional objectives. The first two sections of this guide describe each of the three computer use models and the five computer-related instruction categories in  detail. Primary uses of computers in instruction (including the teaching of thinking skills, the teaching of data analysis, and the teaching of the writing/revising process) are outlined and described in the third section. Guidelines for software selection are included. The fourth section presents suggestions for planning inservice programs to train teachers to use computers in the classroom. A structure for a teacher curriculum in instructional computing, containing topical outlines for each of the five categories of computer-related instruction, concludes the document. (GL)",

The student population is almost entirely black and generally considered to be socioeconomically disadvantaged and academically at-risk. Repeated observations were made of two classrooms (fifth grade and sixth grade) on a periodic basis over an 8-week period in the Spring of 1989. Three class sessions which were observed illustrate the different approaches to instruction at Lester using the computer. Each of the three teachers (a mathematics teacher, an English teacher, and a reading teacher) had a distinctive style of teaching, and their instructional methods, while all following the same general model,  were molded to the combination of their unique teaching personalities and the material to be covered. All three methods appeared to be effective. The methods used by the math and reading teachers, for example, seemed to use the computer effectively for reducing the teacher-student ratio. By using the computer and applicable software as a teaching aid, they were able to provide learning experiences for all of the class while retaining the instructional benefits to be experienced when instructing smaller groups. Both of these teachers have developed models of teaching using accessible computer technology that seems to allow for more independent tutoring. (GL)",

This project had three objectives for optimizing the pedagogical impact of these first attempts at teaching programing: (1) to describe the context of this initial experiment as fully as possible; (2) to analyze the curriculum in light of the theories underlying the teaching of programing; and (3) to conduct certain educational experiments so as to judge the impact of students' programing knowledge on learning. The research team studied the conditions prevailing in eastern Ontario schools in June 1984. The following summer, the team analyzed the curriculum to determine which aspects would benefit  from students' knowledge of programing. Finally, two teaching experiments, in geometry and composition, were conducted during the 1984-1985 school year. In each case, the performance of students who knew how to program was compared to that of students who did not. A study of this magnitude permitted a number of observations. At the risk of oversimplification, the researchers noted: (1) the quality of available material and a certain anxiety on the part of teachers about teaching computers; (2) the teachers' observations on the perspectives offered by the LOGO software package; and (3) the problems involved in transferring the cognitive programing skills to other subjects. Appended materials include the interview guide and questionnaire for teachers, graphs displaying data on teacher  attitudes, plans for a geometry lesson, and a test on the LOGO programing language.

        "description":"In July and August 1989 the Delaware-Chenango Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) piloted the Summer Telelearning for Academic Renewal (STAR) program, a telecommunications-based program aimed at reducing the potential for at-risk eighth graders to drop out of school. Students were selected for the program by their home schools on the basis of their grades and other factors suggesting that they were likely not to complete high school, including attitude, disruptive behavior, poor attendance records, and home environment. An evaluation of the program suggests that telelearning can be used with at-risk students, although a summer program may not be the most appropriate application of the medium. The STAR experience also suggests that small group activities and team teaching can be extremely helpful in molding appropriate learning behavior of at-risk students. This report describes the historical perspective and development of the program; provides overviews of the evaluation process, the team teaching approach, teacher selection methods, enrollment guidelines, and program activities; and discusses evaluation findings, including observations on group interaction of students, team teaching, and computer use by students. Evaluation forms used by students to assess the program are appended together with summaries of their responses. (GL)",

In the spring of 1988, a survey was sent to 116 member libraries of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) to gather data about workload, professional and non-professional staffing levels, use of bibliographic utilities, fillrates, and perceptions about staffing adequacy. This report uses the 76 responses received to present an overview of ILL staffing patterns, test assumptions about workloads and fillrates, and suggest some guidelines for libraries to follow in the analysis of their own efficiency and effectiveness. In  conclusion, it is suggested that the importance of professionals in ILL may be underestimated, and that increasing ILL activity may be causing a reduction in the quality of service in borrowing operations. Six tables highlight survey responses. Appended are a copy of the survey and cover letter; a self-analysis workform showing median productivity levels for libraries found to be effective and efficient in ILL operations; and linear and quadratic correlations and a chart for monthly analysis of unfills.

        "description":"In 1974, Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (PL 93-380) was amended to provide for the consolidation of certain educational programs for public and private schools into two parts, B and C. Part B consists of school resources and educational materials; testing, counseling, and guidance; and financial assistance for the strengthening of instruction. Part C covers supplementary centers and services; strengthening the leadership resources of state and local educational agencies; dropout prevention; and school nutrition and health services for low income families. This report features exemplary projects that fall under Part B of the amended PL 93-380. The data reported for these projects are derived from annual reports for fiscal years 1976 through 1978 from 50  states and seven jurisdictions: American Samoa, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Virgin Islands. It was concluded that: (1) state and local education agency personnel adjusted well to the consolidated program; (2) this program afforded new opportunities for cooperation among federal program administrators and specialists in various fields and instructional services; and (3) the instructional materials, equipment, and testing, together with counseling and guidance services, contributed greatly to the goal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, i.e., to improve educational quality and opportunity.

The Forsyth Library worked cooperatively with the departments to orient and train the students and to coordinate the efforts of professors and librarians. This report concisely describes the process of arranging to have DIALOG available to students on a reduced-fee basis, the hardware and software utilized, and other aspects of the pilot online searching project and subsequent programs.  Observations about the effectiveness of these programs, such as students' willingness to pay for searches and assignments being planned well before the end of the semester, are evaluated. Related impacts and implications--e.g., the substantial increases in demand for library services, librarians' time, and interlibrary loans--are assessed, and general trends in library automation and cooperative educational programs in Kansas are noted.

The study was intended to add to the general understanding of the means by which information about administrative innovations is currently disseminated among the nation's small- and medium-sized public libraries. For the first part of the study, researchers used telephone interviews, supplemented by published and archival records, to produce a narrative description of PLA's development and dissemination activities, and to compare these activities to the theoretical diffusion models that are found in the  general literature on change and innovation. The second part of the study consisted of a mail survey of 48 state library development agencies and a nationwide mail survey of a random sample of 626 public libraries serving populations under 50,000. Major findings indicate that library size is less directly related to adoption of the innovation than was expected. It is suggested that the diffusion of managerial innovations among small- and medium-sized libraries is largely influenced by the extent to which library directors can utilize multiple channels of access to information about innovations.

The survey questionnaires were sent to a total of 796 on-campus and off-campus faculty members. The results presented in this report reflect only the on-campus group. Of the 448 on-campus faculty members who answered the survey, 82% were either very or somewhat satisfied with the UI Library. Faculty members placed a very high priority on the use of the library by the students as part of the university experience, but their opinions were divided over who should have primary responsibility for teaching students to use the library. The most serious problem reported by faculty  members was obtaining materials for research in the UI library. Appendixes, which make up the major part of the document, include detailed statistical tables, qualitative results of the survey, and a breakdown of the costs associated with the study. (SD)",

The results of this project are presented in two reports. The first monograph provides a discussion of several issues related to productivity, including: (1) global economic competition; (2) the need to increase the nation's production of quality goods and services; (3) the improvement of productivity by upgrading the quality of the current workforce through retraining and recruiting, educating, training, and placing new and nontraditional workers; (4) special populations that comprise the emerging workforce and their educational and training  needs; (5) the strengths of two-year colleges that are applicable to human resource development; (6) a strategic model for training the new workforce; and (7) model two-year college programs. The second monograph reviews current public policy issues related to the role of two-year colleges and workforce productivity. Federal workforce training programs summarized in the second report include the Job Training Partnership Act, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Act, the Worksite Literacy Program, the Cooperative Education Act, the Federal Student Aid Program, and State Job Training Programs. A series of recommendations conclude the report, including those directed toward two-year colleges and their national organizations and toward the U.S.  Department of Labor.

All entering first-time freshmen are required to take the TASP test, which has a basic skills focus and a &quot;rising junior&quot; component, and to complete remedial course work if they do not pass all sections of the test. Students cannot obtain a baccalaureate degree nor graduate from a community college without passing the TASP. Two major groups are exempt from the testing requirement: anyone who had taken at least one college-level course prior to August 31, 1989, and those enrolled in a vocational-technical program requiring less  than nine hours of general education. Though the TASP test was developed by National Evaluation Systems of Massachusetts, Texas's 49 community college districts secured several major concessions with respect to the TASP test and related policies, including the development of two test forms, the reduction of test costs, and a refocusing of the test on basic skills rather than on &quot;rising junior&quot; assessment. The benefits of TASP include its diagnostic emphasis, the large number of people involved in test development, and mandatory remediation. Remaining problems include the state's failure to adequately reimburse the colleges for remedial education and possible bias against minority students. (JMC)",

The study focuses on fundamental demographic indicators, such as sex, age, and student status, as well as academic characteristics, such as number of semesters in attendance, grades earned, and transfer credit accumulated. Major findings of the survey were as follows: (1) the average age of graduates ranged from 29.1 (1986) to 30.6 (1988), and the percentage of women graduates ranged from 66.3% (1987) to 73.2% (1989); (2) the General Curriculum degree and the Business Administration degree were the two programs  with the greatest number of graduates through 1989; (3) in spite of high course enrollments, the Fine Arts and Commercial Art programs exhibited relatively few graduates; (4) from 1985 to 1989, there was a slight increase in the percentage of full-time only graduates (12.8% to 15.4%) while the percentage of graduates attending MxCC only part-time remained constant at about 33%; (5) the average graduate needed 7.5 semesters to complete in 1989 compared to 7.7 in 1985; (6) grade point averages (GPA) of graduates remained constant throughout the years studies at about 3.0, with female graduates age 25 or older, followed by male graduates 25 or older, having the highest GPA; (7) a relatively significant and consistent percentage of graduates used transfer credit (45.2% in 1985 to 51.3% in  1986); and (8) in any given year, approximately 40-50% of new students were placed into remedial English courses, yet usually less than 10% of new students took these courses.

        "description":"Designed to focus on the implications of change, Macomb Community College has comprised a list of the top ten issues facing America's community colleges today. Diversity is the first issue that community colleges face. Each college should develop a unique mission statement and respond to the changing needs of the community and the marketplace. The second major issue is open access. While open access has created diversity in the classroom, it has also made the task of meeting the individual needs of each student more difficult. Quality education is another major issue. The performance of community colleges is no longer equated to expansion; in the future, community colleges will have to define and document student success. A fourth issue relates to the shortage of professionals  which will occur during the 1990s. Community colleges must prepare to compete in the recruiting arena in the coming years. The issue of physical access to education has also arisen due to changing demographics and increasing technology. Colleges must cope with the new wave of \"electronic commuting.\" Instructional currency is another issue which must be dealt with by quality staff and college administrators, who must develop a future-focused vision. Such vision requires balancing community needs against programming which accommodates new advances and discoveries. Similarly, articulation efforts must be more efficient, as seamless transitions between institutions will help educators define their purpose, encourage more effective resource deployment, and produce better students. In addition,  sound mission statements must be developed in order to define institutional niches; otherwise, colleges may fall into the trap of trying to provide programs and services for every niche in the community college marketplace, an unattainable goal with limited resources. The issue of college governance must also be addressed; boards have to work at becoming more effective by defining their role and setting goals for themselves as a board. Before many of these changes can occur, however, colleges must be willing to change, to move from a foundation of success into a future of uncertainties. (JMC)",

The survey was designed to study and advance the use of student outcomes measures for assessing institutional ffectiveness in two-year institutions. Three sets of student outcomes were identified for in-depth study: academic progress and employment outcomes, student learning outcomes, and student satisfaction outcomes. Responses were received from 675 institutions, representing approximately 54% of the total AACJC membership. Major findings of the survey were as follows: (1) 61% of the colleges used academic progress and employment outcomes measures to assess institutional effectiveness, and 66% of the colleges gave higher or far higher priority to these  outcomes than to other types of student outcomes; (2) only 35% of the colleges measured student learning skills outcomes and used them for assessing institutional effectiveness; (3) skills assessment at entry was more common than exit-only assessment or entry-exit comparisons; (4) 55% of the institutions used student satisfaction to assess institutional effectiveness; (5) about 75% used measures of academic progress and employment outcomes in the accreditation process; (6) curriculum development was most often cited as the activity most affected by the use of outcomes measures; (7) respondents expected the priority associated with the use of student outcomes to increase within the next 3 to 5 years; and (8) enrollment size, accreditation affiliation, and geographical setting were not  significantly related to the use of outcomes measures.

        "description":"A summer employment and training project for high school dropouts was conducted at Florida's Pensacola Junior College (PJC) through the college's Adult High School. The program participants were economically disadvantaged teenagers who were eligible for Job Training Partnership Act funding. All but four of the 20 participants were high school dropouts, and eight either had children or were pregnant. The program was designed to improve the participants' reading and writing skills, encourage the participants to return to high school, and introduce the study of journalism to nontraditional students through the production of four newsletters and one videotape documentary. The students' typical day consisted of two hours of academic course work and five hours of paid work time. Four  student crew leaders worked an additional 12 hours per week. The 16 dropouts enrolled in a high school level refresher English course, while the four crew leaders enrolled in a college-credit course, \"Feature Article Writing.\" Work crews consisting of four high school students and one crew leader completed various job assignments. An evaluation of the project underscored the importance of institutional leadership in the day-to-day operations of the project to resolve such issues as the use of college vehicles to transport students to worksites; the use of PJC's public television station to produce the videotape documentary; and the development of good relations between crew leaders and members and between participants and the project supervisors. Pre- and post-test scores revealed  significant gains in students' reading skills and smaller gains in language and math skills. All but one of the students completed the employment component of the project, and 75% passed their summer English course. (WJT)",

The CLP addresses problems common to many community colleges: a large proportion of students unable to read, write, and think at the college level; student unawareness of or lack of concern with their academic deficiencies; and lack of student motivation to improve their skills. The CLP faculty seminar has been conducted three times since 1986. During its first semester, the seminar focuses on theory, definition, and hypothesis. The second semester deals with practice, as participants concentrate on developing or revising  assignments collaboratively. By 1989, 53 of OCC's 149 full-time faculty members had participated in the seminar. Most of the CLP participants expressed renewed enthusiasm about their work as a result of the program. In addition, the library and learning lab staffs are adapting critical literacy principles to their work. In addition to the annual seminar, CLP involves four other activities: (1) a national conference sponsored by OCC; (2) a regional consortium for sharing expertise and information on critical literacy; (3) a promotional video; and (4) CLP faculty participants' roles as presenters at professional meetings and as speakers or consultants at colleges interested in building similar programs. The bulk of the report consists of appendixes providing detail on CLP activities and  outcomes. (WJT)",

Students are targeted for the program in grade 10 and begin the program in grade 11 at the secondary level. The 2 + 2 curriculum at the secondary level is an occupational core curriculum that highlights goal setting and development, as well as practical application. Students enrolling in the 2 + 2 program take Principles of Technology, English (with the Applied Communications component where available), and Math in grades 11 and 12. Students who successfully complete the high school portion of the 2 + 2 program are  guaranteed acceptance into the technical programs at CCRI. Following the format of the tech-prep curriculum as a whole, specific articulated degree curricula have been developed for chemical technology, computer engineering technology, electronics, electronic engineering technology, engineering, instrumentation technology, machine design, machine processes, and mechanical engineering technology. Course sequences for each of the tech-prep curricula are included in the program guide. An appendix provides sample placement test questions. (JMC)",

Four operational data sets are analyzed: full-time equivalent (FTE) and headcount enrollments and cost per FTE; VTAE graduates; operational faculty and staff compensation; and district finances. Data are presented for the state as a whole and for each district. In addition, data are provided on new programs, school personnel and salaries, revenue sources, and tuition and fees. Highlighted findings include the following: (1) state VTAE FTE enrollment peaked in 1982-83 at 64,303, followed by declines ranging from 1% to 6.5% in most subsequent years, but an increase of 2.2% in  1988-89; (2) overall, only about 21% of program enrollments were full-time students; (3) 14 of 16 districts had a majority of female enrollments; (4) associate degree graduates represented an increasing proportion of the system's total number of graduates, growing from 38.8% in 1975-76 to 51.1% in 1988-89; and (5) the 113 new degree programs that were introduced between 1980 and 1989 produced 963 graduates in 1988-89.

This state-level approval is based on the following criteria: appropriateness to the system's mission, need for the program or course, quality of design, feasibility for the college/district, and compliance with relevant law and policy. In 1988-89, the Chancellor's Office approved a total of 21 new programs, 38 &quot;stand-alone&quot; degree credit courses, and 72 nondegree credit courses. In addition, the Chancellor's Office approved 693 noncredit courses. Over 65% of these courses were either short-term vocational courses with high employment potential, courses for older adults, or  English as a Second Language (ESL) courses. Between 1978-79 and 1988-89, the number of community colleges offering noncredit courses increased from 64 to 97, while the number of courses offered increased from 10,782 to 13,821. There was a noticeable drop of 20% in requests for approval of precollegiate basic skills courses, but a significant increase new mandated noncredit courses in &quot;Citizenship for Immigrants&quot; and ESL. Two tasks forces have been convened to clarify policy and develop regulations governing the approval and conduct of nondegree credit courses in basic skills and to develop regulations governing the provision of instruction for adults. The Chancellor's Office is also making progress toward streamlining and strengthening state-level approval procedures and validating the  program inventory in the systemwide management information system.

        "description":"In 1988, the Basic Skills Task Force was established to assess the effectiveness of four academic policies in addressing the needs of California community college students with skills deficiencies. The policies define the scope and content of Adult Basic Education and of Precollegiate Basic Skills Instruction in nondegree-applicable credit courses; require colleges to establish skills requisites for degree-applicable, entry-level courses; require that student progress standards be upgraded and a 30-semester-unit enrollment limitation be enforced in precollegiate basic skills courses; and define the scope of student assessment programs and their relation to course placement. The Task Force was charged with examining and refining the policies by assessing the costs of policy  implementation, developing strategies and timelines for the establishment of precollegiate basic skills courses, and recommending policy changes. After more than a year of study and discussion, the task force developed five recommendations: (1) current basic skills policies should be expanded to allow for a basic minimum core of precollegiate basic skills courses, and an expanded set of courses to respond to other needs; (2) regulations governing course standards should more clearly identify characteristics and conduct of nondegree-applicable and noncredit courses; (3) the Chancellor should prepare a comprehensive annual report on precollegiate basic skills instruction; (4) the Chancellor should ensure that staff development includes training and retraining for the effective delivery of  precollegiate basic skills instruction; and (5) the colleges should develop local strategies to ensure the support for and provision of basic skills in nondegree-applicable credit courses.

The target populations of the study were 6,392 students who were admitted to MATC in 1988-89 and 884 students who graduated from MATC, transferred to other institutions, did not return to MATC, or withdrew voluntarily from MATC during 1988-89. Study findings included the following: (1) there were no major educational or demographic differences between the entering students or the leaving students; (2) the reasons given by students for withdrawing in the middle of the semester  were largely personal, such as personal or family illness, and changes in education plans; (3) the most important reason for leaving cited by nonreturning students was financial, though personal problems were also important to this group; (4) although students who left the college indicated that they were satisfied with student services, a majority did not use these services; and (5) there were large differences in the proportion of withdrawing and nonreturning students by ethnic group, with fewer minorities persisting than whites. Appendixes provide the MATC student progress flowchart, a synthetic causal model of student attrition, SAL database categories, student surveys, and an ASSET educational planning form. (JMC)",

At the conference, 116 speakers shared their expertise with each other and an additional 300 participants from 38 states. Speakers and participants represented a broad range of views on trends and issues in early childhood education. Plenary sessions featured debates about the role of government in supporting families, the extent of need for child care, the upcoming legislative agenda, and the costs and benefits of early childhood programs for disadvantaged children. Conferees addressed issues such as continuity, comprehensiveness, quality variations in child care and education, infant care, early  childhood curricula, testing of young children, staffing, the role of the public schools in providing child care and early childhood education, and parental involvement in early childhood programs. Policy options such as tax credits, parental leave, regulation of child care, and welfare reform programs were also considered.

Teachers working with parents should also have appropriate field experience. Trivia in objectives, guess work in selecting learning opportunities, and evaluation techniques that lack validity and reliability should be  avoided. A psychological, and not merely logical, curriculum in which the learner selects learning activities on the basis of interest, meaning, and self-fulfillment can be balanced with measurement-driven instruction to provide an optimal sequence of learning activities by means of which at-risk students can make progress.

A total of 518 districts, or 93 percent, responded. Of these, 161 districts indicated that they had a 2-year developmental program for children who were old enough to enter kindergarten but were judged not ready for the regular kindergarten program. Schools with a readiness kindergarten program were asked what type of screening instrument they used. All tests used test reviews from the Seventh through Ninth Mental Measurements Yearbooks. Tests were examined for representative norming samples, validity data, and reliability data. Many were found to be deficient in one or more areas and many were found to be inapplicable or  inappropriate. None of the screening instruments used by districts in 1984 met criteria of representative sampling, reliability, and validity. It is concluded that placements of young children into 2-year developmental readiness programs should be made with great caution. Given the lack of statistical data, screenings that result in indications of deficiencies should be followed by extensive examinations. (RH)",

Data were collected through observations and evaluations of 149 randomly selected day care centers and family day care homes. Measures included day care and family day care versions of the Child Development Program Evaluation Licensing Scale (CDPE), the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (ECERS), and the Family Day Care Home Rating Scale (FDCRS). It was hypothesized that there would be: (1) a positive linear relationship between CDPE licensing scores and ECERS scores; and (2) no significant differences between nonprofit and profit centers, sponsored family day care homes and independent homes, day care centers and family day care homes, and day care centers and family day care homes in urban,  suburban, and rural areas. Results indicated a significant difference between nonprofit and profit day care centers. Day care centers scored significantly higher (ECERS) than family day care homes (FDCRS). Program compliance scores as measured by the CDPE and program quality as measured by the ECERS/FDCRS showed a strong curvilinear relationship. Rural programs scored significantly higher than urban programs on program quality measures. Implications of the findings for day care policy are discussed. An appendix briefly describes the measures used. (RH)",

It is maintained that a group's language reflects its culture, and the uses to which that language is put are culturally determined. When children and adults do not share common experiences and beliefs, adults are less able to help children encode their thoughts in language. To overcome problems of the multicultural classroom, teachers need to learn to recognize developmentally equivalent patterns of behavior across cultures. They should not value some ways of achieving developmental milestones more highly than others. Teachers need to begin instruction with interactive styles and content that is  familiar to the children. Whether this entails speaking in the child's primary language, using culturally appropriate styles of address, or relying on patterns of management familiar to the children, the purpose is to establish a basis for communication. One of the most important tasks for teachers is interpreting the school's agenda to parents. When differences exist between the cultural patterns of the home and community and those of the school, teachers must deal with the differences directly. Formal assessment of learning outcomes should be delayed until teachers and children have built a set of shared meanings. (RH)",

        "description":"The assessment of individual or community nutritional status involves the use of indicators; when properly analyzed and interpreted, these may be used to decide what strategies to implement, or how to orient activities aimed at improving nutritional status. In primary health care programs, one approach which remains underused involves obtaining knowledge of the nutritional status of families, so as to better adjust treatment to each individual, to guide preventive action at the family and community level, to evaluate nutrition programs, and to provide the information needed for planning in the field of food policy. This approach involves the use of judiciously selected indicators or indices, each measuring a specific phenomenon and yielding a well-defined piece of knowledge. In  the interpretation of the findings, certain rules must be applied if the exact signification of each tool or measurement is to be respected. Periodical longitudinal monitoring of the nutritional status of families, extended to the in-depth interpretation of qualitative and quantitative findings, is needed for the early detection of malnutrition, the regular observation of the evolution of the nutritional situation in each region over the years, and the gradual development of interventions aimed at improving living conditions through action in the many sectors involved, including food and agriculture, health, economics, and education. This report provides a rationale for evaluating nutritional status and describes anthropometric indicators of nutritional status. Further discussion concerns  neonates, pregnant women, presentation of data, and biological assays in the assessment of nutritional status. A brief glossary of terms is given, followed by an appendix of anthropometric reference tables. (RH)",

The paper uses teachers' descriptions of their experience to explore the effect of reduced class size or reduced teacher/pupil ratio on developmental appropriateness of primary grade curriculum and on adult-child interaction. Current class size research is briefly sketched. The paucity of findings regarding classroom processes is noted. Next, Project STAR, a 4-year longitudinal study of effects of reduced class size and teacher/pupil ratio in kindergarten through third grades is described. Results of the teacher  interviews are summarized and discussed in relation to the National Association for the Education of Young Children's position statements on developmentally appropriate practice in the primary grades. It is concluded that small classes of about 15 students and regular size classes of about 25 students and a full-time aide contribute to a primary grade experience that is more congruent with the developmental and learning needs of students than is the experience of proportionally larger classes.

        "description":"Practitioner use of learning style theory and measures can have an impact on curriculum design, instruction and assessment methods, and student guidance in the secondary school. Concern about the \"operationalization\" of learning style continues due to confusion concerning definitions, weakness in reliability and validity of measurements, and problems with the accurate identification of the most relevant characteristics of learners and instructional settings. A new taxonomy of learning styles, designed to help practitioners interpret information derived from learning style measures, is offered. The taxonomy integrates several strong conceptualizations of learning style. The central idea behind the taxonomy is that learner success in any \"teaching-learning situation\" requires  positive motivation on the part of the student. Such motivation will lead to a sufficient degree of engagement in the task and to active task processing that will integrate the new information into long-term memory. A total of 13 learning style theories are summarized and discussed in terms of their contributions to the taxonomy. The document also summarizes selected literature concerning positive results for students whose learning style is matched to features of instruction, testing, and direct training. Areas for further research are suggested and the use of learning style theory and measures by practitioners is encouraged. (RH)",

Of the sample, 22 children in a description condition described each of 6 line drawings for each event. Another 22 children in a standard condition narrated stories without previewing the pictures. In The remaining 26 children, in a preview condition, previewed the pictures before narrating stories. For half of the children in each condition, the pictures included a problem-resolution sequence; for the other half, the pictures included an uneventful sequence. Findings revealed that 4-year-olds differentiated between descriptions and stories in the  complexity of their narratives and in their use of tense and pronouns. The episodic structure of the narratives influenced measures of linguistic cohesion with the result that children produced more coherent stories and tended to use a more complex pronoun strategy in the problem-resolution version. The preview condition, in comparison to the description condition, resulted in improved stories. It is concluded that 4-year-olds are capable of narrating problem-resolution stories when pictures are used as aids. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Preschool and first-grade children's story production was studied. Participants were 96 children who were asked to relate stories about two familiar events: baking cookies and taking a trip to the beach. Story events were depicted in line drawings in a coloring book. Half the sample was assigned to a preview condition in which children narrated stories after viewing the pictures. The other half, assigned to a standard condition, told stories without previewing. Half the children in each condition were given pictures that included a problem-resolution sequence, while the other half viewed pictures of a typical, but uneventful, sequence. Findings revealed three predominant techniques that children used to create cohesion: interclausal connectives, intraclausal devices, and  pronominal reference strategies. Effects on coherence were more complicated, and concerned developmental differences in story structure and content. Previewing of the picture sequence affected coherence. First graders, in comparison with preschoolers, seemed to have a more elaborate concept of a story. This concept enabled flexible adaptation to different structural contexts. To some degree, the amount of cognitive effort required determined children's success in using linguistic reference devices and incorporating the episodic story structure into their narratives. Preschoolers' storytelling abilities were tenuous, although not as poorly developed as once believed. (RH)",

Drawing and verbal descriptions were collected in two sessions separated by a 1-week interval Participants were 16 children of 5 and 6 years of age who were in day care. Comparison of defining features in verbal and graphic descriptions revealed a distinction between basic structural and nonstructural elements of the house. Structural features were those considered prototypical of a house, such as doors, windows, roofs. Nonstructural features, such as trees, garages, kitchens, and furniture, were elements not prototypical of house descriptions. The basic structures of houses were represented by the majority of children in their drawings and descriptions. However, both prototypical items and  their elaborations were more often drawn than verbalized. Nonstructural elements were separated on the basis of whether they were internal or external to the house. Features which could be seen on the outside of the house were more often depicted graphically, while those seen on inside were more often verbally represented. It is concluded that verbal and graphic representations of objects may rely on functionally distinguishable but interacting symbolic systems. (RH)",

The questionnaire covered four categories: (1) background information; (2) education and experience; (3) training for the CDA; and (4) salary and position increases after receipt of the CDA credential. Responses were received from 37 percent of those surveyed. It was found that the overwhelming majority of CDAs are females having an average age of 38 years at the time of the credential award. A variety of ethnic groups make up the CDA population; 53 percent of the population is white. CDAs, who are generally well-educated, work in a range of preschool  settings. Nearly 80 percent worked for Headstart at the time of the credential award. CDAs receive considerable support from employers and the community. Most employers of CDAs paid all or part of the cost of their CDA training. Most CDAs teach, and their salaries are low. In 1988, 52 percent received a salary increase as a direct result of having earned the CDA credential. However, salary increases were minimal, with only 20 percent receiving increases over $500 a year. Position increases have shown a slight upward trend since 1983. The survey instrument is appended.

Patterns of adjustment and group response are described as social constructions which stigmatized the two children studied. The 24 children in the group came from traditional families. Most were 4-year-old girls. Data were obtained from multiple sources, including 34 hours of videotaped behavior in activity centers; 72 hours of participant observation field notes; transcripts from taped formal interviews with teacher, aide, and mothers; classroom artifacts; school records; reports; program descriptions; and material from children's cumulative folders. The two children on whom the study focused, Dan and  Joan, were found to break rules by behaving aggressively; failing to recognize or accept routines, rules, and limits; and missing opportunities to have positive contact with peers. Reported findings describe Dan and Joan's rule-breaking behaviors and three general patterns of peer responses: exclusions, snubs, and put-downs. Characteristics of exclusions, snubs, and put-downs are discussed. Concluding remarks focus on social processes and intervention. (RH)",

        "description":"This study investigated the way in which parental beliefs moderate affective reactions to children at risk for abuse. A sample of 40 unrelated mothers was drawn from a larger research project. At-risk and not-at-risk children were recruited from 40 families participating in counseling at a local child abuse agency. At-risk status was determined through: (1) difficulty ratings reported by mothers; and (2) amount and severity of discipline received, as measured by Straus, Gelles, and Steinmetz's (1980) Conflicts Tactics Scale. The Parental Attribution Test was used to assess parental beliefs concerning causes of caregiving outcomes. Unrelated mothers were asked to interact with children from the families receiving counseling for child abuse. Each mother interacted with two  siblings, one of whom was rated as being at greater risk for child abuse. Matched speech segments from the interactions between mother and child were acoustically analyzed in terms of the speaker's fundamental frequency, pitch perturbation, and acoustic quality. Analysis revealed that speech from \"powerless\" mothers was characterized by significantly more stress, especially when the message was directed to children at relatively greater risk for abuse. It is argued that differences in the mother's speech quality are signs of perceived stress and will ultimately contribute to ineffective communication patterns. (RH)",

        "description":"This study investigated the issue of whether young children understand that the acquisition of certain types of knowledge depends on the modality of sensory experience involved. Sight and touch were the two sensory modalities investigated. A total of 36 children of 3-5 years of age were exposed to pairs of objects that either looked the same and felt different or felt the same and looked different. Children's understanding of the modality-specific nature of knowledge was assessed in terms of their ability to correctly state whether they would need to see or feel the object in order to determine its identity when it was hidden under a toy tunnel. Although the 5-year-olds performed well, the 3- and 4-year-olds had great difficulty in differentiating the types of knowledge to be  gained from different sensory experiences. Results are discussed in relation to children's theory of mind and understanding of the process of knowledge acquisition. (RH)",

        "description":"The Parent Attitude toward Children's Expressiveness Scale (PACES) provides a measure of the degree of acceptance-control the respondent allows toward a child's hypothetical emotional and expressive behavior. PACES is a 20-item scale with a multiple choice format for each item. Emotional and expressive behaviors represented in PACES include anger, distress or sadness, fear, anxiety or nervousness, interest or curiosity, happiness or pleasure, and disgust. Some accepting responses are of a sympathetic or empathic sort, while others are more suggestive of permissiveness. Some of the most controlling reactions border on humiliating or ridiculing the child, while others are more indicative of a scolding response. The instrument appears to be a reliable instrument for assessing the  degree of control in a parent's attitude toward children's emotional and expressive behavior. The scale appears to have good construct validity as an attitude measure that evaluates the degree to which parents believe children ought to control their displays of emotional and expressive behavior. Past and ongoing research with the scale is reviewed. It is concluded that PACES provides numerous possibilities for investigating a variety of questions in the area of emotional development, family systems, and socialization. (RH)",

The CIRC curriculum is intended to help students in the early grades acquire a variety of reading and literacy skills. The curriculum centers around &quot;treasure hunt&quot; units that last 5 or more days each. These units focus on the reading of a narrative that is presented in two successive segments. Student dyads are required to discuss and answer questions developed for each segment. Questions for the first segment end with a prediction question that asks students to predict what will happen next in the story. Analyses indicate the occurrence of three main functions in the interaction of students in dyads (in which the teacher occasionally  participated). These functions include: (1) teachers or students giving assistance to a student; (2) students demonstrating competence in offering answers to a question or solutions to a problem; and (3) students asking for help directly or indirectly. It is concluded that findings could be helpful in increasing understanding of the ways in which cooperative learning works at the level of student interaction. (RH)",

This measure includes subscales for students' perceptions of their self-worth, social acceptance, and other aspects of their appearance and accomplishments. Subjects also reported on features of their friendships with up to three close friends. Over 300 children from the fifth, eighth, and eleventh grades participated in the second study. These students completed the tasks performed by subjects in the first study and also rated their liking for same-sex,  same-grade classmates. On the basis of the peer ratings, students were judged as higher in either popularity or rejection. Findings indicated that friendship and social status are distinct facets of peer relationship. Peers' influence on classmates' sense of self is especially salient in the junior high years. Supplementary data showed that students' academic achievement, achievement motivation, and classroom behavior were only weakly related to their perceived social acceptance, social status, and friendships.

A questionnaire listing 462 qualities of early childhood teachers was compiled from literature reviews. Subjects were asked to check a maximum of 50 qualities. Of the 142 principals and kindergarten teachers in 6 northern Louisiana parishes to whom questionnaires were mailed, 39 percent returned the forms. In a similar mailing of 266 questionnaires to 18 rural and urban school districts in Texas, 74 percent of principals and 67 percent of kindergarten teachers responded. Findings indicated that principals and kindergarten teachers lacked agreeement on qualities deemed important for  teachers of young children. This was true even among teachers and principals in the same school. An exception was found among principals in Louisiana, who exhibited agreement on seven items dealing with administrative concerns, effective teaching skills, and innate qualities. Six of the original 462 items were ranked important by three of the four respondent groups. Only two items were on both the Louisiana principals' list of seven and the majority's list of six qualities; these were: accepts children equally, and aids with positive self-image. (RH)",

The experiment was designed to determine whether preschoolers can effectively use an elaboration mnemonic to enhance serial learning without specific instruction during retrieval, and whether preschoolers can generate their own associative images during encoding. Findings of the experiment demonstrated that preschoolers can successfully use a sophisticated elaboration mnemonic to enhance serial recall, even without specific retrieval cues. Under certain conditions, they can effectively  generate their own relational imagery. In the second experiment, 27 preschoolers ranging in age from 3 years, 4 months, to 5 years, 2 months were randomly assigned to image generating, image and mnemonic generating, and control conditions.

Respondents substantially agreed on the importance in a training curriculum of the American Indian perspective, a case-study approach, family therapy, and identification and intervention skills needed to deal with both child abuse and neglect and chemical dependency. Appendices include the tribal needs and worker skills assessment findings. (DHP)",

        "description":"This report outlines the major rural development programs and initiatives of the Department of Agriculture and other federal agencies. Diverse economic realities make necessary differential rural development policies and programs. The federal budget deficit makes it necessary that the government use creative and efficient management techniques to stretch limited resources and direct them to the areas demonstrating the greatest need. Federal assistance can be financial, physical (infrastructural), or human resource-related. The Department of Agriculture has played a role supporting town meetings and local initiatives in several U.S. communities. Similarly, eleven major federal departments report on current programs that specifically target and serve rural areas. They include the  departments of: Commerce, Defense, Army, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, and Transportation. Federal projects are also described by six independent federal agencies including the Small Business Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Veterans Administration, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Rather than being a comprehensive listing of programs and activities, this report serves as a general primer about the federal government's efforts on behalf of rural development. It also details the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 1989 rural development strategy and describes the 1990 rural development budget. (TES)",

        "description":"The role of schooling in the economic development process has been targeted as essential in both human capital theory and modernization theories. Research into the nature of underdevelopment in Central Appalachia has provided a basis for debate among regional scholars as to its causes and consequences, yet serious discussion of pre-modern structural conditions of many rural and Appalachian schools is almost non-existent. This paper briefly reviews the themes and theories surrounding the underdevelopment issue, and provides an illustrative case study on the economics and politics of underdevelopment in the East Tennessee school district of &quot;Clinch County.&quot; The results suggest that: (1) historically, schooling was largely controlled by local families, churches or &quot;outside&quot;  missionary forces, and contemporary public education is still influenced by this tradition; (2) the school system has been poorly financed and lacks facility and staff; (3) many modern and professional educational characteristics are visibly lacking, reflected in poor administrative policies and leadership; and (4) modernization models that posit schools as an independent force in the development process should take more factors into consideration, such as historical, cultural, economic, and political circumstances surrounding public education.

        "description":"Rural communities are often dependent upon their agricultural bases, which have undergone drastic changes. For communities to remain viable as economic units certain measures must be taken. Strategic planning can assist communities in assessing their situations and in developing plans and implementation schedules. Initially used in the business and corporate worlds, strategic planning can be used by education, including continuing higher education and the Extension Service to deliver efficient, effective programs. The purpose of this paper is to present a strategic planning model designed to fit small-town community development in group situations. This model focuses on rural communities with populations of 1500 or less and was piloted in three areas of Nebraska. Cooperation  between small towns and communities is also part of the model. Non-residential cooperative extension personnel have no preconceived notions about the community and hence can remain objective and neutral in delivering the program. The following six steps constitute the strategic planning process as it is applied to small community development in a group setting: (1) determining who should be involved in the process; (2) determining the geographic area and its needs; (3) analyzing the external environment affecting the area; (4) assessing the area's strengths and weaknesses; (5) analyzing competing areas; and (6) examining potentials for growth and development, assumptions for success, and development of objectives with an action plan.

        "description":"This ERIC digest presents an overview of small-scale schooling in an international context; examines demographic data, staffing problems, and incentives used in other nations; and points out the distinctive characteristics and unique value and potential of small schools in both industrialized and developing nations. Rural school populations remain significant in most countries and even in the most industrialized countries, small rural schools are still the rule rather than the exception. The plight of small schools has, however, grown worse in both industrialized and developing nations. Stereotypes of small schools and their settings are misleading; these schools are diverse, and their characteristics vary substantially, even within a single nation. Small schools have survived  out of necessity in industrialized and developing nations alike. Although no one definition of &quot;rural&quot; or &quot;small&quot; applies to all countries and settings, the strengths and needs of small schools transcend national boundaries. Small schools will not disappear in the foreseeable future because the rural populations served by small schools will continue to be substantial, even as industrialization proceeds. The strengths of small schools, as well as their evident needs, are significant, and policies should attend to both. Because of their diversity, small schools cannot be well served by a single policy even within a given nation. Policies to support small schools must consider the specific local or regional context, so that the needs of small schools can be met at the same time. This digest  lists 10 references. (ALL)",

The program serves approximately 110 students, ages 1-18. Instructors, supervisors, and aides work with nursery, preschool, and elementary-age children at a local school, while an outreach instructor serves secondary students in the evenings. The program stresses basic skills development in reading, oral language, and mathematics, but also provides experiences in music, art, physical education, and career education. Student information is coordinated through both the Migrant Student Record Transfer System and contact with school personnel in Texas (home state of 90% of program  participants). Glendive residents show extraordinary appreciation for the role of migrant families in the area, host a picnic for migrant families each June, and share their expertise and talents as guest speakers at the school. Other program features include strong leadership, experienced staff, inservice professional development activities, parental involvement, appropriate instructional materials, high expectations for student's learning and behavior, positive classroom environment, maximum use of learning time, close monitoring of student progress, regular feedback and reinforcement, recognition and rewards for student and teacher excellence, and extensive evaluation of program effectiveness.

        "description":"California State University (CSU) at Chico has been an innovative leader in distance education for many years. In 1969 CSU began offering external degree programs, delivered by faculty who commuted to community college locations around rural northern California. In the early 1970s a study on the needs of higher education in the area resulted in the creation of an extensive Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS), which replaced the commuting faculty. ITFS is a one-way video, two-way audio system that currently delivers single courses and entire degree programs to about 550 students at 16 learning sites. It also serves numerous educational groups, state agencies, and corporations. Classes are live broadcasts of regular on-campus sessions. The catalog of CSU's entire library  collection is in machine readable format accessible to ITFS students. CSU installed a C-band satellite uplink in 1984 and a Ku-band uplink in 1986. CSU delivers courses leading to a Master's degree in computer science by satellite, with current enrollment of 200 corporate employees in 9 states, and is developing a Bachelor's degree in computer science for satellite delivery. Other CSU satellite telecommunications activities include teacher education courses provided for the TI-IN network through federal Star Schools funding, and both statewide and nationwide teleconferences. Appendices list CSU ITFS programs, the computer science course schedule for 1988-92, and teleconferences produced since 1985. (SV)",

        "description":"Students in about 100 schools in 10 states attend classes 4 days a week, for all or part of the school year. A growing number of rural schools, faced with declining enrollments and diminishing state aid, are experimenting with this schedule. Benefits of the schedule include lower energy and transportation costs and lower absenteeism among students and teachers. Holding classes 7.5 hours a day, 4 days a week, provides the same amount of instructional time as the traditional schedule, but with more time-on-task and less wasted time. Students have had no real problems adjusting to the longer day. Teacher, student, and parent attitudes toward the 4-day week have been generally positive. The 10 New Mexico school districts operating on the 4-day week reported cost savings of 10-25% on  fuel, electricity, and transportation; standardized achievement test scores comparable to state norms; and a collective dropout rate of 3.3% (versus 8.1% statewide). In the 12 Colorado districts on the 4-day schedule, students showed some gains and some losses in academic achievement, with no clear evidence that student achievement was suffering. This report contains 11 references and the third, fifth, and eighth grade scores on the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills for 16 small New Mexico school districts (including 7 on the 4-day schedule) from 1982-83 to 1985-86.

Rural areas include open countryside and places with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants not in the suburbs of large cities. This report presents demographic data on the rural population, pointing out that comparison with 1987 data suggests a leveling off of farm population decline. Almost half of the rural population in 1988 was located in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs); and about one quarter of the farm population lived in MSAs. The farm population is older than other components of the population. About 2.6 percent of the employed labor force worked in farm occupations. Money income for the year 1987 was lower for households and families living on farms than for those  in nonfarm areas. The report examines size, distribution, social, and economic characteristics of the rural population. Tables show U.S. population by urban/rural, farm, and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan residence. They also show occupation, poverty status, regional distribution, labor force participation, and income distribution by farm/nonfarm residence. Detailed tables show race, age, sex, marital status, fertility characteristics, family characteristics, employment status, and income of households and families by farm/nonfarm residence.

Rural scholars were more likely to be female (45.5%) and Caucasian (98%) than other scholars. Involvement in extracurricular activities was significantly higher for rural merit scholars. Among rural scholars, 37% completed the equivalent of 5 years of English and mathematics, but only 26% of scholars finished 3 years of a foreign language, and 12.1 percent reported taking no foreign language. Only 14% of nonrural scholars had an A average, but 64.7% of rural scholars did. Rural scholars reported using computers for word processing and math drill and practice. Only 10% of rural scholars'  schools had satellite (distance-learning) instruction. A total of 58% of all students tested had a family income under $40,000 but 65% of rural scholars' families had an income of $20,000 or less. Results suggest that the culture of rural areas and environment of small schools produces rapport between teachers and students, greater involvement in school affairs, and closeness of families, all of which contribute to students' academic achievement.

Results show that most institutions, including those with large Native American populations do not have a good database on Native American student performance and outcomes. Fewer than half the institutions responded to many questions, indicating that hard data was difficult to obtain. Responses from institutions with data indicate a matriculation rate of 27.3% for Native Americans. More than half of  those leaving before graduation did so in their first year. One third of Native American students attended colleges part-time. The average $2,000 to $3,000 out-of-pocket costs for these schools is beyond the means of most Native American families. All reporting institutions indicated providing remedial or developmental courses, whereas 22 institutions reported that their programs included organized tutoring and Native American counselors, student organizations, and content courses.

        "description":"&quot;Peer mentoring,&quot;&quot;peer coaching,&quot; and &quot;colleagueship supervision&quot; describe a process of professional improvement in which teachers assist other teachers in becoming more competent and innovative in the use of pedagogical skills. Recent evidence suggests that teachers feel the individuals most qualified to assist them in developing and refining instructional strategies and skills are other teachers. Typically, teachers are formally evaluated, however, by a building administrator with no expertise in teachers' subject areas. In rural schools, these problems are particularly acute, for a new teacher may be the only staff member with expertise in a particular discipline. This paper describes the benefits of a peer-mentoring program using master teachers as mentors. Master teachers  are trained in effective teaching practices and peer coaching. These master teachers are available in a multi-district network for in-class observation and consultation in schools that may not have a master teacher available for a new teacher in a particular subject area. Problems identified include: difficulties in school cooperation, costs associated with peer-coach replacement and travel, peer-coach legal responsibilities, teachers' union approval of such projects, and the need for common definitions of &quot;master teacher&quot; and &quot;peer coaches.&quot; (DHP)",

The 1988 survey questions were similar to those asked in a study conducted 3 years earlier when subjects were 10th and 12th graders. Major findings were: (1) the influence of school personnel on student career and curriculum choices was less than that of parents and friends, and declined from 1985 to 1988; (2) mother's educational attainment was related to student plans to attend college and the type of college chosen; (3) overall aspirations and salary expectations increased from 1985 to 1988, while desired occupations more nearly approximated expected occupations; (4) high school seniors were more confident of fulfilling their goals than either sophomores or graduates; (5)  females had career expectations equivalent to males but expected lower salaries; (6) students in the academic curriculum had much higher occupational aspirations than those in the vocational curriculum, but the difference narrowed somewhat after high school graduation; and (7) although vocational students were much less likely than academic students to attend college, nearly half of the vocational students had higher education plans.

Results of this study indicate that urban students had higher educational and occupational aspirations than rural students; however, rural schools seemed to emphasize preparation for college attendance more than urban schools. Most rural students planned on entering urban occupations. A large number of both rural and urban students planned to major in business. A majority of urban students' parents were in business-related occupations, a background variable that may have influenced students' career choices. However, the majority of rural students' parents were in lower-status occupations. Parents of both  groups also had a significant influence of childrens' educational and occupational aspirations. Rural students had realistic expectations about starting salaries and occupational opportunities. Both groups of students seemed confident about their ability to realize their aspirations. Results suggest that parents need to be informed about career opportunities and to be constantly involved in the educational process. This paper contains 18 references. (Author/DHP)",

        "description":"Different areas and regions of the nation have characteristically different rural high school systems due to differences in socioeconomic status of the residents, racial or ethnic membership, and family background. Differences in staffing patterns, enrollment levels, and school budgets are also characteristics that help to differentiate rural and urban high schools. This paper examines these characteristics of rural schools in Ohio and Southwest Georgia, as they pertain to rural students' aspirations and expectations. Twelfth grade students in 19 rural public secondary schools in Ohio and Georgia completed surveys. The population makeup of the schools was very different, with Georgia rural schools having a black enrollment of over 80%, whereas rural schools in Ohio were almost  entirely white. Ohio rural students enjoyed a slightly higher standard of living, but parents in both states had similar levels of educational attainment, though the proportion of parents with college experience was somewhat greater in Ohio than in Georgia. More Ohio students planned to attend four-year colleges and universities, and they expected to enter higher status occupations than the Georgia students. Ohio students indicated they were more confident of entering their chosen occupations. The report concludes that policymakers should review such findings, for national policies may not have equal import in all regions. This paper contains 10 references. (DHP)",

Of all students, 81% passed all three sections of the test, mathematics, reading, and essay. The passing group represented 87% of Anglos, 59% of blacks, and 69% of Hispanics. The TASP is not a timed test; students may take up to 5 hours to complete any one portion. This format might reward students who persist. Students can take each section separately, and some can pay for study guides and preparation classes, concentrating on each section separately. Female Anglo and Hispanic students did better than males, but black males surpassed black females. Failures in reading were quite  small. Females failed mathematics at almost twice the rate they failed writing, whereas males failed writing at about twice the rate they failed mathematics. Failure on the writing section of the test is a sign of particular trouble. Apparently, students cannot perform in college without basic writing skills. This test is seen as a program designed for assessment, advising, placement, remediation, and evaluation as part of a program to develop academic skills. (DHP)",

In fall 1986, a Nebraska survey examined attitudes toward school size and reorganization issues among school board presidents. Respondents were 81 board presidents from K-8 districts and 32 board presidents from K-12 districts that had been reorganized in 1980-85. Both groups felt that local control is an imperative and that the question of reorganization is best resolved with a high level of local involvement. Other respondent opinions differed substantially by type of district (K-8 versus K-12). About 60% of K-12 presidents agreed that tax equity could improve education,  whereas 82% of K-8 presidents disagreed. Whereas 70% of K-8 presidents felt that their district was about the right size, 60% of K-12 presidents said their district might be too small. Presidents of K-8 districts were more concerned than K-12 presidents over the possible effect of school closing on community vitality. K-12 presidents rated breadth of the curriculum as their schools' main strength, whereas K-8 presidents pointed to the individual attention their students receive. Educational opportunities were seen as being enhanced through reorganization by 66% of K-12 presidents, whereas 84% of K-8 presidents disagreed. (SV)",

Alaska Natives are the state's only racial group that is underrepresented in enrollments at the University of Alaska (UA). This report examines the contribution of the Rural Alaska Honors Institute (RAHI) in nurturing Alaskan talent. RAHI recruits promising college-bound rural Alaska Natives who are high school juniors to participate in a 6-week academic enrichment program. These students who enter UA at Fairbanks are required to maintain a minor in Alaska Native studies and engage in a 2-month internship program. These socioeconomically deprived, first generation high school students were not well prepared for rigorous academic study.  During the RAHI summer session, however, they made significant progress in mathematics and reading. Seventy-five percent of the 255 students who were examined went on to enroll in postsecondary courses. Ninety-two percent would unequivocally recommend RAHI to other students. Twelve percent of RAHI alumni for 1984-85 summer session, and 8% from the 1985-86 session completed a bachelor's degree in the minimum amount of time required, whereas none of the Alaska native students not attending RAHI had done so.

Secondary  credit activity was proportionately greater for currently versus formerly migratory students. Twenty-two percent of migrant students moving between districts carried full or partial credit on the MSRTS records. Being overage in grade is a key indicator for identifying students at risk of dropping out. Fifty percent of migrant students grade 7-12 are on grade level, but 32.8% are one year and 17.1% two years or more below grade level.

        "description":"The factors of people, technology, structure, and task provide a sociotechnical model for understanding the essential elements of schools as organizations. Schools can be understood as cultures and managed as such. Effective schools focus on a task-oriented organizational culture that meaningfully involves all participants in the key elements of the decision-making process. The specific elements through which organizational culture is preserved, expressed and conveyed are: (1) its history; (2) its symbolic myths and stories; (3) its espoused values and beliefs; (4) expectations for behavior; (5) rites and rituals which have symbolic value; and (6) heroes and heroines that symbolize the organization. These elements intersect and overlap to describe the organizational culture of a  particular school. Quality education has been associated with factors that reflect small and rural schools, such as strong ties between community and schools, the presence of supportive interpersonal environments, and the development and nurturance of an academic climate that encourages organizational participants to achieve their individual potentials. The following strengths of rural and small schools may be conducive to establishing superior learning environments: (1) a lack of distinction between what belongs in school and what belongs in the community; (2) a kind of generalism which expects people to do whatever they are able without specialized roles or strictly age-graded functions; (3) close and supportive ties between families and the school; (4) a sense of comfort and  cooperative spirit among the students; and (5) rural independence and self-reliance translated into the school setting.

The document also includes a detailed evaluation of the program based on research results. The MTCDP was designed to improve services of seven American Indian community colleges, mainly by strengthening qualifications of the college staff. Another feature was to design and conduct tribal-college institutional research for use by institutional management. The last function was to create a vehicle for technical assistance, inservice training, and other staff development activities for the tribal colleges. The MTCDP developed, provided, and institutionalized a graduate degree program in Adult  and Higher Education at Montana State University, which continues to support the project. Ensuing transportation, curriculum, and inservice training problems were confronted. Research, technical assistance, and inservice activities were offered under the program. By the end of the initial funding period, 10 faculty members in tribal colleges had received their masters degrees and 10 others were working toward their doctorates. Institutional research centered around Indian learning styles, tribal college follow-up, and assessment of student outcomes. The program evaluation suggests that the MTCDP's stated goals had largely been met. The evaluation recommends continuation of the MTCDP. The document concludes that the MTCDP was a timely project for both the tribal colleges, which needed  program assistance, and the university, which had been seeking linkages with the colleges in keeping with philosophy, the spirit of that guides land-grant institutions of higher education. The advisory board survey and the student interview survey are appended. (TES)",

MAJC, a private institution sponsored by the Religious Sisters of Mercy, enrolls 550 full-time and 450 part-time students. The program, supported by the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, involves the establishment of rural off-campus centers that offer continuing education to small, localized student-learner support groups. Work is assigned to groups of three to six students who meet weekly as the &quot;learning teams.&quot; The monitoring itinerant instructor visits these groups and rotates once per week among three groups. The program offers associate degrees to rural students  normally hindered by travel distances, geography, low population density, or cost factors. Under the itinerant teacher program, 126 students completed 239 courses between 1986 and 1988. Most participants were married females, between 31 and 34 years old, enrolled in a business course, pursuing a bachelor's degree, and had not had any previous higher-education experience. The accompanying evaluator's report is not an evaluation, but a description of intended procedures for evaluating the itinerant program. The intended evaluation design uses formative and summative techniques and includes both internal and external foci. Also described are evaluation activities during the project's first year, some evalutive questions regarding the program, and proposals for improving evaluation  techniques. (TES)",

        "description":"Interest in a science fair is low when students feel undirected and lack the information they need to produce a successful project. For many students, parents, and teachers, planning and carrying out a science fair project may be very frustrating. This book is designed to be a reference that helps teachers guide students through this process. The emphasis is on the processes of science and the development of successful thinkers, not necessarily award winners. Strategies, ideas, and techniques to help students appreciate the world of science are provided. The handbook includes planning guides for teachers and students, timetables, suggestions for conducting research, ideas regarding the judging of projects, and a list of 68 resources. (CW)",

        "description":"In the mid to late 1980s, observers of education in Western Australia witnessed considerable educational change. Following an inquiry into education in Western Australia (Beazley, 1984), several major changes were made in secondary school curricula, procedures of assessment, and methods of certification. This paper explores some of the consequences of the curriculum change from compulsory year-long courses to optional short courses in the lower secondary school (grades 8 through 10; ages 13-15 years). In particular, the effects of the structural changes for gender equity in enrollment and achievement in science and mathematics are investigated and implications are drawn for the future subject and career choices of students. Although the data are from Western Australian schools,  the trends observed here suggest a warning that the effects of such a major change elsewhere should be monitored carefully. (CW)",

The curriculum emphasized a hands-on inquiry approach, and included both science process skills and content objectives. This is a report of the Comprehensive Instructional Management System (CIMS)-Science Program during the 1988-89 school year in three school districts. Implementation efforts focused on introducing the program to participating schools and assisting staff in using the curriculum and assessment materials. This involved support form central CIMS, district personnel, and school personnel. Cited as strengths were the CIMS-Science curriculum's hands-on approach, specificity, flexibility, and accessibility to teachers without  strong science backgrounds. Criticism focused on the unavailability of manipulative materials and inadequate coverage or omission of some science topics. Based on the findings, six recommendations are made. (YP)",

Its objective is to provide both remedial tutoring to students lacking mathematics skills and enrichment to students who are potentially gifted in mathematics. Sixty-two high school students were student-tutors to 513 elementary and junior high school LEP students in eight schools in two school districts. A licensed teacher acted as advisor for every five student-tutors. Tutors' attitudes about the program were positive. Project personnel and school staff indicated that tutors had developed a sense of responsibility, commitment, and self-confidence. Based on the findings, two recommendations were  made: (1) develop an evaluation design which ensures that similar instruments and procedures are used throughout the program; and (2) follow students to assess retention of mathematics skills acquired in the program.

These proceedings resulted from a meeting to explore dimensions of number sense and its related fields. The participants came from three groups: mathematics educators actively pursuing research on the topic; cognitive psychologists; and other mathematics educators who have adapted methods and models from psychology. The conference was unusual in that no formal papers were presented; instead, each participant submitted suggestions for preconference reading which was to serve as background for 2 days of discussion. The discussions were focused by the following questions: (1) What is number sense? How do we assess and teach  it? How is it linked to mental computation and computational estimation?; (2) What research questions regarding these issues need to be addressed? What are the theoretical foundations for this research?; and (3) What do you want to see accomplished at the conference? Part I of the proceedings consists mainly of transcripts of the responses to three questions. After the conference had concluded, each participant was asked to write a short paper to include reflections on the themes of the conference. These papers are contained in Part II of the proceedings.

The manner and extent to which the teachers became engaged in the effort to reform mathematics instruction for intermediate level urban students is illustrated. The teachers had established a collaborative organization concerned with planning for problem-solving in mathematics. They met on a regular basis during the first year, cooperatively solved problems, and conducted pilot studies of the efforts of problem-solving on their students. Despite these effects curriculum reform and teacher empowerment remained catch phrases only. In its first year of operation, the  project's tacit function was to offer the teachers relief from the institution. Because of institutional conditions, the teachers' limited concept of curriculum theory, and the tendency for teachers to focus on mechanical or less-than-significant concerns, business-as-usual continued to dominate the educational program.

Students in the experimental group participated in 12 weeks (60 sessions), 50 minutes per day, of Individualized Manpower Training System (IMTS) instruction plus a 10-minute daily period of computer assisted instruction (CAI) in mathematics. The only difference between the experimental and control groups was that the experimental group received 10 minutes of CAI in mathematics daily and the control group received 10 minutes of IMTS  instruction in mathematics daily. Analysis of covariance indicated no significant difference on any dependent variable for type of instruction and the interaction between sex and type of instruction. The IMTS program with or without CAI had a more significant impact, by t-test, on males' academic self-concept and locus of control. (Author)",

The mean time viewing an exhibit was 62.8 seconds but varied considerably among exhibits. Data were also analyzed by time of day, ethnicity, group size, species observed, and activity level of the animals. Visitor behavior patterns were also analyzed based on label length and difficulty, and popularity of the species. Taken together, the  data provide a general understanding of how recreational visitors behave in zoos with respect to several variables of interest to zoo professionals. (Author/CW)",

In addition, the study analyzed whether there was further development or changes of these skills and concerns throughout the duration of student teaching. The initial sample used was 17 preservice secondary science teachers enrolled in a microteaching course. A stratified random sample of six of these student teachers was followed into the immediate subsequent student teaching experience. Four rounds of qualitative analyses were used to assess the congruence among the concerns, perceptions, and decision-making skills identified upon the completion of the microteaching course and those first expressed upon first  immersion into student teaching; and development and changes of the aforementioned perceptions, skills, and concerns during student teaching. Those concerns and perceptions evidenced during microteaching persisted during student teaching, along with a few additional concerns. Additionally, the perception of planning changed as the students began their practice teaching. Although the subjects completed the microteaching experience primarily with concerns for self, they exhibited an immediate dominance of concerns for students upon entering student teaching. (CW)",

This paper considers the effects of mathematical affect and the use of intervention programs to increase the retention of women and minorities in higher-level mathematics courses. Mathematical affect plays a role in the development of long-term mathematical persistence behaviors, such as course-enrollment decisions. The most critical period in which to use interventions to influence mathematical affect is the middle/junior high school age level. More students will be able to develop the short-term persistence behaviors necessary to  experience success within the mathematical environment when attention to affect begins to be included as a regular part of the mathematics curriculum. Once students possess short-term persistence behaviors, it will be easier to motivate them to continue to enroll in mathematics courses. (YP)",

With the highest life expectancy on earth, the Japanese potentially face long periods of retirement, as well as the possibility of long periods of disability. Although family support of the elderly is thought to have been strong traditionally, the recent decline in co-residence with children is one indication that the way that support is given may be changing. This issue is of particular concern to the government, which wants to avoid any greater responsibility for the elderly than is necessary given the dramatic population aging yet to come. The government is also encouraging employers to provide more employment opportunities for the  elderly at the same time that it is trying to raise the eligibility age for receipt of public pensions. There is resistance on the part of employers, however, because wages and retirement allowances in Japan are positively related to length of employment. Furthermore, it is not clear whether elderly Japanese of the future will be as willing to work, if they learn to enjoy increased leisure early in their careers. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that population aging will lead to Japan's economic decline. Although the saving rate may decline somewhat, restructuring the economy and continued overseas investment should keep the economy growing in the long run. Important in both the care of the frail elderly and the continued growth of the economy will be the roles played by middle-aged Japanese  women. The document provides background information useful to teachers preparing lessons in social studies. (Author/JB)",

David Rothman, in \"Lessons from an Opium Eater,\" examines how the nineteenth-century confessions of a famous English opium addict, Thomas De Quincey, has relevance to the present, how it might be used to help find solutions to the current problem of drug abuse. Ann Henderson offers a commentary on the issue of drug abuse and public policy. Joan Scott, in \"The History of Families,\" argues that, far from being fixed and immutable, the family is a varied, changing, adaptable institution. Whether women work to support their families or to find meaningful, productive activity, or both, their wage-earning activity does not in  itself disrupt family stability or impoverish their children emotionally. Rather, the attempt to impose idealized models of the family on diverse and changing families undercuts their ability to adapt to changing economic and social circumstances and so to survive. Margaret Kingsland adds a commentary that focuses on the issue of day care. Donald Worster in \"Devastating Nature\" examines some of the threats to the environment and relates them to the changing values and ideals of modern society. If society wants to stop the devastation of the earth, it must be willing to change itself. David Tebaldi's commentary illustrates the distinction between the anthropocentric and the biocentric view of nature and the environment.

The concentration of scientific and technological capabilities in a few countries exacerbates these new problems. The United Nations tried to address this disparity through a program on science and technology for development adopted in Vienna in 1979. That program has faltered. Participants at the Nations Issues Conference asked why, discussed the appropriate role for the United Nations, and identified new challenges. It was agreed that science, technology, and production interact in ways that often are unpredictable. Development was discussed as a society's ability to meet the needs of its people. The term endogenous capacity is used to describe a nation's ability to make  informed choices and decisions about how to apply science and technology to economic and social development. Many felt the Vienna Programme of Action had failed because it was political in nature, it did not have sufficient input from the scientific and technological community, and it was unable to build its own constituency among member-nation governments, and therefore it lacked sufficient funds. Conference participants agreed there is no need for a grand scheme for promoting development. The role for the United Nations should be restricted to those areas where a universal, multilateral governmental agency is needed. There is also a role for multilateral organizations to facilitate coordination among efforts to apply science and technology to development. (JB)",

EFTA was established in 1959 to foster free trade in industrial goods and to increase trade in agricultural and other products. In addition to the current six member nations (Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland), the association at one time also included the United Kingdom, Portugal, and Denmark. When the United Kingdom left EFTA for membership in the European Community (EC), EFTA lost its largest partner and any real power in negotiating with its rival, the EC. Despite this, the EFTA nations have maintained favorable trade relations with the EC. However, in  1992, the EC will take a major step toward final political and economic integration, possibly freezing out the EFTA. This paper examines the export economy of Iceland to see what impact further EC integration may have on that economy. The document includes a 19-item bibliography. (Author/JB)",

The second graders, finding few biographies written for students reading on a first or second grade level, interviewed community members, collected photographs of them, and wrote their biographies, which were placed in the school library. The third graders, studying political elections, became concerned about the lack of an acceptable description for the terms leader and leadership. They conducted a survey of recognized leaders in the community and state, identified common characteristics of these terms as described by the respondents, and recorded their conclusions for the benefit of themselves and other students in the school.  The steps in the creative problem solving strategy are: (1) identifying a problem, (2) gathering information concerning the problem, (3) finding components of the problem, (4) brainstorming possible solutions to the selected problem, (5) finding solutions, and (6) justifying a solution and developing a course of action. This step by step process is slow at the onset, but students find the process exciting and challenging.

The educational system includes the public schools, vocational training, continuing education, and the universities and aims to prepare people for responsible citizenship. West Germany's reform and modernization have been important and education is vital to these processes. From 1950 to mid-1960 was a period of non-reform and this was reflected in the country's education policy. The late-1960s to the mid-1970s began a reform era in which there were changes in curricula, the public schools, and higher education. The reform movement then subsided due to financial and social problems. The Minister of Education and Science holds  major responsibility for the funding and values in West Germany's educational institutions. For some time West German economic growth and modernization have been dependent on skilled manpower with a knowledge of new technologies. Education is viewed as an investment toward this end and present education policies link education to industry and prosperity and promote vocational training and scientific and technological education. Meanwhile, the structures that cause and increase social inequality persist. Currently major societal changes are taking place and it is important that all members of society have influence on social development, but current policy makers seem not to be open to dialogue. Education continues to reflect society's segmentation. (AS)",

In seeking to answer these questions, the Greeks were among the first to explore many of humanity's problems and their legacy had an impact on democracy and the disciplines of history and philosophy. The Romans were heavily influenced by the Greeks but passed on their own contributions to law, government, language, and literature. The English also made significant contributions to these same areas. The most notable French contributions include the writings of Montaigne, Pascal, Moliere, Rousseau, Sartre, and Camus. German influence is seen in music, with  great composers such as Bach and Beethoven offering outstanding contributions. Christian orthodoxy also has been a significant force in European culture. Contributions of Thomas Aquinas and Martin Luther show major impacts on the development of religion in Europe.

Members wished US WILPF to serve as an avenue for expanding women's political power and for reaching the goals of nonviolent change and economic and social justice at all levels of national and international life. It was the first modern women's peace organization to emerge after World War I. With its national headquarters in Washington, D.C., it functioned as a public interest group with Dorothy Detzer as chief lobbyist, while local branch members applied pressure on legislators and officials and attempted to educate communities on peace issues. Mildred Scott Olmstead,  the national organization secretary, worked to expand and strengthen the group at the grassroots level in order to increase US WILPF's political clout. This two-pronged approach to peace education--lobbying at the highest policy-making levels and education at the grassroots level--provided women with the opportunity to gain political power to realize their reformist goals. These women chose not to enter partisan politics or the electoral arena. Instead, they opted for empowerment through educational, lobbying, and organizing activities. Women's full political participation would await a future generation of women who had developed both a feminist peace consciousness and a plan for entering electoral politics. (JB)",

Although different in their tactics and in their educational programs, these women, who founded schools in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were united in their belief that black women had to assume the initiative in educating themselves and their people. Knowing the harsh realities that blacks, especially women, faced, McLeod and Burroughs focused on the attainment of skills that would provide alternatives to unemployment while teaching leadership and pride. The stereotype of black women as an unfit lot, moved the founders to action in stressing deportment above all else. But as the founders matured in  their vision, they began to make important connections between the self-sufficiency of their schools and the self-sufficiency of their communities. Broadening their appeal among blacks by offering more diverse and relevant courses, they increased their black support and became, over time, less dependent on the whims of white philanthropy. (JB)",

        "description":"Five farms in Union County in extreme southern Illinois were studied in depth, and about 100 more were briefly surveyed to ascertain how the farm women's roles have changed over the years. Well into the twentieth century, the male and female domains on these farms were relatively well defined. Within the barn and its yards, the husband had primary authority over the organization of space and work; within the house and its yards, the wife had primary authority. The husband's domain was primarily oriented to commodity production and the pursuit of profits, with production for use subordinated to production for the market. Conversely, the wife's domain was primarily oriented to the production for use values and the reproduction of the family which constituted the immediate work  force, with commodity production subordinated to consumption needs. Changes in technology, production techniques, and the economy have gradually transformed the organization of farmsteads. The modern farm, organized increasingly along industrial lines, has replaced women's prior productive functions with equipment and cash. Like nonfarm women, farmer's wives, too, have left their place within the operation of the farm for wage labor outside the home and farm. Unless a woman assumes new roles on the farm, leaving her separate domain to become a bookkeeper, marketing expert, or farm hand, her life in the 1980s is little different from her nonfarming rural and small-town counterpart. A 56-item bibliography is included and 5 figures, including floor plans of the forms discussed, are appended.  (JB)",

        "description":"The goals of language policies in Marxist-Leninist states tend to be applied in three stages: (1) pluralism, (2) bilingualism, and (3) monolingualism. The language policies in Bulgaria, particularly as applied to the Turkish minority, fit this pattern. A pluralistic language and education tradition in Bulgaria, inherited from the Ottoman Empire, lasted until World War II. Turks and other national minorities were given rights to control their own schools and use their own language. Turkish schools in Bulgaria were important in maintaining language, religion and ethnic identity among Turks. Political changes in the 1920s and 1930s caused many of these schools to be closed, so that by the end of World War II their number had been reduced by 75 percent. After Communist Party  consolidation of power in post-war Bulgaria, schools were nationalized, and the government worked for the assimilation of all minority groups into mainstream Bulgarian culture. From 1946 to about 1960, policies encouraged bilingualism among the Turkish minority. From 1960 to about 1970, the Bulgarian government consolidated Turkish schools with Bulgarian schools and eliminated Turkish language instruction. Turkish language publications of all types were gradually eliminated from libraries, bookstores, and homes. The transition to bilingualism and eventually monolingualism was aimed at facilitating assimilation; however, the Turkish minority have continued their social and cultural activities in Turkish. Since these people live in ethnically homogeneous communities that are physically  isolated from Bulgarians, Turkish language will most likely continue to strengthen the Turkish minority. (AS)",

        "description":"With heavy immigration fueled by U.S. immigration law changes in 1965 and the influx of over 700,000 Indochinese refugees since the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the number of Asian Americans grew from 1.4 million in 1970 to 3.5 million, 1.5 percent of the U.S. population, by the April 1980 census and an estimated 5.1 million, 2.1 percent of the U.S. total, as of September 30, 1985. Barring major changes in U.S. immigration policy, they could number almost 10 million in 2000. The major Asian American groups are Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Vietnamese, Koreans, and Asian Indians. In 1980, 49 percent of Asian Americans lived in California or Hawaii and 9 percent in New York; and 92 percent lived in metropolitan areas, compared to 75 percent of the general population. Except for the  latest-arrived Vietnamese, the fertility rate of the six major groups is lower than the average white rate, labor force participation is generally higher and unemployment lower. In 1980, 35 percent of adults were college graduates, compared to 17 percent of white adults, and among the foreign-born, all but Koreans and Vietnamese exceeded the white population in achieving the highest status occupational category. Per-worker median incomes in 1979 were higher than the white median only for Japanese, Chinese, and Asian Indians, but family median incomes were as high or higher than the white median for all but Vietnamese, because Asian American households, especially among recent immigrants, contain more workers than white households. Asian Americans are not homogeneous and some groups still  lag behind, but with their strong family support and dedication to education and work, Asian Americans are likely to assimilate like other immigrant groups before them.

In the formative stages of the project, students in the Program for the Talented and Gifted at John Rolfe Middle School participated in the development of the project; it is intended, however, that participation will expand to interested students and faculty throughtout the school. In 1986 the project received a two-year Excellence in Education grant (1) to acquire and organize the collection, (2) to develop teacher and student knowledge of community  resources and assist in the use of those resources, (3) to design innovative curriculum that encourages inquiry learning and an interdisciplinary approach, (4) to provide new scholarly opportunities for students at all ability levels, and (5) to generate community support and interprofessional cooperation and involvement in the research, development, instruction, and programs. This final report contains the in-depth first year report, an accounting of the second-year growth and activities, and numerous appendices containing supportive materials related to year 2 of the grant period. These appendices, which make up the bulk of the document, include correspondence related to the project, a tentative plan for funding the center through the private sector, dissemination materials, samples of  developed activities, samples of student work that are based on artifacts and a catalogue of the Rolfe Museum and Research Center Collection for Year 1.

It expands the range of subject matter by considering women candidates' presence, primary campaign experiences, and fundraising. The data show that few women have run for office in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in the 1980s, but those who have run have done so strategically and with a comparable rate of  success with male candidates. A gender gap does exist in campaign contributions to male candidates' advantage, but this has not kept women candidates from achieving equality at the ballot box. (Author)",

A teaching unit, as well as lectures and various publications on curanderismo have been developed, based on research and interviews with practitioners. The practice of curanderismo involves rituals and, often, the use of herbs to heal patients. Curanderismo functions on three often interrelated levels: the material, spiritual, and mental; and the curandero or curandera (healer) may specialize in a particular type of remedy. Belief in curanderismo is both a religious belief and a belief in the supernatural. Healing abilities are often seen as endowed by God, or the result of a long apprenticeship. Curanderos base their  livelihood on their healing abilities, and are usually employed for more serious cases. At present, health care professionals are urged to recognize curanderismo as an alternative or supplement to formal medicine. (AS)",

The first approach views arts instruction as direct student involvement in the expressive modes of the arts. The second approach views the arts as a means of acquiring cultural literacy. The framework is constructed on these two complementary approaches, which are expressed in four components of arts education: aesthetic perception; creative expression; arts heritage; and aesthetic valuing. The framework is organized to assist curriculum planners design an arts curriculum that has a triple thrust that: (1) develops the unique characteristics of each of the arts; (2) interrelates the arts; and (3) infuses the arts into  the general curriculum. Chapter 1 addresses the commonalities among the arts; chapters 2 through 5 present the unique aspects of each discipline. The individual discipline sections follow similar formats to assist teachers and curriculum developers build a balanced curriculum that includes all four areas of the arts. Chapter 6 provides a guide for interrelating the arts and for integrating the arts into the total learning process. The concluding chapter articulates what is needed to develop an adequate program for the arts. (JB)",

        "author":["Childers, Kevin"],
        "description":"A 2-day conference on teaching moral values in American schools resulted in a report called \"Moral Education and Character\" which highlights the views of participants from a variety of fields. This brief paper is a synopsis of the issues and arguments presented in that report. Moral education concerns learning about good conduct. It is about the development of character, the stable qualities of a person that are revealed in his or her actions. Parents are the first moral educators of a child. Teachers also play a major role in moral education once a child begins school. Certain qualities of character and action, such as honesty, are universally accepted. Such features of morality are so taken for granted that people tend to focus on the controversial aspects, such as the role  religion should or should not play in moral education and overlook what everyone accepts. The Supreme Court has made a constitutional distinction between teaching religion and teaching about religion. The latter is constitutional, but in practice, it may be difficult to do one and not the other. Moral education can be introduced into the school curriculum in a number of ways: (1) through a distinct course or classroom activity, (2) as a part of a literature course, or (3) in cooperative learning activities, to name a few. There are many questions in this area that might be addressed by future research. For example: (1) What values do all hold in common, and what differences exist among moral viewpoints? (2) What types of moral education, if any, are individual teachers practicing in  schools today? (3) What are the effects of religious heritage on moral education? and (4) Is there a role for the federal government in this area at all? (JB)",

Some of the highlights of the report follow. (1) Overall voter turnout dropped to 57 percent in 1988, the first decline reported in CPS in a presidential election since 1972. (2) All age groups, except the oldest, showed declines in turnout in 1988. (3) Black turnout fell to 52 percent, down about 4 percentage points from 1984; white turnout dropped by about 2 percentage points to 59 percent in 1988; and Hispanic turnout dropped from 33 percent in 1984 to 29 percent in 1988. (4) Turnout for women exceeded that for men in 1988. (5) All regions of the country showed a decline between 2 and 3 percentage points  from their 1984 levels. (6) Registration rates declined correspondingly with voting rates, except for persons 65 years and over, whose registration increased slightly. (7) Of the 118.6 million persons who reported being registered in 1988, 11.7 million reported that they had registered specifically for the 1988 election. (8) Among those who said they had registered specifically for the 1988 election, first-time registrants were a little less likely to report having voted than other 1988 registrants. (JB)",

(Audiocuing is the pre-recorded auditory cue provided by a microcassette recording which only the subject can hear.) In the event that it is necessary for the student teacher to make behavioral changes in the amount of positive feedback statements provided to the student, auditory cuing would prompt the intern into making a positive statement. Eventually, this prompt would be removed, but the habit of providing consistent feedback responses would remain. This research was designed to substantiate evidence that audio prompting would induce more specific verbal feedback, which in turn would increase academic learning time  (ALT). The subject for the study was a student teacher assigned to a high school physical education class. Results indicate that audiocuing did have an effect on variable feedback, but produced a statistically insignificant increase in the amounts of engaged motor and ALT. (JD)",

A review of the objectives, scope, and methodology of the CPS is presented, and difficulties in meeting staffing targets are discussed. It is noted that the growing need for staff with highly specalized skills, compounded by various funding problems, have resulted in staffing  shortages that have hindered key technical assistance and monitoring activities in the CPS.

This analysis of the literature was designed to assess the comparative contribution of a set of selected variables to gains in teaching skill. The variables were classified under three general categories: training variables, trainee variables, and setting variables. Of central interest in the review was the conceptual-observational instruction method of training. This instruction is based upon well-defined concepts that include the components of concept definition, exemplification, identification, and application. The favored medium was videotape  or film. In over half of the studies reviewed, practice was provided in actually using the targeted skills of teaching. Feedback to the trainee on the use of the targeted skills was provided in almost all of the studies. The role of conceptual learning in the development of teaching skills is analyzed, and it is pointed out that training must result in understanding as a prerequisite to change in skill. It is also suggested that consistency of practice conditions is conducive to optimal skill acquisition. (JD)",

The report answers the following questions: (1) Will the teaching force increase in number in the closing years of the 1990s? (2) Has the teaching force aged significantly in recent years? (3) How will the teaching force change agewise by the turn of the century? (4) What differences are there in the changes that will be unique to Chicago and to downstate? (5) Will there be shortages of teachers or administrators in the foreseeable future? and (6) What are the positive and  negative aspects of the changes expected to occur among teachers and administrators by the year 2000?

Nine full days of observations were completed with each of the teachers for 2 consecutive school years. Results are presented in terms of kindergarten teachers' time allocated to reading and to all instruction as well as their frequency of instructional interactions during reading instruction and while reading stories to their classes. AM to PM results are compared for teachers teaching half-day classes. In addition, year to year comparisons are presented for teachers of half-day and full-day kindergarten instructional interactions. Correlations for kindergarten and first grade teachers for AM/PM and year to year frequencies of decoding interactions were all above .88 and significant  above .00l level. Discussion focuses upon the greater likelihood of stability for half-day kindergarten teachers than for first grade teachers, the difference between these results and findings by other researchers suggesting that teachers' behaviors lack stability, and possible explanations for why some teachers may be somewhat less stable than their peers. Data from the study are presented on charts and tables. (Author/JD)",

Two questions are posed: (1) Can a modified OT technique be used to measure teachers' knowledge structures? and (2) Is there a relationship between teachers' knowledge structure scores and their ability to be adaptive during instruction? Using 8 experts, 16 novices, and 4 uninstructed learners, 3 studies were conducted. Results indicate that the modified OT technique describes longitudinal changes in novice teachers' knowledge structures during reading methods course instruction, and that novices' knowledge structures are associated with  adaptive instructional actions. Implications for teaching and teacher education are suggested. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper identifies areas within the teaching-learning process that need to be addressed by alternative teacher certification programs. One of the major strengths of alternative teacher certification programs rests in the subject matter knowledge of their participants. Beyond this, however, there is a growing knowledge base that includes contributions from research on specific teaching and learning skills and behaviors, research on child development and cognition, and recent research on teacher thinking and sense of efficacy. Effective teacher preparation programs incorporate this knowledge base with the assumed subject expertise of the candidate for alternative certification. As part of this discussion, a theory is presented that defines the role of \"reflection\" as a means to  an end, rather than as an end in itself. The teacher developing classroom expertise uses reflection in the form of analysis and synthesis of subject matter, pedagogical knowledge, and classroom events in order to establish successful routines, which become part of the knowledge base. Potential weaknesses of alternative teacher education programs are time limitations and a possible lack of emphasis on pedagogical knowledge and the development of reflective processes. (JD)",

        "description":"The case under study was a staff development program devoted to methods for instructional grouping called \"cooperative learning.\" In this case study, the rhetoric of cooperative learning for mainstreaming was tested by examining the words and actions of teachers and administrators for congruence with rhetorical devices. Three kinds of information were investigated: (1) responses to a survey of over 50 teachers and administrators who participated in programs promoting cooperative learning methods for mainstreaming; (2) textual artifacts of those programs for inservice teacher education; and (3) group interviews with participants. Both documentary and interview data were analyzed in reference to three rhetorical devices: topics of argument, types of commonplace, and types of  figures of speech. These analyses portray specific discursive strategies chosen by teacher educators in reference to informants' accounts of the rhetorical success of these strategies in creating and maintaining support among teachers and students for mainstreaming and cooperative learning. The paper endeavors to show, through rhetorical analysis, the degree to which this program of educational reform succeeded in its goal of changing teachers' beliefs and practices. (JD)",

In response to this challenge, Radford University developed a totally restructured undergraduate teacher education program which was subsequently approved by the State Board of Education. This paper presents a summary of the more salient features of the Radford University Plan to Restructure Teacher Education. The summary is organized to address three major areas: collaboration, innovation, and evaluation. The first of these is the collaboration by an interdisciplinary task force composed of faculty from throughout  the University and public school personnel which reviewed and developed new courses. The second area, that of innovation in the four-year degree program, provides for extensive general education which includes generic pedagogical studies appropriate to all preservice teachers regardless of level or subject matter specialty. Clinical experiences are emphasized for elementary, middle, and special education teachers. An outline is presented of the Comprehensive Teacher Education Assessment and Management plan, which was established to evaluate the program. Resources for program planning research are listed.

Districts that adopt the district autonomy/compromise model have sufficient resources and commitment to design their own independent curriculum guidelines focusing on local needs and priorities. In contrast, districts that use the compliance/augmentation model generally implement state-level policies yet sometimes go  beyond these recommendations with district-devised initiatives. (Author)",

The &quot;writing to learn&quot; literature draws heavily on research in the fields of learning theory and cognitive processing to support the conception of writing as a teaching strategy. A conceptual framework designed to explicate how writing can be utilized effectively across the teacher education curriculum has been developed. Disciplines as diverse as philosophy and anthropology, information about what students in teacher education perceive as problems with their current education, and research on the writing/thinking connection have contributed  to the development of the framework. This document discusses this development, including a description of the conceptualization of the teaching act on which it is based, presents some specific and detailed writing activities useful in a variety of education courses, and discusses the implications for future research of the conceptual framework prsented.

Until recently, practice, feedback, and coaching functions were reserved for student teaching experiences or delayed until induction and inservice development experiences. Of these functions, only coaching still remains for preservice teacher educators' adoption. This paper describes the strategies used in a general secondary methods course to build a collegial learning environment among preservice teachers, an environment that prepares them for a coaching model to be used in later staff development and assists in their learning of alternative instructional strategies. Discussion focuses  on the strategies used by course instructors to coach students as peer demonstrators and coaches in a variety of teaching models. Perspectives of both instructors and students concerning the advantages and disadvantages of peer modeling and coaching are reported. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications and limitations of the coaching model. (Author/JD)",

The following cognitive strategies deal with eliminating unwanted drug use: (1) show concern; (2) articulate ethical issues; (3) set behavior limits; (4) provide educational opportunities; (5) make private counseling available; (6) be a counseling coach; (7) build the athlete's self-esteem; (8) be aware of the athlete's mental status; and (9) promote team roles and the athlete's perception of meaningfulness as a participant. Behavioral techniques for preventing drug abuse involve setting up situations which foster certain desirable responses from the athletes and/or using verbal or nonverbal  techniques to reinforce favorable behaviors or performance outcomes.

This report documents the transformation that has taken place in Connecticut as a result of the CONNCEPT program, and it identifies critical needs and policy implications. The report includes data on the overall performance of CONNCEPT examinees over the four years of the program; performance on individual subtests over the same period; and performance by certain key indicators, e.g., reported SAT scores,  ethnic status, age, gender, and institutional affiliation of examinees. The report confirms the effectiveness of CONNCEPT in significantly increasing the level of skills of individuals seeking Connecticut certification without jeopardizing teacher supply. Low minority representation indicates that much needs to be done in the areas of preparation, remediation, and recruitment. Data is displayed in 29 tables. (JD)",

Typical prerequisites to admission include academic program, test scores, course work, or assessment of professional performance. Criteria for retention after admission often consist of academic performance or mastery of competencies. This paper addresses criteria that are most commonly recognized as subjective, nonacademic expectations. A survey of 58 American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education member institutions was piloted to determine the reasons an institution would counsel a student to drop out of the education program. The survey identified 19 nonacademic items representing personal, behavioral, physical, and legal issues or situations  reported to be related to \"counseling out.\" Schools reported whether or not an item was assessed in their program as well as whether it was considered before or after admission. Among the top five rankings were physical exceptionalities and grooming. Behavioral and legal conditions ranked in the middle among the schools. Personal circumstances constituted the final items in all schools. Appendices include the survey instrument and tables displaying some of the data. (JD)",

The focus of this article is on speeded reading comprehension tests used for entry or re-entry placement in postsecondary institutions. Speeded tests were prompted by the accelerating popularity of timed tests initially used for mass assessment of World War I recruits and conscripts. Early research reviews dealt almost entirely with studies based on comprehensive student populations. Later investigations began to direct attention toward underprepared populations. Almost inevitably, students who score low on the reading test portion of an entry assessment are candidates for intervention. Issues covered include speed set  and anxiety, test wiseness and accuracy, and backwash. Speed set is a rate-of-work mind set purposefully executed to complete a task during the allotted time instead of the time the task demands. Backwash refers to the effect that a test of particular skill has on the acquisition of that skill. The preponderance of research indicates that the tests in question are inappropriate for comprehensive populations as well as developmental students. There are a number of acceptable alternatives to speeded comprehension tests. A 52-item list of references is included. (TJH)",

The affect/effect theory states that a change in the level of expectations held by a teacher for the intellectual performance of a student is translated into a change in the affect shown by the teacher toward that student and the degree of effort shown by that teacher in teaching that student. The affect/effect theory is consistent with much experience and research. The following aspects of the theory are considered: (1) dynamic features; (2) communication channels; (3) molar versus molecular variables; (4) redundancy versus specificity; (5) channel  discrepancy; (6) interactional synchrony; and (7) direct intervention.

Emphasis is on the triangulation procedure used to evaluate the validity of the outcome measure selected--the College Outcomes Measures Project (COMP) Test of the American College Testing Program (1984). The University had implemented a common core curriculum in 1985 that included a set of goals for the general education program. The evaluation method required the faculty to determine the relationships between the core goals and the knowledge measured by the COMP Test, between the goals and core courses, and between the knowledge measured by the COMP Test and core courses. The triangulation of these three components provided insight into the  validity of the COMP for evaluation. As longitudinal data on student progress toward the goals accumulate and relatively weak areas are established, the developed matrix can be used to identify how courses address goals. Validity is demonstrated when the test, goals, and core courses overlap; a lack of overlap of any two components will suggest problems. The process has proved non-threatening to faculty and has stimulated discussion about ways of assessing outcomes. One figure is included. Four appendices provide the goals, the evaluation model, a table of relationships between core goals and the curriculum, and a sample curriculum validation worksheet, respectively. (SLD)",

Preparing teachers had more positive attitudes toward evaluation and mathematics than toward tests. No correlations were found between their attitudes toward evaluation, which were positive, and their attitudes toward tests (generally negative) and mathematics (slightly positive), but there were moderately significant correlations between their attitudes  toward tests and mathematics. High-aptitude preparing teachers had significantly more positive attitudes toward mathematics and tests than did low-aptitude preparing teachers. The locus of the observed differences was primarily on affective dimensions of these attitudes. Implications are discussed in terms of theory, education, and instructional practice, and in terms of a study of the approach of instructors by attitude. Ten tables present data from the studies.

The sample consisted of 250 of the 738 teachers in West Virginia who were completing their first year of teaching in 1987. The study used three tools: (1) a general demographic questionnaire; (2) the School Climate Survey developed by the National Association of Secondary Principals; and (3) the Stern Activities Index (G. Stern, 1970), an assessment of personality needs. Among findings were that: (1) the beginning teacher was most likely to be female (78.5%), married (54.4%), without children (65.8%), teaching in an elementary school, and not a union member; (2)  just over half planned to make teaching a life-long career; and (3) the beginning teacher scored significantly higher than normal on a number of personality characteristics relating to achievement and personal relations. It was further found that while West Virginia seemed to have attracted teachers with needs and behavioral tendencies that seemed positive for education and children, the school climate as perceived by the sample was below national norms on all factors of the School Climate Survey. Implications are presented for the areas of staffing, induction programs, and the practices of building principals in dealing with or providing support for beginning teachers.

The sample included 78 freshmen (22 males and 46 females) enrolled in a self-development and career exploration course at Murray State University (Kentucky) during the fall quarter of 1981. Of these, 39 were enrolled in the university's program of Special Services for Disadvantaged Students (SSDS). Each was administered the Student Development Task Inventory  of R. B. Winston and others (1979), an instrument designed to measure individual growth and development of college students. The effects of the course were evaluated through pretest and posttest scores. No significant differences were found in the developmental levels of students from disadvantaged backgrounds and regularly admitted students, and no differences were found in the pretest and posttest scores of the two groups. Posttest scores improved for both groups, an indication of the possible advantages of the course. The guidance course may have assisted the SSDS students in career development and lifestyle planning. Three tables present study data. (SLD)",

        "description":"The search for solutions to the perceived failures of American education of recent years indicates that the public senses there is something wrong with the educational system. Educators must examine testing in light of the fact that schools are getting poor results in terms of student achievement and, perhaps, change their view of what tests should accomplish. Theoretically, test scores should lead to change in schools. The following questions should be addressed by educators: whether group or cooperative learning is preferable to individualized learning, what the relative values of questions with one right answer and questions requiring judgment are, and how far schools should go beyond the manipulation of numbers. Examples drawn from the Holweide School in Cologne (West  Germany) and the Boy Scouts of America illustrate education that engages the student. The importance of basing practice on the understanding that different people learn in different ways and at different rates, reestablishing the connection between school and work, and making the educational program and the assessment program relevant to the world of work are discussed.

The goal of SEDL's Programmatic Theme on Facilitating Student Achievement is to contribute to the improvement of programs and activities in the Southwestern Region for teaching reading, writing, and thinking skills by providing research and development-based information, training, and technical assistance concerning such efforts. Key objectives are to: (1) identify--via research and practice--strategies, approaches, and programs to enhance student achievement; (2) establish collaborations to build effective practice; (3) provide information, training, and technical assistance to help empower SEDL's collaborators to improve student  achievement; and (4) disseminate information on knowledge and tools for improving student achievement. Among the key activities of the initiative will be three regional meetings to give training and assistance to SEDL collaborators. It is expected that a core of trained collaborators will be formed, to result in a more informed group of parent, educator, and community collaborators in the effort to improve student achievement. A series of papers on the issues of student achievement and a final report on the SEDL effort are planned. (SLD)",

A new look at student achievement is necessary because the information age is making new demands. There has been a shift in education away from a focus on the products of education toward a focus on the processes that support the understanding and usefulness of the content. The trend in process-based education is to increase the range of experiences incorporated in an instructional sequence. New approaches to diversifying the educational environment include the use of partnerships with parents and businesses and the use of technology. New process-oriented assessment and  performance indicators also form part of the school reform movement. The socio-economic context in which the education system functions is another factor influencing the definition of student achievement. It is helpful to define student achievement in terms of an integrated framework of factors to evaluate the significance of the effects educational reform efforts have. An example of a successful school improvement project is Parents as Partners in Reading, a parent involvement program in Louisiana. Such a program addresses tomorrow's problems today. (SLD)",

A mythology about standardized testing has developed, in part because the metaphoric languages of medicine and business have been applied to education, defining it in terms of cure, efficiency, and productivity. Test bias, political implications, and contemporary learning theory can transform standardized test use into test abuse. Growing awareness of the dangers of exclusive dependence on standardized testing has resulted in many changes, including: (1) use of tests for screening and diagnosis; (2) innovative statewide assessment programs; (3) use of means of assessment that are authentic measures of what students need to gain; (4)  use of large-scale tests in innovative ways; (5) goal planning as the emphasis for raising achievement; (6) new technology for testing; (7) increased awareness of fair testing practices; (8) development of the National Commission on Testing and Public Policy; (9) use of expectancy scores; (10) use of sophisticated sampling techniques; and (11) use of standardized tests as only one source of information. Standardized testing must come to be regarded, not as a cure for educational ills, but as a useful tool with much potential for misuse. (SLD)",

The program involves a two-step process by which currently undocumented aliens are granted temporary and, then, permanent citizenship status. This paper describes a means of providing formal evaluation of the educational program--associated with the amnesty effort conducted by the Dallas (Texas) Independent School District (DISD)--designed to inform potential amnesty applicants of their rights and responsibilities. The DISD was involved in planning the provision of English language and civics classes to approximately 60,000 amnesty applicants  believed to reside in Dallas/Rockwall County. During the first year of amnesty classes, the DISD enrolled about 15,000 amnesty applicants in classes at over 100 sites in the 2-county area. The evaluation effort included interviews with program directors, administrator and teacher surveys, student interviews, and classroom observation in 17 classrooms. Results provide information on the accessibility and availability of programming, staff development, site personnel cooperation, teacher preparedness, teaching methods, and student evaluation of program effectiveness. Two data tables are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"A study sponsored by the Texas Education Agency was conducted to define qualitative and quantitative indicators of school district success. Efforts were focused on: viewpoints of administrators; quality indicators examined in other states; and a review of the literature. Results and recommendations are summarized into the following categories: basic model of schooling; indicator variables; educational comparisons; statewide indicator system; and that which is successful. Data indicate that multiple measures of school district performance should be used. It was apparent that using Texas Educational Assessment of Minimum Skills (TEAMS) test scores as the sole measure of school district performance does not meet the needs of administrators. It is suggested that state-level reporting  be quantitative in nature, but that school level measures be both qualitative and quantitative. A table summarizes the many indicators available for assessing educational inputs, processes, and outputs. Use of indicator variables is summarized as follows: (1) primary focus at the school level; (2) use of multiple output indicators of school performance; (3) use of multiple measurement and data collection strategies; (4) use of adaptive indicators that evolve over time; and (5) focus of the school on change and improvement over time. The bases for school comparisons are reviewed, and the utility and organization of a statewide indicator system are described. Recommendations are included for future efforts in developing a statewide indicator system. Two tables and two figures illustrate the  conclusions of the study. (SLD)",

        "description":"The learning approaches of secondary students were studied for 495 eighth-, tenth- and twelfth-grade students in Singapore. The focus was on determining: (1) the dominant approach used by students in learning different academic subjects (English, Chinese, mathematics, and science); (2) the motive-strategy consequence in learning these different subjects in grades 8, 10, and 12; and (3) the different learning approaches used by better (express) and weaker (normal) students. Normal students were motivated to learn the subject for its usefulness to them; express students were more likely to have intrinsic interest in the subject. Normal students were more likely to use rote learning and to rely heavily on teachers' notes and past examinations, while express students were more likely  to look for relationships between new and old concepts learned, showing a more reflective approach in their learning. The express students used effective retention strategies more frequently and exhibited better examination techniques than did normal students. Overall, when strategies were viewed in terms identified by J. Biggs (1979), these secondary students, irrespective of grade and subject, showed a preference for deep and achieving strategies. That weaker students were more likely to favor the Surface Approach was an expected finding, but one educators should consider in their efforts to help weak learners. Six data tables are included.

Several series of experiments were designed with the purpose of producing experimentally manipulable impasses or plateaus in the course of learning. Over 200 subjects (humans and animals) in learning studies identified targets in various complex computer-presented displays. Among the factors manipulated were: (1) complexity; (2) noise; (3) salience; (4) biasing instructions; and (5) the distribution of target features across boundaries of displays. Impasses were produced, but patterns of impasse phenomena were not reproduced reliably enough to support or disconfirm a theory of impasses in learning. It is suggested that the best available  tools for studying impasses in learning are probably the tools of comparative expertise (expert-novice) research, rather than those of the learning study.

QUEST accounts for answers adults produce for different categories of open-class questions, identifying the information sources associated with the content words in questions. Each information source is organized in a conceptual graph structure. The model suggests three convergence mechanisms that narrow the node space from dozens/hundreds to a handful of nodes that serve as good answers to a question. These mechanisms include: an arc search procedure to restrict the search; answer quality decrease as a function of structural distance; and a constraint satisfaction component to prune out potential answers that are conceptually incompatible with the queried node. QUEST was tested in four  informational contexts: (1) expository texts on scientific mechanisms (192 and 162 college undergraduates); (2) narrative texts (110 undergraduates); (3) generic knowledge structures (500 trials with college students); and (4) situations with complex pragmatic constraints (telephone surveys of 336 citizens, interviews with 144 clerks, and filmed interviews using 436 questions). The model successfully predicted the likelihood of generating answers and the goodness-of-answer judgments. Seven tables and 10 figures present study data. (Author/SLD)",

Although some students view ability in a fixed sense, others equate it with learning and hold an incremental view of it. Ability beliefs may influence perceived self-efficacy, which can affect motivation and skill acquisition. The theoretical bases of attribution theory, conceptions of ability, and self-efficacy are reviewed. Evidence from research is summarized to demonstrate how providing  students with attributional feedback affects achievement beliefs and behaviors.

Social-cognitive learning theory suggests that observations of peers performing academic tasks may affect the learners' efficacy partly through the intervening influence of perceived similarity in competence, and that student capability differences may influence perceived similarity. Research is summarized showing that students with skill deficiencies judge themselves more similar in competence to coping models than to mastery models, and that observing coping models enhances their self-efficacy and skills to a greater extent than does observing mastery models. In contrast, normal achievers judge themselves more  competent than coping models (peers) who verbalize negative beliefs and equal in competence to mastery models and to coping models who do not verbalize negative beliefs. Future research might investigate familial influences on students' receptiveness to contextual factors, underminers of perceived efficacy, and developmental changes in ability to learn from models.

        "description":"Issues in the ongoing evaluation of an innovative curriculum in an academic setting are discussed. The program provides instruction in computer literacy to a physically challenged clientele and to professionals from local service agencies who have disabilities. Data have been collected through survey questionnaires principally composed of Likert items and direct or telephone interviews. Both interviews deal with: (1) likes and dislikes of participants; (2) desired changes; (3) perception of effects on individual improvement; and (4) demographics/client background data. The foremost problem has been that of unintentional alienation of subjects due to semantics in talking about disabilities. Face-to-face interviews with visually impaired subjects brought different problems in terms  of potential bias. Confidentiality is a problem transcending all types of evaluation instrumentation. Another important issue has been the utilization of the evaluation's findings. The evaluation of the first year was summative; it served as the basis for formative changes for subsequent years. Strategies for the successful conduct of this summative evaluation with formative purposes must take the acknowledged problems into account. Evaluating a program for special needs groups may require special preparation and sensitivity. (SLD)",

        "description":"The utility of computer analysis in the assessment of written products was studied using the WordMAP software package. Data were collected for 92 college freshmen, using: (1) the Test of Standard Written English (TSWE); (2) the English Composition Test of the College Board; (3) verbal and mathematical Scholastic Aptitude Tests; (4) two narrative essays; (5) two expository essays; and (6) two persuasive essays. The variables analyzed by WordMAP were used to predict the score on a single essay and a combined score for the other five essays that three human readers would give. In either situation, the computer could predict the reader's score reasonably well. It is not likely that many institutions will choose to assess writing without using human readers, but the fact that  assessment of writing skills can be enhanced through software analysis may make it possible to reduce the amount of labor required, perhaps by using only one reader instead of the two or three usually required. Computer analysis also makes possible a level of feedback to students and teachers that is not possible using human readers alone. Five tables contain data from the study. (SLD)",

This paper reviews the assumptions that must be met for ANCOVA to yield useful results, and argues that ANCOVA will yield distorted and inaccurate results when these assumptions are violated. For ANCOVA to provide meaningful statistical control and to not obscure or mislead, it must be ascertained that the data set fulfills several requirements, especially those pertaining to the homogeneity of regression slopes. For ANCOVA to increase power against a Type II error, there must be a high correlation between the covariate and the dependent variable and no correlation between the covariate and the independent  variable. ANCOVA practitioners should examine their data sets carefully to insure that ANCOVA is an appropriate analytic method rather than a method that generates more problems for a given data set than it actually solves.

        "description":"The instructional effectiveness of commercially prepared test preparation materials was studied using Riverside Publishing Company's &quot;Improving Test-Taking Skills&quot; materials. The study further investigated differential effects of test-taking instruction as a result of student characteristics. In the first year of the study (1986-87), performance on standardized achievement tests of 182 fourth graders receiving an average of 12 hours and 212 fifth graders receiving an average of 9.25 hours of instruction with the Riverside materials was matched with that of students receiving test-taking instruction without the Riverside materials (223 fourth-graders, and 215 fifth-graders). In the replication year, students in nine schools received about 10 hours of Riverside instruction. Samples  used in the second year included 129 fourth-graders and 92 fifth-graders receiving the Riverside materials, and 148 fourth-graders and 109 fifth-graders not receiving the Riverside materials. In the first year of the study, fourth-grade students receiving formal instruction in test taking did increase their scores, although teacher-made or commercial materials performed comparably well. In the second year, the Riverside method instruction appeared to have resulted in improved test scores only in mathematics for the fourth grade. No beneficial effects of test-taking instruction were found in the fifth grade in either year. No clear-cut patterns of differential effects for sex, socioeconomic status, or ethnicity were apparent for grade 4; results for grade 5 were similar. The policy  implications of these findings are discussed. Two tables contain study results. (SLD)",

        "description":"To learn more about graduate program selectivity, admission test requirements, and the role that the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) play in the admission process, a two-phase study was conducted. First, the GRE General Test and Subject Test requirements of a broad range (over 12,000) of graduate programs were summarized by examining data in the &quot;Graduate Programs and Admissions Manual&quot; to indicate how many and what kinds of programs do or do not require GRE scores. Then a mail survey of 616 graduate departments was carried out; the survey yielded 333 replies to a questionnaire about administrator's perceptions of the importance of GRE scores in the admissions process and the ways in which scores were used. Faculty members responding to the questionnaire included professors  (56%), associate professors (29%), and assistant professors or below (15%). The following conclusions were reached: (1) about 64% of all graduate programs require GRE scores; (2) GRE score requirements have not changed appreciably over the last decade; (3) there is little relationship between program selectivity and use of GRE scores; (4) the primary use of GRE scores appears to be to compensate for otherwise weak applicant credentials; (5) the primary reason given for non-use of GRE scores is the belief that other information is adequate for decisions; and (6) departments assign the most importance to grades, followed by letters of recommendation, and then by GRE scores. Nine tables and 1 graph present study data. The survey, the departmental questionnaire, and a sample of responses are  appended. (Author/SLD)",

Sixty students at the University of Missouri-Rolla were included in this study. Participants were required to study a passage and create a summary of the material in one of three conditions. Those in the text-map group (TM) and those in the text-text group (TT) studied a passage in the form of traditional text, while those in the map-text group (MT) studied the passage in the form of a knowledge map. Those in groups TT and MT created a summary in the form of traditional text, while those in group TM created a summary in the form of a knowledge map. Following the  summary, all groups studied a second knowledge map that described psychological research designs. Students completed recall tests over both passages 2 days later. Results indicate that students in all groups performed better on the summary (post-organizer) than on either recall test, and recalled significantly more information from the text passage than from the experimental design passage. TT subjects performed better than did the other groups on post-organizer accuracy, while the other two groups recalled more of the information in the transfer passage. Post-organizer accuracy proved to be a significant predictor of recall in MT subjects, while post-organizer accuracy and recall were largely unrelated for the other groups.

The study used the Florida Performance Measurement System summative observation instrument--a measure of teacher classroom behavior that is comprised of 20 behavioral indicators shown to be effective and 20 indicators shown to be ineffective by the educational process-product literature. Data from 7,926 observations (4,447 at the elementary school level and 3,479 at the secondary school level) conducted during the 1987-88 school year and from 4,575 observations (2,735 at the  elementary school level and 1,840 at the secondary school level) conducted during the 1988-89 school year were submitted to analysis. Questioning and interactive indicators, both effective and ineffective, dominated the average lesson (60%), while indicators dealing with higher order thinking and problem solving comprised only 4% of all behaviors. The data imply that awareness of ineffective questioning behaviors may need emphasis in teacher training programs and that the current emphasis on problem solving is appropriate.

Emphasizing robustness across broad unidentifiable ranges of contamination, an attempt was made to replicate, on a somewhat smaller scale, the definitive Princeton Robustness Study of 1972 to determine how closely results produced in a laboratory environment represent the multiple contaminations encountered among real world data. Contaminations included various mixtures of modalities, digit preferences, tail-weights, sample spaces, and asymmetry. Due at least partly to the almost universal presence of asymmetry, the arithmetic mean in particular and L-estimators in general proved comparatively robust for the situations  investigated. Most so-called &quot;robust&quot; estimators proved less efficient than the mean even in rather extreme conditions for these multinomial data sets produced by empirical applications of ability and psychometric measures. These findings imply that prior robustness studies that have found the arithmetic mean and its parametric counterparts to be non-robust may be misleading, since the types of theoretical populations investigated in most research studies do not appear to exist among real world psychometric and education data sets.

The examinations included essay, clinical, and oral forms of the tests. Twelve judges graded the three essays for 32 examinees during a 4-day grading session, which was divided into eight half-day grading periods. Eighteen judges graded the performance of 217 examinees on the clinical examination during a 2-day grading session that was divided into four grading periods. Forty-six judges graded the performance of 270 examinees on the oral examination during a day and a half grading session that was divided into three grading periods. An extension of the Rasch model was used to analyze facets for examinees, items, judges, and  grading periods. This study focused only on judge severities and differences among grading periods, however. The system of links necessary to calibrate judge severities and grading periods as separate facets was adequate because judges had 16 primary protocols and some examinees in common. Data from each of the three examinations were analyzed using FACETS, a computer program for Rasch analysis of examinations with more than two facets. The FACETS program estimates objective and conjointly additive calibrations, standard errors, and fit statistics for each element of each facet in the examination. Significant variation in judge severities and some variation across grading periods were found on all three examinations. However, the fit statistics confirm that most judges are reasonably  consistent in the application of their individual level of severity. Four data tables and four graphs are included. (TJH)",

In this program, conducted at the Selinsgrove Area Middle School (SAMS) in Pennsylvania, adults from the community ate lunch with groups of seventh graders. The focus of the lunch guest program was to increase interaction between students and adults. A representative group of male and female professional and business people as well as individuals associated with the educational community were invited to be luncheon guests. One criterion for choosing guests was that each must be a person who either worked with or were known to have an interest in this age group of students. The session for each group lasted 45 minutes. Students met the guest in the school office, had a  conversational lunch at a designated table in the cafeteria for 30 minutes, and spent the remaining 15 minutes in a quiet setting to bring the experience to a close. Twenty-three of the 27 community members who were involved in the program were surveyed; all requested to continue as participants in the program. Six teachers with students in the program were interviewed; all indicated that they felt positively about the program. Results from the survey of the 168 student participants at the conclusion of the program indicated that the program was very positive for them. For example, 66% of the students felt that they would like to participate in Lunch at SAMS again, and 77% of the students felt that seventh graders in the next year's class should get a chance to take part in Lunch at SAMS.

In addition, the paper recounts an example of how a non-traditional approach was used to maximize the usefulness of data collected under unusual constraints and with an a priori expectation of a high rate of non-response. The author was charged with testing the ability of the National Science Foundation to conduct a biennial survey of scientists and engineers who had recently immigrated into the United States. This assessment was done within the context of the &quot;noggin factor,&quot; which engenders a consideration of the particularity or each survey situation. As a result of the noggin factor, generalized solutions to  survey research problems tend to be self-defeating. It is concluded that survey researchers should attend more to process than to outcome.

The following conditions were sought: (1) sufficient knowledge of the LOGO primitives and concepts; (2) mastery of the thinking skills within the programming context; and (3) explicit training for transfer. A systematic experiment was conducted in 3 6th-grade classes with 72 12-year-old students, using a pretest-posttest design with a non-treatment control group. A LOGO course, involving the training of a systematic programming strategy, was taught to two of the classes. In one of these classes, explicit instruction for transfer was also applied. At the end of the school year, the fulfillment of the conditions was  tested. Findings reveal that the first two transfer conditions were fulfilled in both experimental groups; results with respect to explicit training for transfer were less positive. A series of transfer tests was administered, and data analysis revealed that transfer was obtained in both experimental groups. This finding implies that fulfillment of the first two conditions is sufficient for realizing transfer of thinking skills. Three tables present study data, and 13 figures illustrate items from the tests. (Author/SLD)",

The 12 goals targeted in the report include improving student achievement, decreasing dropout rates by 50%, and assuring that four out of five college-bound students are ready for college work. The following are examples of actions underway in SREB states: (1) reporting school progress through  establishing indicators and data collection; (2) setting school accreditation standards; and (3) establishing school incentive and reward programs. The prosperity and unprecedented economic growth that characterized the SREB area in recent years are slowing, and officials in these states will soon be making tough decisions about educational funding. Failing to focus on outcomes for students and failure to use accountability to determine areas of success and areas where schools are not doing well will mean that disparities in opportunities and outcomes for disadvantaged students will continue and may increase.

Steps in the analysis included: (1) developing multiple regression equations for each institution by gender and minority status; (2) predicting college grade point average (GPA) through these equations, using as independent variables the proportions of free and reduced price lunches, the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) verbal and mathematics scores, and college credit hours carried and earned; (3) using the appropriate regression equation for the  institution to calculate the residual (the difference bewteen actual and predicted GPA); and (4) determining the average residual for graduates of each high school to rank them on the basis of mean residuals. Results showed a modest pattern of suburban and urban high schools tending toward lower college performance than expected; on the other hand, there were high schools located in rural areas that had positive mean residual GPAs. This suggests that some rural and small-town schools do produce students who perform at a higher level than would be predicted on the basis of their SAT scores or the socio-economic status of their high schools. This method may have promise for extending assessment possibilities; methodological implications are discussed. One flowchart is provided, and an  appendix lists the multiple regressions by institution. (SLD)",

        "description":"The purpose of this report is to explore an analysis of discussions, among groups of elementary school children, of a social problem. The intent of the research is to contribute to the advancement of methods for program and student assessment, particularly toward goals not usually evaluated by traditional testing programs. The analysis method used is an adaptation of schema theory set against a background of recent research on the solving of ill-structured problems. The major contribution of this study is in operationalizing the imposition of a schema framework on protocol data. The particular data that form the example analyzed come from an ongoing curriculum project comparing methods of teaching thinking skills in the classroom. Subjects were 3rd and 6th graders in 18 classes  at 8 rural elementary schools in 3 school board jurisdictions in southwestern Ontario. Groups of five students each were taken from class and asked to discuss for 10 minutes a potentially iniquitous family situation involving allowances and household chores and what might be done about the problem; 76 discussions were recorded. The analysis showed patterns of differences among protocols, expressed as aspects of typical, enriched, and impoverished schemata. Many of the patterns in the data could be tentatively linked to the instructional treatments. Although the context is group discussion, much of the proposed methodology is applicable to problem-solving protocols of individuals. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"This paper explains in user-friendly terms why multivariate statistics are so important in educational research. The basic logic of canonical correlation analysis is presented as a simple or bivariate Pearson &quot;r&quot; procedure. It is noted that all statistical tests implicitly involve the calculation of least squares weights, and that all parametric tests can be conducted using canonical analysis, since canonical analysis subsumes parametric methods as special cases. Canonical analysis is potent because it does not require the researcher to discard variance of any of the variables, and because the analysis honors the complexity of a reality in which variables interact simultaneously. Three major classes of procedures for evaluating the importance of specific variables in canonical  correlation analysis were explored. Various procedures in each class were illustrated in a concrete fashion using a single small data set for heuristic purposes. Appended program files for the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and the Statistical Analysis System may facilitate further exploration of the concepts presented.

        "description":"This paper suggests that multivariate analysis techniques are very important in educational research, and that one multivariate technique--canonical correlation analysis--may be particularly useful. The logic of canonical analysis is explained. It is suggested that a backward variable elimination strategy can make the method even more powerful, by yielding more parsimonious results and greater power against Type II error. Backward variable elimination canonical correlation analysis uses communality coefficients to eliminate variables with relatively small explanatory power. It is also suggested that cross-validation procedures should be implemented to augment interpretation. These analyses are illustrated using a small heuristic data set. Five data tables are included.

        "description":"The effects of a 3-week summer workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and seven seminars held in the following academic year on the learning environments of 40 participating teachers' high school biology and chemistry classes were assessed. In this 1988-89 program, the 40 teachers visited 10 industries and agencies to observe applications of basic science. From these observations, they developed, in the university laboratories, teaching modules for their classroom curricula. Development activities were augmented by lectures, demonstrations, and presentations by visiting scientists. Videotapes were prepared to demonstrate basic science applications and processes as part of the teaching modules. This evaluation focused on the ability of the inservice program to  stimulate effective teaching approaches to theories and concepts in biology and chemistry for secondary school science teachers, to build curriculum units from industrial and societal applications of conceptual and syntactical science using teaching strategies geared toward a range of student abilities, and to provide lesser-prepared teachers an opportunity to build enriched curriculum units and develop effective teaching strategies. Evaluation data were gathered via a learning environment measure called &quot;Our Class and Its Work.&quot; Results indicate that the program did improve the science education of participants, stimulating positive student attitudes and greater student achievement.

This program was planned to test the notion that parent-child interaction in the context of Head Start would be the most beneficial form of parental involvement. An assessment session, which measured variables in the parent/family as well as in the child, was conducted in October and again in April of the Head Start year. The initial assessment indicated that the Head Start families are similar to other families, but that the mothers tend to underestimate their child's self-worth and the families tend to display patterns considered dysfunctional. The results from the second assessment session indicated that these problems can be  alleviated with an increase in parental involvement. For instance, parents at the end of the study had increased their estimate of their children's competence and social acceptance. Furthermore, the families involved in the study became less dysfunctional during the study. The results of this study indicate the significance of parental involvement in the Head Start Program and suggest the need for future research. One table and one figure are included. (JS)",

A racial comparison of all urban households on the basis of income yields the following findings: (1) 4 percent of Black households and 14 percent of White households comprise the upper class; (2) 23.6 percent of Black households, 27.6 percent of Hispanic households, and 41.9 percent of White households are at least middle class; (3) 20 percent of all groups comprise the working class; (4) 15.3 percent of Black households and 17.5 percent of Hispanic households comprise the low income  class; and (5) 41.3 percent of Black households and 33.4 percent of Hispanic households comprise the very low income class. The underclass is a newly emerged group that can be viewed as a subset of the low and very low income groups, whose members have developed problems beyond poverty and lack of opportunity, and are geographically concentrated in urban innercities. Policies that employ residential mobility to overcome the limitations of innercity residence focus on either improving the relative advantages available in the inner-city, or improving the access of innercity residents to advantages available in the suburbs. However, these solutions, which merely involve movement within the current geography, cannot assure employment success. Two tables of statistical data and a chart  illustrating the theories of the underclass are included. A list of 19 references is appended. (FMW)",

Project components included the following: (1) piloting the use of dropout intervention specialists at 10 high schools; (2) improving procedures for identifying at-risk students; (3) evaluating the effectiveness of some of the District's dropout prevention programs; and (4) enhancing the community's understanding of the dropout problem. This report presents major findings of Project GRAD. Statistics indicate that despite State education reforms, AISD's dropout prevention effort, WINGS (With Intervention the Number of Graduates Soars), and other initiatives, the  AISD dropout rate has remained roughly unchanged since 1982. Factors seen as contributing to program inefficacy include lack of special services, WINGS programs overlap, underattention by campus coordinators, overreliance on part-time specialists, and an overbroad State definition of at-risk students. WINGS should be modified to accomplish the following: (1) match services to needs and eliminate service gaps; (2) coordinate existing programs; (3) track and monitor individual at-risk students; (4) concentrate services on students at greatest risk; and (5) evaluate existing programs on an ongoing basis. The report includes 58 figures, 23 attachments to chapters, and a list of 18 references. (AF)",

Representatives from 30 education organizations discussed a national agenda for early awareness programs and explored opportunities for collaboration. Early awareness programs are broadly based efforts to introduce students in the late elementary and early secondary grades to the increased opportunities available to high school graduates who enroll in a postsecondary education program. All intervention strategies should be based on the following concepts: (1) all student groups, including minorities and other at-risk groups, have high aspirations and are capable of academic achievement; (2) minority students have talents and abilities that are inhibited and  obscured by the structure and practices of the education system; (3) instituting the necessary changes in the education system will take a significant expenditure and effort; and (4) schools must be assisted in providing necessary services through collaborative arrangements. The following program elements are necessary: (1) early parent and childhood education; (2) parent involvement; (3) tutoring and supplemental instruction; (4) efforts to build self-esteem and instill a positive attitude towards success through education; (5) mentoring, role models, and other support group interactions; (6) involvement of postsecondary student services staff; (7) guidance about preparation for the next levels of study and affirmation that students can succeed in any learning situation; and (8) program  evaluation through long-term tracking of participants.

Information was gathered from a telephone survey of emergency shelter providers, housing advocacy organizations, and local governments in 26 communities, ranging from small rural communities to large cities. The following summary findings are reported: (1) virtually every community, regardless of size, reported that its housing needs and the rate of homelessness were growing but none would be able to meet the need in the foreseeable future; (2) families with children comprised the fastest growing sector of the homeless population, the majority of which were headed by women, and unaccompanied  minors comprised over 25 percent of the homeless in large cities; (3) special needs groups within the homeless population included the mentally ill, comprising at least 30 percent of the homeless in 17 communities, and substance abusers, comprising 33 percent of the homeless in 16 communities; (4) although not identified in the survey, there is growing evidence that Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) can cause able-bodied, fully-functioning individuals to become homeless; and (5) minority groups, usually African Americans, comprised over half of the homeless population in 11 communities but the rate of homelessness among Hispanic Americans and Native Americans has increased recently.

The program provides information and activities to increase the students' awareness of their potential and the opportunities available through higher education. Information was gathered from student files, surveys of students, professional staff, and parents, and the Student Attitude Measure (SAM), a standardized measure of student attitudes. The following summary findings are reported: (1) participants' grade point  averages in required and college preparatory courses were slightly higher than other middle school students; (2) participants' attitudes toward academic learning and school behavior in five areas of the SAM were average and above average; (3) some differences were noted in academic performance and attitude by grade levels, sex, ethnic origin, and socioeconomic status, suggesting careful consideration in selecting participants and in planning program activities and individual follow-up; (4) teachers were positive about recommending students for the program, services offered, and program coordinators' communication; (5) parents demonstrated positive attitudes toward the idea of a college education for their child and the child's continued participation in the program; and (6) almost half of  the parents reported some postsecondary education.

        "description":"This document comprises a study of compensatory education programs at the classroom level in 24 schools in 6 states. funded under Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act. The following issues were investigated: (1) instructional effectiveness; (2) the effect of local service delivery design on instructional quality; and (3) the extent and nature of coordination between Chapter 1 and regular instructional programs. The study sample comprised 17 elementary schools, 3 intermediate schools, and 4 high schools, of which 15 schools were located in urban areas, 4 in suburban areas, and 5 in rural areas in diverse geographic regions. Data were gathered from interviews with school staff and through over 2,000 hours of classroom observation. In general, program design  was found to have very little effect on the total amount of time a student spent receiving instruction, but simply redistributed a fixed amount of instructional time across programs. The result was small gains for participants when compared to non-participants, despite the advantage of small class size. The wide variety of local program characteristics suggests the following implications for improvement: (1) improvement will occur on a site-by-site basis; (2) the amount of direct instruction or the nature of the curriculum is more likely to affect instructional quality than service delivery design; (3) add-on services would increase the amount of instructional time; (4) curriculum should be closely coordinated between Chapter 1 and regular instruction; (5) students should be exposed to  higher-order thinking skills at all levels; and (6) secondary school programs should move away from self-paced instructional formats that rely on independent seatwork.

Some of the findings and recommendations of the NAVE are the following: (1) the Perkins Act is a weak mechanism for achieving its goals because little additional direction has been provided on federal or state levels on the targeting of federal funds for supplementary services to disadvantaged and handicapped students, nor has technical assistance been provided on effective practices for serving these populations;  (2) secondary education greatly needs improvement, and six major objectives for federal policy in vocational education are proposed; (3) although postsecondary education is a growing enterprise, its major problem is that many students do not stay in it long enough to receive in-depth training, and federal policy changes should be made to improve rates of program completion, especially among targeted groups; and (4) the federal role in vocational education should be strengthened and changes should be made in the current legislation.

        "description":"The National Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE) examined how the federal law was implemented and federal funds were distributed under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984. Data were reported on targeting of resources among and within states and on the uses of federal funds, and implications were drawn from the findings. The study found that the rates at which states allocated Perkins Act funds among secondary and postsecondary sectors varied greatly in 1986-87, with postsecondary shares ranging from 8 to 100 percent. In addition, separate area vocational school districts appeared to receive a disproportionate share of the federal funds in secondary education. In contrast, most school districts received grants that were too small to mount new initiatives of  any size. For the disadvantaged set-aside alone, school districts with the highest poverty rates had a greater likelihood of receiving an award, and their per-student disadvantaged and handicapped set-aside awards were larger than those in other districts. A substantial amount of Perkins Act funds were used for assessments and other types of vocational counseling. Handicapped set-asides go to students with individualized education plans at the secondary level and to students with physical and cognitive impairments at the postsecondary level. Recommendations were made for improvements in fund allocation. (KC)",

Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984. This part of the study examined the federal role in supporting vocational education at the postsecondary level. It examines enrollments, course-taking, educational attainments, and labor market outcomes associated with postsecondary vocational education. It compares different groups of students at various types of institutions and considers the relationship between the act and other policies, both federal and state, that also finance postsecondary vocational education. The study found that postsecondary education is a growing enterprise that is central to the educational mission of  less-than-baccalaureate institutions. There are 4.3 million vocational students at these schools. The major problem facing postsecondary vocational education is that many students do not stay in school long enough to receive in-depth training. For students who accumulate substantial amounts of vocational credits or complete programs, postsecondary vocational education pays off in economic terms. These findings strongly indicate the need to help students choose a field of study, complete the program, and find a related job. Perkins Act support of postsecondary education is low compared to state and local support. Federal policy in postsecondary vocational education should aim to improve rates of program completion and placement in related jobs, to provide special assistance to at-risk  populations, and to improve the transition from secondary to postsecondary vocational education.

Analyses that address student enrollment patterns were based on the 1987 High School Transcript study. Some of the findings of the study are the following: (1) both handicapped and academically disadvantaged students enrolled in public high schools do have access to vocational education, and, in fact, they earn more credits than other students; (2) handicapped and disadvantaged  students took a higher percentage of their course work in area vocational centers than did other students; (3) handicapped and disadvantaged students earned 37 percent of the credits in cooperative education programs as compared to 43 percent for advantaged students; (4) handicapped females earned considerably fewer credits in occupationally specific courses than any other group of students; and (5) students in schools with large concentrations of poor and low-achieving youth took fewer vocational courses than students in other schools. Recommendations were made for improving handicapped and disadvantaged students' access to high quality vocational programs and to cooperative education, for providing placement services, and for targeting funds to schools with high percentages of special  needs students.

        "description":"The learning gap between high school students in the United States and those in many other countries has several causes. First, U.S. students devote a lot less time and interest to learning. A second major reason is parental and school board apathy. Cultural comparisons reveal a lack of incentives for learning accomplishment in the United States, stemming from (1) the lack of labor market reward for high school achievement; (2) peer pressure that discourages studying, because students compete against each other rather than for achievement of fixed standards of competence; and (3) admission to selective colleges is based on aptitude tests rather than absolute standards of achievement. In other countries, studying hard is not a national character trait but a response to the way  society rewards achievement. The difficulty lies in designing a system that motivates by recognizing and rewarding learning effort and achievement. Reform recommendations include statewide achievement examinations, local competency profiles, portfolios of graduation credentials, release of student records to employers, credential data banks, changes in college admission policies, greater use of improved employment tests, and school-based rewards for learning. Underrepresented minorities particularly would benefit through improved ability to compete in the labor market. (70 references) (SK)",

        "description":"U.S. competitiveness depends on higher worker productivity, greater technological investment, and streamlined organizational structure, which require a flexible, highly trained work force. The demand for educated workers continues to rise in industrialized societies, influenced by the demand for certain goods and services, decline in real labor costs, productivity as influenced by technology and workplace organization, and international competition, which is changing the skill requirements and composition of jobs. Research findings show that the average educational requirements of future jobs will not differ significantly from current jobs; technology has varying impacts on occupations; and a broad array of different types of skills may be necessary. Changes in the supply of  educated labor are caused by increased numbers of women, minorities, and immigrants in the work force and the lack of educational preparation of many labor market entrants. There is a growing mismatch between the educational attainment of workers and job demands, resulting in both over- and undereducation. The nature of schools differs from the nature of the workplace, with a consequent imbalance between the types of skills taught and those needed by workers. Additional research is needed to provide adequate measures of skill needs and labor supply and demand. Policy makers should focus attention on achieving adequate education for disadvantaged groups, providing appropriate school experiences, determining appropriate roles for all types of educational providers, and effectively using  educated workers.

        "description":"A search of literature was conducted to address whether and how the Federal Government should do more to encourage U.S. students to complete degrees, especially graduate degrees, in science and engineering. Science was defined to include all of natural science, including mathematics and computer science, but to exclude social and behavioral sciences. The study found that the number of U.S. citizens earning doctorates in science and engineering in 1987 was 9,724. This number is not enough to replace scientists and engineers who die or retire, but the number is greatly augmented by foreign residents who receive doctorates and remain in the United States. The level of science and engineering doctorate awards to U.S. citizens has been constant since 1976. Until now, the number of  degrees awarded has usually been sufficient to meet employment needs, with the labor market expanding and contracting and student enrollments following suit, after a lag. However, although shortages are not widespread at present, there are general persistent shortages of personnel in computer science and engineering, and sometimes in mathematics and environmental and physical sciences. Federal intervention in the science and engineering job market can be made through graduate fellowships and traineeships, research assistanceships, forgivable loans, precollege programs, tax incentives, undergraduate assistance, and employee educational assistance, but such intervention has both pros and cons.

Many work-bound youths, especially minorities and females, spend their first years after school unemployed or job hopping, with consequent loss of training and productivity. These problems are becoming more serious because minorities and females are becoming an increasing portion of the labor force and the youth labor force is shrinking while demand is projected to increase. Achievement cannot be improved without student incentives and teacher authority. The school-work transition and employers' hiring practices undermine student incentives and teacher authority. Lacking authority, teachers make &quot;bad bargains&quot; with youths. Japan, West Germany, and Boston use alternative  models. To improve the situation of noncollege-bound students, (1) employers should hire youths based on grades, test scores, and school recommendations; (2) employers must show youths how basic skills lead to desirable jobs; (3) employers must tell school counselors about job openings and hiring criteria, trust counselors' recommendations, and make hiring selections while youths are still in school; (4) schools must make grades meaningful to employers, especially recruiters and supervisors; (5) schools should rate students for &quot;effort&quot; and for &quot;improved skills&quot;; (6) teachers should write references for work-bound students, as they do for the college bound; (7) schools must make grades and teacher recommendations available to employers and make transcripts easily understood and compared;  and (8) schools must restructure the general track to offer preparation for youths' future goals.

        "description":"A general increase in the demand for workplace basic skills mirrors the general increase in societal basic skills demands. As a result, many adults are participating in second-chance basic skills education. Second-chance basic skills programs are offered by a wide variety of providers, but populations actually served by programs rarely amount to more than a tiny fraction of estimated target populations. For the most part, basic skills instruction in the United States is provided by part-time teachers and volunteers. Levels of training and certification among instructors are often low. Second-chance basic skills programs have not done very well at either attracting or retaining a significant number of learners. High quality instruction helps a good deal, but a significant amount  of time is needed for even the best programs to have an impact; and no program reports holding average learners as long as even 100 hours per year. Most of the funding for programs is provided by the states. During the past few years, there have been a number of promising new developments related to second-chance basic skills education. Among them are an increase in the number and sophistication of workplace basic skills programs and the increasing potential of technology to help overcome some of the problems that have plagued basic skills education. Multistrand basic skills programs are one of the possible program alternatives. Such an approach offers varying solutions to varying problems. Policy options should be considered for increasing and improving adult basic skills programs. (62  references) (KC)",

        "description":"This paper provides a critical review of economic models of employers' decisions to train workers: what training is undertaken, where it is undertaken, and who finances it. The focus of the review is on the provision of job training to workers with no unusual training problems. The first two sections consider the nature of on-the-job training more precisely, emphasizing the role of the firm in the supply of on-the-job training opportunities. Two alternative models of on-the-job training are considered and a few implications for the efficient supply of training services are derived. In section 3, a basic investment model of on-the-job training is developed, forming the analytical structure that will be used to frame the discussions to follow. The economic logic of this human  capital paradigm is discussed at length because of its central role in forming the economist's conception of this market. In section 4, conditions under which the free market generates an efficient amount of on-the-job training are outlined. The discussion then proceeds to the important issue of why this market may fail to yield efficient results, most prominently the financing problem. The relationship of human capital finance to the deeper issue of property rights structures is explored. Analyses of variations on this fundamental problem comprise much of the remainder of this review, including the policy discussion of the final section. The potential for an alternative supply mechanism, employer training cooperatives, is critically examined. The final section considers ways in which the  government can encourage the more efficient provision of on-the-job training. (37 references) (KC)",

        "description":"Recent trends indicate increased interest in the education and training of the labor force. However, information in the extent of on-the-job training (OJT) is complicated by conceptual difficulties, such as the informal nature of much OJT, lack of reliable cost data on formal training, and the fact that many studies based on stratified samples lack weighting to a total population. Varying estimates of the numbers of workers to whom training is provided arise due to different approaches to measuring the types and duration of training, with few studies tracking trends over time. Studies of differences among types of workers trained lack consensus on whether male or female, union or nonunion workers receive more OJT. Generally, white, more educated, and full-time workers are trained  more. No firm relationship between training and employer size has been determined. In some studies, minimum wage laws appear to constrain training. Overall, the lack of information seriously hampers the formation of policy. If concern about employer-sponsored training is likely to continue, systematic data collection is vital. (43 references) (SK)",

        "description":"Today's postindustrial or information age requires a different mix and a more advanced level of basic employability skills than those needed in the industrial age. As a result, the workplace is now demanding a higher entrance level of employability skills than the schools have previously been asked to provide. In addition, information technology is increasingly developed in the workplace. Employers have responded by complaining about the schools, helping the schools, and starting in-house programs to provide basic employability skills and further training. A literature review revealed that little is known about private sector training, particularly about employer-provided training and most specifically about informal, on-the-job training. Estimates of employers' annual  expenditures on training are of questionable accuracy. Private sector training may be of sufficient policy importance to warrant a systematic data collection effort. The findings of the literature review also confirm that women and minority groups are much less likely to receive employer-provided training than are white males. Suggested policy changes may improve access to private sector training. Finally, the review suggests that the popular idea that firms underinvest in human capital may not be accurate. It suggests that more research is needed, but to the extent that underinvestment in private sector training does exist, options are possible for increasing the extent of such training.

The role that the private sector plays in education is not widely known. The application of its solutions to broader education problems fails to occur because of lack of awareness. A conceptual model of training such as that used in private industry is described; this approach could be used to improve education. This model of training  considers the audience, the content, the process of training, and the cost. These factors are first described individually and then integrated into a data-based, multivariate model. Use of the model represents an opportunity to achieve a full understanding of private sector training. (KC)",

        "description":"A human resource strategy to enable the effective integration of new technologies in the workplace must be comprehensive, flexible, and sensitive to the dynamics of technological and organizational change. However, information from macro-level studies provides little guidance for anticipating and planning for the adoption of new technologies, failing to forecast their effects on employment and being conducted at aggregation levels that are too high. Case studies, when systematically analyzed in a broader conceptual framework, can produce useful generalizations for decision making. A skill training life-cycle framework identifies patterns in training requirements across four phases (introduction, growth, maturity, and decline) in the nature of tasks, type of job skills, effects on  job structure, and type of training provider. At the organizational level, management practices and labor-management agreements determine how and when technologies are used. One characteristic vital to successful adoption is the support of workers and managers for change. Although human resource adjustments and workplace restructuring occur primarily within firms, public policy can play a leadership role in (1) provision of skill development to prepare the work force; (2) programs to ease the adjustment of workers in transition; and (3) support for research and development of effective ways to integrate technological change.

        "description":"Technological advances necessitate the continuous retraining of the work force. Three technologies are having greatest impact on the labor force: (1) the scope and depth of computer skills required by most jobs continue to expand; (2) robotics in manufacturing means that certain new jobs are more technical and require postsecondary education; and (3) telecommunications are becoming increasingly important in business. Consequently, a large proportion of workers is likely to be affected by one or more of these technologies. Three general effects of new technologies are skill twist, deskilling, and upskilling. Skill twist refers to the displacement of old skills with new ones. In deskilling, new technology reduces the level of skills required, and upskilling has the opposite effect.  The nature of retraining for these three effects clearly differs; other influences are employee characteristics and organizational structures. Strategies for retraining include lifelong learning, use of educational technology, training sponsored by professional organizations, and vendor training materials. Issues in their use include affordability, accessibility, effectiveness, and the question of who is responsible--individuals or employers. Different policies are needed for skill twist, deskilling, and upskilling, as well as attention to the needs of groups whose level of literacy or economic circumstances limit their ability to participate in retraining.

For the major programs identified, it discusses the level of federal support, the eligibility requirements for the program, the characteristics of the participants, and the types of training provided. An important issue for this study is the definition of training; the definition provided by the U.S. Department of Education for vocational education in the 1988 &quot;Digest of Education Statistics&quot; is used. This definition focuses on training as coursework for obtaining a vocational credential. Descriptions of activities that can be regarded as training but do not meet this core definition are included in the report in some instances, especially when they are provided along with vocational classroom training. The  eight major federally funded training programs profiled include the following (funded under the Job Training Partnership Act): (1) Training Services for Economically Disadvantaged Youth and Adults; (2) the Summer Youth Employment and Training Program; (3) Employment and Training Assistance for Dislocated Workers; (4) the Native American Program; (5) the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Program; (6) the Job Corps; (7) the Veterans Employment and Training Program; and (funded under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act) (8) vocational education. The paper concludes that (1) data on participants and services are very limited; (2) some overlap may be necessary to serve special target groups; (3) few participants receive occupational classroom training; and (4) few programs have formal  links with employers to ensure that their labor needs are met.

        "description":"Several social objectives influence government sponsorship of employment programs: (1) training for mobility to reduce disruptions caused by change; and (2) increasing skill levels to increase productivity. Evaluation of program effectiveness considers whether the program served its target groups, what activities were provided, and what the outcomes were. The Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) targeted disadvantaged groups and provided classroom training, work experience, on-the-job training, and job placement. Wide fluctuations in estimates of CETA's net impact make it difficult to determine participant outcomes and cost-effectiveness. CETA's restructuring as the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) added performance standards and decentralization, which may have  limited the extent of services to mandated populations. Reviews of JTPA Titles II and III found some net gains, although those in most need are not always likely to receive assistance. Special youth programs such as the Summer Training and Education Program and JOBSTART have had modest positive outcomes. In general, the more effective programs for youth and disadvantaged adults are the more expensive ones. Government employment programs have served only a small proportion of their eligible population. Policy questions for future programs remain: Should they continue the same mix with more funds and participants? Serve fewer people more intensively or more people less intensively? or Should more attention be paid to matching individuals to the most appropriate programs and activities? (31  references) (SK)",

Less than one-third of 16- 19-year-old black males were employed in 1988. The most important policies affecting the employment of black males are monetary and fiscal policies. No employment and training policies can come close to providing the improvement in employment of black males that sustained low unemployment rates throughout the economy provide. The major replication and expansion of the Summer Training and Education Program (STEP) for in-school youth deserves support, but it is critically important that a strong evaluation component be added. Increased educational remediation was added to the Summer Youth Employment Program, with no plans to  evaluate the effects of the increased remediation. For out-of-school youth, the Job Corps is a long standing program of proven effectiveness that should be maintained and expanded. Job Start, a new pilot project for dropouts in an urban, nonresidential setting, deserves support and rigorous evaluation. A study of how the employment and training system can be better related to the educational system is much needed. After more than 20 years of federal employment and training programs, very little is known about what works for whom. (A 36-item list of research notes is included in the document.) (CML)",

        "description":"The imminent shortage of qualified workers, resulting from demographic changes and technological upgrades, has caused educators and employers to recognize the need to improve and increase their communication in order to achieve their interrelated goals. From the late 1800s, business has exerted influence on the nation's public education system. Employers have had input into its structure, operations, and regulatory policies on local and national levels. An intensified era of business education activity beginning in the 1970s has come about as the result of changes in federal employment and training policy that gave employers a larger role in local program planning. The business community often provides educators with data on projected vacancies and facilitates academic  achievement through participation in school-business collaboratives that focus on school-to-work transition assistance. Recently, workplace literacy programs have emerged. Various models of business-education collaboration exist, including examples from other countries. Improvements in these collaborative efforts would require educators to recast their role as receivers of services and resources from business to one of more active participation in translating workplace requirements into relevant curricula. Recommendations resulting from a literature and research review are that educators should be encouraged to initiate a more proactive role in meeting the needs of the business community, that Private Industry Councils be given a larger, regulatory role in facilitating partnerships and  communication guidelines, and that more research be conducted to identify the appropriate facilitating role for the Federal Government.

The aid covers about the same percentage of college costs that it did in 1970, but the impact of veterans' education benefits and social security benefits is no longer significant, and loans now make up one-half the total aid, having supplanted grants as the basic form of support for students who can demonstrate need. Participation rates in postsecondary education have not increased appreciably since the mid-1970s. Some ways of increasing participation, particularly of low income and minority students, are to increase funding for grants, decrease loan defaults by increasing risk sharing, and simplify the aid application process. To increase the participation of older  students, the tax exemption for all employer-paid postsecondary expenses should be restored and a partnership should be formed between the public and the private sectors to provide adequate financial aid to dislocated workers. Economically disadvantaged students who want to attend college must compete for the same aid with other economically disadvantaged students who want to attend vocational schools. Those funds should be better targeted by setting different award and loan schedules for students in collegiate and vocational programs; limiting the eligibility of students who do not have a high school diploma or equivalent; and removing students without a high school degree from the postsecondary student aid programs and placing them in vocational training programs of the Departments of  Education and Labor. Changes should be made in calculating family income to offset &quot;middle class creep&quot; in programs originally intended to help economically disadvantaged students. (10 references) (CML)",

In all probability, however, any distortion between investment in human and physical capital is quantitatively small. This suggests that distortions among different types of education and training under the personal tax code are more important. Under the corporate tax code, human capital and research and development might be favored over investment in physical capital within the firm. However, because firms have little incentive to train their workers for new jobs outside the firm, the distinction between current job and noncurrent job is also  relevant in the corporate tax analysis. The current tax code requires firms to treat differently their costs for physical and capital investments, investment in research and development, and human capital development. If it is administratively not possible to amortize the costs of human capital development against future earnings, at least they should be treated comparably with research and development costs. Under the personal income tax code, all investments in education should be immediately and fully deductible by individuals against the current wages and salary of the trainee. They should be deducted on Schedule A of the federal income tax form rather than be subject to a 2 percent expenditure floor. The deduction should be phased out with higher total reported income and allowable  against earned income only. (The document contains 36 references.) (CML)",

        "description":"Except for the increasing labor force shares of youth in the early 1970s, the impact of the changing age and sex composition of the labor force did not make a significant contribution to rising unemployment rates between 1969 and 1982. When compared to the recoveries over that period, however, the current recovery is marked by a significant impact of the changing shares of different age groups, especially the declining share of teenagers. In general, the movement of the baby-boom cohort into prime age groups with their relatively lower rates of unemployment has tended to decrease the natural rate of unemployment. During 1969-88, the average level of educational attainment has increased. Job loss was the dominant reason for unemployment from 1962 to 1988. Although there was a  dramatic decrease in the labor force share of the manufacturing sector and a relative increase in the service-producing sector, industry decomposition of the labor force suggests these shifts did not have a significant impact on the secularly rising unemployment rates between 1969 and 1982. Across that period there was a dramatic increase in the proportion of individuals who are long-term unemployed, an increase that has not been reversed by the current upward trend. That increase has been due to increased representation of 25- to 44-year-old males and people who have lost jobs. No single industry has experienced disproportionate gains or losses in its share of total long-term unemployment. Unemployment may be reduced by increasing aggregate demand through fiscal policy, increasing  investments in education and training, improving information on job availability and persistence, and increasing the flexible use of labor within firms.

        "description":"Regardless of the techniques, model specifications, time periods, and data sets used, studies on the effects of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits on the duration of unemployment of individuals all indicate that UI prolongs spells of unemployment and lowers employment among its recipients. Unfortunately, the magnitudes of these estimated effects vary more than one would like. The single best estimate is that a 20 percent rise in weekly benefit amount for a UI claimant with a wage replacement ratio of 0.5 would increase the duration of his or her spell of unemployment by about a week. Another source of work disincentives is the maximum potential duration of UI benefits. Given the range of estimates in the literature, a best guess is that an additional week of duration increases  a spell of unemployment by no more than 0.5 weeks. The evidence thus far shows that benefits extended beyond the exhaustion of regular UI benefits has very small negative effects on employment. One can find no compelling evidence in support of the proposition that UI increases wages by providing time for better job matches to be made and that, therefore, UI increases job stability. However, those effects may exist. They may simply have not been measured yet, due to significant data problems. Virtually all the studies on the effects of UI are limited in that they are not experimental. Future studies should include examination of the effects of UI on post-unemployment earnings, on the quality of post-unemployment job matches, and on job search intensity.

        "description":"Legislated and administrative changes in the unemployment insurance system during the 1980s probably reduced the program's detrimental effects on labor market efficiency. They did so without changing the nature of the federal-state relationship that makes the program so unusual. Regrettably, though, they hurt the labor market status of low-wage workers by greatly increasing the negative impact of unemployment insurance taxes on the demand for their labor. This inequitable and socially dangerous side effect of an otherwise desirable idea can be reversed if the following policy changes are adopted: (1) increase the Federal Unemployment Tax Act tax base in any year to equal the national average annual wage 2 years earlier; (2) increase maximum state unemployment insurance tax rates  if the preceding proposed change is adopted; (3) require that minimum state unemployment insurance tax rates be zero; (4) require interest charges and payments on employers' accounts; (5) require states to limit noncharged benefits to a small fraction of total benefits; and (6) provide more federal assistance to states that institute short-time compensation and otherwise encourage such programs through the Federal Unemployment Tax Act in order to induce employers to rely more on work-sharing and less on layoffs. The adoptions of these policy changes would, in addition, provide employers with increased incentives to spread work around rather than lay off employees, resulting in smaller employment fluctuations and a lower unemployment rate.

        "description":"Studies show that the most frequently used public or private job search method among job seekers is checking with friends and relatives. This method also generates the most accepted jobs. Direct applications without referral and newspaper ads are also used relatively frequently. Less-skilled employees and minorities use the U.S. Employment Service (USES) more frequently than other groups, but even for these groups, only small fractions of all jobs found are accounted for by the USES. For employers, referrals from current employees and direct walk-ins are the most frequently used recruitment methods, and they generate the most hires. Again, the USES accounts for a very small fraction of those hired. The data clearly suggest that informal search methods are least costly and most  effective for most employers and employees. It is also clear that minorities, women, and perhaps youth are disadvantaged when using the informal mechanisms. No specific reforms of the USES are endorsed. Options might be to strengthen other public mechanisms, such as school placement offices, by increasing the flow of information about local and national labor markets to these offices. However, this would provide no benefits to dropouts. Special instruction on the informal job search process (the writing of resumes and applications, the seeking of referrals, the interview process) in schools and training programs might be useful.

Policy alternatives include maintaining the status quo; withdrawing from public responsibility for labor-exchange services; giving up state control in the management of  labor-exchange responsibilities; abandoning federal oversight of the management of labor-exchange functions; and adopting a hybrid approach that uses market incentives to achieve efficiencies akin to good business practices, but that retains public responsibility for defining appropriate system goals and performance standards. The last option seems best and may include decentralizing through providing block grants to states, offering states competitive grants for innovative practices, and establishing a National Center for Employment Service Training and Research.

        "description":"The recent decline in the labor force participation rates of older Americans is well known and well documented. Dramatic changes in male participation rates occurred between 1968 and 1986. Declines were substantial as early as age 55 and as late as age 70. The trends for older women were much less dramatic. In 1988, nearly half of employed men and more than half of employed women aged 65 and over were working part time, voluntarily, compared to about 6 percent of men and 23 percent of women less than 65. Older workers were more likely to be self-employed than were members of any other age group. Determinants of the retirement decision included economic incentives, health, and labor market obstacles. Mandatory retirement has virtually been eliminated. Social security amendments  will delay the age of eligibility for full retirement benefits to 67. These changes should work to increase the labor force participation of older workers, although recent research suggested that the impact will be modest. Little is known about how employer pension plans will change in response to social security rule changes. Surveys suggested that many older workers would like to retire gradually, although currently only a minority do. Policies that facilitate gradual retirement by making it less costly for firms to hire part-time workers and less costly for older workers to accept part-time employment should be considered.

The paper recommends the following: (1) place more emphasis on assistance to disadvantaged men; (2) expand and strengthen job training programs for males and focus additional Job Training Partnership Act resources on the most disadvantaged males; (3) strengthen the training opportunities in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Unemployed Parent program, which affects males and which will be mandated in all states by 1990 under the provisions of the Family Support Act of 1988; and  (4) strengthen the training opportunities for men receiving benefits in the Food Stamp Program, the only universal transfer program in the United States.

However, the Social Security Administration surveys indicated that in 1966 and 1978, about 17 percent of the population considered themselves as having some degree of work disability. Severe work disability increased from 6 percent in 1966 to 8.6 percent in 1978. In 1966, 19.2 percent of the severely disabled reported being in the labor force; in 1978, this proportion had decreased to 13.6 percent. The U.S. disability system consists of a social security track, complete with medical care and limited rehabilitation services; a public assistance track, also with medical care and rehabilitation services; a work injury track; special tracks for  veterans; and a private sector track. Laws that alter minimum standards of employment, that set aside money or jobs, and that attempt to guarantee employment also characterize the system. Rising disability benefit rates lower labor force participation rates. Studies indicate that the vocational rehabilitation program has an impact on some clients, but studies need to be extended. The United States has developed a costly and reasonably adequate system of income benefits for the disabled. It is time to give more thought to the adequacy of rehabilitation efforts, with the full realization that rehabilitation, like any complex social goal, cannot simply be mandated into existence.

In 1976, 40 percent of the mothers of preschoolers were employed, compared to 58 percent in 1987. In 1988, 53 percent of women with children under 3 years held jobs. Sixty percent of the men in the labor force are married to women who also hold jobs. Between 1970 and 1985, the number of one-parent families more than doubled. Between 1970 and 1984, the fraction of poor people living in mother-only, nonelderly families climbed from 34 to 43 percent. Of single mothers with children under 6 years, 53 percent are in the labor force. Two-thirds of employed women are either the sole support of their families or married to men who earn less than $15,000 a year. Surveys  indicate that 20 to 30 percent of employees of Fortune 500 companies care for elderly parents on a regular basis. Child care is difficult to find and obtain and is expensive. Parents are forced to put together a patchwork system that tends to fall apart. The effect of maternal employment on young children depends on the attitudes of the mother and father about working, job stress, other family stress, and the quality of the child care children receive. The quality of child care can have a lasting impact on children's development, most strongly affecting children's social development, scholastic achievement, and motivation as learners.

These groups will soon comprise 22 percent of the labor market and will be expected to take over positions requiring increased skill levels, but for generations they have been hindered in acquiring necessary skills. Barriers to employment faced by ethnic minority groups, particularly families in poverty and young adults, are discrimination, restriction to occupations that are below their skill levels, the persistence of poverty, and dropping out of school. Approaches that may help in obtaining education and work skills include saturation selection and training; emphasis on small groups rather than individuals; mentoring;  alliances among schools, homes, and training programs; and internship programs. Efforts must be made to increase the involvement of parents and extended family members, along with the child, to increase the achievements of school children. Well-funded preschool programs that involve children and their caretakers are needed, beginning with the mother's pregnancy. Welfare availability contributes only about 10-14 percent to the existence and growth of single parents and poverty. Limited economic opportunities of black and Hispanic males prevent marriage. The majority of single mothers have been previously married. Adolescent pregnancy is now declining among blacks and increasing among whites, although early pregnancies are a continuing problem in all communities.

        "description":"Occupational sex segregation is one of the most obvious facts of economic life. The largest declines in the sex segregation index between 1970 and 1980 were in the managerial and professional specialty and in the service occupations. Changes were greater for white-collar than blue-collar occupations for both white and minority women. White women reduced their entry into a number of traditionally female white-collar occupations that minority women, leaving private household work, continued to enter. It has been easier to pass laws mandating equal opportunity and affirmative action than to eliminate institutional and informal obstacles, such as sexual harassment or coworker hostility, outmoded administrative rules and procedures by employers and unions, and gender-tracked  promotional ladders. There has been some growth in the number of women training for and entering higher-status, skilled blue-collar crafts. There are more women apprentices than women currently employed in the occupations. In construction, federally-mandated goals and timetables established in 1978 have led to increases in women employees, although enforcement efforts have been lax since 198l. In 1978, over 150 programs were able to recruit and train women for apprenticeships; only 50 remain after training and enforcement cutbacks. Federal training programs are doing relatively little to recruit and place women into nontraditional jobs; however, funding under the Perkins Vocational Education Act has been crucial to sustaining the successful community-based preapprenticeship training  programs.

Employers can reduce family-related absences by providing on-site child care and referral services, improving the quality and reliability of community child care centers, or increasing parents' ability to afford better care. Allowing sick leave for family reasons does not reduce absenteeism, but it does reduce the tension associated with having to lie about the reason. There is evidence to suggest that these absences do not necessarily translate into lower productivity. Recommendations relating to the complicated relationship between work and family include: better measures, research tools, and methodologies; more pooling of firms' anonymous needs assessments;  analysis of on-site centers' sick policies; research on parents who work nonstandard hours; work-family conflicts of welfare women with young children; and on the effects of work-family issues within different industries, different size companies, different regions of the country, and different income groups; and a mechanism for translating and disseminating this research to companies.

        "description":"While analysts debate the shortage of child care, the efforts of several major corporations, including I.B.M. Corporation, Bank of America, and Mervyn's Department Stores, are spending millions of dollars trying to recruit and train new child care providers. Nearly half of all children in child care are in family day care homes. Millions of dollars have been put into communities around the country to stimulate the supply of child care. Resource and referral (R&R) centers have had considerable success in coordinating efforts. Although day care centers serve more children and tend to last longer, family day care homes can be established at a significantly lower cost. Employers involved in R&R services find that family day care recruitment can increase the success and value of the  referral effort and ultimately satisfy a larger number of employees. Recommendations include increasing the number of sponsored or coordinated family day care homes; streamlining reporting requirements; and addressing affordability and supply at the same time.

        "author":["Blank, Rebecca M."],
        "description":"Part-time work is a significant aspect of the U.S. labor market, and the number of part-time jobs has increased from 6 million in 1955 to 19 million in 1987. Part-time work is done by a very diverse range of workers, particularly teenagers, older workers, and women with children. Consequently, it is probably not useful to think about the part-time labor market as a single group of workers. The available evidence indicates that most employers think of part-time workers as nonpromotable workers who solve particular scheduling and peak-demand problems within the firm. However, there is increasing evidence of a growing awareness that there may be other types of part-time workers and other types of part-time jobs. Part-time workers in professional and managerial occupations appear to  be at least as well paid as their full-time fellow workers. The growing number of women who seek part-time work on a temporary basis during their child-rearing years may lead to a growing number of professional part-time jobs and some reconceptualization of part-time work and part-time workers. Ongoing growth is forecast in the service, retail, and financial industries, which are areas with a lot of part-time slots. Most of the part-time jobs opening up will be the more traditional lower-skill, noncareer-path type. Useful research projects would include those on (1) the relationship between part-time jobs and fringe benefit programs; (2) the reasons people seek part-time work; (3) the impact of part-time work on the well-being of households; and (5) the labor market implications resulting  from the demands of women who are predominantly full-time and long-time workers for part-time jobs at certain points in their life.

        "description":"The policy options offered in the literature concerning temporary work address two major concerns: (1) the conditions of temporary work itself; and (2) the elimination of fulltime jobs, or lack of growth, and their replacement by temporary work. Both temporary help firms and the organizations that use temporary help should be required to report on the number, type, and duration of temporary help assignments. The quantity of temporary work could be regulated more directly, much as home work is done in some industries. The number of temporary workers could be limited to a proportion of the employer's work force in the regular payroll. In order to improve the quality of work life and worker morale, temporary workers should be included in bargaining units at their client employers,  they should be covered by collective agreements already in place, unemployment insurance coverage should be improved for temporary workers, and client employers could be required to give temporary employees automatic access to their benefits after a certain period of time. One alternative to relying on temporary workers may be employers' increased reliance on overtime for secretarial and clerical jobs. It would be useful for employers to keep in mind that little about work arrangements is technologically determined, but much is determined by custom and tradition that require careful scrutiny.

Alternative work schedules include part-time work, job sharing, work sharing, shiftwork, compressed work week, flexitime, and flexiplace. Flexitime is the most prevalent full-time flexible schedule and is second in prevalence only to part-time work among all flexible work schedules. Its prevalence in the workplace continues to increase steadily. Research studies on the effects of flexitime schedules have not proven very definitive because of design problems. They do suggest that in many work situations both the organization and the individual worker can gain from this arrangement. Unresolved issues involving flexitime include occupational constraints, the  reluctance of supervisors, legal constraints, and union resistance.

        "description":"The issue of combining careers and child rearing has come into public consciousness because so many more women with children now work. This means that there are many more families where both parents work. Women are voicing a growing sense of disillusionment regarding earnings, occupational segregation, child care difficulties, and performing two full-time jobs. They are dropping out of promising careers and starting their own businesses. Barriers to combining career and child rearing include standard business practices, such as the lack of schedule flexibility; entry barriers, such as finding child care; and hours of work. The average employed married woman with children works the equivalent of more than two full-time jobs. Men are experiencing the tradeoffs of combining career  and child rearing at an increasing rate, but still significantly less than their spouses. If women cannot participate in the labor force to their fullest capacity, the marketplace is deprived of some of its most productive workers. Fertility in the United States has declined dramatically. Given the demands of careers and the costs of children to careers, many women and men appear to be making an explicit choice between career and child rearing. Policy implications for dependent care, employer flexibility, and management sensitivity are discussed; a research agenda is identified; and 39 references are included. (CML)",

        "description":"This study of the potential labor market consequences of government mandating of employee benefits suggests that mandating benefits will increase benefit coverage and generosity for insurance coverage will not be helped; even when mandating benefits does improve benefit provision, there will be other offsetting effects, including wage and other benefit cuts, reduced work hours, reduced employment, and possible output reductions; and employer bias against workers who are particularly expensive to insure may also result. A variable cost format where benefits accrue according to hours worked somewhat mitigates the drawback of raising labor costs for low-wage workers and is more responsive to worker and firm differences in the demand for benefits. Any tax incentives should be paired  with a cap on the overall fraction of payroll that can be used for tax-shielded employee benefit contributions in order to make the tax and benefit systems more equitable as a whole. If benefits are to be mandated, each element of a target mandated benefit package should be ranked in a priority list and justified on both efficiency and equity grounds. A separate approach should be designed to meet the needs of those not covered by employer-provided benefit programs. (73 references) (CML)",

        "description":"Employee ownership through employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) was first mentioned in federal legislation in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973. Since then, at least 19 pieces of federal legislation have been enacted that deal with employee ownership in some way, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and tax legislation. Among the results of such legislation have been the slight broadening of the holding of stock, the provision of an important employee benefit, and the ability of entrepreneurs to manage financial needs. These benefits have come without decreases in company performance, but there is evidence that increased performance is possible if ownership is coupled with participative decision making. To encourage employee ownership, the  U.S. Department of Labor should (1) support the formation of state-level organizations to facilitate employee ownership and to help implement the necessary changes in labor relations; (2) make available information on Internal Revenue Form 5500C so researchers can study whether companies use employee ownership to replace pension plans or offer it as simply an additional benefit; and (3) develop a simplified ESOP document. Securities and Exchange regulations should give employee shareholders the same rights held by bondholders in firms of 500 or more employees. (53 references) (CML)",

It is now time to move beyond the experimental stage. The following four interrelated policy initiatives should guide public efforts to promote diffusion and institutionalization of workplace innovations: (1) establish a national database for measuring the diffusion of innovative practices and evaluating their economic and social consequences; (2) update labor law to remove the barriers to labor-management cooperation and innovations; (3) integrate support for workplace innovations with broader human resource, labor market, and economic policies; and (4) provide the  political leadership needed to produce a positive climate within which innovative labor management relations can flourish. These initiatives are necessary because there is no reliable estimate of the extent to which employee participation or work redesign principles have diffused across the U.S. work force; growing evidence indicates that current law is undermining workers' and union representatives' confidence in the fairness of the law and heightening labor-management tensions; and diffusion is not likely to occur without strong national leadership and the commitment of financial resources to build support for the innovations.

In almost no cases does participation make things worse. Sustained long-term improvements in performance occur only when (1) participative groups are given the information and authority to make substantial changes in the workplace; (2) supervisory behavior is altered so that formal participation is consistent with the way things are usually done; (3)  workers and managers are rewarded for increased responsibility and productivity; (4) job security and guarantees of individual rights make workers feel free to participate; and (5) employees believe that participation is not merely a means of speed-up or a threat to their jobs or union. The government should subsidize research and demonstration projects, introduce participation within federal agencies, and revise the National Labor Relations Act to make it clear that participation programs are legal in both union and nonunion settings, as long as their purpose is neither to bypass nor to avoid unions.

        "description":"This study of available evidence on cooperative union-management efforts to solve employment problems indicates that roughly one-half of the larger unionized manufacturing facilities have embarked on cooperative efforts. Thus, larger firms have already made the decision to cooperate or not, and targeting government money to them to encourage cooperation would not be beneficial. The limited available evidence suggests that government assistance could make a difference by helping smaller organizations decide to cooperate and by helping them in the initial implementation of cooperative efforts. Few cooperative efforts enlist or encompass a majority of employees. The key to the success and longevity of cooperative efforts is finding mechanisms or processes by which the parties can  juxtapose relative power activities and cooperative activities. The overriding policy implication is that any government assistance should be focused on helping private parties make the transition from experimentation to institutionalization. The Department of Labor should commit $500,000 to support rigorous studies and coordinate dissemination of their findings through the Bureau of Labor and Management Relations. The findings can be further disseminated through seminars and more effective use of areawide labor-management committees. (The document contains 2 figures, 5 tables, and 84 references.) (CML)",

        "author":["Woodbury, Stephen A."],
        "description":"A multitude of public policy issues currently surround the tax treatment of employee benefits, particularly since the tax-favored status of employer contributions to pensions and health insurance has been blamed for a shrinking tax base that has exacerbated the federal budget deficit, an inefficient and bloated health-care sector, overinsurance by many recipients of employer-provided health insurance, rising health care costs, and a tax system made more regressive because those who receive tax-favored employee benefits tend to be in higher-income households than those who do not. A relatively low cap on health insurance contributions--perhaps at an employer contribution of $1,125 annually--would improve efficiency and has at least five points in its favor: (1) it partially  addresses the problems of rising health care, overuse of the system, and an inefficiently large health-care sector; (2) it addresses the concern that the tax base will continue to be eroded as health care costs rise and as employer contributions increase; (3) it would not limit or reduce access to basic health care by currently or potentially insurable workers; (4) it would imply an improvement in the equity of the tax system; and (5) it would not foreclose the option of mandating health insurance benefits. (The document contains 85 references, 11 tables, 1 figure, and appendices that discuss data problems in research on employee benefits and review recent studies of the tax treatment of employee benefits.)

        "author":["Rudner, Lawrence M."],
        "description":"Although frequently attacked as invalid, demeaning, biased, illegal, and irrelevant, preemployment testing procedures appear to be increasing in popularity. Many prominent companies and organizations are making extensive use of tests. Part of the resurgence of testing is attributable to clearer definitions of acceptable practice. Legal precedents and federal and professional guidelines help both the test developer and its users. Under the right conditions, preemployment testing can vastly improve corporate productivity, but there is little evidence to indicate that companies can properly implement a testing program or evaluate its effectiveness. Tests should only be used to enhance an employment decision, not to replace professional judgment in making decisions. The utility of a  testing program can be estimated as a function of three factors: (1) the predictive validity of the test; (2) the selection ratio; and (3) the base rate. Issues in testing include bias, legal rulings, validity generalization, exaggerated expectations, test quality, misuse of tests, publishers' claims, alternative assessment techniques, and the use of honesty tests. The paper concludes with recommendations to business and to the Department of Labor. A 50-item reference list is included. (CML)",

        "description":"In the mid-1960s, as part of the &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; the armed services accepted up to 100,000 personnel per year who would have been rejected had not standards for reading and mathematics abilities been lowered. Over 80 percent of these persons completed their tour of duty and more than 90 percent were rated above average in their service. An error in test norming in the late 1970s permitted the enlistment of almost 360,000 young men with aptitude test scores below the minimum standards of the time. These enlistees, on the whole, performed satisfactorily. The military used four strategies with the lower ability recruits: limited assignments, provision of extra help and time, revision of training courses, and establishment of special training units. The military provided functional  context literacy training through FLIT: The Functional Literacy Program; FLING: Functional Literacy for the National Guard; and JORP: Job-Oriented Reading Program. Other functional context training efforts include electronics technician's training sponsored by the Ford Foundation, functional context education workshops, technology transfer in the job skills education program (JSEP), and the McGraw-Hill functional context basic skills project. The paper concludes with implications for human resources development policy and practice. Three figures, 2 data tables, and 25 references are included. (CML)",

        "author":["Cappelli, H. Peter"],
        "description":"Relatively little is known about how unions affect employers because of a lack of data and research at the level of the firm. The little evidence available suggests that the effects are complex and go well beyond the effects associated with higher wages. In particular, a better understanding of the role that unions play in providing training and greater attachment to the employer is needed. To the extent that public policy decisions make it more difficult for unions to organize employees, they reduce the competition that nonunion employers feel and reduce the incentives for these firms to maintain good human resource practices. Public policy decisions that make it more difficult for unions that provide extensive training, such as in the skilled trades, to retain their members may  eventually make it impossible for those unions to provide training because they will be unable to recoup the costs through dues. Recommendations include (1) research at the firm level that will investigate the mechanisms through which union coverage affects the management of workers and the behavior of the organization as a whole; (2) consideration of costs in policy decision making; (3) unions as active partners in government training programs, especially for displaced workers; (4) where unions represent occupations where skills are general and employers therefore have no incentive to provide training, encouragement of union participation in training and more government training grants for that purpose.

          "Stacey, Nevzer"],
        "description":"A study of the training opportunities of high school graduates (about 825,000 in 1988) who work immediately after leaving school identified which members of that group get trained, by whom, and with what earnings consequences, based on the experiences of a sample of graduates from their graduation in 1972 until 1986. The following are among the findings: (1) employer-provided training is not an alternative to formal education for acquiring productive skills because work-bound youth receive less training than either non-degree participants or college-bound youth; (2) work-bound youth who receive employer-provided training have substantially higher earnings than those who do not; (3) the public sector employs a much smaller percentage of work-bound youth than does the private  sector but is more likely to educate or train them; (4) men and women in the private sector are likely to report equal participation in training, but women report the duration of their training to be only three-fourths or one-half that of men's; and (5) public sector women are less likely to participate in training than public sector men. Altering public or private policy to correct these inequities is not recommended. Before taking a corrective step, policy makers should decide whether additional training would improve the productivity of work-bound youth, whether it is possible to design training programs to compensate for their educational deficiencies, and how can strategies be developed to optimize female employees' productivity with the restraints they have as primary caretakers of  children.

Among the findings were the following: there was little evidence of targeting services to those with the greatest need; services to out-of-school youth were occupational training for 53 percent of the group, nonoccupational training for 26 percent, and job search assistance only for 21 percent; black male high school graduates were about two-thirds  more likely than white male high school graduates to receive job search assistance only and about half as likely to receive training for moderate or higher skill occupations; a similar pattern was found between white and black females, although the differences were not generally as great as for males; the proportions of Hispanics receiving various services were roughly similar to the proportions of whites receiving those services; out-of-school youth often received longer on-the-job training for lower skill jobs than the maximum typically needed for such positions; and over three-fourths of out-of-school youth achieved positive outcomes upon termination from JTPA, with nearly two-thirds placed in jobs and 13 percent in other positive situations such as entering the armed forces, an  apprenticeship program, or other schooling.

Following an executive summary, the document's first section addresses the need for strategic planning caused by new economic realities such as the perception that knowledge is the premier wealth-producing asset; inefficient labor markets; poor program coordination; and a limited response from the U.S. government. The second section covers public sector strategic planning. It recommends a framework that includes the following: a vision of what a work force readiness  system should be; a decision-making structure to carry out the strategic vision; the coordination of programs across various functional areas and levels of government; new program initiatives to respond to unmet needs; and methods of evaluating the performance of all components of the human resources system in relation to the state's vision. The third section discusses New Jersey's state strategic plan and the strategic planning efforts of Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, North Dakota, and Washington. The fourth section discusses how to overcome barriers to strategic planning and the importance of long-term commitments from policy makers in the public and private sectors. A 33-item bibliography concludes the document. (CML)",

        "title":"On Defining Literacy.",
        "author":["Sherritt, Caroline A."],
        "description":"Defining literacy is a compelling challenge to educators. They generally use three models: instrumental, functional, and empowerment. The latter two approaches, which were increasingly evident in the 1980s, identify literacy by the social functions required in a given context or by the qualities needed for illiterate people to take control of their lives. A functional definition of literacy is particularly suited to adult education in the United States for the following reasons: (1) a functional approach is capable of encompassing all of the various roles adult education encompasses; (2) self-improvement as an end in itself pervades adult education; (3) development of the individual is integral to a democratic society; and (4) adult education is a creation of the middle classes,  which are most likely to embrace a vision of education as a means to upward mobility. The argument for literacy as a means of social and political empowerment reflects the tendency of adult educators to embrace educational objectives from the humanist, radical, and socialist continuum. However, although adult educators espouse literacy for empowerment, they have not been able to translate this mission into an operational definition. A functional approach leads inevitably to programs that teach students to fill out employment applications, read road signs, plan menus, and avoid poisonous substances provided they are so labeled. This approach channels resources into the lowest strata of illiterate subcultures because that is all it can do. The concept of empowerment is subjective: one  person's empowerment is another person's impediment. The most educators can hope for is consensus on principle because a unified operational approach is not possible in a pluralistic society. Even if everyone agreed immediately on a definition of literacy, it would not begin to make a significant impact upon the problem of illiteracy in the world today.

K-12 school systems overseas and in the United States make it possible for children to attend school around the world. Voluntary Education programs generate nearly 700,000 undergraduate and graduate-level college enrollments by military services members taking courses on their own time. Through an extensive network of institutions, classroom education is delivered to more than 475 installations around the world. The Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) program allows members to earn college credits for college-level learning that takes place outside the classroom. High school completion programs, functional/basic skills, English as a second language,  and vocational/professional certification examinations are provided. The Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program of Army, Navy, and Air Force units at over 500 public and private colleges and universities produces a majority of the commissioned officers for the military services. The Military Service Academies offer 4-year college programs leading to a Bachelor of Science degree. The Professional Development Education program includes study at civilian and military institutions for senior enlisted members and officers encompassing broad professional goals in such areas as military science, engineering, health sciences, and management.

VESL programs provide not only the language input needed for learning specific job tasks but also address the sociocultural skills of language needed to negotiate in today's workplace. The demand for more specialized programs in the workplace has opened a new direction for VESL in this decade. VESL programs have been successful in providing functional language experiences in the classrooms or in training centers. Presently, there is a need to move beyond the training center and into the work site where functional language related to specific job tasks can be taught in the context of, rather than alongside, company training programs.  VESL programs that work must consider four basic principles: (1) they must be employee centered; (2) they must include continued instruction in all four language skills (reading, writing, speaking, and listening); (3) they must integrate language use and company training concepts; and (4) they must be cost effective. VESL programs that work are dynamic. They must be flexible to meet the needs of each group of workers, and they can produce workers capable of meeting the demands of the English language on the job.

        "description":"This book examines in detail the impact of tiered compensation structures on unions, employers, and employees. (Tiered compensation structures are defined as pay systems in which employees who start working or change jobs in a company after a certain date receive a lower rate of pay than employees who were doing the same or similar jobs before that date.) Chapters 1 and 2 introduce tiers and describe their role in the United States industrial relations system. Chapter 3 includes a detailed discussion of labor-management relations in the retail food industry and the competitive pressures that led to the implementation of tiers. Chapter 4 discusses the historical and environmental factors that led to the implementation and maintenance of tiers at Mayway Food Market Company.  Employees at the Mayway Company (a fictitious name) were surveyed. Chapter 5 describes the sample and the methodology used in the survey. Both Chapter 6 (which examines the research questions) and chapter 7 (which examines the hypotheses) concern the perceptions of rank-and-file employees at Mayway and build upon the previous research and literature on tiers. The final chapter advances five propositions that appear generalizable to other mature tiered employment settings. It also examines the relative costs and benefits of maintaining tiers at Mayway and the generalizability of the Mayway experience and concludes with a perspective on the future of tiers. Appendices contain survey items and response formats, scales used, and a brief discussion of tiers and store productivity. A 153-item  bibliography and an index conclude the volume. (KC)",

Students were expected to prepare for the televised lectures by reading and reflecting on specific topics identified in specially prepared course guides. Mailed questionnaires were used to evaluate the courses. The study reported the following strengths attributed to the televised courses: (1) the televised courses have increased access to university education in rural Saskatchewan; (2) it appears that the mode of delivery has the potential to provide a viable alternative to on-campus university study for both young rural people and part-time adult students; (3)  the TV lecturers were excellent teachers and were considered by the students to be a major asset in this delivery mode; and (4) the students were given clear instructions as to what to expect from the course by the instructors, the course guide, and the facilitators. The following limitations were reported: (1) students in all three courses felt that the feedback about their performance in assignments could be improved; (2) some students expressed concern about some subject matter and organizational inconsistencies that they found irritating and time-consuming; (3) several sites experienced persistent problems with television reception; and (4) despite the overall positive reaction to he televised courses, some students said they thought the could learn better with a face-to-face  instructor.

The report covers the seven workshop themes: empowering language; addressing sexism; integrating adults with disabilities; furthering cross-cultural communication; understanding illiteracy and poverty; challenging racism; and advocating mother tongue instruction.

Limitations of the study include the fact that methods for determining student learning varied among the sites, and pre- and posttest data were not always available. The following results are reported: (1) tutors and teachers were enthusiastic about the manual as a tool for helping to  teach low-level literacy students; (2) almost all instructors limited their teaching to the word processing templates, with very few students attempting database templates and no one using spreadsheets or graphics; (3) students were highly motivated by using the computer and reported that the templates helped them improve their reading and writing; (4) students at all reading levels learned computer skills by using the templates; and (5) there was evidence at all sites that having an opportunity to work with computers was very desirable and a motivating force in recruiting students as well as tutors. (The document contains three case studies, interview guides, a reporting form, questionnaires, and photocopies of photographs showing the manual being used.) (CML)",

        "description":"A 6-month study examined the attitudes of older, low-literate adults toward using computers to learn to read and tried to determine the effectiveness of Penn State Adult Literacy Courseware for beginning readers with older, low-literate adults at a community-based senior center. The students were 10 black adults, aged 66 to 86 and educated at the 2nd- to 11th-grade level. They were tutored by 10 females, 8 of whom were black, who ranged in age from 64 to 72. All tutors were educated at the secondary level or beyond, seven of them had tutored before, and three said that they had had some experience using computers. The Attitudes toward Computers for Reading Instruction questionnaire and the Slosson Oral Reading Test (SORT) were used as pre- and posttests. The tutors were trained  in the courseware before working with the students. The range of actual instructional hours was 6 to 19, and only 7 tutor-student pairs were active at the end of the study. No strong conclusions about the effectiveness of the courseware and the attitudes of the students can be made, due to the absence of a control group and the small sample size. Gains on the SORT occurred for all but two of the seven students. The mean gain was 2 months. Overall, changes in the students' attitudes toward computer-assisted reading were in a positive direction. (CML)",

        "description":"A study examined the use of the Penn State Adult Literacy Courseware, which teaches sight vocabulary to beginning adult readers, in a volunteer tutoring situation with three male and two female unemployed adults whose average grade level in reading was 1.1. All students were white, their average age was 37, and the highest grade any of them had completed in school was the 10th. The five tutors were all female and received 14 hours of training on the use of the courseware before giving 20 hours of tutoring. Pre- and posttest measurements were taken with the Slosson Oral Reading Test (SORT), an attitude survey of tutors and students concerning the use of computers, and two sections of the Baltimore County Design, which measured how well the students could identify words in  isolation and in context. Limitations of the study include the small number of subjects (N=9) and the fact that there was no control group, so the results cannot be considered statistically significant. Analysis of the pre- and posttest results showed positive gains on all three measurement instruments. The average reading grade level had risen to 1.76 after only 20 hours of instruction, as compared with a minimum 25 hours that traditional programs take to make comparable gains. Students increased their positive attitudes about computers. Starting with less positive attitudes, the tutors also increased their positive feelings. However, no tutors indicated they would prefer the computer over any other method. (The document includes results of a tutor survey on how the courseware could  better serve the needs of displaced workers and on the role of the tutor, as well as a 13-item bibliography.) (CML)",

The document begins with a glossary and responses to questions regarding how illiteracy affects adults, how literacy services can help illiterate adults, and why public libraries should become involved in adult literacy. The next section defines literacy, describes adult literacy services available in libraries, and predicts future trends of library involvement. Literacy program  planning is taken up next, including needs assessment, setting goals and objectives, financing and fund raising, writing proposals, program management, public relations, and program evaluation. The next section outlines several options for library involvement, including providing facilities and equipment, acting as advocates for adult literacy programs, referring potential tutors and students to other literacy providers, managing and developing portions of the collections that are of use to tutors and students in adult programs, and developing library-based literacy programs. The next section describes the keys to program success as commitment, program planning, communication, and cooperation-collaboration. The document concludes with a list of resources containing the names and addresses  of Pennsylvania and national organizations, newsletters, and clearinghouses, a 49-item bibliography, a fact sheet about adult literacy in Pennsylvania, and a list of questions asked of librarians in the preparation of this manual.

A document was issued as a follow-up to an earlier meeting on the importance of the revitalization of social dialog. The Joint Opinion on Training and Education can be viewed on two separate planes: first, it sets out and expresses the progress achieved in forming a view shared by the social partners in regard to the general principles concerning education and training and their importance for a united Europe; and second, it defines common guidelines to be adopted by European  management and labor in promoting quality in education and training systems. The Joint Opinion stresses the importance of both basic training and retraining in order to equip participants with qualifications recognized in the labor market. It also stresses the importance of involving the social partners in the preparation and implementation of various programs of action of the European Community.

        "description":"An evaluation of the New Opportunities for Women (NOW) program in Western Australia was undertaken. Questionnaires were mailed to a stratified random sample of NOW enrollees. Responses were received from 308 women, a 45.7 percent response rate. Findings included the following: 81 percent of NOW students went on either to paid employment or further study; 62 percent of all students who enrolled in a NOW course progressed to further study; 76 percent of students who took all 5 units of the integrated program progressed to further study; NOW facilitated access to further study irrespective of previous educational level; 75 percent of students who undertook further study did so at Technical and Further Education (TAFE) colleges; 57 percent of NOW students found paid employment; and  44 percent participated in volunteer work. However, women's access courses struggled to survive on the margins of TAFE funding arrangements and within an often unsympathetic climate. Lack of services, such as child care, had prevented women from undertaking NOW. Among policy recommendations, the following were included: increasing efforts to provide NOW courses, dropping fees where they had been introduced, providing child care, and expanding courses for women with special needs.

        "description":"A case study of three high schools was conducted as the first phase of a 2-year study of comprehensive high schools' vocational course offerings and how they decide which students should be enrolled in them. The schools are similar in size and grade span and in the same labor market area; they belong to different school districts and serve different student populations. One school serves a racially and socioeconomically diverse group in a naturally integrated neighborhood, the second school serves a mostly middle- to upper middle-class White and Asian population, and the third school serves a student population nearly all Black or Hispanic, with a substantial proportion poor. Other differences in the schools included differences in the type and range of vocational programs,  number of and expectations for the students who take the courses, organization and management style of the schools, morale of faculty and staff, and local traditions or history. At all three schools, the guidance and placement systems seem to concentrate on college-bound and severely troubled students, almost ignoring noncollege-bound, untroubled students. Although each of the schools offers a variety of vocational courses, none has a cohesive, comprehensive vocational program. At all three schools, the perception of vocational education was of poor teachers, poor equipment, poor students, and poor courses. The study concluded that a radical approach to high school reform that would involve a more fundamental reconstruction of the high school curriculum, blurring the distinction between  academic and vocational subjects, should be investigated.

        "description":"A study of the training of the in-company trainer of young people in Ireland was conducted from January through March 1988. Directors of training and the trainers themselves were interviewed in 15 companies. An additional 50 trainers responded to a mailed questionnaire. Trainers were primarily men in their thirties with a background in teaching, personnel work, or a technical area. The competencies trainers need were identified as follows: understanding of basic learning theory, a wide range of instructional techniques, analytical skills to identify the knowledge needed by the trainee and the skill content of the job, understanding of attitude development, program planning skills, record maintenance and monitoring skills, flexibility, and good rapport with trainees. Gaps between  the competencies trainers possess and those they need were identified in all of these areas. The following trends were identified: the need for trainers to develop skills to a high degree; open learning for theoretical training combined with practical &quot;hands on&quot; training; need for a more competitive industrial spirit in Ireland, with training making a vital contribution; and the need for preparation of trainers for new technologies. (Four appendices provide a proposed training program for training managers, data tables, the learning cycle for training, and the questionnaire. A listing of seven definitions of words used in the report is included.) (CML)",

        "description":"This study of the vocational training system in the Federal Republic of Germany was conducted by the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training through site visits, seminars, research papers, and discussion. The study found that the majority of young people in the Federal Republic of Germany (currently 1.8 million) receive their vocational training in the framework of the &quot;dual system.&quot; This term is used to describe the combination of practical and theoretical vocational training at two places of learning with different legal and structural characteristics. The practical part of vocational training takes place in the training company under the supervision of a trainer, whereas the theoretical part is implemented at a vocational school, attendance at which is  compulsory 1 or 2 days per week. Approximately 60,000 teachers and 768,000 in-house trainers are currently providing training. The framework conditions for in-house training are uniform throughout the country and regulated by law. The term &quot;trainer&quot; is defined according to law, with the authorization to recruit and train young people. Authorization for the recruitment and training of trainees is linked to the personal and technical aptitude of persons in the firm. The person responsible for vocational training must be registered with the proper authority, which monitors the personal and technical aptitude of the trainer. Trainers must offer vocational training in a purposeful form and structure it to meet the training objective. Continuing training is required for in-house trainers.  (KC)",

Studies were undertaken to determine the characteristics of dropouts; the consequences of dropping out of school; and associations between dropping out and specific curricula, including the occupational curriculum. Because of methodological problems, some studies were inconclusive or suggested that the occupational education curriculum was more associated with dropping out than were the general or academic curricula. Recently, more carefully controlled studies indicated a positive relationship between involvement in an occupational curriculum and retention of the at-risk student. Studies have identified components of the occupational curriculum most associated with  retention, such as teacher control of curriculum, small class size, individualization, student recognition, external ties, and work experience. Improving the retentive quality of occupational education should include continued encouragement of academic skill acquisition in the occupational education curriculum; encouragement of career exploration and guidance programs and early, relevant introductory occupational education experiences; facilitation of broader student options for enrollment in job-specific training courses by the tenth grade; and provision of appropriate and relevant work-study experiences.

        "description":"The recent frenzy over education--that is, children and schools--has obscured an adult learning crisis that will really put this nation's economy at risk between now and the beginning of the next century. The postindustrial economy demands a new kind of learning enterprise, focused on adults rather than children, on learning rather than education, on technology rather than institutions, and on private competition rather than public administration. Economic security in the postindustrial economy depends less on expertise and more on \"flexpertise\"--the ability continually to adapt individual knowledge and skill. Virtually the entire adult population needs retraining and new learning to be economically productive. Reforms of elementary and secondary education, however justified,  will have little impact on these urgent adult learning needs before the next century. \"More education\" will not solve the human capital crisis. The emergence of a knowledge-based economy requires a new synthesis of the functions of training, education, and other forms of communication and learning under the single umbrella of the \"learning enterprise.\" The major barrier to reforming the current policy framework and creating the kind of learning enterprise needed by a new economy is an appalling lack of timely and accurate information about the entire system of adult learning in the United States. This information must be gathered, education must be made learning centered rather than degree centered, and new technology must be used, in order to meet the economy's growing need for flexible  human capital.

        "description":"A partial survey of the literature on the economics of vocational training reveals three important lessons on how evaluations may be undertaken using data on pay, inputs, and outputs. The first lesson is that social, corporate, and private returns to vocational training in developing countries appear to be high enough to justify expanding training activity. However, training in industrial institutes and vocational secondary schools is less cost-effective than more formal firm-based training, at least in Kenya, India, and Israel. Also, Latin American data indicate that school and formal institutional vocational training may be substituted for one another. The second lesson is that in some sectors a more labor-intensive method of production is economically more effective than  current methods. This may, in turn, imply the need for more--not less--skilled labor and vocational training. Further, given technology and output, unskilled and skilled labor appear to be substitutes, rather than complements, in the production process. The third lesson is that sophisticated function analyses are plagued by statistical and measurement problems. If they are not resolved, estimation techniques are unlikely to be able to pick up any relationship between trained labor and output among firms. However, there are alternatives. Many input and output measures such as performance rating and downtime are available for more modest evaluations. Training can be evaluated using earnings data or output and input data. In all cases, there are technical problems including sample size,  control groups, the use of longitudinal data, and difficulties caused by labor mobility. A simpler before/after plant level study of changes in inputs or output associated with training may offer the most tractable evaluation. (112 references.) (Author/CML)",

Open institutions using distance teaching methods have a special responsibility to ensure that prospective students are not set up for failure by the promise of accessibility and flexibility. Athabasca University in Edmonton, Ontario, Canada, tries to meet this responsibility by supplying a range of preadmission services that can be delivered through a variety of modes to prospective and new students. These services include: (1) information; (2) orientation; and (3) a self-assessment questionnaire to help students  or prospective students determine their reasons for returning to study and the commitment they can make to it. Evaluation of preadmission services is ongoing to ensure that they are meeting student needs. For the future, Athabasca University will attempt to improve preadmission services through increasing accessibility, using new technologies, and taking a more integrated approach. (KC)",

        "description":"This document is an overview of the status and problems of secondary technology education as it is now implemented in Taiwan. The first section describes the country and gives statistics on the national population and on the school population. The second section describes the technology curriculum as one in transition, with its focus changing from traditional industrial arts to contemporary technology education. Two tables provide summaries of the objectives and content of junior-high and senior-high industrial arts curriculum. The third section identifies problems that afflict industrial arts education in Taiwan--industrial arts is considered a subordinate subject, the public's perceptions are not aligned with what the field is, some drawbacks exist in the promulgation system of  the curriculum standards, and much teaching deviates from the curriculum standards. The fourth section cites the 1993 extension of 9-year national education to 12 years as a good opportunity to rename industrial arts, develop a progressive philosophy, reconstruct the industrial arts curriculum, and win the public's support for industrial arts education. A summary, 11 references, 1 figure, and 2 tables conclude the document. (CML)",

        "description":"Media reports suggest widespread illiteracy among adults who may not be able to read, write, speak, or otherwise communicate competently enough to meet the demands of modern society. There is no consensus on the definition of illiteracy or supporting statistics. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the adult illiteracy rate is 13 percent, or 17-21 million persons. Other estimates of illiteracy, functional incompetency, and marginal competency range from 0.5 percent to 50 percent of the adult population. Of the 191 million who were 14 years or older in 1985, the number who are less than functionally proficient would range from under 1 million to over 100 million. Illiteracy and incompetency in the work force imply losses through low productivity, accidents, employee  errors, and extra training programs. High rates of illiteracy are reported among welfare recipients and prison inmates. Illiteracy also impinges on national security. Federal assistance for adult education and literacy programs is primarily authorized through the Adult Education Act (AEA), which serves 3.2 million people yearly and had a FY89 appropriation of $155 million. The AEA has been extended through 1993. Other federal legislation that supports literacy education includes the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 and the Family Support Act of 1988. Amending federal programs to clarify priorities, targeting assistance to adults most in need, establishing a national commission to define literacy and increasing the quality of literacy data are under discussion.

        "description":"An ethnographic study of five clerk-typists and five applications clerks in a large federal agency included observations, interviews, and a 3-week job literacy program. Both in their performance on job tasks and in the tests and exercises in the literacy program, the clerks demonstrated a number of strategies by which they quickly locate information: sorting, avoiding, searching, relying on oral information, and using manuals. In sorting, checklists (that were developed by another group of employees) that bore little resemblance to the tasks were reorganized by the clerks. Avoidance strategies included making sure all necessary information was included before starting a task, looking for key words, and looking for the expected sequence of documents. In searching, the use of key  words, of the sequence of papers within a file, and of format clues enabled the clerks to locate and verify information effectively. The clerks relied on asking for help orally rather than attempting to use manuals, as they learned their jobs by the trial and error of doing them, not through formal instruction. Homemade \"manuals\" were more widely used than agency manuals. The importance of ethnographic studies of literacy, which illustrate the degree to which people exceed others' expectations of their literacy skills, was identified.

        "description":"Vocational training in Hungary consists of 8 years of primary education in the state school system, followed by general secondary schools or secondary or intermediate-level vocational training. Secondary or intermediate-level vocational training is based on three major institutions: vocational secondary schools (4-5 years), skilled workers' schools (3 years), and vocational schools (2-3 years). The most popular and most controversial are the vocational secondary schools, which have undergone several reforms since their establishment in 1961. Access to secondary or intermediate-level vocational training is also given to secondary school leavers. In addition, training courses providing both initial and further training as well as retraining are important in the Hungarian vocational  training system. The institutions of higher vocational training in the state school system are the high schools and universities. Problems of the vocational training system include overspecialization, lack of flexibility, lack of computer-based technologies and integration of computers into the curriculum, little relationship of training to changes in the world of work, and too few financial resources. Future developments in the vocational system are expected to revolve around broader training for students, increased financial resources, and increased training courses outside the system. (Resources in this report include sources of information about vocational training in Hungary, lists of major institutions, selected reading and legislation, and 16 data tables.) (KC)",

The first part contains recommendations to the president, the Congress, and the employment and training community on policies and practices concerning the homeless and employment issues. The second part is the report on which the recommendations are based. It includes information for policymakers and the job training community about the homeless: who they are, what caused them to be homeless, the training and employment issues that need to be considered when dealing with them; assessments of how and the extent to which JTPA is serving homeless individuals; examples of programs where Private Industry Councils (PICs)  have developed and implemented innovative approaches or programs to include the homeless in their JTPA programs; and seven case studies of local JTPA initiatives where the PICs are undertaking special efforts to ensure services to this group. The study that resulted in part 2 of the document included interviews with 55 professionals who administer local JTPA programs in urban areas to determine the level and type of services they are offering to homeless individuals. The case studies attempt to identify what works and does not work by examining factors such as community support and involvement, PIC and private sector roles, types of services provided, levels of interagency and public/private coordination, outcome measures, and funding examples. The case studies are about San Diego,  California; San Mateo County, California; Louisville, Kentucky; New York City, New York; Toledo, Ohio; Nashville, Tennessee; and Seattle-King County, Washington.

        "description":"Canadian baby-boomers will reach old age around 2020. Until then, they represent a large, well-educated generation whose economic productivity provides a strong base on which to build the necessary systems of income support, health and social service delivery, and economic adjustment that will be required to age gracefully. Canadians can expect that the population and the labor force will grow less rapidly over the next 30 years. Low rates of fertility are likely to continue. The average age of the labor force will increase. The labor force may be less adaptable and geographically mobile as the proportion of young entrants decreases. It will be essential to develop and implement strategies to promote health throughout the life span. By 2025, women will constitute 60 percent of  the elderly population. The jobs, benefits, and incomes available to the female labor force are unlikely to provide them with the financial security they will require. The two principal aspects of demographic policy are immigration and fertility. As early as the year 2000, significant increases in the rates of immigration will be required if Canada is to maintain a stable level of population. Canada's commitment to programs of family and child benefits has seriously eroded since 1985. Although it cannot be demonstrated that policies designed explicitly to increase fertility are effective, policies that make it more difficult to choose to bear and raise children would be unwise.

The principal findings of the survey included the following: a total of 10.8 million workers 20 years of age and over lost jobs because of plant closings or employment cut-backs over the January 1981-January 1986 period; of the 5.l million workers who had lost jobs at which they had worked at least 3 years, about two-thirds were reemployed as of January 1986; close to 18 percent of those displaced were unemployed when surveyed in January 1986; of the 3.4 million workers who found work following displacement, 2.7 million were working at full-time wage and salary jobs with more than half of those reemployed earning as much or more  in their new jobs as in their lost jobs; about 2 of 3 displaced workers were men; the geographic distribution of displaced workers was heavily concentrated in the East North Central states; more than 1 of 3 workers over 55 years of age left the labor force after losing their jobs; and reemployment was more difficult for Black and Hispanic workers.

        "description":"Utah's Custom Fit Program (CFP) was reviewed in an attempt to evaluate a complex program. CFP provides funding to train employees of private businesses. In general, classroom training and on-the-job training for up to 500 hours is provided to full-time, entry-level employees of companies creating new jobs in Utah. Little legislative guidance had been provided as the program evolved over the past 10 years. Until recently, policy had not been clearly defined. Although there has been some confusion about program policy and management, the program appeared to have some positive benefits. CFP benefits the state by helping to encourage job growth. State and federal tax money is used to fund training programs tailored to specific businesses. The program gives the governor and his  representatives a tool to use when negotiating with companies considering moving to Utah. CFP can be a useful economic development activity if it is well managed. The State Office of Education has recently made progress in improving management of the CFP and should continue to do so. Suggested administrative functions are monitoring of training programs, verification that companies are expanding, supervision during on-the-job training, and program follow-up. (Appendix A lists the uses of CFP funds in Fiscal Year 1989. Appendix B lists the number of trainees by company and institution for small business agreements in Fiscal Year 1988. A final attachment provides the response to the report from the State Superintendent of Public Instruction.) (CML)",

Materials from commercial publishers listed in the California Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS) curriculum and matrix were rated in terms of usefulness for career education for adults. It was discovered that there are virtually no materials addressing the important area of barriers; publishers are not rating reading materials in a uniform manner; there is a general lack of adult materials at the lowest reading levels; materials need to be updated with current topics; text format is often a problem, with text too dense, poor graphics, and type size that is difficult to read; assessment material  is often not targeted to individual student needs; case studies often do not take into account adult life experiences; and materials to assist instructors in the integration of career education into a total curriculum are lacking. (The bulk of this document consists of publication reviews, each providing a bibliographic citation, reading level, annotation, learning format, type of activity, CASAS competency, and evaluative comments. Four reviews of vocational identity publications are provided.

Chapter 1 introduces the concept of comparable worth and describes the rest of the document. Chapter 2 discusses definitions, concepts, and analytical issues: the basic premises underlying comparable worth and practical details of implementing it, the nature of labor market discrimination and the question of whether equal pay for jobs of comparable worth is nondiscriminatory, and analysis of how adoption of  comparable worth might affect wages and employment of men and women. Chapter 3 deals with empirical questions: conventional economic and comparable worth studies of the actual magnitude of the female/male pay gap, and methodologies for analyzing the actual effects on wages and employment where comparable worth policies have been adopted. Chapter 4 describes comparable worth policies in Minnesota state government employment. Chapter 5 describes comparable worth in San Jose, California, municipal government employment. Chapter 6 describes comparable worth in Australia. Chapter 7 provides a summary and conclusions. The document includes a 14-page reference list, 46 tables, 6 figures, and an index. (CML)",

        "description":"A study examined international differences in how immigrants perform in the labor market of their chosen country of residence. The empirical analysis used five census data sets from the three host countries to document the labor market performance of foreign-born persons in Australia, Canada, and the United States. Among the major empirical findings were the following: (1) prior to the mid-1960s, the United States and Canada attracted migrants who performed quite well in the labor market, whereas Australia attracted migrants who were not relatively successful in the Australian labor market; (2) these rankings were reversed during the 1970s, with migrants to Australia performing very well, whereas those choosing the United States had very low earnings; (3) changes in immigration  policy initiated by the 1965 Amendments to the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act induced a structural decline in the quality of immigrant cohorts who chose the United States as their destination; (4) U.S. citizens who emigrated to Canada had very low earnings despite their relatively high education level. The study concluded that economic theory suggests that much more can be learned about the selection process if immigrants are compared to persons from the same country of origin who chose not to migrate and if immigrants in any given host country are compared to migrants who chose other host countries as their destination.

Among the findings on the defined benefit pension plans were the following: many plans exhibit significant backloading; most plans generate substantial retirement incentives, often at the plan's age of early retirement; the extent of backloading and retirement incentives differs widely across firms; and early and normal retirement at age 55 is quite common among firms in the transportation industry. The analysis of the retirement response to the Fortune 500 company's pension plan yielded the following findings: most of the benefits accrued in the year the  worker reached age 55, the plan's age of early retirement; the plan made pension accrual significantly lower after age 55, thus providing a very substantial incentive to retire at age 55 or shortly thereafter; and the pension plan increased the extent of early retirement between ages 55 and 60 by roughly one-third.

The first paper, &quot;A Window of Opportunity,&quot; is the text of a speech by Robert Silverstein, Staff Director and Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee on the Handicapped of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources to the national meeting of Project Zero to Three, November, 1988. Mr. Silverstein discusses nine major themes that are elaborated in the provisions of P.L. 99-457 and describes their implications for state and local policymaking. The next paper, &quot;Report 99-860&quot; from the Committee of Education and Labor of the House of Representatives describes the background and need for P.L. 99-457 and the  rationale behind each provision of the legislation. Finally, &quot;Community-Based Service Systems for Children with Special Health Care Needs and Their Families,&quot; by Josephine Gittler of the National Maternal and Child Health Resources Center describes a vision of family-center coordinated care that helped to form the conceptual foundation of P.L. 99-457.

First, MAP provides local-level data for administrators and parents to monitor the progress, transition patterns, expected attainments, and associated costs of students in special education. Second, MAP facilitates the aggregation of local data to inform decisions about special education at the state and national levels. Finally, the project has encouraged positive change in the way that data for special education are reported and used. Two articles arising from the project are appended.

Subjects were 24 children, aged 3 to 7, who had a sibling with a handicapping condition. Results based on parental questionnaires and pre- and post-interviews of the children indicated few statistically significant differences in psychosocial functioning. Having a handicapped sibling was not associated with differences between children on measures of empathy, verbalized affect toward parents or siblings,  understanding of disability terms, or perceived self-competence and acceptance. Significant differences between the groups were uncovered only on measures of functioning obtained through maternal reports, which may have been due to mothers' perceptions being influenced by stress factors and not the siblings' actual behavior. Enrollment in the sibling workshop program failed to produce measurable changes in psychosocial functioning. Parents, however, were enthusiastic about their child's participation, expressing satisfaction that a special program was designed for their \"neglected\" non-handicapped child.

It was not possible to demonstrate that a significant effect resulted from IE training, as neither seventh-grade nor eighth-grade subjects showed an increase in academic performance  or reduced absenteeism or behavior problems. The only statistically significant differences were found for schools attended, educational exceptionality, and race.

Careful specification of target behaviors can ensure that collaborating teachers in a consultation program have a shared understanding of the exact nature of the referral problem. Past practices for problem identification generally involved conducting a conventional interview with the consultee. Shortcomings associated with this approach are discussed. A rationale is introduced for employing an alternative process termed a behavioral interview, which yields clearer specification of the problem behavior. Six verbal skills that appear to be central to successful problem identification in a  behavioral interview include: behavior verbalizations, behavior setting verbalizations, evaluation verbalizations, summary verbalizations, empathy verbalizations, and deflection verbalizations. To the extent possible, the interview should be standardized to ensure that target behaviors are adequately identified and to decrease sources of error and bias. Specialized training is required before prospective consultants begin the process. References are listed. (JDD)",

In spring of 1988, a survey was made of key state personnel to assess current implementation status along a number of critical dimensions: definition and eligibility criteria, finance, family plans, interagency service coordination, and data systems. The survey found that 25 states had definitions for &quot;developmentally delayed,&quot; while 20 states were considering or revising their definitions. From 4 to 15 different financial sources were being used to support programs for infants and toddlers; 14 states reported no coordination of funds, while 28 states reported efforts to coordinate sources.  Nineteen states were using a former or existing interagency planning group to serve as the Interagency Coordinating Council, while 24 states formed new councils. Only five states reported having an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) meeting the requirements of the law, while 18 states were developing IFSP formats and 16 states were developing IFSP guidelines and policies. Forty-four states indicated that they had data available for at least one of the four required annual report categories. (Author/JDD)",

Results of the survey, conducted in the summer of 1988, indicated that many states had made a great deal of progress toward developing a policy regarding the definition of developmentally delayed, most states had only partially completed the process, and a few had not yet begun. The Interagency Coordinating Council and the lead agency were identified as playing a major role in providing input into this process. A content analysis of the completed definitions from 28 states showed that all definitions included developmentally delayed infants and toddlers and those with established risk. Three major types of  eligibility criteria were prominent: percent delay, delay in number of months, and delay as indicated by standard deviation. Within these major areas, there was considerable variance in the level of delay needed to establish eligibility for services. Over half of the states included at-risk infants and toddlers, but there was minimal agreement as to which factors place a child at risk, with 53 different biological criteria and 36 environmental risk factors being cited by states using these categories in forming definitions.

Therefore, it is concluded, there is no basis for deciding whether the resultant data are plausible and informative or illusory and irrelevant to acquisition theory. It is proposed that judgments of grammaticality be viewed not as behaviors proprietary to the field of linguistics, but as one type of decision-making or judgment-making behavior among many others behaviors. As such, they may be described in terms of procedural or epistemological principles given by more generalized models of  cognition and psychophysics. Specifically, performance on grammaticality judgment tasks are examined first within the framework of the Theory of Signal Detectability and then within a more recent framework of concept construction and categorization. Some of the principles of those frameworks are then applied to problems in second language acquisition theory. Finally, some reflections on where second language acquisition research has come from and can go with grammaticality judgment data are offered. (MSE)",

Students were usually assigned to cooperative learning groups to participate in activities designed for sharing personal backgrounds, values, and cultures. Students were surveyed about the differences between the groups and the effects of the class pairing. ESL students responded more positively toward school and asking teachers for help. Mainstream students found  interaction with classmates easier. The biggest gaps between the student groups were in the areas of trust, safety, and control over one's life, with the mainstream students feeling more positive in these areas. Both groups found the program worthwhile, and students in all classes commented that the best part of the paired classes was getting to know students with a culturally different background.

Subjects were of Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican background, and had not attained the language proficiency of fluent Spanish monolinguals. Findings suggest that modifications of Spanish in a bilingual setting involve underdifferentiation of null and overt subject pronouns, whose behavior is not fixed by parameters but determined by pragmatic and perhaps prosodic configurations. Spanish overt pronouns appear to be losing their status as stressed or strong pronouns as opposed to inherently weak null pronouns, thus paralleling  English, where overt subject pronouns are normally unstressed but can receive contrastive or emphatic stress. Transitional bilingual Spanish speakers seem to be approaching the stage where the only feature distinguishing null and overt pronouns is the presence or absence of phonetic substance. It is concluded that the resetting of the null subject option is not the normal outcome in unbalanced bilingualism, but that the possibility for null subjects exists in Spanish at all levels. (MSE)",

The program also provides secondary school students with instruction in English as a Second Language and communication classes in their primary language. This report presents information on LEP student enrollment levels and trends, proportions represented by different language groups at the elementary and secondary levels, the adequacy of the programs provided, the linguistic and professional qualifications of the staff teaching LEP students, and the progress made by LEP students toward acquiring English language proficiency. Recommendations for  program improvement at the elementary level focus on improving the qualifications of personnel, and at the secondary level target improved identification, remediation, and monitoring of LEP students. Qualifying tests for new secondary instructors are also recommended. Numerous data tables, graphs, and other figures supplement the text. (MSE)",

        "description":"A discussion of the use of word processing for the instruction of English as a Second Language (ESL) is presented in two parts. The first addresses the uses of the technology in teaching language skills, including writing, vocabulary, grammatical competence, reading skills, and oral skills. Related literature is reviewed and specific examples of classroom techniques are presented. The second part reports on a survey of teacher attitudes concerning the use of word processors. Results suggest that most teachers believe the word processor plays only a minor role in the development of writing skills and are not clear about what that role is, beyond its motivational effect. It is concluded that the most widely acceptable forms of word processor use in ESL are those that involve a  central role for the teacher as a developer of instructional materials, guide, resource manager, and information and feedback source, and for the student as initiator, experimenter, and collaborator, the roles normally filled by teacher and student in a communicative classroom. This suggests that exploitation of the word processor provides good opportunities for integration of the technology and current language teaching practices. (MSE)",

        "description":"This study examined interaction between non-referential gesture and discourse-structuring linguistic devices in the development of metanarrative ability. Specifically, the development of the interaction between beat gestures and all metanarrative devices was analyzed in 9 children aged 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, and in 3 adults. Subjects viewed a cartoon and were videotaped recounting the story to listeners of the same age. Results showed that (1) adults produce metanarrative and narrative statements when telling a story, with the beat gestures accompanying metanarrative statements; (2) young children do not produce many metanarrative statements, but the percentage of metanarrative clauses in a story increases with age; (3) young children do produce as many beat gestures as adults, but  they do not have the same distribution and do not occur primarily in metanarrative clauses; and (4) young children's beat gestures occur with time words. In conclusion, young children do provide structure, in their speech and gesture, in the stories they tell. This structure, however, exists as a comment on a lower level of organization; the level of links between individual events as opposed to global links between parts of the story seen as a whole.

In some places, integration of language and content instruction involves implementation of two-way bilingual (interlocking) immersion programs. Such work falls into the general rubric of language (education) policy or planning. The role of language in education in several disparate settings is illustrated by the adoption of different policies and practices. In the People's Republic of China, English is taught non-intensively as a foreign language as part of the regular middle school curriculum, followed by more intensive English for special purposes for those with a demonstrable need for  further study in English. Nigeria provides transitional bilingual education with a limited maintenance component. The Philippines offers full bilingual education with a complete integration of language and content instruction throughout education cycles. The process by which a country chooses an appropriate model represents educational language planning. This process has relevance for policy formation in the United States. (MSE)",

        "description":"The acoustic effects of the syllable-final /l/ significantly alter the vocalic timbre of the preceding vowel in Catalan. Vowel quality is modified anticipatory to the articulatory gestures required by the /l/, resulting in a lowered second formant. Syllable-final /l/ in Catalan is heavily velarized as a result of tongue tip-tongue back coupling and presents many of the characteristics of an offglide (/w/) movement. This velarized segment is less segmentable from the vowel portion it follows, which may cause a change in the listener's perception of vowel duration. These co-articulatory effects are greatest in the case of front vowels and are of particular interest with respect to the mid-front phonemes. Historical phonology states that phonetic shifts in these vowels were  generally exempted in the conditioning environment of liquid sounds. It is argued that the above-mentioned effects underlie this resistance. Evidence to support these claims is sought in the form of acoustic analysis of vowel-lateral and lateral-vowel sequences. The results favor the accepted phonological theory. (Author)",

Eight standard curricula commonly used in Dutch schools and using either communicative or grammar-based approaches or a combination of the two were included in the investigation. For each curriculum, the classroom techniques, themes, and topics were compared and a score reflecting the degree of communicative approach used was calculated. Student achievement levels on proficiency tests in listening, reading, writing, and speaking based on the content of the eight courses were compared.

The focus is a subset of verbs in modern Hebrew and the language-specific knowledge that children acquire of what constitutes a possible verb in their language, from the point of view of both internal form and of categorical appropriateness for naming a certain semantic content or transitive relation. The application of two complementary processes, root extraction and pattern assignment, by 60 Hebrew-speaking children and 12 adults was studied. Subjects were asked to interpret and produce innovative verbs based on familiar nouns and adjectives. The three main findings include the following: (1) children can perform root extraction from as young as age three, and do better at identifying consonantal roots  when they are presented with novel verbs for comprehension than in producing novel verbs by extracting roots from nouns or adjectives they know; (2) when children produce new verbs, their innovations conform closely to the grammatical structure of the standard morphological patterns used for constructing verbs in Hebrew; and (3) all child subjects, aged 3-9, overwhelmingly favor the verb pattern preferred for denominal verb-formation in current Hebrew, even though other patterns are equally available in the established lexicon and in the children's own speech.

The guide translates this need into competency-based instructional objectives and language functions, and provides suggestions for materials and teaching techniques. The curriculum provides two tracks of instruction to accommodate differences in educational background and learning ability; this volume contains Track A, for use with semi-literate and educationally disadvantaged students with 5 or fewer years of education in their native countries.  Each track consists of four proficiency levels, each containing 9-11 instructional units or topics. For each topic, the guide provides a list of performance objectives and a list of language functions and corresponding structures to be mastered. Each performance objective is also indexed to a competency on the general competency list. Appended materials include a chart of reading and writing enabling skills for each level, a list of cross-cultural questions, pronunciation notes, suggestions for activities and classroom techniques, a resource list, and questions that may be asked of immigrants by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.

The measurements were selected to represent a broad spectrum of state conditions relevant to education in the areas of demography (e.g., net migration and youth in poverty); economics (e.g., tax effort and school size); schools (e.g., school size and expenditures); politics (number of local governments and composition of state legislature); participation rates (e.g., high school graduation rate and college starting rate); migration (public system attractiveness to residents  and non-residents); public system characteristics (e.g., public versus private strength and geographic accessibility); program and retention profiles (e.g., graduation profile and graduate education emphasis); and finance of public higher education (e.g., role of tuition and public system financial support). Each entry was required to have a partially distinct, although possibly small, causal potential to some aspect of education policy and/or operations.

The text describes the specific objectives and methods used to conduct these freshmen workshops. There is widespread agreement that optimal education requires students to learn through their active involvement with information, concepts, and principles. The Academic Orientation workshop was specifically designed to communicate the college's expectations of high student involvement in classes from the outset of the freshman's college experience in order to promote active learning on campus. The text explains how co-leaders are trained, looking at background (a couple of meetings at which faculty members discussed ways  to orient new students to the academic side of the school); overview of academic orientation workshop format; objectives of academic orientation workshops (student expression and student listening); process considerations for workshop leaders; discussion segment; and conclusion of co-leader training. Freshmen attendance at the workshop was very good, in part due to the strenuous efforts of the Student Life department to present the Academic Orientation workshops as an integral part of the overall new student orientation program.

The courses taken by first year medical students in the fall semester were selected for study. A questionnaire divided into three parts accompanied the liaison report. Students were asked to evaluate their general perceptions of the accuracy of student liaison reports, evaluate the  accuracy of the report itself after reviewing it, and provide general recommendations regarding the use of student liaison reports for the purpose of curriculum development. According to the results, reports produced by the liaison committee: (1) are moderate to very accurate in reflecting the ratings of the majority of students; (2) would be acceptable to the majority of students as adequate representation for making suggestions for course and curriculum changes; and (3) will tend to have a somewhat positive bias for courses in which there may be intense negative sentiment.

        "description":"This report, the first in a series on student financial aid, develops a public policy justification for needs-tested higher educational subsidies targeted specifically to students, and offers evidence to support the argument that financial aid is a worthwhile use of public monies. Traditionally, public subsidies for students have been directed to institutions; in the mid-1960s, however, federal and state governments began to subsidize higher education of students directly via needs-tested grants and other forms of aid. Currently more than $20 billion is spend on student aid. Five sections look at: student demand for higher education; differences in abilities to pay college costs; the effect of price on student enrollment decisions (discussing student enrollment responses to price  and to financial aid); the public policy commitment to equalize higher educational opportunity (discussing federal and state commitments); and society's interest in improving educational opportunity (discussing labor force renewal and preservation of social peace through hope). It is concluded that higher education is essential to current and future prosperity of both individuals and the larger society. Signals from the labor market indicate a current oversupply of workers with less than a college education and an undersupply of workers with college degrees. Today, student financial aid addresses simultaneously two social issues: (1) the fulfilling of the aspirations of citizens wishing to climb the ladder of opportunity and (2) the enormous human capitalization requirements of the  evolving world economy and the role of the United States in that system.

        "description":"Logit analysis coupled with the BMDP4F computer program (Brown, 1983) was used to derive an appropriate model for the study of student retention and graduation. The model was then applied to graduate student retention and graduation data from the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). Logit analysis is a method of determining what effects need to be entered into a model for adequately predicting the value of a categorical dependent variable and involves independent variables that are all categorical. The BMDP4F log-linear analysis procedure was used in the application on the UNIVAC 1180 to determine which independent variables and interactions were necessary to predict retention. The UMCP study was concerned with identifying predictors of (1) graduation within a specific  number of years since admission and (2) retention each year after entry for students registering for master's or doctoral programs during 1977-1979. Results included the following: the difference in predicted retention rates among academic divisions at the doctoral level may be related to differences in the perceived advantage accruing to the completion of a doctorate versus the personal and financial sacrifice involved in continued study; full-time rather than part-time status at entry may be related to greater goal commitment and may result in a higher degree of social integration; and the lack of a significant relationship between age and retention in graduate school is similar to the conclusion of Pantages and Creedon (1978) for college attrition. The results of the UMCP study are  compared with other studies. Two appendices include a list of graduate programs by graduate division and a table giving characteristics of sample by level of program. Tables are included. Contains 33 references. (SM)",

The study is based on financial data from a sample of 57 regionally accredited nonprofit independent higher education institutions in the state. Indicators show that enrollments in these institutions have generally held steady in recent years, their state-funded financial aid has increased, and their net revenues are positive. However, indications of financial stress are evident at many of them, including soft enrollment demand, decreases in instructional expenditures, and increases in institutional financial aid expenditures. To provide a policy context for interpretation of these data, the report reviews state policy issues affecting the independent sector and recommends a  policy framework for future study of that sector.

For students showing promise but not satisfying these criteria, a special admissions category was also proposed. Because of concern that implementation of the new policy would reduce enrollment, a study was undertaken to compare the full-time-equivalency (FTE) enrollment from fall 1985 to spring 1989 with the FTE enrollment that would have existed had the proposed requirements been in effect during that period.  Results indicate that 11 students would have been rejected under the proposed entrance requirements, but also that only one of these students passed sufficient courses to graduate or obtain the minimum grade point average for graduation. Five of the students attended for only one semester. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the college adopt the proposed entrance requirements. Contains 28 references. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study investigated the relative importance of certain college attributes to the freshmen of Ashland University, a small, private univeristy in Ohio. Five institutional characteristics were examined: availability and variety of financial aid, dorm life (living conditions and food quality), quality of education (quality of teaching, career relevance of the curriculum, and overall institutional reputation), student-faculty relationships and interaction (availability of faculty to students, faculty promotion of student development, and degree of faculty advice given to students on personal as well as academic matters), and campus social life. Conjoint analyses were conducted on the completed survey forms of 295 freshmen out of 318 administered the questionnaire. The student sample  was segmented by gender participation or nonparticipation in sports, and degree of parental influence in college choice. Financial aid and quality of dorm life were the found to be the most important attributes overall, with educational quality, social life, and student faculty relationships rated in declining order of importance. Varying attribute rankings were found for the different student segments, with financial aid ranking first most often. Implications for college administration and future research are discussed.

        "description":"A method for college planning using alternative futures scenarios is explained, and a case study is used to illustrate its use in institutional research. The alternative futures approach addresses the uncertainty associated with strategic decision making. It differs from the traditional long-range planning models based on a single set of environmental assumptions about the future by recognizing that the future is subject to modification by a wide range of possible events with some probability of occurrence. In the model, the issues or concerns that may require attention are identified through environmental scanning, and defined in terms of trends or events. Univariate forecasts of trends and events are generated and interrelated through cross-impact analysis. The most likely  future is written in scenario format, and alternative scenarios are generated by computer from the cross-impact matrix. In turn, these scenarios stimulate development of appropriate policies, which are analyzed for their robustness across scenarios. The purpose of the exercise is to produce a final list of policies that effectively address the issues and concerns initially identified. These policies are then implemented in action plans. The case study concerns planning for an affirmative action program. Contains 190 references. (MSE)",

The information gathered is organized in eight categories: the goals of collegiate education; academic standards; attitudes about student life; teaching, research, and service; the status of the profession; views of the institution; participation in decision making; and general observations. Following an introductory narrative summary, results are presented in 104 tables within those categories. Data are arrayed by faculty age, gender, professional discipline, and institution type. Three major issues are identified: (1) some optimism but also great concern about aspects of academic quality, particularly the quality of students; (2) conflict between faculty  interest in teaching and requirements for published research; and (3) respect for the institution and their role in it, but concern about institutional administration.

The California Postsecondary Education Commission approved the original proposal in 1987, contingent on finding solutions to concerns about transportation access and services to disadvantaged students. The university offers the following: the environmental impact report, a private transportation study, the state university's transportation plan, the plan to serve disadvantaged students, and the question of alternatives. Other actions by the state university and the issue of a full-service campus are addressed. The Commissioners conclude the following: the need for such a campus has been demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt; a permanent center is  preferable to other alternatives; and transportation problems are being handled as efficiently as possible. Among the four recommendations are the Commission's approval of this center and the university's need to periodically report to the Commission its positive steps to alleviate the transporation problems. Eight appendices comprise the greater part of the document and include: letters responding to notice of preparation for environmental impact report; responses to draft environmental impact report; residences of surveyed students attending Pleasant Hill Center; transportation planning; service to disadvantaged students; alternatives to proposed project; response to request regarding project; and letters and relevant memoranda.

Major sections take up the following topics: a policy context for the Commission's planning priorities; population projections through 2020; long-range enrollment projections  (background, recent projections, demography, and enrollment projection methodologies); segmental enrollment planning (California Community Colleges, California State University, and University of California); capital outlay planning; and state budgeting (e.g., power of the executive, workload formulae, and the state capital outlay process). Conclusions are offered regarding long-range planning activities of the segments, enrollment planning, capital outlay planning, and state budget and capital outlay approval.

The discussions and findings are in three sections: nonresident tuition in California; nonresident tuition in other states; and recommendations for state policy guidelines for nonresident tuition. Part 1 &quot;Nonresident Tuition in California,&quot; covers UC, CSU, California Community Colleges, segments comparisons, and California residency requirements. Part 2,&quot;Nonresident Tuition in Other States,&quot; covers the methodology of selecting comparison institutions, level of fees, methodologies used for adjusting nonresident tuition levels, and residency requirements. In part 3, recommendations cover the following: context for policy, need for comparability among the differing nonresident methodologies, California nonresident charges compared with those charged by comparable institutions nationally, nonresident methodologies and their compatibility with the state's resident fee policy, need for revision of California's residency requirements, and differential fee levels for professional students in high-cost disciplines. Four appendices offer the text of Senate Concurrent Resolution 69 and information about the following: 1988-89 tuition and fees, UC  and 23 other institutions; community college students who are or may be exempted from paying nonresident tuition; and exceptions to the general residency rule.

Study results rejected the hypothesis because the nontraditional students made significantly higher GPA (2.95 versus 2.54) than the traditional students. There was a significant correlation between age and GPA. This could give rise to the possibility that the findings could be generalized to other institutions.

Educators tend to have problems with this joint venture as it relates to role identification, because it requres that specific duties or responsibilities assigned to designated administrators and/or faculty in both higher education and public education to clarify consultant versus particpant obligations. This role identification could fall into the categories of information exchange, relevant programming, and protection of expertise. These categories are the major areas of concern in staff development today. Guidelines developed by Barnes and Murphy for increasing interaction programs  non-judgmental; when possible, include administrators; reduce scheduling difficulties; and allow coaching teams to remain together for at least 2 years. Dimensions for enhancing morale suggested by Gross and Herriott include: display a sense of pride in the workplace; enjoy the work assignments; and work cooperatively with fellow educators. The collaboration of staff development between higher education and public education can make a major change in promoting excellence in education for the 1990s, leading to a more secure future for later generations.

        "description":"This study investigated the educational implications of having a group of 17 first-year New Zealand nursing students develop a medical expert system. Goals of the study were to determine whether, in the process of developing the expert system, the learners could: (1) acquire a more in-depth understanding of the specific subject domain under study (namely, how to identify alcoholic patients); (2) develop a more complex set of problem solving strategies; and (3) acquire conditional reasoning skills. An ethnographic case study approach was adopted. The learners participated as a whole class in six sessions over a period of 10 weeks, for a total of 10 contact hours. In addition to whole class sessions, they met in small groups to interview subject matter experts. Participants then  met as a whole class to share their information and to construct rules for the knowledge base of the expert system. Both quantitative and qualitative measures were used to describe how the learners could use computers to acquire knowledge and thinking skills in a group learning context where computers were used as tools. Data were collected using the following instruments: pre- and posttests to measure gains in reasoning abilities; student worksheets to solicit information on the participants' problem solving strategies and knowledge representation; students' logs; and questionnaires to collect information on students' background, knowledge acquisition, and attitudes towards the expert system as an instructional aid. Due to the preliminary nature of the study and the short time frame, no  claim was made as to the extent of the improvement in problem solving and reasoning skills; however, the results clearly indicated that expert systems can be used to enhance the development of certain reasoning skills and also to facilitate the acquisition of a deeper understanding of the subject domain under study.

        "description":"Two factors which contribute to successful learning are presented and shown to be useful in the selection of teaching methods that match educational aims: a feedback model of the teaching and learning processes based on Pask's conversational learning model; and a classification of educational aims based on Bloom. Several kinds of feedback are listed in descending order of response time: statistical feedback obtained from large surveys of students; assignments; tutorials, telephone conferencing, and self-help groups; and self-assessment questions. A classification of educational achievements is then presented: (1) learning in the affective domain (e.g., attitudes, values, and affective skills such as communication and adaptability); (2) learning in the cognitive domain (e.g.,  facts and understanding); (3) learning of intellectual skills (e.g., particular techniques, analysis, and synthesis); and (4) learning of manual skills. These categories are explored and illustrated with examples. The selection of teaching media and methods is considered as it relates to their place in the feedback model, their suitability for different educational aims, and their cost-effectiveness. A variety of teaching media and methods is outlined--including face-to-face methods, printed texts, films and television programs, audio, audio-graphic systems, computer-aided learning, laboratory or practical work, and assignments--and a matrix provides guidelines for the selection of methods for various educational aims. Finally, cost-effectiveness considerations of methods and media  selection are discussed. (6 references) (GL)",

        "description":"A major goal of the School for Independent Study at North East London Polytechnic, which was founded in 1974, has been to provide the opportunity for higher education among students in an underprivileged area of London where typically few students have access to further schooling. The desire to increase access led to &quot;non-standard entry&quot; criteria devised to use the students' experience instead of examination scores. The school has grown from one program of 73 full-time students in 1974 to three programs of 800 full-time and part-time students, and its activities now span the globe. Emphasis is on goal orientation and the development of transferable cognitive and interpersonal skills rather than on the content of any discipline. To this end, projects are carried out in the  community. The history of the school is reviewed, followed by a statement of its philosophy. Procedures for admissions, academic program planning, registration, assessment of students' work, and networking (both with other faculty in the Polytechnic and with experts in the students' fields of interest) are described. Examples of students' work from the three degree programs (Diploma of Higher Education, Bachelor of Arts and of Science, and Masters of Arts and of Science) and profiles of selected students are provided. Procedures are outlined for staff and resource allocation. Descriptions of international links with such countries as Japan, Australia, China, Cyprus, Scotland, and Pakistan conclude the report.

          "Abbott, Elizabeth"],
        "description":"Students aged 10 to 17 years in a primary school and a secondary school in an industrial suburb of Melbourne, Australia, were observed as they worked at activities in both curriculum and non-curriculum areas using MITSI, a computer program, as a KBS (knowledge-based system) tool. Evaluations of the students' general abilities, computer abilities, and opinions and attitudes led to the conclusion that well-designed activities based on MITSI are very well received by learners and teachers, and can produce valuable learning outcomes. Vital considerations in planning to use MITSI are the characteristics of the system, the selection and design of learning activities, and the emphasis that is placed on general cognitive abilities. The key to good activities is the discussion and  thinking they can spark, and this depends as much on the way they are presented and supported in the classroom as on the details of the computing. MITSI is a good tool for a broad range of information-handling activities, including using or building databases, exploring and expressing simple logical relationships among items, and organizing a body of knowledge and expressing it in a systematic and rule-bound way. Experience shows that it is more effective to allow beginning students to explore pre-written programs before extending them or building their own; the transition to writing programs and writing rules should be gradual. Structured worksheets that permit students to work at their own pace can free the teacher to provide individual assistance to those with special problems, and a  wide range of activities add interest, allow users to explore MITSI more fully, and promote a richer range of general skills. Things to watch for include finding enough time, individual differences among students, being sure the computer is the best way to meet a particular educational goal, integrating computer work, looking for computer spin-offs, and being wary of sex-role stereotypes.

The second section reviews some basics of an applied approach to education, and the projected growth of the department from 1980-89 is summarized in the third section. The fourth section describes the curriculum, which consists of two phases: the first year is filled with clusters of conceptually interrelated courses (educational science, research methods and techniques, educational technology, social science, educational computer use, philosophy of education, practical skills, social and communicative skills, and  technical sciences); and the second part, which takes on or two years, offers a differentiation program in an area of specialization (educational management, instructional technology, curriculum technology, or educational instrumentation). The fifth section outlines the themes serving as the organizational basis for departmental research: (1) strategies for curriculum development; (2) efficiency in education; (3) educational information systems; (4) examination techniques; and (5) educational instrumentation. Guidelines for entering and leaving the program are discussed in the final section. Comparisons with the program of the University of California at Los Angeles Graduate School of Education are presented throughout. Four documentation resources (in Dutch) are listed. (MES)",

Problems in developing a technology for CBL materials production are discussed, and several insights behind the development of such a technology are considered: (1) it is useful to make a distinction between the developmental systems for CBL materials and the delivery systems; (2) there is a growing tendency to use general purpose high programming languages as well as computer-assisted instruction (CAI) design languages for the development of CBL; (3) CAI is increasingly perceived to be more than an automated version of programmed instruction; (4) an emphasis on formalizing procedures for programming  design and development has been emerging; and (5) work on computer-based simulation has made an important contribution to the growth of CBL technology. The problems of credibility and limited resources in creating favorable conditions for the implementation of CBL are considered, along with potential means of addressing these problems in Western Europe.

The first section indicates how the problem of selecting the appropriate amount of instruction in MAIS can be situated within the general framework of empirical Bayesian decision theory. The linear loss model and the classical test model are discussed in this context. The second section describes six characteristics essential in effective computerized adaptive instructional systems: (1) initial diagnosis and prescription; (2) sequential character of the instructional decision-making process; (3) appropriate amount of instruction for each student; (4) sequence  of instruction; (5) instructional time control; and (6) advisement of learning need. It is shown that all but the sequence of instruction could be improved in MAIS with the extensions proposed.

A copying program on an Apple IIc microcomputer functioned as the training instrument. Although the children did not acquire proficient touch typing skills, they did type accurate responses faster, keep their hands positioned on the home row when they began typing, and show some conditioning to key locations when using the Dvorak keyboard. While the children's fingering was often inconsistent and they continued to glance at the keyboard for confirmation of key locations, their acquisition of touch typing skills would probably have been more extensive had they stayed with the same keyboard throughout instead of changing from the QWERTY  to the Dvorak version. Although there is some evidence that children as young as 6 years can acquire touch typing skills, it is unclear what the recommended procedures should be for introducing young children to keyboard fingering. Additional research in this area acquires increasing importance as more young children use microcomputer keyboards. Twelve references, 2 tables, and 1 figure are included. (GL)",

        "description":"In the past 5 years educational institutions in North America have begun to incorporate audiographic conferencing technology into their distance education programs. The use of audiographic conferencing is escalating rapidly since this technology offers the potential of serving distant students at a reasonable cost without requiring instructors to radically modify their classroom behavior and without requiring extensive new institutional support systems. The real-time communications environment of the traditional classroom is maintained because these systems allow full interaction among participants. The instructor is free to be spontaneous and to present information both orally and visually; students can participate in classroom discussions, ask questions of the instructor and  their peers, and can create, view, and discuss graphic and other visual materials. To understand how this technology is being used and to develop an ideal model of how best to use it for course delivery, the Annenberg/Corporation for Public Broadcasting Project and the University of Maryland University College sponsored a research project. Interviews were conducted with students, faculty members, administrators, and technicians from nine institutions in the United States and Canada which were using audiographic conferencing. The report summarizes the interviews and direct observations and explains what seems to work and what does not. Appendixes include descriptions of audiographic systems; institutional contacts; a project evaluation report for Audio-Plus; two research papers on the  instructional effectiveness of audiographic conferencing methods; and professional guidelines for a Teleteaching Project in Pennsylvania.

        "description":"The ability to bridge together geographically-distant populations for training is made possible through teletraining, a human performance system which integrates telecommunications into the planning, design, and delivery of training programs. Typically, teletraining uses standard telephone lines or digital communication services to provide interactive audio, audio-graphic, and video programs that are viewed at all locations on the teleconference. (As few as two locations and as many as 100-plus locations have participated in international teleconferences.) The value of saving the cost of travel time increases its appeal, and linking experts to learners globally has many benefits. However, a successful teletraining experience requires appropriate awareness of cultural differences  and instructional design strategies, as well as adequate preparation for the technical support required to deliver the course. Audio teletraining, audio-graphic teletraining, and video teletraining are described, the advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed, and guidelines for the design and development of teletraining programs are provided. Cultural considerations in designing international distance education environments, based on Geert Hofstede's model, are also considered. A description of an international teletraining program, which was held as part of the 1988 convention of the Association of European Correspondence Schools in Istanbul, Turkey, concludes the paper.

Approximately one-half of the students included in the reading study also participated in the mathematics study. The Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT) Mathematics and Reading Surveys were administered using a pretest posttest design to determine any differences between the control group and the experimental  group in each study. An analysis of the MAT Reading Survey and MAT Mathematics Survey results showed statistically significant positive gains for the Chapter 1 students who worked with the ESC software, and that these gains were significantly greater than those of students in the control group.

        "description":"As a regional institution serving the needs of 11 different island nations of the South West Pacific, the University of the South Pacific (USP) is, along with its on-campus face-to-face teaching activity, deeply committed to and reliant on distance study methods. Both of these activities at the university are the principal responsibility of a single body of teaching staff. This investigation, through the means of a structured questionnaire, studied the involvement of members of the university's teaching staff in instructional materials development for distance study. It inquired into the time they spent on such activity, their levels of satisfaction with the materials they produced, their preferences with regard to teaching and instructional materials development strategies, and  their views on how the process of instructional development at the university could be improved. Responses revealed a rather unsatisfactory picture with requests for more time for materials development, better coordination and planning, greater consultation among colleagues, and adequate support services in instructional materials development for distance study. There was concern and consensus about the need for instructional materials developers to be adequately familiar with the USP region and the students for whom the materials are intended. Some respondents suggested that course writers, prior to developing instructional materials, be allowed to spend time in the region becoming familiar with the local learning context. Among the less frequently mentioned suggestions was that  prospective course writers be sent abroad for short-term training courses in distance education and instructional materials development for distance teaching.

        "description":"COMPENSTAT, a menu-driven statistical program for IBM-compatible microcomputers, has two distinct versions: instructional and computational. The instructional version can be used by instructors as a classroom resource, and the computational version is used directly by students to calculate answers to problems. The software package is primarily used as an assignment generating and problem solving tool. Each student in a class is assigned unique data for a problem type. Since all data sets generate different answers, students can help each other learn but cannot simply copy answers. The instructor is not burdened with extra work, since each student's assignment is followed by a personalized answer key on which the student's answer is computed. An answer sheet is even provided to  organize students' responses for easy checking. This paper provides instructions for using the menu-driven features of COMPENSTAT in a business statistics course including diagrams of the menu options, which facilitate building, viewing, or modifying data sets; generating individualized assignments for students in a class; and performing statistical calculations (e.g., frequency distributions, descriptive statistics, probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, chi-square and ANOVA, index numbers, regression and correlation, and nonparametric statistics). Examples of a COMPENSTAT answer sheet and statistical problems on regression, correlation, and ANOVA are also provided. (GL)",

In addition to their traditional bibliographical, academic, and personal competencies, librarians also have to possess technological expertise in order to gain access to automated library processes both for themselves, and for providing individual and group online and CD-ROM instruction. Additionally, because of their daily contact with patrons, librarians can aid in determining user and community needs, thereby helping to establish budget priorities for building library resources and managing staffing. Administrative decisions about automation are also increasingly being made by reference librarians. Continuing education is recommended for all reference  librarians to maintain current knowledge of library information and resource issues. It is also suggested that librarians should play a proactive role in requesting financial support for continuing education, and that they should strive to keep communication lines open with administrators so that they can be informed and can inform the administrators of new systems, technologies, and programs.

It functions primarily as a circulation system, providing short bibliographic records (i.e., main entry, title, place of publication, and date) and complete holdings and circulation information for all titles. Programs are written in a detailed language similar to PL/1 and BASIC, and are executed in SUPERWYLBUR, an interactive operating system that allows for the submission of batch jobs as  well as interactive macros or programs. Although LCS does not provide many features of a truly automated system (e.g., order presentation, invoice processing, voucher preparation, and fund accounting), it does have advantages over manual files. Examples are shown of &quot;make.orders&quot; and &quot;print.slips&quot; programs used to keep track of and print ordering records of approval titles. (SD)",

The Library Bill of Rights--which advocates the provision of library resources reflecting all points of view on current and historical issues--is cited as a standard for the inclusion of API as part of library collections, and the results of an analysis of the subscriber list and telephone interviews with a number of API subscribers are presented. The findings indicate that approximately 1 in 80 public, academic, school, and special libraries in the United  States subscribe to API. Colleges and universities are the biggest subscribers (1 in 18), and 41 of the 53 U.S. American Library Association-accredited library schools subscribe to it. Approximately 1 in 200 public libraries also subscribes to the index, although three states have no library of any kind that subscribes to API. Brief reports of conversations with librarians from several public libraries, as well as libraries from public universities and private and community colleges, private and public high schools, and organizations that receive the API, indicate that they subscribe to API because of its coverage of such topics as women's and minority studies, controversial issues, counterespionage, terrorism, and political happenings.

The project was jointly managed by the Indiana Department of Public Instruction and the Indiana Cooperative Library Services Authority (INCOLSA), a state-wide multi-type library network. Staff at large school library media centers in Indiana were trained to catalog nonprint media to national standards including full Library of Congress MARC tagging. They were, in effect, decentralized cataloging nodes in the OCLC system, with INCOLSA staff doing database searches and actual catalog card production. Of 7,495 titles cataloged, a hit rate of 70% was obtained and 1,240 original cataloging records were added to the OCLC database. A decentralized, standardized approach to  nonprint media cataloging was judged satisfactory by participants. Participants judged that the project had significantly increased their knowledge and skills in cataloging and MARC standards for nonprint media. The project led to five large school corporations converting to online network operation. Project recommendations include: increased school/network demonstrations, adoption of national standards for cataloging nonprint media by school library media centers, and the need for a feasibility study of a producer/manufacturer/distributor bibliographic control center to input cataloging data directly to the OCLC database. Analyses of data are displayed in six tables, and a sample workform, a production statistics form, a copy of the project evaluation questionnaire, and a report on a  conference on critical issues in network development are included.

In this phase, seven public libraries offering I&R services were studied in depth to provide descriptions of their operations, organizational factors, and the reactions of their users. Organizational factors and operations were studied through available documents (relatively few) and interviews with 14 to 21 persons at each site. User reaction to I&R was studied by way of short user interviews conducted by the libraries' staffs after instruction by the study team. Sites were chosen to illustrate a mix of organizational configurations of the I&R service, of resource file formats (microform, cards, and computerized), of urban-suburban-rural settings, and of the I&R service role.  In addition to the descriptions of seven instances of library-based I&R, general observations are offered, and include the following: (1) most I&R service consists of information provision, as opposed to actual referral; (2) computerization itself is not the absolute determinant of the nature of the service delivered; (3) commitment of top management and the magnitude of library resources deployed for I&R seem to be major determinants of the success of the I&R innovation; (4) I&R users include a relatively even mix of regular, infrequent, and non-users of the library; (5) the library is not often the place of first resort for people with I&R needs; (6) clients range demographically from lower socioeconomic through upper socioeconomic strata; (7) the promotion of I&R invariably increases  the volume of traditional reference queries; and (8) staff seem to be generally positive toward I&R although often not in agreement as to what it consists of.

Topics discussed are: (1) the &quot;Guidelines'&quot; mission statement and specific challenges brought about by this mission; (2) the issue of program development--i.e., the school library media program being fully integrated into the schools' overall curricula--and the concept of &quot;partners&quot;--i.e., a cooperative and collaborative planning  model; and (3) the three-fold role of the library media specialist as information specialist, as teacher, and as instructional consultant. It is recommended that Canadian institutions consider the capacity-performance model (i.e., the capacity to meet institutional/educational needs and the ability to perform at a level appropriate to the institution and its members), which requires an exploration of vision and values, and which strives to renew an institution's vitality. A chronology of guidelines documents and other landmarks across the decades in the United Stated and Canada is included, as well as provincial documentation for reference purposes. (SD)",

        "description":"This report discusses a workshop conducted by the library of San Jose State University to instruct eight students with learning disabilities (SLD) in the use of CD-ROM databases. The workshop contributors believed that CD-ROM databases could simplify research paper and homework assignments for such students. The 5-month workshop sought not only to entice these students into the library to receive tailored library instruction, but also to strengthen the bonds between the library and the campus learning disabilities staff. Because sequencing was a problem for this group, the workshop was broken into constituent parts, which incorporated the steps necessary to formulate, implement, view, and print out search results on the ERIC CD-ROM database from SilverPlatter. The accompanying  instructional materials (e.g., handouts and overhead projections) were color-coded; this was particularly helpful to students with certain perceptual disorders for whom reading high contrast print materials (i.e., black and white) would be difficult. The workshop achieved its objectives of establishing better contact with both the target group and the learning disabilities support staff. It is suggested that this workshop could serve as a model for bibliographic instruction to other groups who require simple, systematic entry into the technology. Nine sections of colored handouts are appended, including a CD-ROM evaluation form. (16 references) (SD)",

The \"Strategies for Proficiency Workshops\" were intended primarily as in-service training for secondary foreign language teachers and secondarily as retraining for secondary teachers who specialized in areas other than languages, but who would be teaching languages during the coming year. The workshops focused on improving oral proficiency, confidence in speaking, instructional skills, test development, and such innovative techniques as teaching higher order thinking skills, creative evaluation techniques, visual-based  curricula, computer-assisted materials design, and the Color Connection system of materials development. Participants were recruited through personally addressed letters sent to all foreign language teachers in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and to all participants in prior workshops. A special effort was made to recruit and admit minority teachers throughout Texas. Evaluation of the workshops involved a comparison of pre- and post-test self-assessment questionnaires and in-class observations of a sampling of teachers during the following fall term. Participants in both French and Spanish language workshops perceived gains in both their speaking and understanding abilities and their instructional skills. Evaluation materials are appended.

The paper focuses on four categories of research: (1) research conducted to fulfill external reporting requirements and to influence policy at state and federal levels; (2) formative research on institutional efficiency as measured by teacher-student a full-time/part-time faculty ratios, institutional effectiveness or educational outcomes, community needs assessments, and faculty/staff evaluations; (3) research to inform decisionmaking for program development and change; and (4) studies conducted to improve public relations and marketing research. Guidelines are presented as standards for good institutional  research, underscoring the importance of following acceptable sampling, statistical, definitional, and evaluative procedures; and of ensuring that research is timely and has practical applications. The final section of the paper analyzes six research reports; a program report on student retention by Gainesville College Georgia; and five California projects.

        "description":"Scholarship -- or, rather, the lack of it -- is a major weakness of the American community college. The most immediate problem the community colleges face in this area is that of developing a clear and meaningful definition of scholarship. Community colleges have paid little attention to scholarship for a number of reasons: (1) community colleges take pride in their commitment to effective teaching, setting off endless debates over research versus teaching; (2) two-year colleges have been unwilling to recognize and reward scholarly activities; (3) community college presidents and deans of instruction fail to emphasize and promote scholarly activities for themselves; (4) community college professionals have failed to realize that thinking in terms of the job rather than of the  profession, with its inherent obligation to scholarship, results in neglect of scholarship; and (5) faculty and administrators have rarely engaged in regular and systematic approaches to the evaluation and improvement of teaching that extend beyond individual classrooms. The most obvious way to enhance scholarship in the community college setting is to include scholarship as an important part of the rewards system. In addition, each college should institute a forum devoted to scholarship, and ensure released time, summer employment and study, and other avenues for scholarly pursuits. Ultimately, presidents and deans of instruction must lead the way in establishing a climate on campus that promotes scholarship. (JMC)",

Telephone interviews were conducted with a representative sample of 601 students, soliciting information about the importance of various factors and goals in their decision to attend a community college, their educational plans, high school background, applications to four-year colleges, and perceptions of relative college costs. Study findings included the following: (1) 88% or more regarded acquiring basic skills, gaining a sense of personal accomplishment, acquiring general knowledge, and preparing for a career  or occupation as \"very\" or \"somewhat\" important; (2) those in the youngest age group (17-21 years) were most likely to consider transfer to a four-year institution as \"very important\" in their decision to attend a community college, while the oldest age group (35+ years) was most interested in gaining a sense of personal accomplishment; (3) two-thirds of the respondents considered course and program availability, quality of teaching, and location to be \"very important\" factors in their choice of college; (4) location and cost were \"very important\" to more returning students than to new/transfer students; (5) 49% planned to complete a community college program and 35% thought it would take 1 year or less while 37% thought it would take 2 years; (6) one-third indicated that they had applied  to a four-year school, and part-time students were more likely than full-time students to have been accepted; and (7) over 80% perceived community colleges as less costly than four-year public or private institutions. Appended to the study are analyses of survey responses broken down by student characteristics, responses to open-ended questions, the survey instrument, and a sample size and sample error chart.

        "description":"Drawing from a review of the literature and a comparative study of evaluation techniques, this paper offers a rationale for the use of performance appraisal as a method of evaluating student writing. The literature review covers: (1) various roles played by composition teachers, including the students' audience of one, writing coach, and Socratic tutor; (2) the art of rhetoric and the science of linguistics; (3) criteria and scales for evaluating student writing holistically, including Diederich's scales of general merit and mechanical skills and Lloyd-Jones's primary trait scoring method; (4) the importance of communicating expectations and evaluation criteria to students and providing feedback on how well their compositions meet these standards; (5) the distinction between  grading and evaluating; and (6) the limitations of revision checklists. The next section of the paper explains and offers support for the use of performance appraisals, like those used in industry, to make students aware of the factors that are priorities for an assignment before they turn in their papers. The final section reports on a study comparing the effects on student writing of direct teacher instruction and collaborative learning in peer groups as means of providing feedback. Appendixes include 76 references, a chart on the development of rating scales, a sample assignment and revision/grading sheet for the assignment, and two additional assignments with a list of grading points for each.

The writing component includes maintaining a weekly journal, weekly compositions, and suggested prewriting exercises on a computer. The grammar skills component revolves around the instructor's assessment of individual student's needs and results in the assignment of individual grammar chapters for each student. After providing a week by week schedule of the three course modules, the course  description focuses on the nine course components: (1) assessment of students' writing ability, including the assessment test package; (2) the writing component, including sample journal assignments and journal topic sheets; information on weekly paragraph-writing, mini-essay, and essay assignments; and sample evaluation assignments; (3) lectures; (4) grammar instruction; (5) weekly student-instructor conferences; (6) computer-assisted instruction, including sample assignments; (7) peer editing; (8) reading assignments; and (9) library research.

        "description":"Data from a recent study of potential effects of friends' characteristics and friendship features on students' adjustment to school are used to illustrate the distinction between two contradictory assumptions about the path of peer influence. The first assumption, which is linked to the work of Bronfenbrenner, takes a negative view, and focuses on the friends' own characteristics, especially their attitudes and behavior. The second assumption, a positive view of peer influence attributed to Piaget and Sullivan, focuses on the features of the friendships. Positive features of friendship include intimacy, trust, and prosocial behavior, while negative features include conflict and rivalry. Subjects of the study were over 300 students from 5th, 8th, and 11th grades. Data suggest that  the first pathway incompletely describes friends' influence. Close and supportive friendships have positive effects on attitudes and behavior at school. Data also suggest that attention should be given to the negative features of friendship. Findings support these hypotheses: (1) the features of children's and adolescents' friendships have a greater impact on some aspects of adjustment than on others; and (2) age changes in the impact of friendship features vary across aspects of adjustment.

        "description":"Early childhood (ECE) programs should reflect the diversity of the populations and cultures for which they are designed. For example, there are varieties of support for early childhood education in the United States, where a basic distinction is made between programs for education and programs for child care. While some may believe that the alliance between the fields of ECE and child development is immutable and uniform, in reality programs differ in theories of development and educational ideology. Kohlberg and Mayer identified three educational ideologies that reflect different developmental theories: a romantic ideology reflecting a maturational view; a cultural transmission ideology reflecting a behavioral view; and a progressive ideology reflecting an interactionist,  constructivist view. Although for many years the romantic ideology was associated with most preprimary programs, at present, ECE program in the United States are characterized by a cultural transmission ideology or a progressive ideology. It is well to keep in mind that while programs for young children should be developmentally appropriate, they should also be worthwhile educationally. The starting place for educational program development should be a value statement on what children ought to be and become. Implications for educational practice and teacher education are discussed.

It stresses the importance of community programs and local empowerment in easing the stresses of changing family roles. The second section explores ways of caring for and educating the young  child. These include quality day care programs, home care, play groups, and programs for teenaged mothers and hard-to-reach families. The third section discusses the process of sharing and implementing a new model of early childhood education and care.

This report, which was adopted unanimously at the seminar's closing session is divided into three main sections: (1) The Parent and Community as Mediator; (2) The Professional and the Trained Parent as Mediator; and (3) The Socio-Physical Environment as Mediator. Topics discussed in section 1, on the parent and community as mediators, include the concept of marginality, examples of marginality, differences between industrialized and traditional societies, changes in women's work, marginalization in  industrialized settings, implications for the concept of marginality, the concept of parent education, combating the disadvantages of marginalization, child care workers in the community, the educative role of the family, and policy aspects. In section 2, the topic of the professional and the trained parent as mediators is discussed in terms of the influence of professionals' attitudes, developing new relationships, professionals, para-professionals, parents, essential skills and knowledge, community empowerment and whether such empowerment is always possible, universal principles in training, informal networks, and evaluation and advocacy. Section 3, on the socio-physical environment as mediator, deals with access to resources, itinerant peoples and land, housing and urban change, secure  and defensible space, nutritional imperatives, misleading nutritional beliefs, health imperatives, the knowledge and information environment, and the community's own initiative.

        "description":"Research suggests that: (1) teachers' use of praise may lower students' confidence in themselves; (2) systematic use of praise as a reinforcer in the classroom is impractical; (3) praise is a weak reinforcer; (4) various forms of praise have different effects on different kinds of students; and (5) use of praise is not the most powerful method for controlling deviant behavior and maintaining student attention. However, research also indicates that there are effective ways to praise students. The term &quot;effective praise,&quot; or &quot;encouragement,&quot; refers to a teacher's use of positive acknowledgments that neither judge student work nor assign status to the student. Encouragement offers specific, teacher-initiated, and private feedback that focuses on improvement and efforts, uses sincere  and direct comments, helps students appreciate their behaviors and achievements, avoids comparisons with others, helps children develop self-satisfaction from a task or product, and does not set the student up for failure. It is concluded that teachers who avoid ineffective praise and use encouragement create a classroom environment in which students do not fear continuous evaluation, can make and learn from mistakes, and do not need to strive to meet someone else's standard of excellence. Nine references are cited. (RH)",

The program aimed to provide developmentally appropriate activities for students believed to be &quot;at risk&quot; of failure in a regular kindergarten program. A total of 36 students participated. Testing indicated that participants made gains on all three student measures employed. Principals believed that the DK program: (1) differed from the regular program; (2) had certain advantages; (3) had a positive impact in their buildings; and (4) helped students avoid learning and behavior problems while promoting their academic and social growth. Principals recognized  the difficulties of starting such a program and indicated the lack of a guiding district philosophy. Teachers: (1) found differences and similarities among DK programs in different buildings; (2) believed that the DK program delivered many positive outcomes for students; (3) identified major concerns with the program; (4) differed in their expectations for the program's coming year; and (5) perceived the DK program as a means of developing alternative instructional strategies and sorting low-end students.

(2) What are likely trends of future evaluations? and (3) How can future trends take into account recent research in developmental psychology? Predictions are made on the basis of trends in ECD programs and evaluation, and advances in developmental psychology. Table 1 lists a dozen trends in early childhood education programs which have emerged in the last quarter of the 20th century, while Table 7 envisions characteristics of evaluation in the year 2010. The discussion of trends in evaluation research, which is supplemented with illustrative data tables, cites four exemplars of different types of research, each of which is a  prototype of design. It is maintained that research will vary in scale and be increasingly experimental and rigorous in design. Large scale designs will employ increasingly sensitive measures and follow up greater amounts of time. A section of the paper which outlines trends in developmental psychology notes dissatisfaction with Piagetian theory, itemizes the legacy of Piaget, and asserts that more must be known about the relationship between the child's intellect, emotions, and social world. An illustration of a transactional theory of development is given which serves to indicate the ways in which ECD programs can change children's thoughts and feelings through a cycle of causes and effects.

A total of 24 children 4 and 5 years of age, half from low socioeconomic status (SES) families and half from high, were observed while performing perceptual/performance cognitive tasks. Five tasks were presented. All test sessions were videotaped, and observers coded behavior using a continuous time sampling procedure. Three mutually exclusive state codes measured duration of behavior; these were attention, attention and on-task manipulation, and off-task behavior. Five event codes measured task talk, visual scanning, trial and error responding, impulsive responding, and helpless confirmation seeking. Frequency of behavior that reflected problem solving  strategies was recorded. Findings revealed that two of the behavior categories, \"helpless confirmation seeking\" and \"task talk,\" were associated with 77 percent of the variance in test performance. Significant SES differences were found in all of the five categories of observed behavior, except \"task talk.\" Results are discussed in terms of functional variables that are responsible for SES differences in performance.(RH)",

        "description":"Based on the assumption that the kind of instruction provided during testing is important when examining children's zones of proximal development, two methods of dynamic assessment, &quot;graduated prompt&quot; and &quot;mediation,&quot; were compared to each other and to static assessment. In dynamic assessment, the examiner sets up a learning environment in the testing situation and takes measures on changes from pre- to post-training performance and on the amount of instruction that was required from the tester for the child to obtain the posttest performance level. Developed originally for school-age children, the graduated prompt procedure includes a series of hints or prompts presented in a graduated sequence of increasing explicitness; children receive these aids in order to learn the rules  needed to solve the problem correctly. In the mediational assessment method, examiners intentionally and directly teach the principles and strategies needed for task completion. The standard static method measures only the products of prior learning. A total of 60 children 4 to 6 years of age who were at academic risk participated. Findings revealed that children receiving either method of dynamic assessment were better able to perform a cognitive task independently than were children receiving static assessment. Children receiving the mediation method of dynamic assessment performed a transfer task better than did the graduated prompt and static assessment groups. (RH)",

The comprehensive intervention was designed to provide psychosocial support and comprehensive health care for low-income women and infants during the mother's pregnancy and the first 2 years of the child's life. This report describes effects of the intervention on birthweight. Multiple regression analysis that used medical and social predictor variables showed a strong relationship between the set of predictors and the criterion variable of birthweight. Analyses  of variance for primiparous and multiparous mothers showed an effect of intervention on birthweight for primiparous but not multiparous mothers. There was a significant interaction between intervention and age group. Effects of the intervention were greater for 17- to 21-year-old mothers than for others.

The study finds that young people up to 19 years of age who attended the High/Scope Educational Research Foundation's Perry Preschool Program (PPP) in the early 1960s continue to outperform peers who did not attend preschool. The PPP provided an organized educational experience directed at the intellectual and social development of young children who participated, in most cases, for 2 years when they were 3 and 4 years of age. Fifty-eight children were assigned to the preschool group  called the experimental group and 65 children were assigned to the no-preschool group called the control group. The Perry Preschool study addressed the issue of whether high quality early childhood education would improve the lives of low-income children and their families, and the quality of life of the community as a whole. Sections of the report concern: (1) the background and context of the Perry Preschool Study; (2) preschool's effects on school success, early socioeconomic success, and social responsibility; (3) review and interpretation of study outcomes over time; (4) preschool's long-term impact; (5) the lessons of early childhood research; and (6) nine case studies of children growing up in Ypsilanti, Michigan.

Phases discussed concern: (1) definition and development of appropriate curriculum; (2) use of learning centers as an instructional setting; (3) use of assessment measures to stengthen a comprehensive early childhood program of instruction; and (4) development of a practical plan for implementing a comprehensive early  childhood instructional program. It is anticipated that by 1990 over 200 administrators will have completed the training. An example of the action plan format suggested for use in Phase 4 is included. (RH)",

This paper discusses aspects of these three components. Discussion of written policies focuses on the mandated reporter status of caregivers, state laws, procedures for reporting abuse, and daily classroom procedures. Aspects of the personal safety component include anatomically correct names for body parts, assertiveness skills, the right to privacy, differences in personal touches (the touch continuum), verbalization about unwanted touches, and ways in which a child can know whom to consult when troubled. Letters to parents concerning the curriculum content supplement the discussion. Material on  parent-teacher dialogues and meetings includes discussions of child sexual abuse, public laws, classroom policies and strategies, abuse prevention curriculum activities, the parental role in prevention, indicators of abuse, ways to handle a disclosure, and related books and materials.

        "author":["Nelson, Katherine"],
        "description":"Issues of meaning have become central concerns of research on language development. There are at least four reasons for the neglect of meaning by earlier researchers. First, Chomsky's original theory assumed that syntax could be described and explained independently of meaning. Second, linguists had long assumed that semantics was too messy and difficult to get involved in. Third, psychologists viewed semantics as too easy and transparent. Fourth, issues of meaning, as defined in adopted philosophical models, seemed to psychologists and linguists to be too remote from the problems faced by the language-learning child. This paper: (1) indicates how each of these four reasons for neglect gave way in the light of new research; (2) sketches some recent approaches that address lexical  meaning as a problem in its own right; and (3) describes a framework considered appropriate for further research into the process of how language is learned and the question of how word meanings and concepts relate to each other. The general approach described constitutes a functional framework for conceptual and semantic development, one that is based on the assumption that the child's mind is a system that is open to the potential and constraints of the social, cultural, and communicative world in which the child develops.

The program focused on: (1) developing a method of referring students for testing; (2) providing a specialized motor diagnostic test; (3) improving students' self-esteem; and (4) promoting administrator and teacher awareness of the importance of identifying and remediating students with motor skill deficiencies. Participants were 3 girls and 7 boys in the first grade. After target children were pretested and results were evaluated, activities that would improve the children's motor skills were designed. Activities were scheduled over a 10-week period and involved exercise stations  for warm-ups, balance, agility, sequencing, visual acuity, auditory discrimination, and coordination. Evaluation results showed that children improved significantly in their overall motor development. Six of the ten children showed improvement in self-esteem. Recommendations are offered regarding the use of the report as a guide for administrators who wish to adopt a similar developmental motor skills program in their schools. Related materials, such as lists of the motor skills activities and symptoms of perceptual difficulties are appended. (RH)",

GAO found that ACYF has been diligent about recouping Child Welfare Services incentive funds once a state has been determined to be ineligible for these funds. Conversely, ACYF has been slow to review the performance of some states that have failed compliance reviews in previous years, resulting in payments of about 24.7 million dollars since 1984 to six  states that may not have been eligible for those funds. Recommendations and ACYF comments are included in the text, along with an appended table of data on incentive funds paid to states after they failed their most recent compliance reviews. (RH)",

A total of 9,444 children were enrolled in 436 classes in 171 schools located in 32 community school districts. The program ran from 8:30 AM to 2:30 PM, Monday through Friday, and included breakfast, lunch, and snacks. Each classroom of 22 children was staffed by a teacher and an educational paraprofessional. A sample of 32 schools was randomly selected from the participating schools. Data for the evaluation were collected in a variety of ways. Any information that was available for the entire population of students or staff was analyzed and included in this report. Findings suggest that,  given the short time available for planning and setting up classrooms and an unexpectedly large enrollment, the program was well implemented. Most program staff had had previous early childhood experience. Classroom activities were largely experiential. Over 95 percent of the parents believed the program had helped their children grow academically and socially. Sections of the report concern background, program administration, the children, the staff, the classrooms, parent involvement, child and family case studies, conclusions and recommendations.

        "description":"A study gauged the effectiveness of prenatal intervention with low socioeconomic, first-time fathers whose partners were experiencing a high- or low-risk pregnancy. Of the 67 men, who were recruited by their partners, half were randomly assigned to participate in an intervention program designed to acquaint fathers-to-be with information, insights, and clinically appropriate techniques in responsive care for infants. Intervention group fathers received two intensive sessions on the nature and capabilities of the preborn and newborn, sensitive responsiveness to preborn and newborn cues and partner cues. After infants' births, fathers were videotaped with infants during two feeding interactions. At time one, intervention fathers were rated from videotapes as significantly more  sensitive during feeding interactions. At time two, 1 month later, differences between father groups approached significance. It is concluded that findings demonstrate that an information support program for first-time, low socioeconomic class fathers is feasible, particularly when women in high- or low-risk pregnancies enlist their partners' participation.

Teachers reported that they found the first year of the program to be simultaneously exciting and frustrating. Over 80 percent of the teachers involved in the project believed that student achievement had improved and that they had noticed changes in children's attitudes toward school and learning. Most problems encountered by teachers related to their learning to work cooperatively with other teachers and to schedule the movement of children between classrooms. Although teachers planned a variety of activities to involve parents, relatively few parents attended. Children showed  statistically significant improvement in social skills as measured by a teacher-administered Child Behavior Rating Scale. Although there was only a slight improvement in attendance, a larger percentage of children had an over 90 percent attendance rate in 1987-88 than in 1986-87. Kindergarten children scored slightly above grade level in language, and first-graders scored slightly below grade level in reading on the Metropolitan Achievement Test. Only 25 percent of second-graders scored at or above grade level on the second-grade city wide reading test. Recommendations for program improvement are offered. (RH)",

        "description":"This study investigates prevention and treatment programs that deal with rural child sexual abuse in the State of Washington. A survey of 61 rural service providers examined agencies, services provided, problems faced in service delivery, and innovative solutions to those problems. The study compares responses from three types of agencies (mental health centers, child protective services, and sexual assault programs). Over 80% of all clinicians surveyed perceived a lack of trained counselors or resources to deal with the problem of child sexual abuse. Only 48% of those providing services thought child sexual abuse victims were receiving good services. The rating of problems by agency staffs showed a pattern of staff shortages, lack of resources, and increasing caseloads among all  three types of rural agencies. Other problems included poor interagency coordination, lack of community support, and problems stemming from societal denial of sexual abuse. Agencies pointed to successes of community education programs on sexual abuse as a means of combatting denial of the problem. Coordination among existing services and agencies also appeared to be a successful approach. The report concludes that rural professionals dealing with child sexual abuse need additional resources and funding. This paper contains 32 references. (TES)",

A total of 407 randomly selected households were called and asked about finances, employment, plans to move, interest in buying homes, housing costs, and other economic indicators. Results were compared with those from similar surveys done in June and November 1987. The survey results are placed in the context of the 1980s economic boom and the recession produced by the worldwide oil boom and bust. Respondents reported less unemployment, more households with higher incomes, fewer households with deteriorating finances, and more households willing to spend money on vacations and other nonessentials. However, although the earnings of many  Anchorage residents have increased, job benefits and hours worked have not, and many respondents reported improved finances because households with two wage earners increased from 35 to 51%. Lower housing prices reflected the effects of recession but improved the financial situation of many residents now paying reduced rents and mortgages. Owners of residential investment properties and commercial properties were more likely to report worsened financial conditions than other residents. This report contains 10 tables. (DHP)",

Americans are becoming more open to school-community cooperation and to expanding the school's mission to include community development. Such cooperation involves communication among community leaders, local business people, the media, the school, and its students. Each of these parties has a defined role to play. Students should be encouraged to study the community to learn about its economy, about research methods, and about themselves as citizens. The results of students' research can then be used to make decisions and chart plans for development. A &quot;blueprint&quot; for studying the community is offered, beginning with simple observation and  interviews. Other &quot;blueprints&quot; include strategies for school-based entrepreneurship, schools and community development, community input and investment, and integration of community material into school courses. Several examples are offered of schools that improved their programs by using the communities as their focus of study. A sample community survey and a sample business plan are provided.

Forty teachers and administrators from various levels in the public school system were interviewed in 1988. Interviewees were primarily located in southern Mexican cities. Mexico's public educational structure is highly centralized. In elementary and secondary schools, the same curricula is used throughout the country. Higher education, indigenous, and adult education systems are described. Separate questionnaires were developed for administrators and classroom teachers. At all levels, respondents indicated that they worked with children from middle to lower-class backgrounds, and educators reported problems related to economic factors. They perceived that the  cost of school materials, for example, posed burdens on Mexican families. A common complaint was that private schools were able to offer a better education than public schools. The results also suggested program strengths, including perceived community support at the elementary levels and an apparent increase in educational opportunities for low-income students. Quality of materials was judged to be adequate, although many educators would like to have access to a greater variety of materials. Other questions touched upon job satisfaction, teacher inservice training, and adult and indigenous education programs. Overall strengths include perceived social progress and an effort to reach more people through different teaching approaches, whereas problems included apathy, lack of funding, and  structural inflexibility. This document includes English translations of the questionnaires. (TES)",

The paper examines college participation through a series of interviews with elementary school students, recent high school graduates not attending college, school and community leaders, and college students from the area. The dominant socializing influences of family, school, and community formed the basis for analysis of the data. Interviews showed many lower-class parents took a laissez-faire attitude toward education and career choices, leaving responsibility with young teenagers, while middle-class parents insisted that children plan for high educational and career objectives. Schools reinforced  this influence, channeling students into vocational or college preparatory courses in ninth grade. Respondents also saw counseling as reinforcing class values in college decisions. For many, obtaining a college education represented a potential threat to remaining in the area, although the possibility of outmigration could provide motivation for some working class students. Ironically, life is just good enough for many lower-class subjects in this study to produce comfort and self-satisfaction, rather than motivation to strive beyond their parents' class and educational status.

But whether a community is large or small, a group must be well-organized before it begins to make decisions concerning the design and purpose of a small-business SUF. This primer highlights some main points a community should ponder before even starting on the long path to establish, operate, and maintain a local SUF successfully. It assumes that a community has decided to consider an SUF. The discussion in each section of the primer gives alternatives, possibilities, or advice that will be guideposts for decision makers. The community will ultimately have to decide the goals of its SUF, and how it will be set up, structured, and operated. The first  section deals with setting the stage, helping communities answer the questions of whether or not a local SUF is needed and attainable, and how it might best fit in with other programs. Major pitfalls to avoid include: (1) lack of oversight; (2) poor use of investment instruments; and (3) defining too small a service area. Starting with a business plan, communities should then define: (1) what the SUF will do; (2) how large it should be; (3) a SUF business organization form; (4) investment objectives; and (5) the investment instruments it will use. Communities must also find a source of funds, cover their liabilities, and consider other possibilities for fully accomplishing its goals. Ideas are offered for community action. (TES)",

The first therapeutic riding centers were built during the late 1950s in Great Britain. Today, there are well over 350 accredited therapeutic riding centers in North America. Therapeutic riding is categorized into three areas: sport/recreation, medical, and education/psychology. While evidence of improved coordination, strength, and self-concept appears as a result of therapeutic horseback riding, scientific research and evidence of benefits is lacking. The current study used 15 physically disabled adults who were given tests before and after an 8-week therapeutic horseback riding program. Another group of 24 physically disabled adults, half of whom took part in the riding program, were  given posttests only. The most noted disabilities in this study were head trauma, visual impairment, arthritis, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy. Participants were tested in self-concept, and in strength and coordination. Strength and coordination were measured using an electronic Strength and Coordination Instrument (SCI Model #1). Results showed improvement in coordination for subjects who participated in the riding program. No significant differences were found in self-concept or strength scores.

        "author":["Ainsworth, Robert G."],
        "description":"This booklet provides an overview of the labor market problems facing Indians and Native Americans, the most economically disadvantaged ethnic group in the United States. It summarizes Indian policy, particularly major policies and laws that relate to early trade restrictions and the exploitation of Indians through trade; their forced removal from their land; establishment of the reservation system, land allotments, and assimilation; termination and relocation policy; and the more recent policies of self-determination. Discussion considers Indian population and labor force estimates and examines barriers to Indian employment. Lack of jobs on or near reservations is the greatest problem, but poor education and training, inadequate English language capability, tribal ties to the  reservation, a culture that is not job-oriented, and poor housing and health conditions, and inadequate transportation are also cited. There are many federal programs for Indians, ranging from housing assistance, to health and transportation services, to education and training for jobs. A number of these programs are listed. But the report suggests that a high degree of overlap and fragmentation of federal programs hampers their effectiveness among Indians. Coordination of federal programs and further federal research, especially on effectiveness of JTPA programs, are recommended. This report contains 25 references. (DHP)",

        "description":"Students come to the classroom with theories that they have actively constructed from their everyday experiences. However, some of these theories are incomplete half-truths. Although such misconceptions interfere with new learning, students are often emotionally and intellectually attached to them. Some common mathematical misconceptions involve: (1) confusion between variables and labels, with failure to understand that variables stand for numerical expressions; (2) mistakes about the way that an original price and a sale price reflect one another; (3) misconceptions about the independent nature of chance events; and (4) reluctance to multiply fractions. Hispanic students display some unique mathematical error patterns resulting from differences in language or culture. In  addition, linguistic difficulties increase the frequency with which Hispanic students commit the same errors as Anglo students. Since students will not easily give up their misconceptions, lecturing them on a particular topic has little effect. Instead, teachers must help students to dismantle their own misconceptions. One effective technique induces conflict by drawing out the contradictions in students' misconceptions. In the three steps of this technique, the teacher probes for qualitative, quantitative, and conceptual understanding, asking questions rather than telling students the right answer. In the process of resolving the conflicts that arise, students actively reconstruct the concept in question and truly overcome their misconceptions. This digest contains 10 references.  (SV)",

        "author":["Beaulieu, Lionel J."],
        "description":"Monumental social and economic problems confront the rural communities of the South. Diversification of the rural economy is the key to revitalizing the rural South, but new industries, anticipating the need for a more highly skilled work force, find the region's human capital resources to be deficient. Vibrant economies are not sustainable in a rural South that leads the nation in the rate of high school dropouts and the proportion of adults that are functionally illiterate. In 1988 nearly 39% of all Southern nonmetro adults and 55% of Southern nonmetro blacks lacked a high school education, compared to 24.4% of all metropolitan Southerners. In 1980 an estimated 25% of all rural Southerners and 40% of rural Southern blacks were functionally illiterate. In addition, the better  educated young people are leaving rural areas, showing the greatest net outmigration rates from the rural South in 1985-87. It has been suggested that these problems are symptomatic of an educational system gone awry, and that a turnaround must commence with an overhaul of the educational system. Placing the burden on the educational system alone is not, however, satisfactory. Rather, these problems must become the collective concern of the family, the school, and the community. Building partnerships among these important local elements is essential, partnerships that send a clear signal to all residents that academic performance and literacy are highly valued goals of the community. A vital ingredient in this collaboration is progressive community leadership. This paper contains 59  references and 10 graphs and figures. (SV)",

This report reviews the characteristics, needs, and efforts to improve rural education in this region. Two critical problems involve students' thinking and reasoning skills and academic performance of children from low-income families. Educators also identify lack of community and parent involvement as serious problems. West Virginia data suggest that the teaching force is aging, though becoming somewhat more highly trained. Initial analysis suggests that student  achievement is lower in rural than non-rural districts. Lower student achievement, however, appears to be associated with the comparatively greater poverty that characterizes rural areas. Resources to improve education in the AEL region are scarce. Difficulties in the region, however, have provided opportunities for such innovations as distance learning, school-based development, and development of curricular and instructional techniques appropriate to rural schools. Equity in school funding is crucial to adequate support of rural education. AEL is identifying promising practices, and communicating such information through a newsletter. A model of school improvement is presently being demonstrated in four poor, rural sites in the region. This report contains 19 references.  (DHP)",

Hence, designing least restrictive environment (LRE) services is crucial in further improving this type of program. Traditional models of service delivery to handicapped students are not appropriate for rural school systems because many presumed conditions for those models do not exist in rural settings. The diversity of rural communities requires the planner to consider multiple factors affecting LRE services. These factors are interrelated and their combinations should be stressed in service planning. Factors that cannot be controlled by the model  designer are called &quot;givens,&quot; such as population, distance from students to services, ages and disabilities of students, and existing personnel. Factors that can be manipulated by the planner are termed &quot;variables,&quot; such as staff development, transportation, and staffing for services. Planners must manipulate &quot;variables&quot; after recognizing the &quot;givens.&quot; As no model is directly transportable, various successful models are described: state funded and statewide models, local cooperative administrative models, the &quot;resource room&quot; model, and models that identify scarce resources, incorporate advanced technologies, or use paraprofessionals.

        "description":"Seventeen papers review recent changes in the structure and performance of the rural economy and examine alternative policies to facilitate the adjustment of displaced people and their communities. Some point to economic structural change in the 1980s as the cause of financial stress in rural America, in sharp contrast with the 1970s when growth and economic vitality were the dominant rural themes. Results indicate a rural economy that has shifted from dependence on natural resource-based industries to increasing reliance on manufacturing and low-wage, low-skilled service industries. At the same time, the rural economy has apparently become more closely linked to national and global economies, making it more sensitive to changes in macro policy and global competition. Downturns  in industries that are important to rural areas indicate a national rural decline accompanied by underdeveloped human resources. Problems associated with rural policy are viewed at the macro, sectoral, territorial, and human resource levels. The analysis of rural conditions and economic forces at work leads to observations about alternatives for future rural policy: (1) future development policies must allow industries to modernize and become more competitive; (2) rural economic policies that depend on the revival of farming, mining, or energy sectors are unlikely to succeed; and (3) states may be key to promoting collaboration among neighboring rural communities. The document concludes that the choice of national rural development policy is ultimately political, a balancing of interests  among groups whose futures are being affected. The various papers in this collection include about 275 references and numerous tables, graphs, and maps. (TES)",

Part 1 was a controlled study that compared the Mastering Fractions program to a more traditional fractions curriculum while controlling for any novelty effect of the videodisc medium. Part 2 of the evaluation was a descriptive study that examined the use of \"Mastering Fractions\" in non-experimentally controlled classroom environments. Both in Part 1 and Part 2, all students were given a 69-item pre- and posttest that examined the learning objectives from a basal series math curriculum and the Mastering Fractions program. The use of the videodisc program resulted in gains in fractions skills and  concepts. The results of structured interviews with both teachers and students indicated that the program was received very positively.

The purpose of the study was to provide empirically derived data in both a qualitative and quantitative format of the non-major to improve the course. Over 600 students were administered the Learning Style Profile (LSP) and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to determine the students' learning styles as a predictor for success in the course. The differences between the MBTI profile and other profiles published were examined among sample groups. Selection Ratio Type Table (SRTT) analysis was done between sample and comparison groups. The only LSP subscale which showed a difference between students who were successful and  those who were not was spatial ability. Canonical correlation showed that the SLP and the MBTI were related at a level of 0.5 for the first canonical variate. Recommendations for course improvement are suggested. The materials of Biology 110, instruments administration, the MBTI scoring program, and statistical results are appended. (Author/YP)",

The paper emphasizes the retarding effect on Newton's development of inappropriate but deep-rooted models at a qualitative level, and the extent to which his experience suggests the necessity for students to struggle conceptually in order to construct the models employed by physicists.

The project was conducted using a 7th-grade class at an intermediate school in Utah. Data were analyzed for 12 students in a special class for students not having the necessary basic mathematics skills to enroll in a regular class. Students used math computer lab twice a week. The volunteers determined what mathematics skills each student needed to practice by referring to the student files, determined what software program would be appropriate for the student, and managed all the necessary student data. Both quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed for: (1) achievement; (2) attitude about  mathematics; (3) mathematics anxiety; (4) study habits; (5) positive reinforcement; and (6) individual help from an adult. Qualitative data collected through personal interviews, volunteer tutor activity sheets, and field notes were analyzed to identify participants' perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the project.

Chapters 1-3 of this book provide the Education for Democracy Project's Statement of Principles, a consideration of history's role as the core of social studies education, and the role of textbooks in teaching world history. Chapters 4-14 examine five selected world history textbooks in terms of included information about and treatment of: (1) the purpose of history instruction; (2) the Greek legacy; (3) Rome's fall and legacy; (4) Judaism's and Christianity's basic ideas; (5) the Middle Ages as a source of representative government; (6) the 17th century English Parliament; (7) ideas from the Enlightenment; (8) the American and French Revolutions; (9) major ideas of the 19th century; (10)  nation-states, nationalism, and imperialism; (11) World War I; (12) totalitarianism; (13) U.S. foreign policy; and (14) democracy in the world since 1945. This book concludes that these world history textbooks tend to neglect democracy's ideas, principles, origins, needs, and significance and that, when included, these concepts are not systematically presented.

These factors appear to have been important in affecting the relative success of educational programs in Ponam. Findings suggest that researchers and policy makers concerned with education need to pay attention to the ways villagers respond to formal education. The first section constitutes a discussion of the changes in the economic position of Ponam Island, and Manus more generally, brought about by colonization and the current economic position of Ponam itself. It is shown that important influences on Ponam's relationship to schooling are broad social and economic forces. In the second section, the author looks at the beliefs,  practices, and values of Ponam society and the ways these shape and reflect islanders' response to education. Islanders see no conflict of importance between the reasons for success in school and the reasons for success in village life. Ponam's use of the sorts of practical knowledge and skills which might be taught in a more vocationally oriented curriculum shows that in attempts at village improvement or development through education, consideration needs to be given not just to the sorts of skills that villagers would have to acquire to improve their lives, but also to the social factors affecting the use of those skills.

Three frameworks related to historical understanding are presented: (1) the thinking skills/information processing framework; (2) the cognitive structure framework; and (3) the response theory framework. A curriculum development model is outlined using four stages: (1) the research stage in which the general historical theme is identified and developed, primary and secondary sources are reviewed, a context is specified, and questions and hypotheses are formulated; (2) the sorting stage in which primary source materials are reviewed, a grade level is chosen, and historical investigation skills are described; (3) the activity development stage in which primary source  materials are adopted and evidence gathering worksheets are developed; and (4) the lesson writing stage in which pupil motivation, lesson objectives, and monitoring and evaluative techniques are reviewed. Three studies describing the curriculum process are provided. Using the theme of lives of children and families at the turn of the century, the studies include: &quot;Family Life in Cloquet, Minnesota, 1900-1910&quot;; &quot;Urban Fringe Farm Families, 1860-1900&quot;; and &quot;The Messages in Women's Magazine Ads, 1897-1910.&quot; A 40-item bibliography is included.

        "description":"&quot;The Federalist Papers,&quot; a collection of 85 essays on the principles of republican government written to support the ratification of the Constitution of 1787, has been praised as an outstanding work by individuals ranging from such founding fathers as Thomas Jefferson and George Washington to contemporary scholars in history and government. Some basic constitutional concepts treated in &quot;The Federalist&quot; include: (1) majority rule with minority rights; (2) public order with private rights; and (3) national sovereignty with states' rights. Yet this classic work is only mentioned briefly, if at all, in high school textbooks. While it is possible that teachers may feel the central ideas of &quot;The Federalist&quot; are no longer applicable in contemporary classrooms or curricula or that the  rhetoric is too difficult for the average student to comprehend, a credible case for the inclusion of these essays can be made. The reasons for making such a case are: (1) the essays are the keys to knowledge of constitutional government and citizenship in the United States; (2) &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; reflect core values in the civic culture; and (3) these papers are directly connected to the curriculum of history, government, and civics. Strategies that could be used to introduce these materials into the curriculum are: (1) document based teaching and learning; (2) issue based teaching and learning; and (3) course-wide infusion of content. Education for constitutional democracy should not be viewed as an ideological exercise, but as an extension to each new generation of citizens of the  challenge confronted by James Madison and others of the founding period.

        "author":["Grigsby, Jill S."],
        "description":"Population aging refers to an entire age structure becoming older. The age structure of a population is the result of three basic processes: fertility, mortality, and migration. Age structures reflect both past effects and current patterns of these processes. At the town, city, or regional level, migration becomes an important factor in raising the age level of the population, but in general the age structure of countries is more dependent on fertility and mortality. High fertility and high mortality ultimately produce a young population, while low fertility and low mortality in the long run produce an older population. A shift from high fertility and mortality to low fertility and mortality has accompanied industrialization in the developed world. Typically, mortality among the  youngest age group declines first, resulting in a younger population. The population aging process begins when fertility declines. As mortality declines among the older age groups, the population ages further. It takes some time for the population to reach a stable age structure reflecting low fertility and mortality. Population aging around the world is inevitable for the 21st century. The demographic transition will require adjustment from social institutions. Four countries that exemplified the four stages of aging in 1985 are discussed (Nigeria, Brazil, Korea, and West Germany). Fifteen charts, graphs, and tables are provided to illustrate various aspects of this population aging process. A 9-item bibliography is included. (JB)",

The writers of human rights documents throughout history have realized that the surest sanctuary for human rights is not in public documents, but in the minds of the people. There are three challenges for civic education about human rights. (1) A challenge of conceptualization exists, i.e., defining human rights, examining and appraising alternative positions about their meaning. As societies evolve, what citizens perceive as \"new\" rights and interpretations evolve from \"old\" rights and  interpretations. (2) There is the challenge of analyzing the value conflicts in human rights documents. The paradoxical problem of human rights and freedom, or how to conjoin majority rule and minority rights to create a workable synthesis in an orderly society challenges all citizens to search for acceptable limits on contending forces. (3) The challenge of connecting national and international perspectives in the education of citizens must be faced. Citizens around the globe are more likely today than in the past to challenge violations of human rights both within and outside of their national political systems. Lessons on human rights that include international perspectives should balance human diversity with the fundamental unity of mankind. (PPB)",

Chapter 1 of this book looks at the Korean educational system and identifies the patterns of thought concerning education, the values underlying these patterns, and their defining implications for educational development. Chapter 2 provides the theoretical background through an extensive review of the literature. Chapter 3 builds the conceptual model which highlights different patterns of viewing educational characteristics of Korean society using Singleton's conceptual classification and Berger's social construction model. Chapter 4 describes the procedure of constructing a questionnaire according to the model and administering the survey. The  findings of the survey are described in chapter 5 and include a profile of the sample population of 850 teachers, 5,040 parents, and 5,560 students, their value orientations, the desired value orientations of education, and an evaluation of school educational systems. Findings indicate that 76 percent of the sample believes that humanism should be more respected than materialism in social development and change. Additionally, 89 percent of parents want their sons to have a university education, while only 70 percent want the same for their daughters. The findings also reveal that the typical public conception of schooling is associated with the humanistic model, rather than the gate-keeper or Confucian models. (PPB)",

High quality graduate dissertations have a role to play in carrying forward research agendas such as these.

The two are inextricably intertwined: the demarcation of facts rests squarely on considerations of values; evaluations are infused with considerations of fact. A category scheme provides the resources for stating various truths and falsehoods and for demarcating conceptual boundaries. But the values that the schemes realize are not always, or only, the ones people intend to produce. In building a system of thought, people begin with a provisional scaffolding made of the relevant beliefs already held, the aims of the projects already embarked on, and the values they seek to uphold. System building is dialectical.  Specific judgments are molded to accepted generalizations, and generalizations to specific judgments. Justification is holistic. Support for a conclusion comes not from a single line of argument, but from a host of considerations of varying degrees of relevance and strength. That which is right relative to one acceptable system may be wrong relative to another. (PPB)",

In 1818, Prince Saunders, of Boston, praised Haiti to his fellow blacks and planned to work with Haiti's King Henry Christophe to encourage their emigration to that country. However, a rebellion and the king's death interfered. The country's new president, Jean Pierre Boyer, saw immigration of blacks from the United States as a solution to all his problems. Haiti was desperately short of manpower, and Boyer, who feared a French invasion, needed allies. He  thought that in return for taking in thousands of unwanted free blacks, a grateful U.S. Government would grant him diplomatic recognition. He offered to subsidize their relocation and envisioned the arrival of 6,000 settlers in the first year. Emigration societies sprang up in the United States all along the Atlantic seaboard and as far west as Cincinnati. The relocation process was not always successful, and some disenchanted blacks returned to the United States. However, many others stayed and sent back glowing reports of their newly adopted country.

        "author":["Hufford, Mary"],
        "description":"In 1978, the U.S. Congress established the Pinelands National Reserve on a million-acre landscape of New Jersey woodlands, farms, marshes, suburbs, towns, rivers, and bays. The reserve was to protect not only the region's great natural beauty and scientific value, but also the cultural life of its people, which is largely undocumented. In 1983, the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress inaugurated the Pinelands Folklife Project, a field survey that documented on audio tape and film hundreds of residents of the area, capturing images of their lives in songs, stories, recipes, poems, crafts, festivals, recreation, tools, and technologies. Like natural resources, such expressions warrant consideration from planners, but their intangible aspects pose a special  challenge. This document refutes the popular image of the region as a wilderness sparsely populated with quaint, backwoods people, presenting instead a place rich in cultural and environmental diversity and describing how residents convey their sense of place through myriad cultural expressions, which planners can factor into their land-use decisions. The concluding chapter on cultural conservation makes specific recommendations for protecting the region's cultural heritage. Dozens of illustrations, including black and white photographs, line drawings, and charts and maps from the Pinelands Folklife Project Archive complement the description and analysis. Appendices provide information on the logistics of the survey and a checklist for development review for municipal planning boards.  (JB)",

        "description":"The first purpose of a high school course in U.S. history must be to help students understand the essence of democracy and those events, institutions, and forces that have either promoted or obstructed it. This review examines five textbooks and analyzes how useful they are in aiding that process, and how they might be made more helpful. The five texts are: (1) \"A History of the United States\" (D. Boorstin; B. Kelley); (2) \"History of a Free People\" (H. Bragdon; S. McCutchen); (3) \"The United States: A History of the Republic\" (J. Davidson; M. Lytle); (4) \"People and Our Country\" (N. Risjord; T. Haywoode); (5) \"Triumph of the American Nation\" (L. Todd; M. Curti). The texts are reviewed using topic divisions such as: \"History's Role in Civic Education\"; \"Old World Backgrounds\";\"Civil War and Emancipation\"; \"Change and Reform Before World War I\"; and \"Depression, New Deal, and War Again.\" The textbooks under review are at one and the same time over-detailed and under-detailed: the first, because they try to mention something about everything; the second, because they fail to develop major themes in depth. They labor too hard to balance affirmation and negation of U.S. history, and the result is a detached neutrality, passionless about both the ugly and the beautiful moments in that history. The texts should convey the complication, drama, suspense, and the paradox of comedy and tragedy found in history. The Education for Democracy Project's Statement of Principles and its signatories are given in the appendix. (PPB)",

The software programs reviewed feature a variety of graphic, textual, and interactive qualities. The difficulty with comparing simulations (and the less complex interactive tutorials) lies in determining whether to do so according to the educational or substantive content, or according to the sophistication of the programming and presentation. The computer can be best used to add value to professorial time by permitting students to learn on their own time in a manner that is more motivational that conventional  homework.

        "description":"This publication provides a brief introduction to core ideas of constitutional government in the United State as presented in &quot;The Federalist&quot; by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. The first of &quot;The Federalists&quot; papers was written by Hamilton, who joined with Jay and Madison in this series of essays to refute the objections to the Constitution raised by the Anti-Federalists. Excerpts from both &quot;The Federalists&quot; and &quot;The Anti-Federalists&quot; series of publications are included. Both sides viewed liberty and order as the necessary ends of government, but could not agree as to what an acceptable balance between liberty and order would be. There was also disagreement within the Federalist camp. Hamilton argued that a strong central government was required to preserve the  governmental integrity of the nation, and that checks and balances between the three branches of government would prevent any one branch from abusing its powers. Madison argued that government must have the power to maintain itself and perform its duties, but he spoke for limits to protect the liberty and security of the individual. Information and ideas that can be used in a Federalist/ Anti-Federalist forum focusing on the primary issue of the balance between liberty and order are presented. Suggestions are made on how to structure and conduct the forums. A chronology of events associated with the Federalist/Anti-Federalist debate, a guide for teachers and forum leaders, a participant rating sheet for the forum, and a bibliography of 18 items are also included.

These five themes, developed by the Joint Committee on Geographic Education of the National Council for Geographic Education and the American Association of Geographers, have recently been adopted by many U.S. schools. By using this handbook, parents can connect everyday learning experiences in the home and neighborhood to the curriculum in school. They can also direct the  natural curiosity of children toward questions and knowledge in geography. In addition to the learning activities for children, the handbook contains a glossary of geographic terms, lists of sources for acquiring free or inexpensive materials, and a list of books for children on various topics in physical and cultural geography. Supporting materials include an outline map of the United States and a press release and publication announcement concerning the contents and uses of this handbook. (JP)",

        "description":"This report presents results of the 1988 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) survey of the geographic knowledge and skills of high school seniors. A national stratified sample of more than 3,000 twelfth graders from approximately 300 public and private schools responded to 76 multiple-choice questions about the following 4 topics in geography: (1) knowing locations, such as countries, cities, and physical places; (2) using the skills and tools of geography, such as map and globe symbols and longitude and latitude; (3) understanding cultural geography, including human-environment relationships and cultural change; and (4) understanding physical geography, including climate, weather, tectonics, and erosion. The respondents correctly answered only 57 percent of the  test items. Average scores for the four topics in the test ranged from 52.5 percent correct on geographic skills to 59.5 percent correct in the cultural geography category. These results indicate that students generally are deficient in geographic knowledge and skills. This problem may be associated with inadequate treatment of geography in the high school curriculum. Much of the geography presented to high school students is integrated with courses in history and science. Less than two-thirds of these respondents had taken a high school course in geography. There was no relationship, however, between taking geography coursework and better performance on this test. But students who studied geography in a U.S. history course performed better than those without this academic experience.  Better performance on this test was linked to certain background factors, such as well-educated parents, both parents living at home, availability of many reading materials, limited viewing of television, and time spent doing homework. Additional materials include reactions of researchers and educators, press release materials, and statements from officials of the Office of Educational Research and Improvement, the NAEP, and the National Geographic Society.

The focus of the second section is to review recent literature where the characteristics of the student were viewed as the dependent variable. The third section reviews research that investigated the mediating processes between teacher and student that contribute to teacher expectations and student performance. There was apparent agreement that teachers' predictions of test scores tended to be overestimated for high achievers and underestimated for low achievers. Student characteristics contributing to  expectation included social class, attractiveness, ethnicity and perhaps gender.

A description is given of the roles and duties of each of these committee members. The principal is generally the person who organizes the administrative tasks of the  committee. The teacher educator serves as the link to the teacher training program and the literature on teaching, and also serves as a channel of feedback to the teacher training program.

Focusing upon the institutions of higher education in Nigeria, questions are raised on the role of the college or university in producing educated persons. It is pointed out that schools of higher education have a responsibility to be aware that educational curricula developed for oppressed peoples by the oppressor are not conducive to enhancing independence and self-actualization. A call is issued for developing the ability to think creatively and to judge critically. A sense of autonomy is emphasized as being necessary for developing responsible awareness of community and liberty. (JD)",

These schools are public elementary, middle, or secondary schools which are structured, staffed, and supported to achieve three goals: student achievement, teacher induction, and support of research directed at the continuous improvement of practice. The professional practice school should be developed as a collaborative institution with the roles and responsibilities shared among university and school district personnel. With a status similar to the medical teaching hospital, it becomes the teaching site for clinical faculty and the place where university researchers, who are oriented toward research in practice, may work with public school teachers. The  pre-clinical education of interns remains a university responsibility. Three papers are presented which deal with issues of accountability, curriculum, and standards for professional practice schools. An additional paper provides background for the conceptual framework. The papers included are: (1) &quot;Accountability for Professional Practice&quot; (Linda Darling-Hammond); (2) &quot;Professional Practice Schools: How Would We Know One if We Saw One?

They also examined children's learning of mathematics through the viewing and discussion of videotapes. The second stage extended this work through a structured program of classroom follow-up and support. Assuming that transfer of learning to the classroom occurs most predictably where demonstration, feedback and coaching are components of the teacher education process,  consultants observed participants' classroom behaviors and provided feedback and suggestions.

Descriptive summaries of each year's progress are followed by bibliographic listings of related research reports, presentations and  publications. Research and evaluation of the pilot-test program over a period of time has resulted in the following three major findings: (1) successful change and reform can be influenced by intervention programs such as career ladders, but it is primarily dependent upon well-developed and effective school systems; (2) the association between teacher performance and competency based on process and developmental evaluation can scientifically be related to reliable and valid student academic achievement measures; and (3) while the Career Ladders Pilot-Test Program does an excellent job of assuring teacher accountability, it has been far less successful with respect to assessing the corresponding accountability of other key factors of district operational effectiveness.

However, for teacher education policy makers in settings like Mauritius there are two special issues to be considered in the examination of the teacher education process. The first relates to the critical decisions that have to be made regarding allocation of scarce resources to education and the fight that teacher education has for a share of these resources. The second relates to shortage of trained teachers and the concomitant struggle to address both quality and quantity in the teacher education program. In this paper, the author examines the concept of teacher growth and how models of teacher growth can help facilitate  a rapprochement between quality and quantity in teacher education programs during times of teacher shortages in places like Mauritius. The questions posed in the Ministry of Education Country Paper provides a framework for suggestions regarding teacher education in Mauritius. (Author)",

The major focus on the project was to help teachers develop and implement approaches to mathematics instruction based on a constructivist view of learning. ELM demonstrated the significant impact of combining constructivist summer inservice institutes with intensive, ongoing follow-up support. Teachers not only integrated into their instruction new strategies, but also showed evidence of having developed constructivist views of mathematics learning as a basis for their instructional decisions. Students attitude scores and teachers observations reflected improvements in students' attitudes about, conceptions of, and communication in  mathematics as well as in problem solving and conceptual understanding. ELM demonstrated that teachers can make student understanding and problem solving high priority and decrease emphasis on computational skills without a drop of in tests results. This monograph describes the ELM Project's philosophical basis and methodology, and presents the instrumentation results, and conclusions in detail.

The study was designed to be the first in a series of studies to find out if Elementary Education students are learning appropriate instructional strategies for teaching phonics. The assumption is made in the study that if a student has a cognitive knowledge of appropriate methods and can articulate that knowledge on paper, there is a high degree of probability the student will be able to implement these strategies in the classroom. A random sample of 26 students responded to a questionnaire developed to assess what teaching strategies a student  would use to teach the letter sounds. Since the implicit and explicit approaches to instruction are accepted as the two major ways for teaching phonics, the students were asked to list appropriate teaching strategies for the approach they were taught.

Traditionally competence has been determined through the use of objective or essay tests. Cognitive knowledge of students may be determined in this manner but the student's ability to apply that knowledge is not adequately measured. The main purpose of this study was to assist the faculty in developing performance tests to measure and enhance their students' ability to teach reading and language arts. The way chosen to assist the professors was to develop prototype performance evaluation instruments to be used in a pilot study, and then report the issues involved with using the instruments. Specifically, the project consisted of  three major tasks: (1) conduct a literature review of performance tests used in evaluating student teachers; (2) develop prototype performance tests and strategies to be used in helping college teachers develop performance instruments for their classes; and (3) a discussion of the issues and concerns that arise when implementing performance tests in the on-campus classroom. The discussion includes an analysis of the dynamics of peer evaluation. The evaluation instruments are appended. (JD)",

The research examined teachers' planning, particularly as it focuses upon project assignments. The study yielded information about teachers' conceptual frames for their teaching, the personal aspects of teaching, the teachers' conceptions of students, and the complexities of designing an effective studio assignment and then helping students through a solution. The findings about studio teachers teaching and planning form themselves into three major groupings: (1) patterns of teachers' knowledge and reflections; (2) findings about the academic task; and (3) teaching and learning as a balance of \"openings\" and \"closings.\" The discussion links these themes with the existing  theoretical work on teacher thinking and planning, the teachers' conceptions about the content of their subject, and academic tasks as the vehicle for learning.

Subjects responding to objective tests included 3,164 male and female students from 54 classes of 18 middle schools, and 1,981 male and female students from 36 classes of 18 high schools. Subjects responding to free response questionnaires included 201 male and female students from 54 classes of 18 middle schools, and 180 male and female students from 36 classes of 18 high schools. To study cognitive and affective development, researchers used: (1) student diaries and compositions; (2) a student concerns questionnaire; (3) two compositions and a standardized test for  determining interests; (4) a standardized diagnostic test and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) to determine needs; (5) a values test; and (6) a semantic differential for self. Research data suggest that most students never reached the late formal operational stage of cognitive development identified by Piaget, remaining in the early formal operational stage or the late concrete operational stage. This finding has important implications for curriculum and text development, and highlights the need for learning through concrete means. Data on affective characteristics illustrate the importance of recognizing the emotional, social, and philosophical problems that students confront. Seventy-eight tables and 9 figures provide study data. (SLD)",

Eight of the students were preparing to enter the eighth or ninth grade in high school and the other six were preparing to enter the 10th or 11th grade. The workshop was designed to enhance participants' knowledge and exposure to science as a career in order to encourage a greater number of disabled individuals to enter science careers. The cross-cultural framework used was described by C. E. Cortes (1986) in his analysis of social and cultural factors in minority education. The approach to data collection combined qualitative and quantitative methods.  Program documents were reviewed and data were collected from the students and the 11 staff members through interviews, questionnaires, and observation. Since this was the first year of a 2-year project, the evaluation focused on formative aspects and was conducted throughout the planning and implementation phases of the project. Generally, students' affective responses to the workshop were positive. The staff felt a high level of frustration and identified the major problems as resulting from the heterogeneity of the students, discipline problems, ineffective instructional methods, disorganization, lack of communication, and staff burnout. Societal, educational, and instructional elements and student qualities are discussed as factors affecting program outcome.

The focus is on a summer pilot study of the RHSE conducted while the continuation of the project was jeopardized by proposed budget cuts. The stages of development, problems involved in passing the proposal through the bureaucracy, and issues raised about designing an evaluation for clients who may not implement the evaluation are discussed. The evaluation described was requested/commissioned by the Albany-Schenectady Schoharie Bureau of Occupational and Educational Services located in Albany (New York). The RHSE, a pilot project for gifted and talented students in all academic subjects, is expected to open over the next 5 years. Evaluation design  stages addressed conceptualization, rationale for choice of methods, training issues, monitoring the processes involved with clients, and post-implementation strategies for survival. The evaluation plan had a strong documentary focus involving interviews, documents, life histories, teacher journals, student journals, and surveys (including parent involvement surveys). Ethnographic techniques and the use of numerous methods were central to the evaluation design's organization. The evaluation design encompassed resource inputs, processes or activities, and outcomes as compared to objectives. A detailed outline of action components of the qualitative evaluation plan of the school before, during, and after the program was developed; and various evaluation strategies were pilot tested. The  aforementioned budget cuts resulted in a postponement of the school project. The life history in teaching survey, teacher evaluation survey, and parents survey instruments are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"An expert/novice paradigm is applied to the development of a computer-assisted test of spatial aptitude. The qualitative differences in encoding and solution strategies between high and low &quot;spatials&quot; were demonstrated. Initial efforts focused on the ubiquitous figural analogy test (&quot;A:B::C:D&quot;). Converging evidence from a variety of standard tasks indicates that high scorers encode figures more flexibly, apply spatial transformations more holistically, and attempt to solve problems in a more &quot;top-down&quot; manner than do low scorers, but pilot results also suggest that at least some of these skills may be trainable. A new methodology has been developed to computerize testing and training in future research. Figural analogy problems from the Cognitive Abilities Test were  photodigitized for use in combination with a program, called &quot;ANALOGY,&quot; written in AmigaBASIC. The resulting test procedure has a great deal in common with the subject-controlled &quot;moving window&quot; technique now commonly seen in text comprehension literature. The procedure allows the subject complete freedom in selecting what to view and when to view it. The computerized procedure constitutes a clear advance over paper-and-pencil tests and standard reaction-time studies, since it yields a rich database gathered under unobtrusive yet controlled conditions. In addition to overall speed and accuracy of solution, the database program provides for direct assessment of specific problem term encoding and comparison times and of global solution strategies. The general-purpose program is easily  modified and allows for a feedback option. This research tool will be applied to a variety of subject populations and training conditions. (TJH)",

P. L. Smith's model (1988) suggests that AUC in better for high-ability students. W. Dick and R. Latta (1970) found AUC to be better for high-ability students and KCR to be better for low-ability students. The study was designed to determine whether high-ability students benefit most from the deeper processing required by AUC, while low-ability students perform best with KCR, which requires less processing. Experimental subjects were randomly assigned to a AUC or KCR treatments, resulting in a 2 (treatment: AUC or KCR) by 2  (ability: low or high) factorial design. One week later, the subjects took an identical posttest that provided the final exam score for the course. Analysis of covariance revealed that low-ability students performed best with KCR, while high-ability students performed best with AUC. The interaction between ability and feedback form was significant. These findings suggest that low-ability students should be provided with KCR and high-ability students should receive AUC. The study also provides support for Smith's model of feedback by learner ability. Three data tables and three figures are included. (TJH)",

Two major classes of invariant measurement are described: (1) sample-invariant item calibration; and (2) item-invariant measurement of individuals. The work of S. S. Stevens is used to help clarify the concept of invariance. The importance of invariance as a key measurement concept is then illustrated via the measurement theories of E. L. Thorndike, L. L. Thurstone, and G. Rasch. The study methodology uses quotations and original figures to illustrate how these researchers addressed measurement problems related to invariance. A comparison and discussion of these three researchers' theories of  measurement are presented in terms of their contributions to the solution of problems related to the concept of invariance. Rasch's research is seen as the means by which the issues raised by the other two researchers were resolved. A case is made for viewing invariance as a fundamental aspect of measurement in the behavioral sciences. Invariance appears to be essential in order to realize the advantages of objective measurement. A 58-item list of references, one table, and five figures are included. (TJH)",

The Language File contains data on each student who responded that he or she had experience in a language other than English in the High School and Beyond base year survey in 1980. It includes 11,303 records with information on: (1) childhood languages; (2) current language spoken; (3) the most important language; (4) number of languages used; (5) English or non-English comprehension; and (6) use of non-English language at home. Data are also presented on whether students received instruction in elementary and secondary schools for students for whom English is not the  primary language, as well as whether they took cultural history courses related to the primary language. The questionnaire contained 23 questions, with 42 variables for each student. The codebook provides information to aid in the use of this data. For each questionnaire item, the question and response categories are printed along with the frequency count for the total subset of students.

The manual, which is designed to complement the 1970 Census Users' Guide prepared by the United States Census Bureau, covers sources of the data, structure and contents of the tapes, and use of the tapes. Because school districts are not generally coterminous with area organizations used by the 1970 Census, school administrators could not apply the Census data directly. To alleviate this problem, the data tapes, which are a recompilation of the 1970 data, provide data tables for each school district in the country with 300 or more students. The tapes contain half of the data tables contained in the original census tapes, including all  tables requested by several dozen educational planners consulted in the design phases of the tape development effort. There are 3,494 school district records in the data tapes, for an average of 2.5 school district records per high school. Data breakdowns include age, sex, Negro population, Spanish origin, mother tongue, place of birth, residence and housing arrangements, employment and occupational status, marital status, and economic status. An extract of these data tapes has also been prepared to supplement the main data files of the National Longitudinal Study (NLS) of the High School Class of 1972. The extract includes only those school districts that contained one or more high schools in the 1972 NLS sample. This manual describes the preparation of the SDDTs, tape labels and control  information, record types, county components and administrative units, computer requirements, and tape format; and it provides code explanations and sample FORTRAN and COBOL access statements.

        "description":"The 50-item Bickley Assessment of Self Esteem (BASE) is an experimental instrument designed to measure the self-esteem of children enrolled in early childhood education. In addition to yielding an overall measure of a child's self-esteem, the BASE attempts to measure the child's general orientation toward academics, toward his or her teachers, and toward other persons. A study involving 206 children enrolled in kindergarten through grade 3 evaluated the ability of 14 BASE items to assess how the student feels in relationship to his or her teacher(s), or the student-teacher factor. Results of a one-way analysis of variance, with grade level as the main effect, indicate that when the 206 profiles were scored on only the items that constitute the student-teacher factor of the BASE,  a significant difference was found between the four grade levels examined. A New Duncan Multiple Range Test was used to determine which grade levels were significantly different from others; kindergarten contrasted with all three other grade levels. A Kuder-Richardson Formula 21 reliability was computed to measure the internal consistency of the items. Overall, data tend to indicate that the BASE can discriminate between subjects on the student-teacher factor. (TJH)",

        "description":"An evaluation of a summer geography institute focusing on the use of thematic maps as tools for teaching across the curriculum was conducted during 1988. The annual institute is sponsored by the Tennessee Geographic Alliance in conjunction with the National Geographic Society. Thematic map making involves portrayal of visible patterns of inequality that stimulate questions and responses. In essence, thematic maps are tools for eliciting speculations, tentative explanations, and hypotheses to be tested. The 1988 institute involved 24 fourth- through 12th-grade teachers from Tennessee and South Carolina. Five techniques were used in the comprehensive evaluation of the institute: (1) participant observation; (2) participant perception survey; (3) participant interviews; (4) content  analysis of participant diaries; and (5) content analysis of institute materials. A total of 36 activities and 30 materials were coded and charted by investigators to determine levels of learning style accommodation and thinking skills facilitation. Results indicate that thematic mapping accommodates a range of perceptual learning styles and contributes to the development of higher order thinking skills and processes. In addition, simple analyses of instructional activities and materials can generate valuable information for instructional decision making. (TJH)",

The guides outline skills associated with three instructional/skill levels--basic, developmental, and extensions--within each subject area at each grade level. Skills are measured by the Minimum Performance Test, given each year to students in third, sixth, and eighth grades. Promotion from the eighth grade depends upon mastery of the basic skills listed in the five content guides for reading, mathematics, language arts, science, and social studies. Teachers must report each child's progress to parents via a form created by the school. Results of  the survey indicate that: (1) 99% of the schools used some form or letter for reporting; (2) 42% used a combination of letter grades and percentage grades; (3) 57% used letter grades only; (4) one school used a parent conference form instead of a report card; and (5) two schools used a computer in reporting grades to parents. In general, the reporting forms were not congruent with the expressions used in the course content guides. (TJH)",

An integrative framework for information processing and cognitive ability determinants of skills is presented, along with principles for ability-skill relations. Three major patterns of individual differences in skill acquisition are considered: (1) changes in between-subject variability; (2) the simplex pattern of trial intercorrelations; and (3) changing ability-performance correlations with practice. In addition to a review of previous theory and data, experimental manipulations are used to evaluate the cognitive ability demands associated with information processing parameters of skilled performance. A complex air  traffic controller simulation task used in several investigations is introduced, along with empirical tests of theoretical principles. Examinations of practice-related between-subject variance changes and ability-performance correlations are used to demonstrate that an equivalence exists between three broad phases of skill acquisition and three cognitive/intellectual ability determinants of individual differences. Recent extrapolation of the theory to a dynamic representation of abilities is reviewed. Abstracts of scientific publications associated with the research are appended. (Author/TJH)",

Each Learning Center served elementary, intermediate, or high school students, and the program of each was designed to equalize educational opportunities by providing truly open choices to public school students and their parents. Because the program of a Center could be quite specific, some had special admissions requirements or prerequisites. Five Centers offered performing arts; three offered media communications; seven had an occupational-career technology focus; and five offered classic academic courses. The overview section provides the national and state context for the inherent  worth of the program. A generic Learning Center is described in goals, definition, and description sections. The four major implementation categories are broken up in the following areas: (1) purposes; (2) program organization; (3) program resources; (4) and students served. Students' evaluations and parents' evaluations are examined. Major accomplishments, needs, and concerns are also discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion and recommendations section.

By the year 2000, urban districts are projected to be comprised of 40 to 70 percent minorities. The Connecticut State Board of Education has rigorously monitored racial desegregation laws since 1980 but  has been unable to provide a racially integrated environment that fosters academic achievement. Recent litigation in Missouri, Indiana, Virginia, and Ohio indicates that states should develop interdistrict collaboration to fulfill their responsibility to desegregate. The following recommendations are suggested: (1) the state should promote the concept of &quot;collective responsibility&quot; for integrating the public schools; (2) the state should make available financial incentives to encourage school districts that plan and implement voluntary programs that advance quality, integrated education; (3) the State Department of Education should provide technical assistance to school districts to develop and implement plans to achieve and maintain integrated schools; and (4) the State Department of  Education should undertake planning with other agencies responsible for housing, transportation, and other factors that can help promote integration. Statistical data are included on two tables and seven graphs and maps. A list of 28 references is appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"This document describes viable options to enable the State of Connecticut to provide integrated and quality education, in response to a 1988 report that presented broad-based recommendations for overcoming racial inequalities in contiguous school districts. The initial report, dramatizing the increasing racial and economic isolation in the state's public schools and calling for voluntary action to reverse the trend, generated public interest and investigation of alternatives by a number of school districts, agencies, and community groups. However, despite the increasing public awareness of and responsiveness to the problem, racial and economic isolation persists. The following existing integration initiatives are described and examples of improvements are suggested: (1)  Interdistrict Cooperative Grants Program (including both planning and implementation grants); (2) Project Concern, an intercommunity program for disadvantaged students; (3) State Summer School Grant Program; (4) curriculum reform initiatives; (5) professional development; (6) interdistrict vocational-technical schools; and (7) local cooperative vocational programs. The following new initiatives are described and examples of further development are suggested: (1) magnet schools; (2) school construction and renovation; and (3) recruitment of minority teachers. The new methods and strategies suggested for delivering quality, integrated education are summarized. Statistical data are included on one table and two maps. A list of 27 references; the recommendations of the Superintendents' Work  Group regarding Project Concern; and the report of the Subcommittee on School Construction, Leasing, and Site Acquisition of the Superintendents' Committee on Racial/Ethnic Equity and Desegregation are appended.

The history of magnet schools in American education is examined, linking it with several recent movements to reform and reorganize schooling. A synthesis of research findings from 12 district studies of magnet schools and various other studies conducted in the past 6 years provides data that are examined. The studies focus on magnet high schools' distribution, their educational effects on students, and their effects on education district-wide. Both the data from the studies and the studies themselves are evaluated. The implications of the various studies' findings on educational effects for education decision-makers are discussed, and specific recommendations for  improving research for analyzing educational effects of magnet schools are made. Thirty-seven references are included. A list of the 12 district studies is appended. Table 1 provides the data on enrollment trends in magnet schools from 1982-83 and 1988-89.

Conventional schooling assumes the following: (1) all students can derive meaning from a complex and fragmented array of academic courses; (2) all students recognize or can construct a congruence between schooling and their lives; (3) students have similar capacities and motivations for learning; (4) learning is unaffected by the isolation that some students feel in large impersonal institutions; and (5) students can shield their academic performance from the pressures of outside influences or life circumstances. This report examines prototypes of alternative structures that respond in diverse ways to the characteristics and needs of at-risk youth. It attempts to show how  these programs can diminish students' sense of isolation, incongruity, and incompetence, and can reengage them in the enterprise of schooling. Programs can affect student performance when teachers assume the extended roles of counselor, confidant, and friend. At-risk youth can be reengaged in school when more attention is paid to their individual needs in and outside of class. Teachers should be encouraged to feel accountable for their students and to participate in critical school policymaking. The report includes 3 references and 3 tables. (AF)",

        "description":"This paper argues that programs for at-risk youth tend to overemphasize student adjustment and the mastery of institutional customs at the expense of instilling learning dispositions that might lead to the postsecondary educational training now required to find adequate adult employment. Programs often focus on drawing students into a more embracing educational environment in the hope of improving student self-esteem and encouraging conformity with school regulations regarding attendance, behavior, and work habits. In this process academic and curricular innovation is often slighted. The aim of many dropout prevention programs tends to be limited to high school graduation and the inculcation of behaviors valued in non-managerial employees. This orientation to education, thought  at one time to be practical, is increasingly untenable in an economy where jobs that pay a livable wage go only to those who have some advanced training. It is imperative that programs for at-risk youth prepare their students for the necessity of that training and help them acquire the skills, dispositions, and independence required to seek out and master it. A curriculum more thoughtfully tied into the social and pedagogical practices already present in at-risk programs might facilitate this process. The paper includes two references. (AF)",

A review of the literature of labor economics and employment and training reveals data that define the problem of chronic youth unemployment as well as strategies to reduce that risk. The economy's requirements for education have risen faster than the educational levels of the young. Jobs now require the social, communication, and interpersonal skills that are acquired through informal and formal schooling. However, youth have no more trouble finding work than adults when they have met  the following preconditions: (1) developed sound basic academic skills; (2) received a high school degree; and (3) had substantial work experience as teenagers. Educational programs that develop these skills include the following features: (1) competency-based remedial programs; (2) computer-assisted instruction; (3) small, supportive environments; (4) summer programs that combine education and employment; (5) social services integrated into the school program; (6) increased student control over the pace, content, and style of the program; and (7) a clear and concrete connection between school performance and employment. A grade-by-grade description of how the high school years might be restructured to incorporate these features is included.

Topeka Board of Education, which relied heavily on social science research, flawed in its reasoning on school desegregation, equal educational opportunity, and quality education for African Americans? Both questions deserve answers in the affirmative. The Supreme Court's 1954 Brown ruling was correct; however, the subsequent decision to overemphasize racial integration and underemphasize quality education was a mistake of enormous proportions. Educational policy experts, as members of an evolving professional-managerial elite, used their knowledge to contribute significantly to policies such as busing for racial balance and magnet  programs, but these programs are not enough. These experts who contribute to the formulation and implementation of policies do not have all the answers to complex educational problems. Policy intellectuals will continue to influence educational policy making, but the role of expertise must be clarified and refined in light of its limitations. Past mistakes in educational policy with respect to quality education have resulted in several generations of African-American and Hispanic-American youth who were trapped in these desegregated but inferior schools and who will be left behind in this managerial society. Quality education must be reinstated in all American schools if the United States is to remain foremost among advanced techological nations. (JS)",

        "description":"This report examines the correlates of successful social and educational strategies of a dropout prevention program for minority children in an urban school district. In 1986, Fordham University's Graduate School of Education and Social Services became partners with a heavily-populated minority public school district in New York City. This paper describes the first two years of Fordham's Stay-in-School Partnership Project (SSPP) and attempts to answer the following questions: (1) how much impact did SSPP have on the attendance rate of at-risk children? (2) what effects did it exercise on their academic achievement? and (3) what types of practices and strategies were most effective in this setting? Data on attendance rates, reading and math performance, self-esteem, adequacy of  child care, and an emerging &quot;practice profile&quot; of the project are used to answer these questions. SSPP works by addressing the school experience of children at risk through structured tutoring and play therapy, and by confronting outside experiences through family problem-solving and counseling as well as parental workshops. The project responds to the urban school crisis by focusing on preventive strategies supported by data, identifying areas of greatest and weakest impact, and communicating effective practices. (AF)",

Although there has been no parallel expansion of information specifically on Latino youth, the existing evidence clearly indicates that they are a population at serious risk of developing problems with several substances, and that prevention programs have not  been adequately addressing the unique needs and circumstances of this population. The report is divided into an Overview and Abstracts. The Overview is comprised of the following sections: (1) Introduction; (2) Research Problems; (3) Use Prevalence and Patterns; (4) Correlates of Use, including environmental factors, family background, interpersonal factors, gender, cultural values, acculturation, and group variation; (5) Prevention; and (6) Conclusion. The Abstracts provide citations and annotations for 14 journal articles and research reports. A 140-item reference list and a list of author addresses are appended. (AF)",

A random sample of 40 students was selected from a school of 190 students. All were administered the Piers-Harris Children's Self Concept Scale to determine their feelings about themselves, and an author-prepared questionnaire to determine their feelings on a wide range of areas. The following findings are discussed: (1) analysis of responses to the Piers-Harris Scale indicates that the self-concepts of the students fall within average parameters; (2) analysis of responses to the authors' questionnaire indicates that the majority are content with their placement at the continuation high school; (3) the lack of anxiety reported by 65 percent of the students may contribute to  enhanced self-esteem and decreased drug abuse; and (4) the negative effect of parents who were either separated or divorced may be offset by the lower stress at the continuation school. The desire of the majority of the students to graduate from high school despite the lack of credits and age on enrollment indicates a need for an earlier intervention program for potential dropouts that will offer greater opportunity to succeed.

Evidence is provided which indicates that large scale U.S. government programs are rarely based on a public concern for children, but rather on a more instrumental goal such as developing skilled workers to maintain and increase the productivity and international competitiveness of the American economy. This paper focuses on federal policy throughout the last 30 years in relation to funding for disadvantaged children. The trends are tracked through changing administrations and economics. The following sections are included: (1) \"The Politics of Growth: The 1960's War on Poverty\"; (2) \"The  Incremental Gains of the 1970's\"; (3) \"The 1980's and Programs for the Disadvantaged\"; and (4) \"Looking to the Future.\" Evidence indicates that programs for the disadvantaged are not sufficient to overcome the problems that these children face. Recommendations are made for program revisions and unification of efforts in the fight to turn heightened political concern about the disadvantaged into political action.

Findings were based on a series of personal interviews with human resource directors in 58 companies in the Northwest and the Pacific. Asked about the quality of current entry-level workers, employers reported that a disturbing number of these workers lack adequate reading, writing, mathematics, and communication skills. Other areas of concern included critical thinking and problem-solving skills, ability to work in groups and on teams, employee motivation, attitude, and flexibility. Activities undertaken by employers to support entry-level workers and help them improve their performance as needed were identified. Promising practices used by responding businesses  were reported in 10 areas: employee involvement; child care; family and community concerns; recruiting; training; supervision; motivation; the new basics; business/education partnerships; and handicapped and special needs employees. Implications of the study's findings for consideration by those responsible for providing education and training were also identified. Ten areas were cited: new skills, peer influence, common purpose, expanded learning opportunities, involvement, accountability, cross-training, special training, career paths, and business partnerships.

Chapter 3 covers the economic concepts that are essential for technology evaluation and analysis. Chapter 4 briefly reviews the basic statistical concepts necessary for the design and analysis of on-farm animal research. Chapter 5 presents a model for screening animal technologies at the research station before on-farm testing is conducted. Chapter 6 provides guidelines for conducting on-farm research.  Chapter 7 presents the tools needed to carry out simple economic analysis. Chapter 8 covers basic marketing concepts that are relevant to on-farm research, explaining the reasons that small farmers may be hesitant to test new practices and describing the marketing aspects that should be kept in mind when choosing a technology for on-farm testing. Chapter 9 deals with the risk and uncertainty inherent in new technologies. Chapter 10 covers such topics as obtaining support for on-farm research and the roles of different levels of management in supporting research. The book concludes with a glossary of some 700 terms, a 118-item bibliography, and exercises relevant to each chapter. (CML)",

The following points summarize the results of the study: (1) providers reported that an adult clientele had a positive effect on both the teaching and the ethos of the organization; (2) if many of the problems adults face when returning to education and training stem from domestic commitments, providers could help by supplying child care, counseling and  flexible format and timing of courses; (3) providers stressed that their offerings had to be of high quality, necessitating regular inservice training for teachers of adults, attractive physical surroundings, and teaching methods that take into account adults' differing abilities; (4) providers believed that the most effective forms of publicity were those targeted directly at adults; (5) they believed some adults suffered financial hardship partly due to rules and regulations governing concessionary fees and recommended that deferring payment become an option; (6) providers said they needed to be flexible about the entry requirements for adult students; (7) providers felt they needed more money to improve publicity and develop the facilities to attract adults; (8) they recommended  speedier processing of grants; and (9) they thought it crucial that the government help convince individuals, providers, and employers that adult training and education is valuable and important.

        "description":"The Louisiana Adult Education Program provides academic education for persons 16 years old and above with less than a high school education, with emphasis on decreasing the illiteracy rate in Louisiana. The program enrolled 44,515 students in literacy efforts in fiscal year 1986-1987. Approximately 33,000 students were tested. The average of the initial test scores was 8.7, and the average of the final test scores was 10.3. The average grades elevated were 1.6 per 79.5 hours of attendance at a cost of $1.66 per hour of instruction. The average cost per student was $132. Records indicated that 10,221 students graduated with high school equivalency diplomas; 4,637 completed 8th grade, and 5,641 were issued upgrading certificates. About 1,000 persons were employed in the program,  the majority of them part-time teachers. The majority of the classes were conducted in the evenings in secondary and elementary school buildings. Additionally, 43 learning centers offered alternative adult education classes on a full-time basis. Supervisors offered numerous recommendations that called, among other things, for increased funding for personnel, supplies, instructional materials, and computer equipment, as well as increased cooperation and communication between and among programs.

        "description":"A study was conducted in 1987 to: (1) assess the impact of the farm financial crisis in Washington State; (2) identify at-risk populations; and (3) suggest appropriate programs and agency responses. Particular emphasis was placed on making recommendations for training and development programs to aid in reemployment of dislocated agricultural producers and workers. Information was gathered through a task force effort that involved testimony of expert witnesses, interviews with service providers and members of the agricultural community, and analysis and application of secondary data. The study found that Washington does not have a statewide crisis; rather, it has pockets of distress, severe in some localities. Financial data indicate that approximately 2,800 Washington farms are  likely to fail in the 2 to 3 years following the study. Tentative estimates of dislocation impact suggest that approximately 3,000 to 5,000 agricultural workers will be dislocated within the next 3 years. Lack of unemployment benefits will mean serious distress for many of these producers and hired workers. Successful reemployment of dislocated workers will require improved linkages between the labor supply and labor demand. Two strategies to achieve this linkage are (1) improved up-to-date information on local job availability and (2) economic development efforts in agricultural communities that coordinate economic development with training efforts. Multiagency cooperation will be required to achieve these goals. (The report includes 77 references. Six appendices provide the project  proposal; a set of task force meeting agendas; a graphical analysis of the financial situation of the state's farms; a copy of the 1987 Washington Farm &amp; Family Resource Guide; a farm issue survey form; and a directory of model programs titled &quot;The Unsettling of the Midwest: Education's Response to the Rural Crisis.&quot;) (KC)",

        "description":"A historical perspective of agricultural education is needed in order to understand its role in the future. Agriculture as a science did not exist prior to the 19th century. The Morrill Act contributed greatly to this development. With the realization that higher education could serve persons interested in the agricultural and mechanical arts came a system of public institutions of higher education called the land-grant colleges. Today, agricultural science is a mainstay in the higher education system within and beyond the land-grant institutions. With the advent of baccalaureate instruction in agriculture, however, came a new struggle--the struggle between science and practice. The establishment of education as a specific discipline, a related development, is somewhat obscure.  Education as a discipline is the field of study that concerns itself with the principles and methods of teaching and learning. Agricultural education as a discipline is relatively new. These premises are central to agricultural education: (1) agricultural education involves application in real settings; (2) practice is based on theory; (3) agricultural education serves as the bridge between agricultural science and the other disciplines; (4) agricultural education principles should be the foundation for education in agriculture; (5) agricultural education is not multidisciplinary; and (6) professionals in agricultural education must enter a period of self-examination to determine what agricultural education ought to be.

        "description":"An evaluation was made of PACE (Parent and Child Education), a family literacy program initiated in Kentucky in 1986. PACE was created because of the widespread belief that the state has a serious problem with undereducation of its adult population and the belief also that this problem is the result of persistent patterns of educational failure within particular families across generations. The PACE program was geared to providing remedial educational services to the entire family, rather than just to the children or to the adults. Services are intended to address parents' attitudes and behaviors and their effect on children's educational performance. Program services include adult basic education and parenting skills training for parents, early childhood education for children,  and joint parent-child interaction and learning. The program has won an award for its innovative approach and has been replicated by an outside funding agency. Despite this success, neither the theoretical basis for the program nor the efficacy of its service model have been proven. There are outstanding questions about the effectiveness of PACE and other family literacy programs that need to be resolved before widespread replication is justified. Issues to be addressed include the following: (1) is there a causal relationship between family background and children's educational and social outcomes?; (2) will changes in family attitudes and behaviors be effective in changing children's outcomes?; and (3) can the programs be replicated in different environments?

        "description":"This report highlights recommendations made in recent research reports concerning the role of vocational education in enhancing the success of students at risk of dropping out of school. It has been found that components of vocational education programs successful at retaining students include mechanisms for helping at-risk youth to follow \"normal\" transitional paths through vocational programs and to take advantage of the job training aspects of those programs. It is suggested that work-study programs offered to at-risk students early in their high schools careers may actually encourage them to drop out because those activities are often unrelated to the ongoing school program and may actually serve as inducements for quitting school. It is further suggested that vocational  education's contribution to the successful transition of disadvantaged youth may be improved by providing counseling and exploration prior to program placement, expanding cooperative education, integrating academic and vocational course work, developing criterion-referenced competency profiles, helping students obtain good jobs, and rewarding effective programs. Carefully monitored work experience, incentives such as personalized adult attention and guarantees of postsecondary educational opportunity, career counseling, and school volunteers serving as mentors and tutors are among recommendations for improving school-to-work transition programs. New policy objectives at the federal, state, and local levels have also been recommended, as well as the development of performance measures in  academic achievement, vocational attainment and skills, employment outcomes, and postsecondary continuation and attainment.

        "description":"A study asked trade union leaders in Pennsylvania about present and future levels of worker dislocation, how familiar they were with programs for dislocated workers, what factors caused job dislocation, and what factors affected the use of existing programs. Data were collected through a telephone survey of all 1,824 local unions who were affiliates of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO. Mailed questionnaires were sent to those who could not be reached by phone. The response rate was 58 percent. The following are among the findings reported: (1) over 30 percent of the local unions had experienced some job dislocation in the preceding year; (2) job dislocation was more likely to occur in the private sector, in industrial and trades operations, in concessionary bargaining climates, and in  industries with lower educational requirements for employment; (3) layoffs were the most frequent form of job dislocation and no one factor was reported as the dominant reason for dislocations; (4) over 14 percent of respondents said it is likely or extremely likely that they will experience significant dislocation during the next year; (5) unions whose members had been dislocated have tended not to use programs designed to assist dislocated workers, and there is a low level of familiarity with such programs among all local union leaders; (6) respondents cited job search and placement as the first and retraining as the second most important needs of their dislocated members; and (7) respondents strongly agreed that it is important for organized labor to be deeply involved in dealing with  worker dislocation.

        "description":"This document consists of a leader's guide that tells how to conduct a 1-day workshop and a workbook used by workshop participants to develop action plans to improve workplace literacy and the collaboration skills needed to implement those plans. It is intended that workshop participants should consist of 10-15 community members.) A memorandum in the leader's guide summarizes the intent of the guide and the leader's responsibilities. The first section gives a rationale for improving workplace literacy and for using community collaboration to do it, describes the organization of the document, and describes the workshop that the leader is to conduct. The second section gives detailed steps for conducting the workshop and includes 11 overhead transparency masters. The text of the  workbook is reproduced on the left side of the page, and related notes for the workshop leader appear on the right. The workbook contains worksheets on which the participants can identify such things as workplace literacy skills; problems (for example, existing employees require skill upgrading, entry-level employees possess low levels of basic skills, and the labor pool includes large numbers of non-English speakers); possible solutions; potential community resources; and the benefits of improved workplace literacy. Other worksheets guide the development of action plans that include goals and objectives, tasks and activities, and a timeline. The document concludes with lists of basic workplace skills, reasons for adult participation in education, reasons for adults not participating,  critical elements for overcoming barriers, principles and skills for successful collaboration; and strategies to create and maintain effective partnerships. A glossary and an 18-item bibliography are also included. (CML)",

Currently, there are no federal or state requirements that tractor-trailer drivers receive formal training as a condition for licensing and no minimum federal standards governing any training that may be provided, despite the fact that driver error continues to be cited as the major cause of truck accidents. FHWA did not develop proposed minimum standards for training programs until 1984  and a model curriculum for training tractor-trailer drivers until 1985. Since 1984, three governmental organizations have recommended that FHWA complete its proposed minimum training standards, but it currently has no plans to do so. The review of tractor trailer driver training programs offered by 24 private training schools and 12 public education institutions showed a wide variance in the course curricula, hours of training, and costs. The number of training hours ranged from 150 to 610. The trucking industry has recently tried to improve truck driver training by establishing a program to certify truck driver training programs, the first eight of which were certified in January 1989. The FHWA needs to reconsider whether tractor-trailer drivers should receive formal training as a  condition for licensing and whether there should be any minimum federal standards for such training.

Data were collected through a literature review; from the U.S. Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training (BAT); and from the departments of education and cooperative education coordinators in 41 states and 9 large cities. The following are among the findings and recommendations: (1) strengthened linkages would help the BAT achieve its objectives of playing a more effective role in preparing youth for employment, developing a more flexible labor pool, expanding into new occupations, and involving more women, disadvantaged, and handicapped students; (2) the few effective programs linking  secondary cooperative education and apprenticeship should be presented as models; (3) educational and apprenticeship professionals are interested in establishing and strengthening linkage programs but are hampered by barriers such as lack of experience and knowledge, few resources, and lack of administrative support; (4) once a viable program is underway, state and local educational agencies and BAT should be able to maintain effective local and state programs; and (5) occupations and states with effective cooperative education provide opportunities to expand and increase apprenticeships.

        "description":"The effects of government transfer programs such as unemployment insurance and welfare assistance on strikes were studied by analyzing state-level data on strike frequency from 1960 through 1974. Effects were estimated by using ordinary least squares regression, supplementing traditional models of strike activity with measures of transfer program characteristics. No support was found for the claim that Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, or general assistance affect strikes. However, evidence was found linking unemployment insurance payments to the frequency of strikes, with a more generous unemployment insurance program being associated with a higher strike frequency. No conclusions were possible on whether unemployment insurance programs affect either strike  duration or the number of workers involved in strikes. Either there are no effects or the methods used were not precise enough to measure the effects of two states' (New York and Rhode Island) provision of unemployment compensation to strikers after a waiting period of 7-8 weeks.

        "description":"Literacy education volunteers during 1988 numbered 77,000, two-thirds of whom served as tutors in basic literacy and English-as-a-second-language classes. The other third served in supportive roles as administrators, recruiters, teacher aides, counselors, and providers of child care and transportation. The number of volunteers rose from 34,500 in 1985. New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Kentucky, and Tennessee used more volunteers than other states during 1988. Effective recruitment strategies included posters, fliers, radio and television spots, hotlines, newspapers, and presentations to community and church groups. Major agencies that provided linkage with states included Laubach Literacy Action, Literacy Volunteers of America, Project Literacy U.S. (PLUS), Retired Senior  Volunteer Program, ACTION's VISTA Volunteer Literacy Corps, state and local libraries, and state literacy councils. Volunteers usually received 12-18 hours of training. Section 353 of the Adult Education Act requires states to spend at least 10 percent of their funds on special experimental demonstration and teacher training projects. More than 38 states have organized a state literacy council or coalition that is most often involved in activities such as linking with literacy volunteer groups. Special efforts are being made in Florida and other states to increase the efforts of volunteers. Among organizations' concerns about volunteers have been the difficulty of retaining volunteers, the need for in-depth orientation, and the lack of sufficient inservice training.

It was found that the compulsory attendance laws of the state do not apply to vocational-technical institutes. The attendance policy of the local school board does apply, however. Vocational technical institutes are part of the common school system and are governed by the board of directors of the school district in which the institute is located. Institutes have as their main role and mission the training of persons for the work force. They do this as far as possible by replicating the world of work in classroom and laboratory settings of the institute. The attendance policy is established by the school  board and enforced by the institute. This policy is explained to the students upon enrollment and exceptions to its provisions may be made upon request by the students. The policy is perceived by the institute as part of a contract between the student and the institute. The review concludes that the policy is fair and equitable, the rights of students are protected, and the role and mission of the institute is furthered by adherence to its provisions. (KC)",

Issues examined include the following: (1) fathers are torn between employers expecting super employees and mothers expecting super fathers; (2) a few companies are taking note of the needs of fathers and are making policy changes to ease the conflict; (3) although more companies have paternity leave today, few fathers take advantage of more than a few days of it; (4) more fathers are taking a little time off around the birth of a child; (5) employees would like flexible time arrangements to provide a better balance between work and home life; and (6) awareness has grown, but a revolution in work policies is not  expected. The report contains case studies of four companies that are especially sensitive to the needs of working fathers, explaining how their policies have been implemented. An appendix summarizes results of Catalyst's survey on policies for fathers. A 30-item bibliography concludes the document. (KC)",

The research findings presented in the seminar sessions address the following issues: (1) changing demographic profiles characterized by fewer youth and an aging work force; (2) rising minimum competency thresholds for many jobs, with the attendant danger of a  polarized labor force of highly skilled and unskilled workers if effective education and training programs cannot be developed to bridge the gap; and (3) rapid internationalization of economic and labor forces resulting in international skill markets.

        "description":"This paper is a status report on efforts to make community service a part of the educational experience of high school students. It reviews the current educational debate, describes policies and practices including specific programs, summarizes research findings on the impact of service, and suggests some critical issues that confront educational researchers, policymakers, and practitioners. Some highlights of the report are as follows: (1) as of the mid-1980s, more than one-fourth of high schools offered community service programs for their students; (2) the most common means of service is through co-curricular school clubs and special school events such as holiday food drives; (3) some high schools, especially Catholic and private schools, require service to meet graduation  requirements; (4) arguments in favor of service in the curriculum have appeared in the literature since the turn of the century; (5) some proponents of the practice emphasize the character-building potential of service, its power to promote basic democratic values and to develop patterns of responsible behavior; (6) others stress the potential of service to vitalize education by stressing that it requires the application of academic learning; (7) there is general agreement that a heightened sense of personal and social responsibility, more positive attitudes toward adults and toward those served, enhanced self-esteem, growth in moral and ego development, and more complex patterns of thought result from service programs; and (8) research and the testimony of participants both support the  idea that school-based community service merits further trial. The document includes 45 references and an appendix listing publications and resource organizations for developing service programs. (KC)",

Teachers must consider the purpose of the assessment; the appropriateness of the assessment instrument for adults; the reliability, validity, and practicality of the instrument; whether the assessment is culturally sensitive; and whether the assessment instrument is congruent with the instruction given. An effective assessment model for adults consists of several different types of assessment, giving the instructor a multiple view of the adult's literacy achievement and instructional needs. A selection of the following types of assessment can be used with adults: standardized, norm-referenced tests; other reading tests; locally developed measures; workplace  and other functional literacy assessment; job or life simulation; work samples; observation of students; informal reading inventories; and follow-up of students. An assessment model for adult populations needs to include multiple sources of data, using instruments and procedures that are appropriate for adults and that adhere to the principles of assessment. Assessment is used for planning instruction and can help the student see progress and be motivated to remain in the program. (KC)",

        "description":"A study evaluated the IBM Principles of Adult Literacy (PALS) program in 1988-89. Three adult education centers in Georgia (two with PALS and one without) were studied to determine whether, for adult nonreaders, the PALS program produced gains in reading equal to or greater than those produced by a traditional noncomputerized program. In addition to reading, students' progress in writing and student and teacher attitudes toward the PALS program were evaluated by means of assessment, observations, and interviews collected during an 8-month period. The study found that adults in the PALS program performed as well as adults in a traditional noncomputerized literacy program, although neither group as a whole demonstrated significant progress on the reading or writing measures. There  was a significantly lower dropout rate, but no difference in the attendance rate for the PALS program than for the traditional program. Student satisfaction with the PALS program was high, their attitudes toward the program were good, and they felt they improved their reading. Teachers were generally favorable toward the PALS program although they felt the need to use it in conjunction with other teaching methods and materials. Strengths of the PALS program centered around the use of computers and the inclusion of touch typing skills in the instruction. Weaknesses of the PALS program included the difficulty teachers had getting the writing program started and problems with typing for the older students. The study concluded that the PALS program may be a beneficial addition to a literacy  program, but it is not a panacea for adult literacy education. (KC)",

        "description":"A study examined the Canadian-American Plant Closing Demonstration Project (CAPCDP) to assess the influence of the labor-management approach on factors critical to project success and to identify practices that enabled the labor-management committees set up under the project to work better. CAPCDPs in Idaho, Michigan, New Jersey, and Vermont were studied by the following methods: (1) on-site examination of project planning and implementation documents; (2) interviews with state officials, labor-management committee members, and local service-provider staff; and (3) information on dislocated workers obtained through Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act and Employment Service records, unemployment insurance records, service-provider attendance lists, and labor-management  committee documents. The findings indicated that labor-management committees enhanced the ability of the four dislocated worker projects to help workers cope with job loss and find employment. The committees played a key role in the following four elements critical to the success of such projects: (1) tailoring assistance strategies to meet worker needs through their involvement in project planning, oversight of worker progress, and direct assistance to individual workers; (2) facilitating early intervention by informing workers of their reemployment assistance options before layoff; (3) coordinating project activities by serving as a focal point for planning and monitoring service delivery and providing a communication link between workers and service providers; and (4) supporting and  encouraging worker adjustment efforts by establishing on-site assistance centers, maintaining personal contact with workers, and sponsoring other supportive activities. The extent of committee contribution appeared linked to strong state leadership, the committee's composition, and sustained involvement after layoff. (35 references.) (CML)",

        "description":"A study examined six cases where job training and economic development had been successfully linked through an interorganizational arrangement. Cases were nominated by U.S. Employment and Training Administration officials, job training and economic development experts, and published reports. The six organizations of primary focus were Pima County Community Services Department, Arizona; Susquehanna Region Private Industry Council, Inc., Maryland; Chester County Partnership for Economic Development, Pennsylvania; Northeast Florida Private Industry Council, Inc., Florida; Greater Grand Rapids Area Economic Team, Michigan; and Seattle-King County Economic Development Council, Washington. The cases covered sites with varied demographic and economic characteristics, but did not cover  areas suffering from chronic economic problems or with a large proportion of minority people. Data were collected during two visits to each site in 1989. In each of the six cases, a single organization headed the interorganizational efforts, with the lead organization in three cases being a Job Training Partnership Act organization and, in the other three cases, an economic development agency. While all six arrangements had contractual agreements among participating organizations through which funds were paid for services to all six, informal networks were more important than the formal agreements. It was concluded that in these six cases, interorganizational arrangements produced close coordination of job training and economic development activities, and that these activities were  plausibly linked with exemplary job training and job creation outcomes.

        "author":["Gerakis, Argyrios"],
        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the attitudes of Ohio county extension agents toward satellite video teleconferencing. (Several county extension offices across the state participate in live satellite video teleconferences produced by The Ohio State University. Teleconferences cover a variety of extension education topics, from agriculture to home economics to teenage problems. Since county extension agents play an important role as facilitators at the local level, the success of teleconferencing depends greatly on their attitudes.) Data were collected from a mailed questionnaire to all 186 county extension agents in the state in the summer of 1989. Approximately 79 percent (147) usable questionnaires were returned. Analysis of data revealed that, overall, the majority of  agents are \"slightly positive\" toward satellite video teleconferencing. However, they tend to prefer prerecorded videotapes over live teleconferencing. Cross-tabulation between the attitude scores and a variety of personal characteristics showed negligible to moderate relationships only. The study concluded that the extension service should continue financing satellite video teleconferencing but at the same time should focus on videotape production. Some other suggestions from the extension agents were that improvements be made in the quality of programs and the reliability of the technology, so that the agents might feel more confident about it.

Six additional recommendations are offered: be aware of the importance of the contact person's enthusiasm and support for the program; do not become discouraged if immediate confirmation is not forthcoming from a potential site; be aware that what works at one site may not work at another; allow  time for rapport to develop between students and teachers and to consider moving a teacher who is unsuccessful at one site to another site, where he/she might do well; be aware of the importance of well-trained teachers; and use additional personnel as resource teachers. The appendix contains a breakdown of the ROL population served by age, sex, race, and test scores; a list of organizations with which ROL had contact; a list of ROL sites; a map of ROL sites; strategies used by nonreaders to avoid having to reveal that they cannot read; a program referral form; promotional materials for the program, one of which is in Spanish; and four newspaper articles about ROL and its students.

        "description":"This document reports how the Council of State Policy and Planning Agencies (CSPA) Academy process helped nine states develop workplace literacy initiatives involving their governors' offices, the Job Training Partnership Act system, and the educational system. The states were Florida, Idaho, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, and Missouri. An executive summary provides an economic rationale for the initiatives and describes project participants; the notion of workplace literacy; the CSPA Academy process; the accomplishments (four states designed comprehensive, integrated approaches to the problem; three states created special interagency projects or programs; and two states strengthened their interagency understanding of the problem and laid the  groundwork for change); and the lessons learned from the project. Chapter 1 introduces the project. Chapter 2 frames the issues and presents the working partnerships needed to resolve them. Chapter 3 discusses the major steps in the policy development cycle and illustrates with specific examples how the states constructed their literacy policies and action plans. Chapter 4 presents an overall assessment of the results. Chapter 5 presents in detail each state's experience, process, and products as it moved through the academy. Six references appear. The appendix contains the names and addresses of state team members. (CML)",

        "description":"This document examines the work of Dewey, Kolb, Jarvis, Mezirow, Freire, Rogers, and Houle to find out what these experiential learning theorists have to say about the role experience plays in making learning meaningful. The first section addresses each writer's work for specific ideas of how experience is related to making learning meaningful, including what learning is like, what outcomes are intended, and implications for instruction. In the second section, major concepts are extrapolated about the relationship of experience to learning that are evident in all or most of the works examined. Those concepts include interaction and continuity; creation of new knowledge, awareness, and ability; the integration and expansion of perception; and the development of understanding and  self-direction. Among the implications for adult educators are the importance of understanding the learner's personal and social background, arranging the learning conditions, preparing learners for the contradiction and conflict that the learning experience is likely to incite, posing problems that will result in learning, and facilitating reflection and dialogue about the meaning and effect of the learning experience. The conclusion states that the works examined argue for the necessity of actively engaging adult educators who are responsible for actually bringing learners into a confrontative position with their own thinking in order to grow beyond its limitations. The document concludes with a seven-item bibliography. (CML)",

        "author":["Apling, Richard N."],
        "description":"The current basic grant formula of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act has the following components: distribution of funds is based primarily on state population, but allocations are adjusted to compensate those states with younger populations, to compensate states with fewer resources, and to ensure that no state receives less than a minimum grant. Analyses of federal appropriations showed that the influence of these individual adjustments is relatively small for most states but can be substantial for a few states. For example, the minimum grant provisions sometimes markedly increase the grants of a few sparsely populated states while slightly decreasing grants for all other states. The Applied Technology Education Amendments of 1989, passed by the House of  Representatives as House Resolution 7, has a basic grant formula that is similar to the Perkins Act's except that it contains additional provisions for minimum and maximum payments to states and specifies that no state would receive less than its FY 1989 grant. Under the Perkins Act, states have considerable flexibility in their distribution of basic grants. Partly because of findings by the General Accounting Office that some state distributions may favor wealthier communities over poorer ones, House Resolution 7 requires that 70 percent of funds for school districts and postsecondary institutions be distributed based on poverty, 20 percent be based on number of handicapped students, and 10 percent be based on enrollment. The data needed to estimate the effects of these proposed formulas  are not available at the federal level. (CML)",

        "description":"To assist Congress in preparing for the reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) examined the technical feasibility and utility of instituting specific requirements for performance measurement of secondary school vocational programs. The OTA examined two types of performance measures--labor market indicators and occupational competency testing--but did not evaluate the overall strengths and weaknesses of a federal decision to mandate these or other measures. Labor market indicators were found to be an important but insufficient measure of overall school or program performance. Occupational competency tests were found to provide important but insufficient indications of program effectiveness and were not recommended  as the sole basis for performance standards. As a result of the study, it is suggested that an important role for the Federal Government to play would be to encourage a broad view of performance measurement and that, in particular, Congress could play a leadership role by helping states to (1) develop clear definitions of the objectives of their vocational programs; (2) establish agreed-upon norms of measurement and guidelines for data collection and analysis; (3) carry out research aimed at the development of improved technologies for testing; (4) conduct pilot demonstrations of the effects of alternative performance standards on school and student behavior; and (5) raise necessary funds for dissemination of innovations in performance assessment methodologies.

The AMPS program, emphasizing peer resistance skills, focused on the immediate effects of alcohol, risks of alcohol misuse, and social pressures to misuse alcohol. Schools were randomly assigned to curriculum, curriculum plus booster, or control groups with one-half of each group pretested and all posttested. Measures focused on alcohol use and misuse, susceptibility to peer pressure, tolerance of deviance, pretest drinking status, prior supervised versus unsupervised drinking, parental drinking, and health locus of control. Results for 791 fifth graders and 714 sixth graders who were pretested and present at all testing occasions revealed  that, at the 26-month follow-up, the hypothesized treatment by occasion interaction effect on alcohol use and misuse scores was not significant. Addition of a third factor to analyze the data by various subgroups resulted in significant three-way interactions. Both the treatment and control students with little prior exposure to alcohol use showed relatively small increases in alcohol use and misuse which resulted in no significant differences between these groups at the final posttest, while control students with more prior exposure to alcohol use showed more rapid increases in alcohol use and misuse than did their treatment group counterparts. Nineteen references and seven tables are attached. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"The rising health and social services needs of the elderly can be met in part by using the potential productivity of older people. This study examined the extent to which older people serve as a resource and the potentiality for further expanding their productive contributions. The Minnesota Senior Study involved a telephone survey with a representative statewide sample of approximately 1,500 non-institutionalized Minnesotans age 60 and older. Data suggest that Minnesotans age 60 and older do considerably more volunteer work than would be expected, judging from national surveys. It is estimated that Minnesotans contribute about 70 million hours a year in volunteer time. Three-fifths of older Minnesotans reported volunteer work for organizations; two-fifths reported voluntary  service to individuals in their communities; and three-fifths reported helping their families. Overall, only 16% did not do any of these types of volunteer work. Even so, it appears that most volunteers do not commit large amounts of time; about one-half of older volunteers spent less than a couple of hours per week in volunteer activities. Income, education, being married, being employed, not having functional problems, being young-old, living in a non-metropolitan area, and being able to drive (or being the spouse of a driver) were all positively associated with the propensity to volunteer.

This study examined alternative maternity services in Washington State, which ranks eighth in the country in the use of such services. Data were collected from birth and infant and fetal death certificates. A delivery was considered alternative if it occurred outside of a hospital and/or was delivered by a non-physician attendant, typically a midwife. The findings revealed that alternative maternity services in Washington were used by a select group of low-risk women with generally favorable pregnancy outcomes. Trend data showed that more low-risk women were choosing these services every year. This  increase, coupled with the fact that 45% of Washington women having babies are in this low-risk category and could thus choose alternative services, suggests that any consideration of new delivery technologies must take into account the desire for &quot;low-tech&quot; alternatives.

Although few of the elderly require assistance with the activities of daily living, the data showed that family caregiving studies focused disproportionately on this severely disabled group. An analysis of the studies revealed that dementia and severe physical limitations were over-represented while less severe limitations were under-represented. Although the vast majority of family caregivers spend their time helping the elderly with transportation, shopping and errands,  household chores, and meal preparation, this type of instrumental care was underrepresented in the literature. Family caregiving research appears to understate the most frequent help given to elders (instrumental help) and may over-represent caregiving burden. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Since assuring quality health care delivery to patients suffering from Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and those who test positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a priority, development of effective staff training methods is imperative. This pilot study assessed the effect on staff attitudes of a participative AIDS/HIV staff training method, designed to overcome many of the problems associated with standard didactic methods. Health care workers (N=42) at a large, public psychiatric hospital were evaluated prior to training. Pretest scores were obtained for all 42 staff members. Fourteen employees attended both training sessions; 18 attended the first session only; 6 attended the second session only; and 4 attended neither session. Posttest questionnaires were  administered at the end of the second training session. Of the 20 employees who completed the posttests, 6 had not attended the first session and 14 had attended both sessions. Pretest scores were compared with posttest scores from those who completed the two training sessions. The results support the efficacy of the participative staff training method as a means of increasing compassion toward AIDS/HIV patients, acceptance of the obligation to treat these individuals, and appropriate work-related risk reduction. Desired changes were found only in subjects who attended both training sessions. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Two studies examined homelessness in Augusta, Georgia. The Key Informant Survey, conducted in 1987, involved interviewing individuals (N=42) knowledgeable about homeless people in the community. In the Shelter and Street Surveys of homeless people, conducted in March (N=51) and July (N=71) of 1988, homeless subjects were interviewed concerning demographics; history of housing and homelessness; family and friendships; employment, income, and other financial assistance; perceptions of shelter services in Augusta; history of treatment for addiction and mental illness; general health status and access to health care; and experiences with the criminal justice system. The findings revealed that the homeless subjects were predominantly male and unmarried. There were nearly twice as many  homeless persons in shelters and on the street during July as during March. It appears that the street population of homeless increases significantly during the summer. This population was found to be extremely poor with many reporting lengthy periods of unemployment and homelessness. A substantial proportion of Augusta's homeless reported experience with treatment in substance abuse and/or psychiatric settings. (Survey instruments are appended. Further study will hope to include additional findings in the areas of general health status, access to health care, mental health status, perception of shelter services, social networks, and experiences with the criminal justice system.)

Subjects were 1,156 medical students who entered medical school between 1976 and 1981.

The findings from this 4-year panel study provides preliminary support for the hypotheses concerning social support. (Author/NB)",

It explored how the professional self is developed and how the factors that influence such a development shape a person's performance. Two factors were of interest: (1) the time at which the professional self was developed; and (2) the causes that contributed to this self-development. In the first year of medical school, subjects completed a questionnaire which dealt with their decision to choose medicine as a career. Eighteen items addressed the question of which factors had influenced them to enter medicine. Subjects were 1,156 medical students who were followed for 4 years, beginning with their first year in medical school. It was  assumed that all subjects had a professional identity (wanting to become physicians) but that they differed in the development of this identity. Results revealed that it was not necessarily advantageous for a person to decide on a certain career very early in life and/or to base such a decision on external factors. An identity crisis in which a person's abilities and interests were used as reference points for deciding upon a certain profession seemed to be quite beneficial for achievement related directly with a career.

        "description":"This report consists of two papers on caregiving in Asian countries. The first, &quot;Caregiving in Developing East and Southeast Asian Countries&quot; by Nelson W. S. Chow, discusses the change in the caregiving pattern for the urban elderly in developing countries of East and Southeast Asia. It includes examples from studies carried out in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Republic of Korea, and Shanghai. It is noted that, although the majority of the urban elderly are living with their families, the difficulties they encounter are still great, and the dependent economic position in which most of the elderly find themselves has reduced the respect shown to them and has made them feel inadequate and isolated. The second presentation, &quot;Caregiving among Middle and Low Income Aged in Hong  Kong&quot; by Alex Y. H. Kwan, highlights some of the problems faced by the elderly when a society moves from being a traditional agrarian, trading-port community into an urbanized, international finance society of nearly 6 million people. Strains being experienced by the elderly and their families are identified, with an emphasis on caregivers and how Western values tend to affect support systems and family networks. The usefulness of community care programs in Hong Kong is examined. The article concludes that, although the family system is still playing the major role in providing the elderly with necessary care, the kind of care provided is far from satisfactory. (NB)",

Results from a Swedish national sample of 1,005 telephone interviews in 1986 were compared with results from an American national sample from 1981. The findings revealed that 38% of the Swedish sample, compared to 55% of the American sample, reported that not having enough money to live on was a serious problem. For both countries, the problem appeared to deline with age. Even when Blacks and Hispanics were omitted from the American sample, proportionately more White Americans than Swedes reported not having enough money to live on. Concerning who should assume more responsibility for the care  of the elderly, 13% of the Swedish sample and 23% of the American sample reported that the elderly should be doing more for themselves; 51% of Swedes and 54% of Americans believed that the government should be doing more; and 52% of Swedes and 46% of Americans felt that the children of the elderly should assume more responsibility. In the United States, the older the respondent, the lower the proportion feeling that government should be doing more; in Sweden, the older the respondent, the higher the proportion expressing that viewpoint.

It is noted that the elderly comprise approximately 10% of Israel's Jewish population and that the majority of Israel's Jewish elders are foreign-born. The discussion examines the ethnic and cultural diversity of Israel's population and the impact of this diversity on living arrangements, family relations, and care for the elderly. A dichotomy is drawn between ethnic groups with Western modern cultural backgrounds and those from Asia and Africa with the background of Eastern traditional culture and norms. Also examined are the living  environments in Israel, especially within the rural sector where traditional villages exist alongside cooperative villages (the moshav) and collective communities (the kibbutz). The main components of the state of the art in gerontology in Israel are outlined. The first research project described involves an evaluation of the welfare services of the Haifa municipality and a coordinating service network between the hospitals in the city and the welfare department. The second project deals with the impact of the decision-making process of institutional placement upon family relations and the role of the social worker in the process. (NB)",

This paper is an updated version of a discussion paper prepared during the formative phase of the project. It was created to encourage consideration of a number of key issues related to innovative programs for community care of the elderly. Included are discussions of the cost effectiveness of community care, the scope of community care, support for caregivers, care in and by the community, the domiciliary care/nursing interface, the need for psychogeriatric services, and the importance of diagnosis and reassessment. The paper concludes with a brief consideration of the  nature and problems of evaluation. The conclusion notes that subsequent evaluation will focus on the effect of improved needs assessment and coordination of service delivery on the maintenance of elderly people in their homes, and on their quality of life and well-being. Also evaluated wil be the initial definitions of at-risk clients; the new tools for needs identification, biographical analysis, and the assessment of consumer satisfaction developed during the course of the project; and the economic implications of the provision of care coordinators posts.

        "description":"This report makes specific references to Jewish concerns while examining the respective responsibilities of the state, community, family, and the individual in caring for the elderly. It makes the critical point that reliance on the nuclear family in modern societies for elderly support becomes more tenuous to the extent that there are fewer adult children to provide support to their elderly relatives. The ratios of caregiving-aged adults (ages 45- 59) for every 100 older adults (ages 75+) in Jewish populations in different areas of the world are compared, and it is noted that differences in these ratios are reflected in major differences in the degree to which financial, social, health, and psychological needs are adequately met through networks of family, friends, and  neighbors. Special attention is paid to the population of very old adults (those aged 85 and older) and their offspring in their 60's. The marital status of older adults and the prospect of caregiving support from a spouse are also considered. Intergenerational families are described and relationships between grandparents, their children, and their grandchildren are examined. The effectiveness of the creation of separate policies, programs, and services for the elderly is explored in a section on age integration and segregation; the view of the aged as a burden or asset is discussed; and loneliness and leisure time roles are also investigated. Care of the elderly and leadership roles are addressed. (NB)",

        "description":"This paper addresses issues related to the care of the aged by informal caregivers, government support of such care, and policy changes that might result in improved care of the elderly population. In its treatment of family responsibility for the elderly, it calls attention to several trends: (1) family members will be increasingly unavailable to provide care for their elderly relatives; (2) the elderly do not want to be too dependent upon family members; (3) the care of the elderly can result in serious economic, social, physical, and psychological costs to families; (4) these costs can result in abuse and mistreatment of the elderly; and (5) research findings do not support the assumed cost-savings from family care. It is questioned whether the United States and similar  urban-industrialized societies can effectively adopt the practices of other types of societies in which the elderly are satisfactorily sustained by relatives. Examples are cited of Japan and Sweden where government provides financial incentives to families who provide for older relatives to live with them. A 1981 survey is referred to which found that more responsibility by government, as compared to more by the children of the elderly, or by the elderly themselves, was favored to a greater extent by the American public. Findings on international policies supporting family care of the elderly and its consequences are reviewed and the areas of assistance to families, mandating family support, and social changes affecting informal supports are addressed.

Broverman's Sex-Role Stereotype Questionnaire (SRSQ) was completed by 322 clinical members of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) and 554 psychotherapists listed in the current \"National Register of Health Service Providers in Psychology\" (NR). Results were analyzed for therapists who rated race-unspecified male or female targets in their late 20's, late 40's, and late 60's (N=412, AAMFT n=203, NR n=209). The findings revealed that young women and young and middle-aged men were perceived as significantly  more achievement-oriented than were the old of either gender. Therapists perceived middle-aged targets as more controlled and well-socialized than adults in their late 20's. Young and middle-aged targets were perceived as more self-assured than the old. Therapists of both genders viewed women as more expressive- nurturant than men, but female therapists perceived male targets as much less expressive-nurturant than did male therapists. The outstanding finding in the study was that age of target differences appeared on three of the four gender stereotype measures, and in a pattern that generally supported predictions derived from a social role analysis of stereotype derivation.

        "author":["Spitalny, Gloria"],
        "description":"Four sexually exploited clients shared their experiences in invoking the complaint process against their former therapists. They wanted to stop the therapist from practicing and harming others, to receive some acknowledgement that they had been harmed, and to obtain some kind of recompense. If the therapist was unable to admit his or her error, make restitution, or stop injuring others, they expected the ethics committee, the licensing board, or the court to ensure this result. Two of the clients initiated their complaints through the ethics committee of their therapist's professional association. One client began with the licensing board, and one started with a lawyer and a malpractice suit. They all had suggestions on how to improve the complaint process for others: (1) have an  advocate who can discuss possible options in pursuing a complaint; (2) expedite the process of ethics committees, licensing boards, and legal action; (3) pay members who sit on ethics committees and licensing boards; (4) explain the procedures of ethics committees and licensing boards, give estimates on the length of time involved, and directly communicate the results; (5) establish mandatory reporting by other professionals; (6) establish a criminal law; (7) keep data banks on abusive therapists; and (8) extend the statute of limitations. Many of these recommendations are supported in the literature. Professionals need to come together to review these recommendations, put them in an acceptable form, and implement them in order to protect the public welfare. (Author/NB)",

Optimal career success and satisfaction follow from an experience of time characterized by an orientation to a future that is densely populated with events clearly connected to present behavior. Career interventions may empower individuals by facilitating the temporal perspective, differentiation, and integration that sustain occupational achievement and career satisfaction. These interventions create hope when they make the future important, cause the future to seem real, and construct pathways that lead from the present to goal attainment. A hopeful temporal experience prompts the self-conscious awareness of a subjective career and engenders the planful attitudes and planning  competencies that are critical to career decision making and adjustment. Teaching individuals to have a subjective career helps to shape their perspective on time, differentiate time into meaningful units, and connect events along a time continuum. The planful attitudes and planning skills that result from these interventions may generalize to empower individuals in other life roles. (Author/ABL)",

Each review of the CDS and many investigations of it have offered explicit suggestions for  research to further develop the Indecision Scale. Developments for the CMI concern its increasing use in teaching decisional attitudes and competencies. At this time the most pressing need for the CIM-Attitude Scale is a literature review.

This project established regionally distributed co-operative arrangements with four schools of pharmacy, one state pharmacy association, and one national pharmacy fraternity. In each of the six regions of the country project staff and co-hosts determined profiles of the region's rural elders (personal, health, and socioeconomic characteristics) and of their over-the-counter and prescription drug use in order to orient geropharmacy and gerontology content to the specific needs of the region. Profile-oriented curricula were then taught on-site to pharmacy and health-related faculty; leaders in state,  regional, or local pharmacy associations; and selected community pharmacists. Drug usage profiles were found to differ by geographic region, with several explanatory variables. Independent 6-to 7-month follow-up evaluations by a third party showed some significant changes in participants' practices, within both pharmacy education/continuing education and community operations. This project highlights the need to tailor geropharmacy education to the specific characteristics of the elders in the region. (Author/ABL)",

Most of the research on family correlates of substance abuse has been conducted with teenage addicts and has consisted primarily of reports obtained from the substance abusing adolescent only. This study attempted to identify clusters of family variables that may be causally related to adolescent substance abuse. Data were collected from 154 parents who represented 116 families of middle and high school students identified at high risk of substance use. Family support, communication and conflict intensity, parental coping styles, substance use, health status, life stress, and attitudes towards adolescent substance use were assessed from the parental perspective. The relationship between  these family variables and substance use reported by the adolescent was investigated. A statistical model was developed to more fully elaborate the precise relationships between various family characteristics and adolescent substance use. The most striking effect in these models was the combined role of parental and sibling alcohol use, supporting hypotheses about the role of modeling, facilitation, and lack of negative consequences as contributors to adolescent substance use. Findings emphasize the importance of family factors as predictors of adolescent alcohol use. (ABL)",

In 1978 the original version was modified to eliminate double negative statements and alternative ways of asking the same question and then referred to as the Beck Inventory (BI). The BI is designed to be self-administered, tapping feelings over the past week. The reliability of the 1978 version of the BI and BDI-SF were investigated using an elderly population (N=102) participating in a health promotion program. The internal consistency reliabilities were 0.87 for both forms. Five items on the long form were identified as commonly occurring in an elderly population without depression:  weight loss, body image, irritability, loss of libido, and sleep disturbance. The psychometric characteristics of these items were investigated as was their relationship to the total score. Modifying the BI for the elderly to exclude these five items resulted in a 16-item version (BI-E) with an internal consistency of 0.88. Correlations between the BI-E and the other forms were 0.94 or more. Validity was examined through classification structures and correlational patterns with other mental and physical health parameters. (Author/ABL)",

Results indicated that students in the coping  skills conditions increased their knowledge of the skills; however, positive changes in personality characteristics, substance knowledge, and behavior growth for those in the coping skills training groups did not differ from those for the comparison control group.

The design of successful programs requires taking into account not only existing audience awareness, but knowledge of basic communication planning principles as well. Previous research on source, message, and channel factors in influencing audiences provides a substantial resource for campaign planners intent upon matching messages to particular audiences. Elements such as source credibility, fear appeals, use of humor, elements of message design, and channel information capacities  have all been the subject of considerable research, and many of the findings have implications for media message design. Formative research can also present profiles of the mass and interpersonal communication patterns of specific target groups, and can address their motives for communicating and the kinds of gratifications they seek from doing so. Local neighborhood group campaigns should be integrated with more generalized media campaigns. Group participation may have particular benefits for the elderly in fighting crime. (Author/ABL)",

The hypothesis that there would be a significant relationship between weight loss and eating self-efficacy was supported; stronger evidence was derived from number of pounds lost than from a weight reduction quotient.

Subjects (N=636) were parents whose sons or daughters attended a public high school. Parent satisfaction, adolescent social competence, and parental qualities were measured using self-report scales. The results indicated that parents who reported evidence of social competence in their adolescents were also found to report high levels of parent satisfaction. Parents who reported themselves  to be the most supportive of their adolescents were highly satisfied with parenting their adolescents. Particular styles of attempting to control the adolescents explained variance in parental satisfaction for fathers, but not for mothers. Fathers who used coercion with their adolescents were the least satisfied. In a similar pattern, fathers who used induction reported greater satisfaction with their adolescents.

The results indicated that American children had higher self-esteem scores than did their Chinese counterparts on both self-esteem measures. The cultural differences in self-esteem cannot  be explained satisfactorily in terms of the self-effacing tendency among Chinese children. Chinese children probably receive less respectful treatment because they live in authoritarian families where the parents make the decisions and the children are expected to obey. Chinese students in unidimensional classrooms seem to have fewer opportunities for success than do American children who are more likely to be in multidimensional classrooms in which they can achieve success in many ways.

To identify specific cognitive reappraisal themes and strategies caregivers use, this study examined published accounts of caregivers' (N=26) experiences, which represent an unobtrusive, untapped data source. Statements that reframed or redefined the caregiving situation were recorded and sorted into categories. Five major reframing themes emerged: (1) taking the care-recipient's perspective; (2) finding satisfaction or meaning; (3) identifying accomplishments; (4) discovering personal benefits; and (5) accepting one's own limitations. This study was limited by the sample of caregivers who chose to tell their stories and the  researcher's choices of categories. Increasing the understanding of caregivers' use of cognitive coping strategies can be a foundation for further research that would explore the effectiveness of various techniques in helping caregivers manage their difficult situations.

This study examined risk to use drugs, rather than actual drug use, as the outcome measure and explored the association between components of the parent-child relationship and risk for substance use 1 year later among nonusing young adolescents. Subjects were seventh graders and their participating parents, including 272  nonusers of tobacco and 437 nonusers of marijuana at the beginning of the study. Factor analysis identified the parental relationship and risk-to-use factors, which provided constructs for causal modeling. Analyses were conducted separately for tobacco and marijuana use. The parental relationship constructs did not predict later use of tobacco. One parental relationship construct, emotional closeness, predicted later risk to use marijuana. Emotional closeness with parents, including physical signs of affection, appeared to serve a role in preventing young adolescents from later marijuana use. (Author/ABL)",

In particular, they assert that a pivotal skill in this role transition is the cognitive shift from thinking like a counselor to thinking like a supervisor. This article focuses on one aspect of training that seems basic to the success of the variety of supervision training programs. The thoughts and behaviors of supervisors who have and have not made the role transition are contrasted and interventions that facilitate the cognitive shift are described. Included are illustrations drawn from experiences as a supervisor educator in academic and inservice settings. It is suggested that effective supervisors think of their counselors and of themselves  as educators who create appropriate learning environments. It is claimed that beginning to think like a supervisor is the first step toward a larger goal of developing a cognitive map or conceptual framework for conducting supervision. The article concludes that the cognitive shift of thinking like a supervisor should be a conscious goal of supervision training; when trainers think like supervisor educators, their trainees will learn to think and behave like effective supervisors.

Computer administration of tests provides more control over the testing process than was ever possible with paper-and-pencil testing. At the same time it offers the possibility of being able to monitor and record aspects of the testing process, such as response latency and response shifting, that may prove to be important predictive factors in their own right. Computer scoring of tests has made it possible to obtain accurate scores. It has been estimated that errors involving a difference of one or more points in the final score are made in 10 percent of cases involving hand scoring of objective tests. These and similar errors of measurement may have more impact on  the reliability of scores obtained in practice than some of the better analyzed sources described in measurement theory. In the final analysis, computer interpretations of test scores may offer the greatest potential for advancing psychological measurement. As the volume of research data relevant to a particular test increases, the task of using it effectively in interpretation becomes increasingly frustrating for the unassisted test user. Perhaps even more importantly, computerized reports produce consistent, predictable outputs that can be analyzed and improved if the appropriate models and techniques are developed for doing so and they are treated scientifically and not as scientific curiosities.

        "author":["McFadden, Emily Jean"],
        "description":"Empowerment as originally used referred to a political process in which systemic power was analyzed and redistributed. To translate concepts of empowerment into foster care terminology, an indifferent society fails to support families at risk, then increases their powerlessness by removing their children. Foster children are primarily children of the poor, who are often treated &quot;poorly&quot; by the system mandated to protect and nurture them. The reason that the concept of empowerment is a political one is that societal injustice demands political and economic action. Before thinking about empowerment for young people, the specific ways in which foster children and youth are disempowered must be considered. Foster children could be asked what they want in case review. It is not  surprising that youth at age 17 or 18 cannot make good choices if they have not been allowed choices at age 10. It may be that in foster care research, researchers have been asking the wrong questions; foster children themselves should have input. Before anything else, it must be assured that children and youth in foster care are not harmed. Secondly, a supportive environment must be established. Empowerment is a political process aimed at analyzing and acquiring uses of influence. Ultimately the children in foster care must speak for themselves. (ABL)",

        "description":"The 1983 North Carolina Dropout Study and the 1988 North Carolina Follow-Up Dropout Study were conducted to provide baseline dropout data for North Carolina public high schools, to provide estimates of dropout rates, and to explore possible factors contributing to a student's decision to leave high school. The results of the 1983 study indicated that 26 to 28 percent of North Carolina public school ninth-graders did not graduate from a North Carolina public high school within the next 5 years. Students in the 1988 sample were classified as known graduates, known dropouts, and indeterminates. For the random sample of 2,011 students, the percentage of known graduates was 75.1 percent and the percentage of estimated graduates was 77 percent. The on-going At Risk Study (1987-1991) is  being conducted to explore factors which put a student at risk of dropping out. School behavior and performance differences between graduates and dropouts were investigated, including grade retention, achievement test performance, and pre-school attendance. Student reported reasons for leaving school were also examined. Further steps should include support for efforts to achieve a standard definition of school dropout; local data collection; increased monitoring; evaluation of program effectiveness for at-risk students; sharing of information; and implementation of recent task force and legislative recommendations.

This unique program, which was developed in 1983 as a cooperative effort by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Unified School District, uses uniformed law enforcement officers to teach a formal curriculum to students in a classroom setting. Project DARE gives special attention to fifth and sixth grades to prepare students for entry into junior high and high school, where they are most likely to encounter pressures to use drugs. DARE lessons focus on four major areas: providing accurate information about tobacco, alcohol, and drugs;  teaching students decision-making skills; showing students how to resist peer pressure; and giving students ideas for alternatives to drug use. Noteworthy features of the program are the following: (1) DARE targets elementary school children; (2) DARE offers a highly structured, intensive curriculum developed by health education specialists; (3) DARE uses uniformed law enforcement officers to conduct the class; and (4) DARE represents a long-term solution to a problem that has developed over many years.

This verbal/symbolic aggression is defined as a communication, either verbal or nonverbal, intended to cause psychological pain to another person, or perceived as having that intent. This study investigated the frequency and correlates of verbal/symbolic aggression in a nationally representative sample of 5,232 American families. Verbal/symbolic aggression was measured by the Conflict Tactics Scales. Regardless of whether male or female respondents were the source of the data, it was found that husbands and wives engaged in about equal amounts of aggression. The probability  of frequent verbal/symbolic aggression against a spouse tended to decrease with age and the number of children in the family, and to increase with the occurrence of alcohol abuse and the use of other drugs. Socioeconomic status and race were not found to be related to verbal aggression. Verbal aggression is part of a syndrome of abusive and problematic interpersonal relationships within the family.

After outlining a plan for achieving schools without drugs, the first section, &quot;Children and Drugs,&quot; describes the nature and extent of the drug problem and summarizes the latest research on the effects of drugs on students and schools. Included are fact sheets on drugs and dependence, youth and alcohol, and cocaine/crack.  The second section, &quot;A Plan for Action,&quot; is divided into four parts according to what parents, schools, students, and communities can do. Suggestions for parents include instilling responsibility, supervising, activities, and recognizing drug use, while suggestions for schools focus on assessment, policy setting and enforcement, teaching about drug prevention, and enlisting the community's help. Fact sheets are included on signs of drug use, tips for selecting drug prevention materials, legal questions on search and seizure, and legal questions on suspension and expulsion. Students are advised to learn the facts in order to help fight drug use, while communities are advised to provide support and involve law enforcement in efforts to control drug traffic and use. Special sections are  appended on teaching about drug prevention and using the law. Resources are provided on specific drugs and their effects, sources of information, and references. (TE)",

The next section explains the operation of the STaR program, its materials (sequence cards, flannel board materials) and methods (retelling, dramatization), which are intended to facilitate the effective use of stories in classrooms. Evaluation of the program is addressed in  the next section: individual students from a matched control group were compared with experimental students, tests (the Merrill Language Screening Test and the Test of Language Development) were individually administered to 206 prekindergarten and kindergarten children (43 and 60 matched pairs, respectively), and results indicated program effectiveness, showing positive effects ranging from effect sizes of .24 to 3.75. In addition, informed and anecodotal evidence showed that the program met with approval from teachers and enthusiasm from the children.

        "description":"This book discusses PCRP II, an integrative framework for language and literacy which teachers and administrators can use to examine, and when appropriate, to improve school and classroom practice in language use across the curriculum. Chapter 1 offers an introduction and summary. Chapter 2, &quot;Perspectives on Theory and Practice,&quot; presents four perspectives for looking at the curriculum: learning as meaning-centered, social, language-based, and human. Chapter 3, &quot;The Five Critical Experiences,&quot; (reading, writing, extending reading and writing, investigating language, and learning to learn) defines each experience, elaborates its specific research and theory bases, and suggests classroom activities applicable across the grades and across the curriculum, as well as activities for  different grade levels and content areas. The fourth chapter, &quot;Constructing Curriculum,&quot; addresses the integration of the five critical experiences in daily, weekly and long-range instruction and curriculum planning, and deals with ways to use the PCRP II framework as a heuristic for critical reflection on current practice and for designing units and planned courses of study. Chapter 5, &quot;Designing Congruent Evaluation,&quot; maintains that integrative models of curriculum and learning are more likely to be successful if the evaluation program reflects these models, and proposes six principles for designing the evaluation procedures. The sixth chapter, &quot;Implementing PRCP II through Networking,&quot; discusses the rationale for PCRP II and for the statewide plan for implementing the framework, and  provides a set of specific but adaptable suggestions for how this book may be used to effect change at the level of districts, schools and individual classrooms. Twenty notes are included and an 11-page bibliography is attached. An appendix contains the report of the Pennsylvania Department of Education conference on PCRP II. (SR)",

Educators directly involved with textbook adoptions have expressed several concerns, including: time pressures on evaluators; lack of training for evaluators; concerns related to publishers; and correlations with state or district curriculum. Tennessee's plan for evaluating textbooks was developed by the State Textbook Commission, along with the State Board of Education and the State Department of Education. The model consists of the following steps: (1) selection of basal reader evaluators; (2) approval and release of &quot;Invitation to Bid&quot;; (3) development of evaluation plan; (4) orientation and training for evaluators; (5) independent evaluation of books by reviewers; (6)  evaluator debriefing and committee reports; (7) hearings of State Textbook Commission; and (8) adoptions at the local level. A follow-up survey indicated that both reviewers and publishers were pleased with the process. The communication which occurred between publishers' representatives and reviewers during the display session could hold much promise for the ultimate improvement of basal readers.

The program featured individual and small group instruction arranged according to pupil needs, as well as projects utilizing computer-assisted instruction (CAI). The program was evaluated through administration of the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills as pretest and posttest. Test results indicated that of 2,352 pupils with good attendance records who were native speakers of English, average test score gain was 5.9 Normal Curve Equivalent (NCE) points for the 5.7 months of instruction, which met the program objective of 1.0 NCE per  month of instruction. Analysis by grade revealed that the objective was met in grades 3 and 4. Average NCE gains for students using CAI were higher than those for the regular group in grades 2 and 3 and lower in the remaining grades. Recommendations include determining the cause for less growth at certain grade levels, continuing the Whole Language treatment group, encouraging more parent participation, and improving coordination with classroom teachers.

The goal of the IA program was to provide an educational support program for underachieving pupils. Instructional aides were trained to provide direct instructional service to selected pupils in the classroom. The program, which was implemented in 58 buildings and involved the equivalent of 135 aides assisting 199 teachers, emphasized activities which would increase oral language, written language, and reading skills. Program evaluation efforts involved the administration of sub-tests of the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills to kindergarten children and first-grade  students, and the use of locally constructed surveys of staff and reading assessments of students. The attendance criterion of 90 days was met by 154 kindergarten children and 1,136 first-graders; of these, 903 pupils received pre- and posttest administrations of the achievement test. Results for kindergarten students indicated an average Normal Curve Equivalent (NCE) gain of 2.2 per month for the 5.6 month project period, but less than 80% of the teachers perceived pupil progress was directly attributable to the instructional aide. Results for first grade students indicated that students did not meet the goal of one NCE gain for each month of the program, although teacher ratings indicated that reading skills were substantially enhanced through direct instruction.

The program's two major goals were to develop and provide CLEAR-RR for the first grade pupils and to adapt and apply the inservice program for teachers. Specially trained teachers provided one-on-one half-hour daily lessons during the school year. Pupils included in the final pretest-posttest analysis had received 60 or more instructional lessons. Activities included reading and rereading books while the teacher maintained a record of strategies and errors, writing  and reading stories, identifying letters, and analyzing sounds in words. Students discontinued the program when they had successfully achieved predetermined levels on the Reading Recovery Diagnostic Survey and the vocabulary and comprehension subtests of the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, Levels B and C. Analyses of the standardized test data included comparison of Total Reading scores, pretest to posttest, using percentiles and Normal Curve Equivalents. Results indicated that: (1) the 271 students who completed the program gained an average of 9.6 NCEs; and (2) a staff survey, principal survey, and parent survey indicated that respondents generally viewed the program as effective.

An epistemological questionnaire was administered to the undergraduates. Factor analysis of the questionnaire resulted in four factors reflecting degrees of beliefs in innate ability, simple knowledge, quick learning, and certain knowledge. In experiment two, 86 of the junior college students who participated in experiment one read a passage from either the social sciences or the physical sciences, in which the concluding paragraph was removed. They rated their confidence in understanding the passage, wrote a conclusion, and  completed a mastery test. Belief in &quot;quick learning&quot; predicted oversimplified conclusions and belief in &quot;certain knowledge&quot; predicted inappropriately absolute conclusions. Belief in quick learning predicted poor performance on the mastery level test and confidence rating. Results indicated that epistemological beliefs should be conceptualized in terms of several independent dimensions, each with distinct effects on comprehension.

The report outlines a &quot;standard model&quot; of word meanings which equates word meanings with critical features, or necessary and sufficient conditions for serious, literal use of a word. The model outlined underlies both current common sense thinking about word meanings and much current pedagogical practice in vocabulary instruction. The report argues that in the standard model's attempt to provide a parsimonious, general account of semantics, the standard model falls short of a linguistically adequate and psychologically realistic characterization of meaning. The report concludes that although many points are still being debated,  the current consensus of scholars can best be characterized as the rejection of the standard model.

        "description":"A study was conducted to explore the ways in which instructional method and text quality influence the young reader's interpretation of inside view and character plans in fiction. Thirty-six third graders from a northeastern, suburban, public elementary school served as subjects. Twelve children were selected randomly from students rated as strong, average, and weak. Treatment conditions were randomly assigned to the groups: no instruction/original text (control); no instruction/basal text (control); &quot;Insight into Literature&quot;/original text; &quot;Insight into Literature&quot;/basal text; traditional instruction/original text; and traditional instruction/basal text. The original version of &quot;Freckle Juice&quot; and an adaptation of the story appearing in a basal reading series served as the text  for the experimental investigation. Results of the quantitative analysis suggest that both instructional method and text quality influence the young reader's interpretation of inside view and character plans in fiction. The combination of original, unadapted texts and sociocognitive instructional methods that emphasize literary content shows promise as an alternative instructional context for reading during the elementary school years. The research suggests that young readers are capable of weaving an interpretation of literary form and content and a spontaneous storyretelling. Whether students will be successful in extending their recreations of stories through interpretation may depend upon their participation in instructional contexts that emphasize literary features.

        "description":"A gap exists between talk about teaching that is featured in most preservice teacher education and the working knowledge and problem-solving expertise that characterize skilled teaching. This gap exists because typical teacher training does not embody the principles of modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, and reflection. Three methods which make use of these principles include reciprocal teaching, Reading Recovery, and the Kamehameha Early Education Program (KEEP) in Hawaii. These same principles can and should be applied more broadly to the education of reading teachers. One way prospective teachers can witness authentic practice is through the use of videotapes of real classrooms. Videotechnology would increase the value of the classroom experience for the teacher  trainee and decrease the time and energy the education professor would otherwise have to spend on ancillary matters. This time could be invested in scrutiny of the trainees' videotaped lessons. Prospective teachers could be trained to analyze each other's tapes, an experience which would afford more than the implementation of a lesson containing good and improvable points. It provides a forum for prospective teachers to reflect on a teaching experience, share their ideas, support their suggestions, and gain insight into the nature of teaching. The professor's theoretical information comes to life as a result of its contextualization. The use of videotapes in these ways offers the most feasible avenue open to improve the quality of teacher education and assure higher returns on the  nation's investment in literacy. (MG)",

The overhead projector is a valuable tool for enhancing instruction involving prediction. The process of gradually revealing text to a group of students, eliciting their predictions, evaluating their predictions, and then either confirming or gently refuting these predictions is a valuable learning activity. A short selection with an easily followed story line is recommended for this exercise. Preparation of transparencies requires obtaining a good clear copy of the material. Mounting the transparencies allows the transparency to lay flat on the projection surface glass, allows for a sharper image to be presented, and the mount  provides space for writing notes concerning the transparency. Overhead transparencies need to be protected and stored in a manner that will permit efficient retrieval. The use of good reading materials presented on well-prepared overheads provides a rich instructional base for enhancing prediction competencies. (MG)",

        "description":"As in processing oral speech, proficient reading involves &quot;chunking&quot; written texts into meaningful phrase units. Unlike oral speech, however, cues for segmenting the written text at the proper points are not clearly marked in the text. One method for helping readers identify and use phrase boundaries is to mark such boundaries in the text. A study reviewed research conducted over the past four decades that has attempted to facilitate subjects' reading by providing marked cues to phrase boundaries. Although as a whole the research is not conclusive as to the efficacy of phrase-cued texts in aiding comprehension, it shows promise for helping improve the reading performance of at least certain types of readers, particularly for younger, poorer, and hearing-impaired readers.  Phrase-cued texts seem to be facilitative for readers who have yet to achieve maturity in syntactic sensitivity. However, a level of competency in word recognition may be necessary before phrased texts can be effective. Issues to be explored in future research include topics such as points of transfer to and maintenance of facilitation on conventional texts.

The paper suggests that: (1) teachers need to make the classroom a place where children can feel safe and are encouraged to experiment and take risks with language without fear of failure; (2) reading aloud regularly and often to children should be the centerpiece of any early childhood literacy program; (3) early childhood teachers may wish to focus on words with their students; (4) children should see their teachers and other  adults use literacy; (5) early childhood classrooms should be well-equipped with reading and writing materials; and (6) teachers must expect that their children will do well in school and communicate that expectation often to children and parents. The paper concludes that early childhood literacy educators would do well to give serious consideration to the practices, environments, and attitudes of parents who give their children a good start on the road to reading and writing.

Data were obtained from 60 undergraduate college students, 30 of whom were identified as good readers and 30 of whom were enrolled in a reading skills course, by asking them to identify phrase boundaries in two texts varying in difficulty. Results revealed an interaction between reading ability and text difficulty. In the easier text, both good and poor readers performed at the same level. With the more difficult text,  the performance of the poor readers remained at the same level as that of the easier text. Further analysis indicated that errors in phrasing were due more to a relative insensitivity, rather than too great a sensitivity, to phrase boundaries. Continued investigations into the development of readers' phrasing ability appear to be called for. (One figure and five tables of data are included; 27 references are attached.) (KEH)",

Klyman, editor of the &quot;Pictures&quot; magazine, was a labor activist who disavowed all suspicions that he was a communist. Pulitzer objected to Klyman's emphasis on class struggle and the virtues of non-capitalist economies but believed Klyman was too good a picture editor to be fired or transferred. Dilliard, who edited the editorial page, differed with Pulitzer over interpretation of the First Amendment and application of Constitutional guarantees to the threat of communist subversion. During the  Joseph McCarthy era, Pulitzer felt that Dilliard gave the senator an incessant drubbing in the editorial pages. However, Pulitzer respected Dilliard too much to fire him. Pulitzer's attempts to curb both Klyman and Dilliard by assigning people to closely supervise their work was only partly successful. (Thirty-two notes are included.) (MHC)",

        "description":"Textual meaning is not autonomous--not only do the meanings of texts change as contexts change but also the textual or sentence meanings change as cultural conventions change. A series of preliminary studies have established that children into the early school years believe that the speaker's intentions, especially when the speaker's belief is false, make their way to the listener even when there is no lexical means for conveying that intention. These studies indicate that children tend to conflate what a speaker means with what the utterance means. With age and schooling they come to see these two &quot;meanings&quot; as independent. Children come to revise their estimate of the meaning intention on the basis of the linguistic or sentence meaning. They begin to treat that textual meaning  as autonomous. But what continues to be the case is that the basic distinctions required for literate interpretation continue to be useful for distinguishing between the properties of the text which are &quot;taken as given&quot; for any particular purpose and the set of construals or interpretations that can be made of that text. In learning to distinguish meanings from intentions, and thoughts from expressions, children take the first step on the path which proceeds from taking facts as given and then organizing those facts into some theoretical scheme.

The report explores the relationships among classroom contexts, computer-based innovations, writing practices, and actual written texts--based on long term participant observation in two urban, sixth-grade classrooms, over a 2-year period. The first two sections define the construct of a classroom writing system and discuss both the outside forces on the classrooms and the particular patterns of social organization that pre-dated the introduction of computer technology. The third section focuses on the function and use of the computer with  QUILL software within each classroom writing system; the fourth section discusses the importance of teacher expectations in shaping student writing by using a case study to trace the development over time of a single composition, from first to final draft. The final section examines the conflicting purposes at work within a classroom writing system and the demands that those conflicting purposes put on both teachers and students in carrying out sensible writing and response in classroom encounters. The report concludes by discussing the interrelated implications that a writing systems approach has for equity, writing instruction, evaluation of innovations, and teacher education.

Drawing on data from recent research on writing, the paper proposes three principles that inform a more complicated interaction and suggests that both cognition and context may in a sense construct one another. The principles the paper proposes are: (1) that cultural and social context can provide direct cues to cognition; (2) that context is always mediated by the cognition of the individual writer; and (3) that the bounded purposes that emerge from this process are highly constrained but at the same time meaningful, creative constructs. Addressing the issue of  developing an interactive theory, the paper investigates the need for a broader vision of research as a tool for building contextualized and integrated theories of writing, and focuses on a particular route to theory building, suggesting reasons why observation-based research is the preferred route.

These concepts were applied to a close inspection of three texts written over an 18-month period by an adult writer, Nate, entering a research community within a doctoral program at a major university. The texts chosen for analysis were introductions to end-of-term project reports which, written in the first three semesters, served as milestones in that they represented the culmination of a semester's thinking on a given research topic and the writer's compiled linguistic and substantive  knowledge in his new discipline. The study suggests that the changes occurring over time and the linguistic and rhetorical features of these texts can be seen as indicators of this student's initiation into a disciplinary subspecialty.

Research in both instructional and academic writing which suggests that writers may fail to turn to a constructive strategy even when ill-defined tasks demand it is examined in the paper. Based on a detailed analysis of expert and novice writers, the paper presents a theory of constructive strategy and isolates  five critical features in which writers must create a unique network of working goals and deal with the special problems of integration, conflict resolution and instantiation this constructive process entails. The paper also describes the strategies writers use to meet these demands and some expert/novice differences that affect the integration of the entire plan.

In 1911 Emma Bugbee became the first woman hired as a &quot;hard&quot; news reporter for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; (later the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;). Ishbel Ross, author of &quot;Ladies of the Press,&quot; got her start in journalism in 1916, when her interview of Emmaline Pankhurst, British suffragist leader, made the front page of the &quot;Toronto Daily News.&quot; By 1919, the year Ross joined Bugbee at the &quot;New York Tribune,&quot; Bugbee had worked her way to a desk down the hall from the newspaper's city room, where she covered suffrage news. While the suffragists marched for their rights, the women reporters covering suffrage news fought to get their stories on the front  pages. According to Ross, when women's suffrage stories became page one news, women reporters were often replaced by their male colleagues. In 1914, Bugbee and others at the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; finally insisted they could handle the stories themselves and were given the chance. Bugbee walked with the suffragists on a week-long winter march from New York City to Albany, phoning her story in to the paper each night. Bugbee wrote for the &quot;Tribune&quot; for five decades; Ross eventually retired from journalism to write novels and biographies about American women. (Sixty-nine notes are included.) (MHC)",

The danger, joy, and mystery of life is under the aesthetic gun. Do playwrights, and theater practitioners in general, repress and thus betray their inner voices, or do they seek out the frenzy of heterotopia, which may be throbbing to be uncovered? Certainly, playwrights do not choose to write; writing chooses them. However, a writer may dig into a vein of mystery, which fringe theaters at least encourage, but even those theaters are not interested if the playwright is not a member of their inner circle. After receiving many of these types of jabs at a play's form and content, a playwright may know how to  stop writing. But Utopia is found within Heterotopia, and playwrights must keep searching for it. The playwright must feel deeply and write. (RS)",

Pragmatic, ethical, and theoretical reasons exist for making extemporaneous writing at least half of the composition curriculum and for removing the stigma of the pre-new-paradigm approach to writing. The in-class essay is a marvelous signal of the strengths and weaknesses of student writing: it shows how the student is incorporating the instruction about the writing process; it reveals how well he or she will write an office memo, a letter to clients, or  book reports and essays in other classes; it clarifies where in the writing process the student is and perhaps could go. Extemporaneous assignments, however, must be based on realistic writing situations and should include teacher observation of student behavior during the writing process and analysis of student &quot;scratch&quot; work and outlines.

        "description":"Basic media writing courses are integral to and will become an increasingly important part of communication programs as confusion over goals and lack of focus are clarified. Currently, media writing textbooks are designed for freshman composition, rhetoric, journalism, or mass communications courses. None do an adequate job surveying all types of media writing. A comparison between freshman composition and writing for mass media is a means to establish the focus for the latter. First, good writing comes in many styles and forms. Second, objectivity is central for media writing, while opinion and persuasion are keys in freshman composition. The uses of opinion in writing for the media are highly specialized. Third, rules of usage and formats change frequently in media writing as  opposed to freshman composition, in which students often have deeply imbedded notions of what is or is not correct usage. Moreover, some specific concerns about the basic media writing course include the distinctions between print and broadcast media formats, the amount of material that warrants two semesters of work, the obligation to familiarize students with the technology involved in each of the media, and the dilemma of whether to use a foundations or a formats approach.

        "description":"This paper explores the emergent and polyphonic character of voice in adolescent writing. It proposes a model, derived from M. M. Bakhtin's work on discourse, to account for how adolescent writers borrow voices from various speech communities and communication domains and combine them in complex overt and covert ways in order to construct their own voices. The first section of the paper discusses the conceptions of language-in-use, voice, and semiotic mechanisms which allow for the borrowing and integrating of various voices; the second section illustrates the model with the analysis of two representative texts written by adolescents. The final section presents implications of this approach for the analysis of the writing of adolescents. Forty-four references and an appendix  containing five student writing samples are attached.

        "description":"When asked to teach a newly-created course entitled &quot;Women and Creativity,&quot; a woman who loved teaching was eager for the opportunity to share stories about women with a class made up primarily of women. The course proposal, course objectives, and suggested texts initially seemed so outlined in scholarly language that the concept of creativity appeared imprisoned. The first topic of discussion was to analyze the traditional metaphor of the creative process, the muse, and to investigate differences between male and female conceptions of creativity. This led to the discovery that for women, creativity often was a subversive act in which they found a freedom and a validity in deviating from traditional male constructs of the world. Discussion was followed by two assignments designed  to help students discover that every discipline has a woman in it somewhere who has shaken the foundations. First, students were asked to write and give a report on a creative woman in their field of interest. Second, students were asked to work in teams, to research creative women, and to compile a small anthology on women and creativity. Class discussion during the rest of the course revealed a continuous return to three themes which also served as topics for essays: (1) the dilemma of woman as outsider with the double urge to fit in and to rebel; (2) the creative work of women produced by personal suffering; and (3) the creative sensibility of women which stems from their ability to transcend their own identities and merge with others.

Fifty-six books were included in the sample. In the selection process, account was made not only of the popularity of each book, but also of its distribution among different types of school and different grades to determine the rising level of difficulty in vocabulary between grades. These texts, referred to as the GYM corpus, were then compared to the COBUILD Corpus which represents the largest computerized English collection of texts available. Results revealed a different vocabulary profile in GYM texts from that found  in normal English prose as represented by COBUILD texts. Proportions between abstract and concrete, between complicated and simple, were found to be shifted in GYM texts in favor of the concrete and simple. To some extent this is understandable, since the COBUILD texts are mainly addressed to adult, native speakers of English. Additionally, GYM texts appeared insufficiently progressive, with the result that the difficult words were very often randomly distributed among the grades, instead of growing successively more common.

A telephone questionnaire was developed which sought information about respondent knowledge, attitudes, and behavior regarding privacy and personal information. A national survey of adults over the age of 18 was administered by professional interviewers to a weighted sample of 981 cases. Results indicated that average citizens are quite concerned about what they identify as illegitimate uses of personal information. Nearly all the variables are skewed toward the privacy protecting poles of each measure. The data with regard to age suggested that although older people are more likely to be the target of direct marketing (and resentful of such  annoyances), age did not appear to be related to any understanding of the ways in which personal information is gathered and used for marketing purposes. There were also critical inconsistencies in the data, especially those related to measures of social class, and future research will involve relatively precise classification of the respondent's work experience.

Academic freedom represents an important social and educational value. Despite the fact that it poses certain difficulties for those holding administrative positions, it is an aspect of educational life that is worthy of preservation. The price of academic freedom is contending with the threats to its existence (mainly but not exclusively from external sources) and the  consequences of its exercise (especially in such areas as reasonableness of instructors' standards, grading practices, and relevance of course content and scholarship). In light of all that the presence of academic freedom has contributed to the good of education, that price is very small indeed. (RS)",

Results of a survey which measured the club's effectiveness indicated that students enter the organization with different goals dependent on the stage in their student career. Members report that these goals are being met. The primary responsibility of the advisors at this more mature level of program development appears to be twofold: first, to assist students in becoming more cognizant of the organization as a forum for extending class/textbook learning to their experience in the organization; and second, to assist department faculty in becoming cognizant of the ways in which  the organization is assisting the department in achieving its goals. With the strong emphasis in post-secondary education on experiential learning, this nonperformance student organization offers still another channel for working with this concept within the field of speech communication, by drawing students to the observable and the concrete.

The modular mind is a bio-social model of communication which presupposes a relationship between the function and structure such that one cannot be examined without the other. Communicative focus necessarily centers on the functions associated with brain modules, how they receive, process and communicate the stimuli (information) with which they work. The processing mechanisms and modular networks interact to produce hemispheric modular cooperation and dissonance, the brain's way of sorting information used to produce perceptions and  messages. Several issues arising from holographic theory, dissipative structure, and chaos theory may produce new directions for both theory and research in intrapersonal communication.

The study was based on complete opening ceremony telecasts by NBC in America, Australia's Network TEN, and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Data were gathered on important audio and visual dimensions of the broadcasts. The three major components of the ceremony as planned by the event organizers were: (1) the obligatory Olympic rituals and gestures as defined by the Olympic Charter; (2) the entry/exit of the athletes; and (3) cultural performances including music, dance and demonstrations. Findings indicated that all of the opening ceremony  telecasts conveyed an emphasis on both nation and Olympic-style internationalism. A second general finding was that the three broadcast systems offered viewers different constructions of the Seoul opening ceremony. Results also indicated that, despite varied constructions and interpretations of the ceremony, South Korea's overall image portrayal across three opening ceremony telecasts was positive. The empirical evidence presented provides strong confirmation that television constructs the Olympic spectacle into multiple realities and that it does so with profound implications for images of nation, culture and the Olympic movement.

The paper also argues that the emergence of the Billy Graham campaign coincided with a unique set of events which shaped his communication style and suggests that it is unlikely that another evangelist will arise to continue the Graham style of the ethos-centered crusade because of new channels of communication and more  specialized audiences.

The goal of the audit team was to: (1) identify the strengths and weaknesses of the Sunday morning worship service; (2) assess the performance of ministers; and (3) seek information about denominational associations, memberships and support, publications, and church office staff. Additionally, background information about the members of the First Baptist Church was obtained as well as views of current issues and opinions about the use of the church building by outside groups. Data compiled from a large sample of church members (108 individuals returned the questionnaires)  identified areas of general concern to the congregation.

        "description":"A study examined the Ronald Reagan Administration's rhetoric about the invasion of Grenada to determine its ethical quality and whether the American public could make a fair judgment about the incident based on this rhetoric. Examination of President Reagan's rhetorical efforts revealed numerous violations of democratic ethical standards. Arguments and evidence that were distorted and withheld inhibited the American public's ability to appraise the incident fairly. Four criteria for democratic ethical standards were clearly violated. The first criterion requires that all relevant evidence be disclosed, and the record shows that significant facts were withheld from the American public. The second criterion of democratic standards of ethics requires that all arguments be clearly  presented and understood. The Administration, however, disseminated inaccurate information and many unproven assertions. Democratic ethics also require the individual be allowed to make a rational, well informed choice. Clearly, since the American public was deliberately deceived, its ability to make a significant choice was impeded. Finally, the democratic standards require that appropriate emotion be used. Here, again, the Reagan Administration failed by consistently appealing to fear for the safety of the Americans and the threat of communism as justifications for the invasion, when neither was justified.

Under current circumstances, with tremendous sums of money needed to use television for religious purposes, televangelists resort to sensationalism for mass appeal rather than to spreading the gospel. This ethical problem could be alleviated by having local television stations provide free air time for religious programming, during which no appeals for funds would be allowed. Shut-ins and others would still receive spiritual blessings; televangelists would not need to seek high ratings to stay on the air. Another concern is that the religious fervor of the fundamentalist televangelists leads to exclusionary rhetoric which has numerous negative consequences.  Exclusionary rhetoric argues that there is only one path to salvation and denies tolerance for other beliefs and lifestyles. It promotes religious and secular bigotry in which the &quot;saved&quot; are better than those who are not saved. It also creates a religious caste system in which the concept of attending the &quot;right&quot; church suggests that the other churches are wrong. The positive side of televangelism can be seen best in the work of Billy Graham. (KEH)",

People use language to encode their own experiences; memories are the encoded versions of reality. People learn how to characterize their experience by seeing how others characterize their own and others' experiences. When asked to talk about successful men and women, different words are typically used to describe the behaviors associated with men's versus women's success (such as, men are &quot;ambitious,&quot; women are &quot;power hungry&quot;). Besides the different emotional reactions to different words and phrases, part of the process of encoding experiences involves expressing attributions of motives and abilities. Looking at how people talk about achievement gives others a window into their  motivational systems. Individuals use language as it has been modeled to them to encode their experiences and then those encodings become reality. Language that reflects the status quo then influences how they think and behave. By listening closely to examples of the language women and girls use to describe their achievements, a better understanding of the relationship between language, thought, and achievement behavior can be gained.

Murder mysteries have the force to create reality. They force upon the reader a way of knowing, of apprehending what occurs in criminal investigations. The  interpretation and creation of the text by some readers may often tend to create a special, distinctive universe for the interpreters of the text.

A survey of the human rights and labor departments of all 50 states, designed to determine which states had enacted stronger legislation than the general framework provided by federal legislation, indicated a range of no laws to very specific laws concerning employment screening. A survey questionnaire, designed to determine the extent to which employers would ask or  consider asking illegal questions, was sent to 350 various organizations in Wisconsin and returned by 157 organizations. The sample of organizations was stratified in relation to nine basic industry types and the number of employees. Results indicated that: (1) a large majority of organizations are likely to be asking potentially illegal questions in their pre-employment screening process; (2) the food service/restaurant and wholesale/retail trade industries appear to be the worst potential offenders; and (3) larger organizations are less likely to ask potentially illegal questions than smaller organizations.

Subjects for the second study, 291 adults identified from the mailing lists of the continuing  and adult education division of a mid-size university in Alabama, were sent a three-page questionnaire asking them to write exactly what they would say if an interviewer asked them questions which, unknown to the respondents, were discriminatory. Sixty-two surveys were returned, for a response rate of 21.3%. Results indicated that although the demographics for the student and non-student populations differed considerably, the primary response strategy was the same--the overwhelming response to potentially discriminatory questions was to give the information requested, even when the subjects were told that the questions were illegal.

Results also revealed a relationship between the  subordinates' congruity of self and dimension of time.

The discussions afforded an opportunity to see the internship from the eyes of the student. The journal entries motivated the individual student to examine her effectiveness with the internship task and her relationships with the people  at the intern site.

        "description":"A systematic vision is offered of what Hawaii education might be, and a plan that suggests how to get there is presented. The plan calls for a substantial financial investment and a commitment to a long-run program to achieve excellence. Quantitative data were collected by a survey of knowledgeable people who were asked to describe strengths and weaknesses of the public school system and to give ideas for improvement. Almost 2,000 officials, educators, and people of Hawaii responded. A broad discussion ensues, in light of these responses, of student performance in the current system and the need for major reforms in light of the challenges of the 21st century. An overview of recommendations is introduced, followed by a more detailed presentation of each reform. It is suggested  to: (1) institute universal early childhood education; (2) reorganize K-12 governance and management; (3) modernize curriculum and instruction; (4) strengthen the teaching and administrative professions; and (5) renew secondary schools. The booklet closes with a summary of a transition plan and overall costs for implementing these recommendations. (SI)",

        "author":["Muth, Rodney"],
        "description":"Despite certain challenges to current practice, little attention has been given to the importance of training educational administrators in research as a process of inquiry. In fact, the inquiry process should be at the core of graduate training for all school administrators. The National Commission on Excellence in Educational Administration specifically recommended that university professors emphasize \"theoretical and clinical knowledge, applied research, and supervised practice,\" but did not specify how such a charge should be addressed. This paper examines some assumptions shaping current university training that may undercut attempts to create truly clinical administrator preparation programs. Among current expectations that impede stronger clinical orientations in  university programs are: (1) lack of rigorous training in research, especially applied research; (2) the traditional academic mode of inquiry prevalent in most doctoral programs; (3) the outcomes of inquiry expected by these programs; (4) the institutional rewards and norms for faculty; and (5) the traditional structures of teaching and learning that influence faculty and therefore students. For student-practitioners, traditional research training programs emphasizing theory-building or empirical explanations are probably inappropriate and intellectually disabling. An alternative model recognizing the legitimacy of the practitioner orientation and geared to an experiential, problem-solving process is necessary. Recommendations are given concerning unresolved research training issues. (47  references) (MLH)",

In &quot;The Problem,&quot; Chester Finn offers a stark appraisal of the state of American education in the wake of 6 years of educational &quot;reform.&quot; The second section, &quot;The Theory,&quot; offers a two-part overview of the implications of recent research findings on the educational choice movement and its rationale. In &quot;What Makes Schools Work?&quot; John Chubb discusses a Brookings Institution study of 500 American public and private high schools, and James Coleman, in &quot;What Makes Religious  School Different?&quot; discusses his research on the effectiveness of Catholic high schools. The third section, &quot;The Solution,&quot; discusses how educational choice has been implemented in Minnesota and New York City.

Five roles/perspectives--those of the college professor, superintendent, central office, principal, and teacher--are used to describe the three interrelated processes of collaboration, teacher change, and school improvement. A teacher collegial group project (TCG) was piloted at Temple Elementary School. The project was so successful that five high schools were invited to join the TCG program. The program continued to expand. Described are the participant perspectives in the following areas: (1) varying collaborative roles of the professor; (2) superintendents as  collaborator/supporter; (3) director of secondary education as collaborator with institute of higher education (IHE), principals, and TCG facilitators; (4) principal as collaborator with the IHE and teachers; and (5) teacher collegial groups from the teacher's perspective.

Issues discussed include the definition of education, its relation to the First and Fourth Amendments, and its role in democracy. Discipline and education are considered as well as the power of educational decision making, curriculum, school leadership, and students' rights. The emphasis in the justices' educational viewpoints has turned in general to an emphasis on control, discipline, order, authority, and the inculcation of traditional values. (60 references) (SI)",

The findings of 52 boards for both policies and practices were categorized into four areas: (1) general and broad statements on employment equity; (2) statements specifically intended to assist women; (3) statements concerning hiring/recruitment/selection issues; and (4) statements aimed at eliminating systemic discrimination. The intention of this research was to provide this wealth of employment equity initiatives as an encouragement to other school boards,  and to focus attention on the two diverse types of employment equity strategies: getting more women into those positions of added responsibility and keeping more women in those same positions.

        "description":"This paper examines the historical supply and demand trends of secondary public school administrators serving students in urban, rural, and mixed school attendance areas in South Carolina from 1978 to 1987. This report projects supply and demand trends for secondary school administrators for the next 15 years from 1988 to 2002. The study is divided into three phases. Phase I findings describe supply and demand findings for administrators, principals, and assistant principals in South Carolina from 1978 to 1987. Phase II findings pertain to the years 1988 to 2002. Phase III findings summarize the qualitative data of secondary principals, secondary assistant principals, and secondary teachers in 1987-88, as well as a summary of projected supply and demand for secondary principals  and assistant principals as derived from a questionnaire. Overall findings indicate that the supply population of educators certified as public secondary school principals is projected to decline. The supply population will continue to be large enough to fill available demands. Recommendations are provided. (SI)",

        "description":"Intended as a synthesis of current literature on school improvement and educational change, this guide attempts to provide central office personnel, principals, teachers, and parents with an overview of five school improvement models, along with practical suggestions for improving instructional programs. The second chapter summarizes relevant literature, focusing on two themes: the actors in the change process and impediments to change. Specifically discussed are district administrators' and principals' roles in the change process, principals' strategies for coping with change, the effect of teacher and administrator career paths on innovation, and \"top-down\" versus \"bottom-up\" change. The third chapter examines five school improvement models (the Structure of School Improvement,  Onward to Excellence, Program Development Evaluation, School-Based Improvement, and the School Improvement Process) and summarizes common program characteristics. The final chapter presents qualifying assumptions (including the need for multilevel cooperation and strategies for managing the slowly evolving change process) and seven recommendations: (1) fostering an attitude favorable to change; (2) broadening participation; (3) identifying and defining problem areas and key school effectiveness research elements; (4) deciding on long-range goals; (5) developing an information and feedback system; (6) anticipating obstacles and ways to overcome them; and (7) promoting a spirit of collaboration among participants.

The dominant professional management models are discussed from a historical perspective; they include the Professional Model (pre-1965) and the Professional/Chief Executive Model (1963 to the present). After analyzing a number of models, this paper concludes by offering for debate a prescriptive model, with 12 key points, which takes the most valuable parts of the managerial and micropolitical models. The prescriptive model also draws upon studies of effective schools, the studies of managers in action, and the more general literature on&quot;excellence.&quot; (48 references) (SI)",

        "description":"The changing economic and social situation, the rapid expansion of technology, and the explosion of available knowledge are fundamentally altering the world economy. Today, our nation's students need not only basic skills, but higher level reasoning and communication and thinking ability, as well. In Connecticut, a committee was formed to determine the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that constitute an &quot;educated person&quot; and that should be required of the state's public secondary school graduates. The result, entitled &quot;Connecticut's Common Core of Learning,&quot; completed in November 1986, identifies and documents the attributes and attitudes, the skills and competencies, and the understandings and applications that are to be expected of the state's public secondary school graduates.  In essence, because the committee shared the document with educators before its completion and carefully considered their responses to the drafts, plans for implementation began before the document was even adopted by the State Board of Education. Included within this document are examples from Killingly, Groton, Bridgeport, and Glastonbury that illustrate the focuses and working methods that are making the core a reality. The appendices contain a copy of the April 1988 Connecticut State Department of Education &quot;Challenge Update&quot; and examples of study questions concerning student learning. (KM)",

It has not done well in creating new jobs; manufacturing jobs declined more and service jobs increased less than nationwide. The state is, however, a national leader in beef, hog, and soybean production. Chicago, in addition to being the financial capital of the Midwest, is one of the three places in the country where law and finance have converged to form a massive new industry related to &quot;the making of money.&quot; Chicago has outstanding facilities for higher education, with 34 private colleges and universities and 25 public ones. The state's per capita income to per pupil expenditure ratio suggests, though, that Illinois is seriously deficient in its support of public education. Within Chicago, there are no  predominantly low-income White schools and no middle-class Black or Hispanic schools; virtually all minority innercity high schools lack basic precollegiate courses. Illinois has succeeded in building a major system of higher education, including both public and private institutions, that is diverse and of high quality. Although funding has been inconsistent in recent years, the system still works well, even though it seems to ignore the unique needs of Chicago. (20 references) (KM)",

        "description":"Much of Indiana is sparsely populated and is concerned with agricultural activity; 70 percent of the state's population lives in its 13 metro areas. Partly because residents have done well without high levels of education, a small proportion of adults possess college degrees. Currently, many new jobs in Indiana are at the low end of services that pay very little compared with the manufacturing jobs they are replacing. If the state is to develop a healthy and diverse economy, it must build a &quot;middle&quot; into its service and work force. Due to declining white birth rates, minorities are increasingly becoming an important part of Indiana's future. A greater diversity of students without corresponding diversity within the school faculties to teach and to serve as appropriate role models  could reduce the retention rate to high school graduation. Indiana's 72 institutions of higher education seem unusually attractive to nonresident students; thus, enrollment has remained fairly constant in numbers of students. Moreover, public higher education funding has been increasing. An increasingly important item for strategic planning in Indiana's institutions of higher education is the flexibility offered by the state's comparatively low tenure rate. (11 references) (KM)",

Still, wages in agriculture and tourism are so low that the state suffers in terms of per capita income. Minority populations, although increasingly important in Florida life, will remain less than half of the state's population for the foreseeable future. Florida does have the best record of providing middle-class opportunities for Blacks and Hispanics in terms of small business starts, suburban residence, and government jobs. Schools will be at the center of the policy and implementation issues surrounding the state's future. Higher  education, business, and communities will all be affected by how well the schools perform.

        "description":"Integrating curriculum is one of the key school improvement activities being undertaken in the process of &quot;restructuring&quot; schools. Reviewed are materials on integrating curriculum that have been entered into the ERIC system in the 1980s, as well as documents from other instate and regional sources. The meaning of &quot;restructuring&quot; is defined, and curriculum revision is determined to be a major component of the restructuring process. A review of materials entered into the ERIC system reveals that curriculum integration is interpreted in three ways: (1) the integration of subareas within a single traditional subject area; (2) the integration of two (or more) related subject areas; and (3) the infusion of new curriculum into existing courses or subject areas. A few ERIC entries in the  1980s describe programs that first identified desired core competencies and then built a major part of the curriculum around them; that is, core curriculum programs. A few documents recently entered in ERIC provide specific advice about how to develop comprehensive, overall integration of curriculum as well as provide annotated lists of integrated curriculum projects and interdisciplinary projects across the nation. Documents and articles in ERIC through June 30, 1989, focus primarily on the regressive influence of current standardized testing on curriculum revision and the deleterious effect of tracking children into special education or other groupings that isolate them from mainstream curriculum and learning opportunities.

The plan proposes major restructuring of virtually all the basic systems within a high school, particularly change in schedule. Instead of students changing locations, subjects, and activities seven to nine times each day, they would concentrate on one or two subjects at a time, each subject taught in an extended &quot;macroclass.&quot; Integral to the Copernican schedule is a seminar program in which students grapple with the complex issues of today's world. Other features include: a mastery learning system tied to a credit system that  substitutes for grades; differentiated diplomas; a conduct and reliable performance graduation requirement; and the &quot;dejuvenilization&quot; of the high school. In addition to a full explanation of the Copernican Plan, chapters discuss the problems that the plan addresses, provide a brief history of the evolution of the American high school, explain why and how the plan works, and offer suggestions for implementation.

It emphasizes the need for a functional evaluation of the person's capabilities and an understanding of individual differences which must be considered in the design of assistive devices. Also described are disincentives to finding a job or hiring a worker with a disability. &quot;The Process of Designing for the Handicapped Worker&quot; outlines steps in the job design process, especially task analysis of jobs and functional analysis of disabilities. &quot;The Rehabilitation Process&quot; describes three types of rehabilitation situations: an acute catastrophic injury, a developmental disability, and an industrial injury. &quot;The Process of  Accommodation&quot; discusses modifications to the job, equipment, and facilities that will help an individual's performance in the areas of lifting and carrying, manual tasks, mobility, seating, hearing, and seeing. &quot;Job Accommodation Resources&quot; provides information on: (1) community-based resources such as ergonomists, vocational rehabilitation agencies, medical practitioners, etc.; and (2) resources for technical redesign and engineering, such as research centers and information systems. The paper concludes with a directory of resources. (JDD)",

The students in the special residential program at Mary Baldwin College in Virginia received personality and family adjustment measures at the beginning of the year. Results were compared to the students' later socioemotional adjustment in four areas: freedom from mental health problems, behavioral compliance with rules, positive peer relations, and self-reported student satisfaction. The study found that about half of the students suffered from depression at some time during the year. Forty-eight percent of the students left the program during the year or decided not to return the following year. Students who adjusted best to acceleration came from  families that valued personal independence and an active-recreational orientation, and tended to have favorable mother-adolescent communication. Students with few behavior problems also tended to have positive self-concepts concerning both scholastic competence and physical appearance. Students with good peer relationships tended to have high social self-confidence and came from families having established rules and structures. Student satisfaction with the program was best predicted by high interpersonal interests, lower social self-confidence, and a family life with established rules and structure. (DB)",

The struggle for \"ownership\" of the child, which begins when the child starts school in the United States, is described. The paper analyzes how the interactions of \"First World\" institutions with \"Third World\" peoples are present in the local setting and form the context out of which the child's identity is shaped. The focus is on the children's participation in forming social alignments in the classroom. Interactional scenes involving three Hispanic deaf children in three different classrooms are  presented, describing: the scene itself; the family and home environment; and issues of agency, power, social structuration, and ideology. The three examples are then discussed in terms of their relevance to issues of class, ethnicity, and other aspects of the family's relationship to the school as a public institution and to society in general.

        "description":"Although parents and citizens in each community should be encouraged to participate in the educational policy-making process, it has been shown that public access to school board meetings is thwarted in many subtle ways. To gain information that would help to balance the interests of privacy and public access in every school district, the State Association of School Boards in each of the 50 states and the board of education in the District of Columbia were asked to reply to a two-page questionnaire about the provisions of their state's open meeting law as it applies to their member organizations--the local boards of education. Each chief state school officer was asked to supply information as to whom citizens should contact for more information or to file a complaint when they  believed the law had been violated by their school boards. Findings indicate that four common elements allow the system of open government to break down: (1) vague requirements for compliance; (2) obtuse language; (3) too many exemptions from open meeting requirements; and (4) complex procedures for citizen participation or redress. The elements of open meetings are discussed as well as the fact that school board members may resist open deliberation. Based on the results of the survey, it is concluded that no state has an open meeting law that can be held up as ideal for protecting public access. A glossary is included, and appendixes making up the bulk of the document provide: (1) summaries of state open meeting laws as they apply to local school boards in 50 states and the District of  Columbia); (2) two charts showing provisions of state open meeting laws and common topics allowed in executive sessions; (3) a list of resources; and (4) a list of state school board associations.

Traditional solutions do not respond to the expanding demand for primary education in these nations. Learning technologies, categorized by a systematic instructional development process and validated instructional design principles, offer cost-effective alternatives. A literature review on the soft technologies of learning indicated that: (1) while textbooks remain the most prevalent type of instructional material in developing nations, modularized materials, programmed learning materials, and workbooks are gaining in popularity; (2)  different types of tutoring enhance the quality of education, but only small-group methods are cost effective; (3) productive soft technology use may require teacher role changes; and (4) conventional school organization structure in developing countries does not facilitate effective use of soft learning technologies. Within the data limitations, this report recommends that soft technologies should be used extensively in conjunction with educational reforms in developing nations, that programmed teaching should be used to compensate for the lack of qualified teachers, and that different tutoring methods should be implemented to augment conventional teaching approaches.

        "description":"The cost of education to a country consists of total public education expenditures, total direct private cost, and total indirect private cost measured in terms of foregone earnings; improperly estimated educational costs focus only on government education expenditures. Considerable progress has been made in conceptual understanding of educational costs in the past 2 decades. Factors that determine the total amount of resources devoted to education and factors that determine expenditures within education influence educational costs. With current tight budgetary constraints and unmet demand for education in developing countries, the need to control costs and to improve efficiency is very pressing. An awareness of the disparities between educational costs in different localities is  necessary for decisionmakers to design proper policies applicable to diverse settings. Applications of cost-benefit and cost-effective analyses address directly the concern regarding inefficiency in education; however, analyses of education in developing countries are often plagued by unreliable and incomplete data. For educational policymaking and planning, data on educational costs, quantities, prices, and norms, as well as socioeconomic data, are required. The obvious cost of managing a database of educational costs is likely to be more than compensated for by the gain of better-informed decisions. (132 references) (KM)",

Classroom management attempts to use the human and material resources already present to improve both the quality and the quantity of learning through time-on-task. The relevance of classroom management, which emphasizes teaching in relation to management and uses instructional materials and teacher-managed time to promote learning, in developing nations is examined within this document. Specifically, the literature reviewed indicates that: (1) for learning to occur, stable teacher and student attendance patterns--established through incentives, recognition, and goal achievement--must exist; (2) it is the  teacher as a classroom manager who has the greatest influence on learning; and (3) the use of classroom time and instructional materials depends on the teacher's ability to organize, pace, monitor, and provide feedback to students. Instructional strategies and the allocation of learning resources present challenging tasks for the educational attainment of developing countries. Classroom management strengthens the teacher's knowledge of his or her role; by becoming more aware of this role and of the interactive aspects of the teaching-learning process, teachers can enhance students' ability to learn.

        "description":"Thailand has dramatically increased access to education in the past 25 years; however, like many other developing nations, the country now faces the pressing need to improve educational quality--especially at the primary level. To improve Thailand's primary school quality, the quality of teaching and school administration must be improved. Some policy initiatives attempting to accomplish this goal were designed to make teachers and principals accountable for student academic achievement; others focused on building teacher and principal knowledge capacities and on stimulating quality instruction and administrative leadership. An examination of nine important initiatives enacted during the 1970s through the mid-1980s revealed three patterns of implementation and success. Strong,  united central government support was an important factor in initiatives that produced behavior changes. Additionally, desired effects were achieved if the initiative content met the needs of those affected and if participatory social relations during implementation subsequently appeared in classroom social relations. The accountability approach, currently prominent in Thai schools, may negatively affect long-term, self-sustaining school improvement. Creating a balance between accountability and capacity-building strategies of educational improvement offers a promising avenue for resolving the difficulties of reform and for future policy implementation.

In light of the new information, the model policy, recommended for consideration or adoption by schools and school districts in Iowa, has accordingly been revised. Delineated within this document are changes in: (1) the admission and enrollment policy; (2) confidentiality of medical status as a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected student; (3) health education and universal precautions; and (4) the appeal and review policy. Because blood and bodily fluids of all persons are considered potentially infectious  for HIV, Hepatitis B Virus, and other bloodborne pathogens, &quot;Universal Blood and Body Fluid Precautions&quot; should be consistently followed.

        "description":"Since 1985, Iowa has required certain health practitioners, social workers, certified school employees, psychologists, licensed day care providers, and other professionals to report suspected cases of child abuse directly to the Department of Human Services (DHS). Since school employees are not persons responsible for a child's care under the child abuse laws, a school employee who abuses a student is not subject to investigation by the DHS. Subsequently, the Iowa State Legislature has required that all schools adopt a uniform procedure for investigating allegations of abuse of students by school employees. The first of two sections within this document provides the model policy on identifying and reporting child abuse, the reporting procedures, and information on reporting. The  appendices to the first section include a list of the DHS's officers, and a suspected child abuse reporting form. Contained within the second section is a model policy for investigating allegations of student abuse by a school employee. Appended is a student abuse report; a level-one investigation report; a list of Chapter 102 complaints for 1989-90 and 1990-91; a list of Iowa licensed investigators; the sexual abuse law and the reasonable force law; information regarding Chapter 102; and a Board of Education Examiner's complaint form.

Section two summarizes key features of some consortium-developed applied curricula intended for secondary vocational education students. In the third section successful practices in improving academic performance of vocational education students have been grouped into five categories: (1) those occurring within a single class; (2) between two classes; (3) across a school; (4) beyond the school; and (5) at the state level. Section four outlines preliminary  findings, by the National Center for Research in Vocational Education, on efforts to integrate academic and vocational education.

The necessary transition from the old, closed autocratic administrative decisionmaking system to a new, open democratic organization requires not a radical leap, but a gradual transition. The South Huntington School District, a suburban school system on Long Island (New York) serving 5,500 students, initiated a Quality Circle program 7 years ago. Employees were given training in problem-solving techniques to allow them limited decisionmaking authority in their work situations under the guidance of management personnel. The noninstructional staff was enthusiastic and quick to participate in the initial training, but the  teachers and administrators--already familiar with committee work and public presentations--tended to want to short-cut the systematic approach. The design of the quality circle program is restrictive; however, the program provides a core of individuals trained in problem solving who are ready to be participants in building-level and systemwide decisionmaking. The South Huntington School District is now poised to undergo a successful school-based management transition. (KM)",

Notions about these sources of principal power are explored from the perspective of the patriot saboteur, by which is meant a combination of a passionate commitment to transcendent values with a critical consciousness that among other things, works continually against unthinking conformity and the maintenance of the status quo. The sources of principal leadership flow from the confluence of cognitive functioning, psychological orientation, and personal identity. Of the three, the elements of cognitive functioning are more teachable and their analysis occupies the bulk of the paper. Familiar  psychological and psychobiological concepts of information processing are discussed in terms of the particular model of the principle put forward in this paper. It is suggested also that possible curriculum programs can be designed to educate principals in the role of patriot saboteur. A figure outlining some cognitive functions in four phases of principals' thought processes: planning, doing, reflecting, and applying is appended. (21 references) (SI)",

Based on effective schools research, the program is no panacea but a realistic attempt to modify student behavior by providing experiences that will build a positive self-concept. The Saturday Alternative does not attempt to circumvent existing discipline policies or to allow students an unreasonable number of chances. The Saturday School curriculum is an integral model component and can be expanded to address drug abuse education, conflict resolution, study habit development, and other concerns. The intervention program has nine components: (1) diagnosis and assessment of student behavior  problems; (2) rigid study environment; (3) reality contact with successful business people; (4) completion of a worksheet; (5) completion of a behavior contract; (6) follow-up counseling; (7) &quot;Operation Success&quot; opportunities; (8) recognition and positive reinforcement; and (9) evaluation and program modification. Inservice education for teachers and for business and community leaders involved in the reality contact phase is essential. Saturday supervisors and counselors must be instructed in desired program procedures and outcomes. Effective parenting classes may also be held regularly. The Saturday Alternative may not be the solution for all school systems; the model does treat the causes of student misbehavior through first creating a data base and then providing students with a  support system to monitor and correct problem behavior.

Since the movement to coeducation is seldom accompanied by the return of a \"converted\" school to single-sex status, the incalculable loss to the traditional gender diversity of school organization is alarming, especially when research findings show strong and sustaining effects for these schools, most notably for women and minorities. While boys' schools resemble the factory model of schooling (structured, functional, economically efficient, and focused on a delivery system of education), girls' schools resemble an ecological model of schooling: one that fosters inclusiveness, interaction, caring, values, and attention to the context  of education not as a delivery system, but as a way of life. Catholic education has distinct approaches toward the education of girls and boys; when these approaches are \"blended\" in a coed school, the distinctiveness is lost. Moreover, achievement advantages found in Catholic schools can be attributed to single-sex Catholic schools, not to Catholic schools generally. Students in single-sex schools display more positive academic interests, attitudes, and behaviors than students in coed schools. (13 references) (KM)",

Schools in this district use choice as the conceptual framework for the organization of public education. Once students and parents have been informed of the choices open to them, each student follows a formal admissions process. Curricular offerings in the junior high schools vary according to the organizing theme of the school, for example, health or biomedical studies. The reading achievement level of students is the most widely used indicator of success or failure. In 1982, the district reading achievement level ranked solidly in the middle of all districts compared to 1974 when it had the lowest level of all  school districts in New York City. English language acquisition and mathematics achievement scores are also used to measure improvement levels. Placement of students in selective and private high schools is also a powerful indicator of a school districts' success. Designed and established by Community School District 4, the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics is a unique high school that stresses math, science, foreign languages, and technology. The East Harlem educational reforms offer clear lessons for larger efforts in American cities. (SI)",

Others are moving beyond effectiveness toward excellence and true equity. The Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory (NWREL) developed a 10-step school-based management approach called Onward to Excellence (OTE) that has contributed to improved student performance in nearly 500 schools. Drawing on educational research into school and teacher effectiveness, instructional leadership, curriculum alignment, program coupling, and educational change, OTE identifies several key concepts critical to successful school improvement within a specific community context. In OTE,  the local school effort is led by a team consisting of the principal, key teachers, a central office representative, and a parent or student representative. The OTE process is learned through a 2-year series of training sessions offering implementation opportunities. After a planning team is formed, they study research evidence, profile student performance, set a schoolwide improvement goal, check current instructional practices, plan for implementation, implement the prescription, monitor the program, evaluate progress, and renew efforts. A detailed discussion of OTE's success at improving performance and reducing dropout and discipline referral rates is provided and is supported by charts, graphs and specific examples. Names and addresses of program contacts are also provided.  (MLH)",

The district was chosen because of its strong leadership, evidence of community support, and ability to implement innovating programs. The Independence elementary program goes beyond the basics; the district was one of the first nationwide to pilot the Parents as Teachers Program, an exemplary model of early childhood education. Other recognized programs include Success in Reading and Writing and the Focus Curriculum (for third-grade students with reading deficiencies) and IMPACT (for gifted students). The junior and senior high programs offer comprehensive curricula and a wide variety of  sports and other extracuricular activities. The senior high program offers college preparatory courses that allow students to earn college credit in American history, English, math, and science. The district also provides special and continuing education services and enrichment opportunities offered by a math/physics institute, a music/art institute, and other programs. An appendix provides city and school statistics and a map of Independence showing school locations. Five full-page color photographs and other illustrations are included. (MLH)",

The first section traces the development of the public employee free speech right in the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, setting forth the basic analytical framework within which these cases are decided. The second section focuses more closely on the variables within the Supreme Court's analytical framework by examining a number of lower court decisions, paying particular attention to the decisions of the North  Carolina Court of Appeals, the North Carolina federal district courts, and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The issues are organized according to policy and planning, staff, curriculum, equity, and funding. The effectiveness of computers in the schools can be realized only when there is adequate planning for their use, adequate training of the teachers and other staff who will use them, and high quality software. Equity issues include individual student access within a school building, access within the school district, the availability of equipment for both high-wealth and low-wealth districts, minority access, and male/female access. Cost is one of  the most important reasons school districts must carefully plan acquisition of educational technology.

Recommendations are made in the areas of local action, action to be undertaken by the commissioner of education, state action, federal action, private-sector action, and coordinated action for employment readiness. The costs of illiteracy affect employers and society, as well as the individuals directly concerned. It is difficult to address the illiteracy issue due to a web of problems with the social system and the educational system. Many local, state, and federal efforts have been aimed toward setting standards at various levels and enforcing them through testing and required  remediation. Successful student literacy programs do exist, and a review of the information available on them suggests several themes: (1) target the early years; (2) health is a prerequisite; (3) parents and parent-teacher relationships are crucial; (4) context, reality, diversity, and activity all help; (5) full literacy requires a full-scale effort; and (6) integrated services are needed to support educational success for all students.

Data sources included the &quot;Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of Public Law 94-142,&quot; the National Center for Education Statistics, the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the National Education Association, and the Office of Special Education Programs.

Data gathered included handicap identification rates; integration rates; per pupil expenditures; per capita personal income; percent of total educational revenue obtained from federal (but not special education) sources; percent of nonfederal educational revenue obtained from state sources; and percent of school-aged children living in rural areas, having minority status, or living in poverty.

The majority of both groups were able to produce recognizable, though primitive, narratives. The groups did not differ in general story characteristics, and both groups exhibited errors in language use. Subjects with autism had a greater tendency to produce bizarre language and adapt an \"externalized\" point of view in which the puppets/actors were seen as objects rather than characters. Down syndrome subjects produced significantly more communicative gesture. Although the groups were about equally able to supply information for follow-up questions, autistic  subjects produced a higher proportion of bizarre responses. These responses were considered to be a manifestation of the pragmatic deficits exhibited by autistic subjects. Results indicate that the story recall ability of autistic subjects resembles that of language-matched mentally retarded persons. However, autistic subjects had more difficulty grasping the story as a representation of meaningful events. Results are discussed in relation to the autistic person's awareness of listener's needs and aspects of the social environment. (Author/JDD)",

        "description":"This project investigated the effectiveness of using closed-captioned television in the teaching of reading to learning-disabled and hearing-impared students. Seven teachers of learning disabled students, and 45 students ranging in age from 8 to 13 years, from a large Maryland public school system participated in this study. The first two of nine studies focused upon the identification of appropriate program materials to be used in the seven subsequent studies. These preliminary investigations dealt with determining the readability of available captioned programs, and determining whether the readability level of the captions corresponded to student success in reading captions. Three studies then investigated the effects of captioned television viewing on the vocabulary and  comprehension skills of both hearing/learning-disabled and hearing-impaired students. Four additional studies were conducted with teachers of learning-disabled and hearing-impaired students to determine their skill in using model captioned television reading lessons and their skill in developing and teaching captioned television reading lessons. Results suggest that the addition of captions to conventional television is an effective means of enhancing the sight vocabulary and comprehension skills of both learning-disabled and hearing-impaired students. Teachers effectively developed their own captioned lessons and were enthusiastic about their use in the teaching of a variety of reading skills. The appendices include sample researcher lessons, sample model lessons, and teacher evaluation  forms. (JDD)",

        "description":"This market research report analyzed the published literature, the size of the deaf/severely hard-of-hearing population, factors that affect demand for closed-captioned television decoders, and the supply of decoders. The analysis found that the number of hearing-impaired people in the United States is between 16 and 21 million; hearing impairment is more prevalent with older and lower income people. The size of the market for decoders is considered to be approximately one million. Sales of decoders, about 208,000 from 1980 through 1988, were affected by the following factors: level of consumer knowledge, reliance on residual hearing and lipreading, cost, and influence of family members. The report concluded that various actions could influence decoder purchase and possibly  expand the market for decoders, such as expanding the knowledge of decoders through a public awareness campaign and having the National Captioning Institute incorporate innovations in decoder technology. Various government agencies are encouraged to undertake additional research on degree of hearing loss and on the use of closed-captioned decoders as instructional tools for the hearing impaired, learning disabled, people with limited English speaking ability, and the adult beginning reader.

Each school is encouraged to develop a unified system resulting from: the collaborative effort of the entire staff; available resources; a choice of teaching strategies; and a continuum of services. Anticipated outcomes include increased acquisition of the core curriculum by a greater number of students, a decrease in grade-level retention and the dropout rate, and increased success rate for transition to  post-secondary education and/or employment. After an introduction and a statement of findings, the report presents 27 questions and answers about a unified system, followed by separate sections which cover: safeguards, funding, governance, core curriculum, personnel development, staffing, implementation, and evaluation.

A conceptual model was adopted with planning-evaluation cycles, evaluation of student outcomes, and relationships between effectiveness indicators and student outcomes. The mission of special education  is defined, and the provision of programs that increasingly lead to improve student outcomes is identified as central. The section on the context of special education notes demographic trends, economic climate, and educational policy issues.

A questionnaire was completed by families of 24 Swedish children with osteogenesis imperfecta, and three families were interviewed. The questionnaire addressed: how and when parents were informed of the diagnosis, daily activities and play, transportation considerations, hydrotherapy, fractures, and technical aids. Interviews carried out with three children and their parents aimed to establish a picture of the daily living conditions of children with osteogenesis imperfecta and the impact of their handicap on the family. The interviews covered daily life, child interests,  home modifications, handicap aids used, and problems unsolved by aids. The report concludes that families of children with osteogenesis imperfecta need more community support than they receive, that major problems exist with handicap aids that have not been modified for these children, and that parents need more information on handicap aids available.

        "description":"The delivery of technology-related assistance was selected as the topic for the Center for Special Education Technology's 1989 annual technology use meeting, in order to emphasize the broad context within which technology use occurs and to focus attention on the continuity of services needed to appropriately apply technology. The meeting sought to provide a forum for state-level review of issues in planning and providing technology-related assistance and strategies developed to respond to the need for information and services. This document provides synopses of two presentations, one on the goals, initiatives, and programs of the Office of Special Education Programs and the other on the state of current practice in educational technology use, given by Bea Birman and Linda  Roberts, respectively. These are followed by summaries of presentations made by participants from 12 states, who described their experience-based service delivery strategies. The participants discussed five dimensions of service delivery: information services, training and technical assistance, assessment and evaluation, funding, and statewide planning. Each of these five dimensions has a section to itself, and each section opens with a list of issues that states must deal with. The final section lists relevant technology resources and five suggested readings. (JDD)",

The information presented is applicable to children who are developmentally delayed, sensory impaired, physically handicapped, severely learning disabled, mentally handicapped, neurologically impaired, orthopedically involved, autistic, neuralmuscular disordered, or environmentally deprived, in addition to infants and toddlers at risk and those with head trauma. Following an introductory chapter, chapters 2 and 3 discuss principles of early  language learning and therapeutic intervention in prelinguistic children and the theoretical constructs of the language group paradigm. Chapter 4 provides examples for implementing the approximately 70 language group experiences presented in the rest of the book. These exercises include simple line drawing illustrations, sensory experiences, participatory activities, symbolic representations, and songs set to well-known tunes to foster familiarity with such language groups as fruits and vegetables, events, and objects, and individual members of these groups such as grapefruit, Halloween, and shoes. For each exercise, the context, content vocabulary, materials needed, activity preparation, and procedure are described. (PB)",

The role of high school counselors includes providing students with detailed information about potential postsecondary institutions and analyzing students' needs in  terms of the availability and quality of support services.

Reviewers' total scores, total word count for strengths and weaknesses, and approval/disapproval decisions were then examined. There were no significant differences in applications' average total scores across the three levels of training, although standard deviations were higher with more training. Also, there was no  reduction in the dispersion of the scores with an increase in training. Reviewers who received additional training tended to write more words in both the strengths and weaknesses sections. Concerning approval or disapproval of the application, there were statistically significant differences across the training conditions, but they could not be determined to be training differences. Reviewers across all training conditions provided more documentation for those applications they disapproved than for those they approved. More experienced reviewers tended to give lower scores and more documentation than less experienced reviewers. (JDD)",

Statistics indicating the high attrition rate among beginning teachers, especially special education teachers are cited and related to lack of training and ongoing support. Teacher induction models are compared showing that all emphasize a high level of interaction among new teachers, their colleagues, and administrators. Examples of successful mentoring programs are cited in the Houston Mathematics and Science Improvement Consortium (which matches high school science/mathematics teachers with practicing scientists and mathematicians) and the teacher induction program at the University of  Wisconsin-Whitewater (in which beginning teachers are matched with a mentor and and a university consultant). Selected state initiatives from Virginia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Florida, and Utah are briefly described. It is concluded that such programs can reasonably be expected to accomplish such goals as increasing the retention rate of promising beginning teachers and screening out the least promising teachers but cannot be expected to overcome major problems in the school context such as misplacements, overloads, or overcrowded classes. Forty-four references are cited. An attached bibliography on entry year induction programs and practices lists about 70 references dated from 1977 through 1988. (DB)",

Papers have the following titles and authors: &quot;Supported Employment Issues Relating to Time-Limited Funding&quot; (Paul Sale); &quot;Beyond Title VI-C: Accessing SSA (Social Security Act) Funding Resources&quot; (Claude Whitehead); &quot;Supported Employment for Individuals with Disabilities Other than Mental Retardation&quot; (Jay Buckley et al).); &quot;Supported Competitive Employment for Persons with Head  Injury: A Post-Employment Treatment Model&quot; (Wendy Wood et al.); &quot;A Descriptive Analysis of Reasons Why Supported Employees Separate from their Jobs&quot; (Thomas Lagomarcino and Frank Rusch); &quot;Job Opportunities Today and Tomorrow: Ensuring Career Choices, Mobility, and Employment Continuity&quot; (Claude Whitehead); &quot;Rehabilitation Facilities and Supported Employment&quot; (Robert McDaniel); and &quot;Challenging Choices for Vocational Rehabilitation Facilities: Response or Resistance to the Integrated Employment Initiatives&quot; (Claude Whitehead). Three general and 31 specific recommendations resulted from the forum. The general recommendations include: (1) promote the continued development and implementation of supported employment services for people with severe disabilities; (2) promote the continued  development and implementation of related placement and training techniques for people with disabilities who require vocational rehabilitation services other than supported employment; and (3) develop support systems necessary to promote a full array of employment and employment related services for people with disabilities through adequate funding, policies, and research methodology.

        "description":"The Hawaiian Language Immersion Program, implemented at the kindergarten/first grade level in an elementary school on Oahu and one on Hawaii, is described and evaluated. The program was instituted at the request of parents of students who had attended a Hawaiian language immersion preschool and was open to all students, regardless of ethnicity or language background. Students received instruction in language arts, mathematics, and other content areas entirely in Hawaiian. Instructional assistance was provided by young professionals from a Hawaiian studies program and by parent and community volunteers. Lack of instructional materials was a significant problem. Evaluation of the program was based on ethnographic classroom observations, interviews with parents and school personnel,  and oral language assessment of the students in Hawaiian and English. Evaluators found that the program had near total immersion, that students appeared to understand and respond appropriately to instruction in Hawaiian, that a range of topics and content areas were being taught, and that there was unusually high parent involvement and support. Almost all students had achieved moderate to high Hawaiian proficiency for their age, others were making significant gains in the language, and all were fluent in English conversational discourse. Twenty-two recommendations are made, including continuation of the program through grade 6 for participating students, and extension to a new cohort of kindergarten and first-grade students. A detailed account of the curriculum and instruction is included  in the report. (Author/MSE)",

Techniques for teacher adaptation of materials and classroom presentation are outlined. The first step is assembly of topic-appropriate pictures and the production of simple third-person statements to accompany them. Leisure is the theme used here for illustration. With the introduction of pictures and statements, the teacher can begin the process of checking input comprehension, using questions for three purposes: comprehension check, recall, and extension. For further use of the same material, the teacher can change to first- and second-person questions and statements, a technique that personalizes and extends the approach. Total physical response  activities can be integrated into this comprehensible input sequence, with students acting out commands. At this point, the teacher can vary the process by moving from the pictures and students to charts, asking yes/no questions, introducing a true/false listening activity, and/or using a multiple-choice listening activity based on the chart's content. The teacher can prepare brief passages about the activities of selected characters for use in a scanning activity. Additional applications for developing all language skills and for student testing and grading are suggested. (MSE)",

        "description":"With the decline of manufacturing, industry faces the layoff of many low-skilled workers and a shortage of skilled workers. To fill the gap, workers will need more skills, often those not taught in schools. Language minority individuals are most affected by these changes. The situation has brought a new political focus on the role of vocational education in the overall educational system. Proponents of vocational education see it as an alternative to the academic-only program; it provides a transition to careers for the non-college bound, and a stepping stone for those seeking higher education. The level of participation of limited-English-proficient (LEP) students in vocational education programs is difficult to determine, but a steady increase is suggested. LEP enrollments are  skewed toward business, trade, and industry. Federal legislation attempts to provide accessibility, quality, and coordination of vocational education for this population. Currently, model programs in the Chicago Public Schools and at Florida's Miami Jackson Senior High School are addressing the specific needs of LEP students. The development of Vocational English-as-a-Second-Language (VESL) courses parallels these efforts. Educators, parents, and policymakers can all contribute to improving educational and employment preparation and services to LEP youth. (MSE)",

The frequency, definitions, and cultural implications of male, female, and double-gender names are outlined: names having religious meaning; those characterizing personal demeanor or disposition; names denoting virtue, war-like characteristics, physical characteristics, or aspects of nature or animals; and miscellaneous names. The information about age or social traditions available in first names is discussed. The relative lack of nicknames or shortened forms is also noted as an indicator of social values. It is proposed that: Spanish first  names are ideally suited for the study of civilization, oral literature, and folklore classes; religious first names reflect the importance of religion in Hispanic communities; double-gender names show the importance of the baptismal ritual and of the loyalty inherent in the parent/godparent relationship; Spanish first names give insight to some behaviors and trends; and names should be discussed in the classroom whenever appropriate.

In the first two years of language study, the amount of material being studied and the focus on language acquisition are such that film can be accommodated as an outside activity carrying credit. A German series of literature on film, designed for television, and literature interpreted for the cinema by film authors offer diversity in the language classroom, are well suited for classroom use, and are readily available. A brief in-class introduction of the author, the period, and the film establishes the literary context before viewing. A discussion of students' written critiques after viewing the film serve to clarify  any questions students might have. Use of English in students' critical commentary is permissible only in the first semester. Students eventually recognize that subtitles are actually a hindrance, and they soon notice the inaccuracies in them. If appropriately used at each level, film will support literature before and when it can be read, while adding its own dimension to and interpretation of the written work. (MSE)",

The students (37 graduate students and 32 visiting scholars), were surveyed for background information (position and workplace in China, time in Canada, and major) and the perceived importance for success in Canada of 15 academic skills and 15 social skills. Results suggest that all academic skills are considered very important, except that some skills (e.g., test writing) were less important for visiting scholars. Visiting scholars gave priority to oral communication and obtaining information. Graduate students appeared to be more concerned with overall command of all academic- and research-oriented English, especially for effective writing. Only slight differences in perception  were found between academic fields. Language training for social skills appeared to be considered as important as academic English training. Ranking of social skills suggests that understanding the culture and customs of Canada are important in Chinese students' adaptation to social life in Canada. The findings support previous research and suggest re-evaluation of some English course content and activities. (MSE)",

        "description":"Teachers continue to address the question of how to adapt instruction to recognize the existence of different learning styles yet provide quality education for all students. Traditionally, instructional models available to teachers and curriculum planners ranged along a continuum from lockstep to individualization. This definition has led to unsuccessful classroom procedures. A redefinition of instructional options views these options as two categories of adaptation: 1) instruction-based adaptation and 2) learner-based adaptation. Individualization, developing in second language instruction in the early 1970s, and Aptitude Treatment Interaction (ATI), a methodological paradigm pioneered in 1977 but with few studies in language teaching, were the forerunners of adaptation. Both  can be classified as forms of instruction-based adaptation, which stresses the importance of making instruction responsive to the learner rather than making the learner responsive to the instruction. In contrast, learner-based adaptation aims at bridging the aptitude-task gap by expanding and enhancing a learner's capacities to make him more flexible in the face of varying task requirements and therefore more autonomous and system-independent. Both types of adaptation, individualization and ATI, are applicable to the language classroom, depending on the learning strategies needed and the tasks required. (MSE)",

Writing was assessed based on two writing samples: one done for another class and one on a specific topic and produced for the study. It was found that students had usually written at least two drafts of at-home assignments because of the time available, but none had chosen to ask for assistance. Dramatic changes were seen in the second study in the quantity of student writing, fluency, vocabulary, and idiomatic expressions. Some unresolved problems of form were found in all papers. The differences in the writing strategies  available to the students were less apparent in this study than in the earlier study. Most instructors expected students to demonstrate in writing that they had understood the material being studied and could use the information gained and actively contemplate it. Overall, instructors responded to what they perceived as the sophistication of thought, grasp of material, and care taken by students with the writing task. Some teachers felt the ESL students in their classes were as good or better writers than native English-speaking students, despite the second language problem. (MSE)",

Ten years of data were collected for each retirement system, and these data were broken down into fixed income and equity components so that similar categories of investments could be compared. Results revealed that the North Dakota pension fund was not achieving an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return, and it was concluded that the relatively small size and conservative nature of the North Dakota pension fund limited its investment opportunities. Specific  recommendations for performance improvement include: NDPERS should consider a switch to a defined contribution system; the state should investigate the 401K tax-deferred savings plan authorized by the Internal Revenue Act of 1978; the state should consider using a computer modeling technique to adjust the equity-fixed income asset allocation; and fund managers should contact the state's Congressional delegation to express concern over the issue of taxation of pension funds.

The study attempted to answer the following questions: (1) to what extent do instructional consultants use collaborative practice by establishing bilateral control of consultations? (2) to what extent do collaborative acts (checking, specificity, and rationale) affect the responses of clients? (3) what other variables are related to degree of collaboration found in instructional consultation? and (4) what patterns or episodes of behavior are  particularly collaborative or highly controlling? Evaluation of Interactions of ten pairs of subjects (each pair consisting of an instructional consultant and a university faculty member) found that true collaborative consultation was rare; that consultant behavior was usually controlling, non-confrontable, and non-explicit; that when consultants used collaborative techniques, client responses were active, suggesting ownership; that instrumentation affected degree of collaboration with observation or paper and pencil instruments usually producing more collaboration than video; and that typical episodes could be identified as either agenda setting, questioning, or lack of questioning.

Since the average age of the students was 36, special emphasis was placed on structuring the class to increase relevance to the students' working lives and to ways adults learn best. A brief literature review examined theories of adult learning and motivation and of experiential learning and teaching evaluation. This review resulted in identification of six principles of effective practice which guided course design. Central to the course's activities was a real-life evaluation study of a local insurance company's training programs. Implementation required negotiations with the company and university personnel, group design  of the evaluation study, document analysis, development of employee and customer surveys as well as interview questions for individuals and focus groups, and preparation of a final report. Finally, the course was evaluated against the six principles identified as facilitating adult learning: (1) voluntary participation in learning; (2) mutual respect; (3) collaborative spirit; (4) action and reflection; (5) critical reflection; and (6) self-direction. All students recommended using the real-life evaluation project again. An appendix presents the evaluation design matrix. 18 references. (DB)",

Structured interviews were then conducted with 15 faculty members with a wide range of experience in working with grants. Although faculty members viewed grants activity as being important, many did not routinely pursue external funding due to the following impediments: (1) lack of time, (2) lack of information about funding sources, (3) lack of procedural information, (4) and lack of a clearly defined system of rewards for those who  obtain external funding. A general lack of clarity as to the place of grantsmanship in the overall scheme of the college's expectations for faculty was a commonly expressed concern. Faculty also expressed the need for technical assistance and assistance in the physical preparation of proposals.

Findings indicated that the change in the USAE segment of the Business Affairs Office had reached completion at the time of the study. This state of completion may have been due, in part, to the fact that many of the relationships the Director of USAE had with its components probably existed, informally, before the reorganization took place. 26 references.

        "description":"The study examined expressed reasons for choosing the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) by undergraduate students majoring in social work there. Responses of 205 social work majors to a questionnaire found that these students chose UNI primarily because of location, size, cost, the presence of a social work program, to get a good education, to be with their friends, and to continue a family tradition. Other findings indicated that 44% of students had attended other colleges previously, that many students considered other majors before deciding on social work, that 84% of the students had been born in Iowa, that 50% planned to go to graduate school, that the mean age of social work majors was 24.3 (though 74% were between 18 and 23 years old), and that 89% of the students were  female. The study concludes that the social work program at UNI does not unnecessarily duplicate other Regents' programs because students deliberately choose both UNI and the social work program there. Findings are detailed in six appendixes. (DB)",

        "description":"The study examined the likely response of nonresident enrollments to a lowering of nonresident tuition rates in South Dakota public institutions of higher education; the cost of educating additional nonresident students; and other economic benefits to the state of increased enrollment of nonresident students at state universities. Nonresident enrollment trends (1972-1985) are summarized textually and graphically for: the University of South Dakota, Black Hills State College, Dakota State College, Northern State College, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, and South Dakota State University. The demand model is then applied in terms of the price-enrollment relationship, the econometric demand model, price elasticity of demand, and marginal revenue. Finally, the  least-squares-dummy-variable method of estimating the coefficients of the model is applied to the pooled sample for students from Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, and all other states and foreign countries. The data were also examined in terms of the cost model, an econometric estimation of the cost function, demand and cost together, and community effects of increased enrollment. It is concluded that a reduction in nonresident tuition rate would significantly increase enrollment but that increased costs would be greater than increased revenues. Inexpensive strategies for increasing nonresident enrollment are outlined. Data is displayed in 8 tables and 46 figures; 9 references are provided. (DB)",

The first section addresses concerns expressed in response to a previous Proposal. Departmental improvements are cited in the areas of: (1) scholarly stature of the EAHED faculty; (2) the lack of a strong cognate area in the proposed Ph.D. program; and (3) lack of differences in a dissertation requirements between the Ph.D. and Ed.D. degrees. The need for a Ph.D. option is justified in  terms of regional and national trends, student interest, doctoral program enrollment, current doctoral programs in Oklahoma, and employment prospects.

Recommendations are given for four stages in the research process: (1) For the planning stage, faculty should concentrate their efforts within the established body of research and remain current with the latest research in their area of specialization. (2) For the research stage, faculty should consider opportunities to replicate, criticize, review, discuss, and present papers before peer groups. The need to work around constraints such as time, education, resources, and financial support is noted as is  the value of working with a co-author. (3) At the writing stage, faculty should write with a specific outlet in mind, making inquiries to editors, and obtaining colleagues' evaluations before submitting their manuscripts for publication. (4) At the submission and review stage, researchers need to deal positively with editors and with reviewer suggestions and consider alternative outlets. Faculty are encouraged to develop and implement a larger program of research. 20 references. (DB)",

The diverse elements of today's student body include differing age, gender, ethnic and racial backgrounds, and increasing numbers of differently able and part-time students. The issues facing higher education fundamentally relate to the capacity of institutions to function in a pluralistic environment. After an executive summary and introduction, six sections cover the following topics: (1) the status of diversity (enrollment, retention, and the campus environment); (2) the role of student characteristics; (3) the challenge of involvement (theories of involvement, cultural pluralism, intergroup  relations, and demography); (4) institutional responses to diversity (approaches of successful institutions and implications); (5) organizing for diversity (diversification of faculty and staff, mission and values, dealing with conflict, the quality of interaction on campus, educating for diversity, the perceived conflict between access and quality, and the changing climate); and (6) assessment and implications (institutional assessment, research, coordination among sectors, national issues, costs and commitment, and leadership).

Syllabi are designed to communicate course information and instructor views of the courses to the student. The syllabus is a very effective tool for improving communication between the instructor and the student, and it serves as an agreement about the purpose and  direction of the course. After some suggestions on using the syllabus guide, the guide then provides suggestions for the following 10 syllabus sections: instructor and course; course purpose, goals, and objectives; educational beliefs; content outline; assignments and course calendar; textbooks; supplementary readings; methods of instruction; student feedback and grading procedures; and learning facilities and resources for students.

Among the conclusions is the following: a clearer articulation of the field's &quot;domain&quot; is needed. This articulation needs to consider interdisciplinary and multi-methodological aspects of the discipline. Thought should be given to replacing several of the courses with others more reflective of  the central ideas of the discipline (specifically, are oral interpretation and voice and diction more central to the curriculum than communication theory, listening, and multi-cultural diversity?)

Data helped to: (1) determine trends in program development in speech communication in smaller institutions; (2) assist faculty and administrators in program development; and (3) assist the Committee with member services. A three-part survey gathered data on: member name, address, and institutional affiliation; department and program; and department staffing. Findings based on a 45% response rate confirmed the original picture of considerable diversity among small colleges, yet  patterns emerged. Most of the institutions were private four-year colleges of 500 to 2,000 students which considered themselves small colleges. The smaller ones were more likely than the larger ones to include a speech course as a requirement for graduation. Four full-time faculty members was the typical departmental staff size. Most faculty were full-time and tenured or tenure track. About two-thirds were male, and the gender factor seemed consistent with national data suggesting a disproportionately smaller number of females in the upper faculty ranks. Findings can be helpful in program planning and for the Committee as it seeks to assist its membership in program and professional development.

One hundred forty members of the Speech Communication Association Committee on Small College Speech programs received a copy of the survey. Survey results indicated the following: many faculty at small colleges perceived an increased need to conduct and publish research in order to have their scholarship acknowledged for tenure, promotion, and merit; the role of promotion and tenure  committees, usually composed primarily of other faculty members, should be explored; and faculty members and deans need to better understand the role of research and publication at their respective institutions, because these factors can increase retention and professional advancement for faculty.

        "description":"The Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) program provides financial assistance to low-income undergraduate students attending postsecondary education institutions and is authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The program is administered on the campus of each participating postsecondary education institution which uses SEOG funds to award grants to eligible students. The educational institutions fund a portion of SEOG awards with their own resources, and use a standardized needs test, called the Congressional Methodology (CM), to determine student eligibility and amount of award. During the academic year 1989-1990, approximately 632,000 students received SEOGs. The average award was approximately $700 with awards ranging from $100 to $4,000. Since Fiscal  Year 1980, Federal appropriations for the SEOG program have increased by 25.7% in current dollars but decreased by approximately 18% when adjusted for inflation. The average award in constant dollar value, and the number of students receiving awards, have also decreased. During the 101st Congress, legislation involving the SEOG program has focused on the effects of the CM. An appendix provides a summary of the legislative history of the grant program. (DB)",

        "description":"This report discusses eligibility for a new Federal income tax exclusion created by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 for U.S. savings bonds used to pay qualified higher education expenses. The exclusion enables eligible taxpayers to leave out of their gross income the interest earned on series EE savings bonds that are used for tuition and required fees, net of scholarships, for themselves or their spouses or dependents. Taxpayers must be at least 24 years of age and the full exclusion is limited to taxpayers with modified adjusted gross incomes below $60,000 for married couples and $40,000 for single taxpayers or heads of households. As the exclusion will be available only for series EE bonds issued after 1989, it is not likely to be widely used during the  next several years. Analysis of eligibility of current students, however, assuming that the exclusion had been previously available, suggests that more than half of all current students (more than 6 million graduate and undergraduate students) and their families would be eligible to use the full exclusion. The most significant restrictions are the purchaser's age limitation and the qualified expenses limitation, which would affect families of students who receive scholarships at public colleges and universities.

        "description":"The study examined the teaching concerns of university teaching assistants (TAs) and attempted to identify changes in the ways in which TAs think about teaching as they become more experienced. The study surveyed 145 first-time TA appointees at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and 79 more experienced TAs from a wide variety of the university's departments. After a few background questions, the survey then presented F.R. Fuller's open-ended question from the Teaching concerns Statement (Fuller &amp; Case, 1972; Fuller, Parsons &amp; Watkins, 1974) encouraging expression of concerns about teaching. Nine categories of concerns were identified and grouped into three categories: (1) survival stage/adequacy concerns (e.g., what is expected of me?); (2) mastery stage/student  learning concerns (e.g., How do I deal with student attitudes?); and (3) impact stage/improvement concerns (e.g., How can I foster critical thinking and learning for its own sake?). The study found stage one concerns to be dominant, not only for the first-time TAs, but also for the experienced TA group whose adequacy concerns were focused more on the system and the teaching situation. Only for TAs with 10 or more quarters of TA experience did stage two concerns begin to outnumber stage one concerns; for all TAs there was a notable lack of stage three concerns. Results suggest the need for further development and training of experienced TAs. (DB)",

The first essay discusses the role of the academic profession in the university, stressing the professoriate is the most important single element in the university. Topics considered are autonomy, accountability and the professoriate; the professoriate under stress; historical perspectives; the sociology of the professoriate; promotion and remuneration; national case studies; and the professoriate as an international community. The second essay offers some general perspectives on student politics including the historical context, the  impossibility of a \"permanent revolution\" in the university, responses to activism, who the activists are, the impact of activism, and differences in student activism in the industrial nations and the Third World. The final essay looks at the sources and nature of reform in the university in a discussion of difficulties of reform, the need for reform, the impetus for reform, the process of reform, trends in the 1960s, the 1970s and beyond, and future directions.

The first section reviews trends in higher education enrollment from 1970 through 1987. The second section presents data on higher education enrollment for the fall of 1987 by: control and level of institution; level of education; attendance status; and sex and age of student. Enrollment trends identified between 1970 and 1987 are as follows: most of the dramatic increase (about 45%) in higher education enrollment occurred between 1970 and 1983; part-time enrollment increased about 70% from 1970 to 1987; and the enrollment of women increased 93% since 1970. Highlights of the 1987 data include the  following: higher education enrollment increased 2.1% from 1986; most students in institutions of higher education were enrolled in public institutions; there was no increase in number of students enrolled in private institutions; over half of all students in higher education were 24 years of age or younger, though 27% of all students were 30 years old or older; and most younger students were enrolled full time and most older students were enrolled part time.

Emphasis is placed on the responsibility of the building level media specialist to exercise leadership in establishing the partnerships and initiating the planning process. The central unifying concept of the guidelines is the provision of both physical and intellectual access to information, increasingly through networks extending well beyond the school. The  guidelines are presented in eight chapters: (1) The Mission and the Challenges; (2) The School Library Media Program; (3) The School Library Media Specialist: Roles and Responsibilities; (4) Leadership, Planning, and Management; (5) Personnel; (6) Resources and Equipment; (7) Facilities; and (8) District, Regional, and State Leadership. Seven appendixes provide: a report on a survey of school library media centers; budget formulas for materials and equipment; library media facility guidelines; policies and statements on access to information; a list of selected research studies; and lists of individuals who have contributed to the development of the guidelines, either financially or as professional consultants.

Viewing the library media specialist as an initiator of curricular activities rather than a purveyor of support services, these guidelines emphasize leadership, partnership, planning, curricular needs, collection development, and equity of access to information. This discussion guide has been developed to help educators at all levels to plan meetings and conduct effective discussion sessions with persons who have become familiar with \"Information Power\" in its entirety, in order to evaluate local school library media programs in light of the  recent revisions. The first of three sections identifies the principal concepts presented in \"Information Power\" and provides an overview of each of its eight chapters. Procedures by which discussion sections may be effectively organized to promote the successful exchange of knowledge and views are recommended in the second section. The final section identifies specific constituencies for discussion groups and suggests discussion questions for each of the groups--i.e., library media specialists, administrators and boards of education, classroom teachers, college and university faculty, state department of education personnel, and members of the community at large--as well as questions for mixed constituency groups and questions basic to all discussion sessions.

Chapter 1 provides background on project goals, learning in the VC, educational technology and effectiveness, software, a theoretical framework, and outcomes to be measured. A discussion of methodology, covering target courses and subjects, experimental design, evaluation, measurement, and data analysis is presented in Chapter 2. The next chapter deals with implementation problems related to student recruiting, equipment, software, resistance to collaborative learning,  electronic pranks, and experimental controls. Chapter 4 describes student perceptions of the VC based on pre- and post-course questionnaires. Differences in course outcomes as affected by mode of delivery (completely online, mixed, or face-to-face) are discussed in Chapter 5, while Chapter 6 looks at the effects of student attitudes, attributes, behavior, and access conditions on outcomes. Findings are summarized in the final chapter. Appendixes include: (1) the baseline questionnaire for students, with frequency distributions; (2) the post-course questionnaire for students, with frequency distributions; (3) the questionnaire for students who dropped the course, with frequency distributions; (4) the guide for interviews with students; and (5) interview transcripts.

Although the main objective was to examine the teacher education implications of microcomputer use, it was necessary to put this in context, and a survey of patterns of microcomputer use in OECD member countries was conducted in preparation for the seminar. The results of this survey are discussed in the first of three major sections of the report and lectures, video presentations, and software displays were used during the first 2 days of the meeting to show how microcomputer applications are being used in classroom  settings. The second section provides an overview of group discussions on the changes in curriculum, learning processes, and classroom management associated with microcomputer use in the various member countries. The final section considers the areas of agreement that emerged concerning the teacher education implications of microcomputer use. The report also includes lists of papers and materials distributed or demonstrated during the seminar and a directory of seminar participants. (28 references) (GL)",

        "description":"The notion of generic design, while it has been around for 25 years, is not often articulated, especially within Newell and Simon's (1972) Information Processing Theory framework. Design is merely lumped in with other forms of problem solving activity. Intuitively it is felt that there should be a level of description of the phenomenon which refines this broad classification by further distinguishing between design and non-design problem solving. However, Information Processing Theory does not facilitate such problem classification. This paper makes a preliminary attempt to differentiate design problem solving from non-design problem solving by identifying major invariants in the design problem space. Descriptive protocol studies are used to explore the problem spaces of three  prototypical design tasks from the disciplines of architecture, mechanical engineering, and instructional design. Eight significant invariants are identified. The paper concludes by drawing some morals for the development of computer-aided design (CAD) systems, noting the limitations in the work, and indicating directions for further research. Diagrams include the structure of a prototypical design task environment, the design problem space, the conceptual structure of the transformation of goals to artifact specifications, and symbol systems used in architectural design.

Analyses of the 173 responses received indicated that the teachers had very positive attitudes toward the computers, the labs, and the software. Teachers were extremely positive about the decision to set up computer labs with the ESC mathematics and reading software, and a large number felt that each of their students was &quot;on task&quot; throughout the lab period. Most considered the ESC software to be compatible with current mathematics and reading  curriculum content and methods. In general, teachers wanted more laboratory time to use the software with their classes. Most teachers stated that they would be willing to work with other staff members and consultants to become more effective in using software for instruction. A copy of the questionnaire with a tally of the responses and comments offered by 53 of the respondents are appended. (6 references) (GL)",

Four approaches were used: (1) a longtitudinal approach to study student growth and development; (2) observations of students' behavior while writing with the computer to study their thinking processes; (3) daily interviews with students to explore the nature of their thinking while writing; and (4) lengthy generalized interviews to determine students' use of the computer in the home and school environment. ACOT students in the ninth and tenth grades were found to be both confident and positive about their computer experiences. Students found the computerized learning to be more challenging, with Hypercard,  computer-based robotics, and computer graphics affording a more dynamic learning experience. The graphic feature available with the Macintosh appeared to be a vital feature of the students' writing and the nature of engaged thinking strategies. Students also demonstrated an expanding repertoire of planning and revision behavior, and several students commented that using computer-generated text allowed them to make more revisions and check for coherence. Finally, ACOT students who had returned to regular classroom environments had maintained the computer-based skills they had acquired, although they were disappointed at the lack of computer opportunities in the regular classroom environment. The text is supplemented by two diagrams and numerous charts. (EW)",

Reviewers used a meta analysis procedure to calculate effect size as they focused on the impact of microcomputer use in specific areas and with specific kinds of students. Thirty-eight published and unpublished studies and 44 dissertations were reviewed. While computer-based instruction was shown to be potentially effective in most educational applications, computer-using educators are advised to keep the following in mind: (1) since significant results have been found at all grade levels, current data cannot  be used either to increase or decrease use of computer applications at any particular grade level; (2) computer uses in all content areas except English as a Second Language (ESL) seem productive, and science may be an especially promising area; (3) using computer applications seems to significantly improve students' attitudes toward school and subject matter, but insufficient data exist to indicate that better attitudes have any impact on achievement or on dropout rate; and (4) while most types of skills profit from computer applications, word processing and use of Logo to enhance creativity and problem-solving skills are especially promising.

The term has been used broadly in the literature and includes three major aspects: (1) interactive video as storage; (2) interactive video as hardware; and (3) interactive video as learning concept. This digest describes each of these concepts in detail. The first section discusses the information storage and retrieval capacities of both Constant Angular Velocity (CAV) and Constant Linear Velocity (CLV) videodisks. A scheme for classifying interactive video hardware by &quot;levels of intelligence&quot; (based on a three-level scheme developed by the Nebraska Design/Production Group) is outlined in the second section. Emphasizing learner interaction with  visuals, the third section focuses on the advantages of interactive video over other computer-based systems for instructional purposes. (10 references) (GL)",

        "description":"Three decades of applications of information technology and library automation at Ohio University are chronicled in this paper. The first major development highlighted is the founding of OCLC (the Ohio College Library Center) as a cooperative cataloging device in the 1960s. OCLC's growth is traced from when it was a small organization of two staff members with a $67,000 budget and serving 54 libraries in 1967, to a complex independent organization employing 885 people with a budget of $95.7 million and a growing membership of 9,400 libraries in 1988. Featured accomplishments of the 1970s include OCLC's successful online interlibrary loan system, which has received an estimated 20 million requests from its 1979 inception to 1988. A major development at Ohio University during the  1980s is the ALICE system, an online locally integrated library system which interfaces with OCLC (now the OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc.) for online shared cataloging and interlibrary loans. ALICE offers an online public access catalog, acquisitions, circulation, and serials control. Based on the Virginia Tech Library System (VTLS) software, ALICE uses microwave and telephone lines to serve libraries at five regional campuses in a network mode. Other advancements include: (1) the growth of online database searching; (2) expanding nonprint collections that include new formats; and (3) growing use of CD-ROM based information. A new development foreseen for the 1990s is a statewide information system to facilitate library resource sharing. Five diagrams accompany the text. (13  references) (SD)",

The significance of acquiring and disseminating professional information to faculty and administrators in higher education is discussed, and it is noted that the journals in which a faculty member publishes are sometimes used as critical factors in promotion and tenure decisions. Following a review of the literature about hierarchies in higher education publishing, a model is presented which offers five constructs that affect journal quality: (1) perception, which gauges the opinions of selected peers about a journal's quality; (2) citations, which measure the number of times a work is cited in subsequent research in the area; (3) usage (publishing), a measure that  shows the number of times fellow educators publish in that journal; (4) usage (readership), identifying how often the source is referred to by peers; and (5) factual information, which can be obtained from reference publications about journals. A mathematical model encompassing flexibility for faculty and academic departments with diverse needs is also introduced to help evaluate journals using the proposed constructs. The combination of the constructs and method are based on the fact that the strength of one can compensate for the limitations of the other. A figure illustrates the concept. (14 references) (SD)",

The question of online searching and professional status is raised primarily in response to Brian Nielsen's work in 1980 and 1982, and also motivated by the relatively low volume of work on this topic since Nielsen. A major aim of this study was to evaluate whether Nielsen's predictions about online searching deprofessionalizing librarianship were beginning to be realized. The study consisted of 8 interviews, lasting from 45 minutes to 3 hours, with librarians who do and supervise online searching in a variety of disciplines and settings. Thirty-three questions were asked under conditions of privacy to establish the basic background facts of each respondent's  situation, and to elicit their perceptions of the effect of online searching on: (1) their image; (2) their role as teacher or as intermediary; (3) their interaction with patrons and end users; (4) their careers; and (5) their own personal attitudes toward online searching and its impact on their professional status. It was concluded that, although automation has made many tasks more routine, its effects have been an enhancement. In most situations where searches were being negotiated, librarians felt that they gave patrons more individualized attention. Furthermore, librarians generally felt that the addition of a computer had a professionalizing effect on librarianship. Copies of the interview questions and privacy statement are appended.

Libraries are the places where books and other records of human memory and imagination are transmitted from one group of people to another, and librarians are the impresarios of the process. Personal experience and long study of Russian culture have shown that the answer to an important question is often more likely to be found in yesterday's book than in today's newspaper; deifying some books while denying access to others can be dangerous; and libraries can provide a quiet refuge for scholarly integrity. The American experience and example may be increasingly relevant to the world because: (1) the evolutionary American model may have more to offer than  the absolutist models; (2) their various religious beliefs enable Americans to identify with a dimension of human experience that is incomprehensible in an atheistic society; (3) the maintenance of a civil, civic unity among diverse communities is an American aspiration that is becoming increasingly relevant as the world grows more diverse culturally, even as it becomes more interrelated technologically; and (4) Americans are strongly committed to higher education at a time when education and intellectual leadership in world politics are becoming increasingly important. The American type of democracy has depended on knowledge and grown through books, which are the individual's portable, affordable link with the memory, mind, and imagination of the rest of humanity, and the best guides we  have for the exploration of our own basic humanity. Because the American example is so relevant, and because deepened and broadened knowledge has been so central to it, the necessity of getting more of our young people into creative contact with books and reading is an urgent concern for all American libraries.

The first, a background paper by Robert L. Oakley, identifies some of the problems that modern information technology has created for the intellectual property system in the United States; reviews several alternative proposals for dealing with the problems; briefly examines the ways in which Canada and the United States have approached the same issues; and concludes that these problems are solvable through amendment, new &quot;sui generis&quot; approaches, and expanded roles for an administrative agency, or through the development of voluntary or compulsory licensing mechanisms. In the second paper, Shirley Echelman comments on  issues raised by Robert Oakley's report, and summarizes presentations given at a previous program session. The third paper, by Robert J. Kost, interprets an Office of Technology Assessment report about intellectual property rights and explains why the marriage between the law and technology is currently &quot;on the rocks.&quot; The second half of the proceedings is a report on the business session of the NAC. Appendixes include the meeting agenda; a list of working groups; criteria for membership in the NAC; a list of suggested and prioritized topics for future research on networking; and a statement from the American Library Association on the phone companies' open network architecture plans filed with the Federal Communications Commission and a request for input on these plans from libraries.

        "description":"In 1988 the Special Libraries Association (SLA) Networking Committee conducted a survey of association members to identify important networking issues and concerns. The survey results, presented in this report, were intended to assist the SLA Board of Directors in determining future directions for the association to take with respect to networking. The questionnaire, which was designed to be self-administered, was mailed to SLA chapter presidents and &quot;Bulletin&quot; editors. Respondents were asked to list problems they had had with networking, what they would like SLA to do to improve networking opportunities, and related questions. A total of 113 questionnaires were received and entered into a VAX/VMS minicomputer for analysis. The analysis was designed to divide respondents from  corporate, nonprofit, and government-related libraries from respondents in academic or public libraries. Results indicate that the vast majority of SLA members belong to at least one network. Special librarians belong to an average of 2.2 networks; respondents from academic libraries belong to an average of 3.2. Most frequently cited benefits of networking were related to interlibrary loan and cataloging. Although most respondents did not indicate problems associated with networking, those who did most often mentioned high costs as a concern. The committee recommends that SLA provide its members with more information and education on networking benefits and opportunities, and support network-related research. Eleven tables are attached and the survey instrument and verbatim responses to  the question &quot;Is there anything else about networking you would like us to know?&quot; are appended. (SD)",

Tables and graphs cover the transfer status (i.e., native, community college transfer, four-year college transfer, or out-of-state transfer) of baccalaureate recipients, of graduates who were Maryland residents, of graduates who re-enrolled in college, and of graduates who reported that they planned to earn an advanced degree. In addition, transfer and native students are compared in terms of percentage of females, mean annual salary, graduating institution, percentage seeking employment, percentage who owed no money on loans, debt of those who borrowed money to attend college, and racial composition. Highlighted findings include the  following: (1) during the 1980's, approximately 50% of the graduates of Maryland four-year public colleges had transferred from another campus, and 23% to 28% of the graduates had transferred from a Maryland community college; (2) transfers were slightly more likely to be male, white, and Maryland residents at the time of graduation; (3) transfers tended to be older than native students; (4) native students were more likely to have re-enrolled in college after graduation, and had slightly higher post-graduate degree aspirations; (5) one year after graduation, transfers had higher median annual salaries than native students; and (6) at graduation, transfers owed less on college loans than native students.

One of the first activities of the Center for At Risk Students was a survey of 2,300 institutions and schools regarding programs for at-risk students. Responses from 220 institutions with at-risk programs revealed that: (1) 52% of the programs were offered by community colleges, 65% were in urban locations, and 66% had commuter populations; (2) rural  institutions received only 64% of the funding per pupil for at-risk programs that urban and suburban institutions received, and public institutions received only 38% of the funding of private institutions; and (3) respondents expressed needs for additional funding, staffing, faculty training, and teaching materials. The section of the newsletter on IHS traces the growth of the school from 56 students in 1985 to 417 students in 1988-89; offers a profile of IHS students and faculty; and explains admissions requirements. In addition, program outcomes are noted including 90% average daily attendance rates, 3.9% dropout rates compared to a citywide average of 30%, a 90% graduation rate, and a 100% college acceptance rate. The final section of the newsletter describes \"Exploring Transfer.\" The  aim of the program is to forge new connections between public and private educational institutions, between two- and four-year colleges, among faculties in different disciplines, and between previous experiences and future possibilities. Thus far, the program has achieved its primary objective of increasing transfer rates, with at least 70% of the first cohort transferring. (JMC)",

College instructors should direct students to such concise, recognized discourses on improving writing style as Strunk and White's \"The Elements of Style.\" In these manuals, specific, effective suggestions may be found, such as \"be concise,\"\"use active verbs,\"\"choose words carefully,\" and \"omit unnecessary words.\" These guidelines will significantly improve, with minimum effort, the writing style of anyone who is not already a skilled writer. The easiest and most effective means of improving writing style is to avoid whenever possible the use of a few undesirable words which are employed too often in daily written and spoken  language. These words are \"it,\"\"they,\"\"thing(s),\"\"you/your,\"\"get/got/getting,\"\"fix/fixed/fixing,\"\"do/did/done/doing,\"\"that,\"\"put,\"\"why,\"\"out,\"\"up,\"\"down,\" and \"off.\" The almost effortless technique of revising sentences to eliminate these few words begins the process of developing the elusive phenomenon known as a distinctive style.

Introductory material explains that the new campus has potential for contributing to the revival of the downtown community; creating equal access and opportunity for people who may not otherwise aspire to higher education; and integrating a unique campus design into the overall redevelopment of the downtown area. Homestead has a 60% non-Hispanic White, 20.6% African-American, and 19% Hispanic population; 35.96% of the city's residents aged 25 years or older graduated from high school; and the  1980 average median household income was $14,797. An integral part of the campus's service area, the Homestead Air Force Base, has an approximate population of 4,000 military personnel, 10,000 dependents, and 1,100 civilian personnel. Community leadership and joint planning between the college and community are necessary to help the campus serve as a center for educational, cultural, and social events. In addition, programs must be related to individual and community needs; the campus must attract students from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, ages, and income groups, and faculty must be screened for their commitment and ability to reflect the community's ethnic diversity and talents. The college plans to offer programs and services in the following areas: (1) academic support; (2)  precollegiate skills development; (3) general education development; (4) professional development; (5) technical development; (6) administrative; and (7) learning resources.

        "description":"This study was conducted to investigate the relative importance of social and academic factors in influencing the probability of transfer from a community college to a four-year college. The structural model used in the study was composed of the following constructs: the effect of social class, race, and gender on students' academically related behaviors in high school; the combined effect of student background and high school behaviors on high school outcomes; the effects of background, high school behaviors, and high school outcomes on community college behaviors; and the effect of background, high school behaviors, high school outcomes, and community college academic behaviors on the probability of transfer from a two-year to a four-year college. Nationally representative data  from the \"High School and Beyond\" study were used to track a random sample of 2,500 students who attended community college within two years of high school graduation in 1980. Within four years after finishing high school, 24.3% of the community college students had transferred to a four-year college. The students' academic performance in college was the strongest direct predictor of eventual transfer. Family social class and high school factors (e.g., placement in the academic track, application to college while in high school, high grade point average, and high standardized test scores) exerted important indirect effects on the probability of transfer. Race and gender effects on transfer were found to be weaker than in earlier studies. While broader access to two-year institutions may  appear to increase educational opportunities for socially and academically disadvantaged students, the fact that it is the more advanced students with better academic preparation in high school who actually transfer to four-year colleges suggests that the community college experience may actually perpetuate rather than ameliorate social stratification in higher education.

        "description":"Using two nationally representative and longitudinal data sets, a study was conducted to examine trends in transfer from community colleges to four-year colleges. These data sets followed the high school classes of 1972 and 1980 into postsecondary education. A comparison of the educational outcomes of the two cohorts of students revealed the following: (1) the likelihood of transferring to a four-year college without a credential declined, especially for students entering public technical institutes and private vocational schools; (2) the proportion of students completing academic associate degrees declined, and the likelihood of transferring among those with such credentials also declined (from 68.7% in the Class of 1972 to 48.9% in the Class of 1980). (3) the proportion of  students earning vocational associate degrees increased, but the likelihood of those with such credentials transferring decreased from 31.7% to 23.2%; (4) those with vocational associate degrees were less than half as likely to transfer as those with academic associate degrees; (5) rates of completing certificates increased in technical institutes and remained stable in community colleges, but certificate completers were much less likely than degree completers to transfer; and (6) transfer rates were higher for males, white students, high socioeconomic status students, and those who were in the academic track rather than the general or vocational tracks during high school. Many different factors explain the decline of transfer rates, including the changing demographic backgrounds of  students, declining achievement during high school, a collapse of career counseling in the high school, an increase in the numbers of \"experimenters\" in community colleges, the shift from academic to vocational programs within community colleges, the apparent weakening of academic associate degree programs as routes to transfer, and declining federal aid.

        "description":"In 1988, a survey was conducted to determine the characteristics and extent of peer tutoring programs at two- and four-year colleges in New York. Data were also collected on supplemental instruction, a variant of peer tutoring in which the peer tutor works closely with a faculty member to help students in identified high-risk courses. Of the 270 surveys mailed, 32% were returned. The 59 responding institutions included 28 two-year colleges, 30 four-year colleges, and a technical institute. Survey findings included the following: (1) 95% of the institutions had at least one peer tutoring program; (2) 80% offered peer tutoring for remedial/developmental, entry-level, and advanced courses; (3) 32% selected tutors through faculty recommendations; (4) 96% paid their tutors, and 4%  used other means to reward tutors; (5) 41% had centralized tutoring labs to supervise their tutoring programs; (6) institutions most commonly provided supplemental instruction in math, biology, business, chemistry, and English; (7) 96% provided peer tutors with training, with 29% using administrative personnel to train tutors; (8) 74% provided either one-to-one or small group tutoring; (9) 38% required &quot;at risk&quot; students to receive tutoring; and (10) 85% of the institutions indicated that tutoring was available to all who requested it. A 16-item bibliography and the survey questionnaire are appended. (WJT)",

The accreditation standards are divided into eight areas. Standard one discusses institutional integrity: purposes; planning; and effectiveness. Standard two discusses educational programs: general requirements; articulation; curriculum planning and evaluation; and credit and non-credit courses. Specific topics under standard three are student services and co-curricular learning environments, which are discussed in terms of general provisions, counseling services, admissions and records, coordination and administration, and the comprehensiveness of services.  Provisions for faculty and staff in the areas of selection, qualifications, evaluation, staff development, and other personnel policies are the focus of standard four. Standard five discusses various aspects of learning resources, including collection development, accessibility, faculty and staff, and general provisions. Standard six concerns physical resources, such as facilities, equipment, facilities planning, and financial resources. The final standard covers aspects of governance and administration, including the governing board, administrative services, faculty, support staff, and students. Supporting documentation is listed for each standard. (JMC)",

        "description":"Assembly Bill (AB) 1725 provides for the hiring of faculty who do not meet the precise letter of the minimum qualifications, provided that the governing board of an institution determines that an applicant possesses qualifications that are at least equivalent. In order to make these determinations, each district must have and use an equivalency process. Criteria for determining equivalent qualifications include having the appropriate courses for a relevant degree but lacking a diploma, having a degree in another area, or having a degree with a different title. The more difficult case arises when experience or independent learning is proposed as the equivalent of academic work. The problem in this case is obtaining evidence to establish that a candidate really does have enough  background to be judged as knowledgeable as someone with a degree. The candidate should be expected to provide the evidence, and the evidence must be as reliable and objective as a transcript. Faculty in the discipline will have to carry most of the responsibility of determining equivalency. In order to get relevant information to the discipline committee, applications should contain an opportunity for candidates to indicate whether they possess the minimum qualifications or, if not, why they think they possess equivalent qualifications. Regarding the difficulties of hiring part-time faculty, the funds provided under AB 1725 can provide for an increased number of classes taught by full-time faculty rather than part-time faculty. Where part-time faculty will be needed, a good hiring  process should be used to prescreen a pool of candidates who can be hired when needed. In addition, each district can determine acceptable hiring procedures when time does not permit a full search for qualified applicants, and at what point it is best to cancel a class and reschedule in order to permit a fair and careful hiring. A proposed model of these equivalency procedures is attached. (JCM)",

        "description":"Adult influences on infant peer interaction were examined to determine whether infants would be more likely to sustain interaction with one another when their mothers were encouraging them to do so than they would when their mothers were busy with something else. A total of 36 infants, 14 months of age, were videotaped during 30-minute play sessions consisting of two previously unacquainted infants and their mothers. Observations were made under two conditions: when the mother was encouraging infant interaction and when she was busy filling out a questionnaire. Infants remained in proximity to their peer partners, interacted more frequently, spent more time interacting, and had longer interactions with one another when the adults were busy, than was the case in the condition of  encouragement. Thus, on the whole, infants were better able to sustain interactions when adults ignored them than when they attempted to assist them. Most adult attempts to elicit peer interaction failed. Infants may be more &quot;expert&quot; than adults in interacting with other individuals who do not yet use language or other culturally appropriate means of interacting. Adults, however, may facilitate or inhibit infant peer interaction, depending on the strategy they use. It is concluded that assisting in toy placement and manipulation may be more helpful than giving advice or verbal instruction. (Author/RH)",

Interrater agreement between adolescents and their primary caregtivers with regard to childhood behavior problems was .48. Correlations between childhood behavior problems and adolescent temperament indicated significant associations. Childhood hyperactivity correlated with adolescent general activity level. Childhood peer dysfunction correlated with adolescent mood quality and flexibility.  Adolescent temperament was found to correlate significantly with all of the adolescent problem behavior correlates. In general, a difficult temperament profile was associated with both childhood and adolescent behavior problems. This finding suggests a degree of continuity in temperamental behaviors associated with maladjustment during childhood and adolescence. (RH)",

Data indicate that very large numbers of mothers with young chidren are employed in the state and that their children need care. The number of preschool-age children has increased. Employment levels among women in all social groups have increased, but employment opportunities for women and men vary dramatically from county to county. The availability of licensed child care also varies from  county to county. Availability appears more closely related to per capita income than to need as measured by female employment. Low wage rates often make it necessary for both husband and wife to work to support a family. Many families, even those with two wage-earners, cannot afford high quality child care. Affordability and quality of child care are especially problematic for female-headed households, because women, on the average, earn less than men. Recommendations for social policy are offered.

Male preschool children in the alcoholic homes were the target group, because they are 6 to 10 times more at risk for adult alcoholism than are the control children. As hypothesized, both parents in the high risk families reported more history of antisocial behavior than did control parents. Differences in family climate revealed that the alcoholic families were less likely to pursue moral and religious activities than the other families. Both parents in the alcoholic families described their transactions in more hostile terms than did controls.  Both husbands and wives in alcoholic families agreed that their relationship centered on hostility rather than around control. More generally, the data indicate that a group of 4-year-old children who are disproportionately at risk for alcoholism in adulthood are already exposed early in life to parents who are more antisocial in childhood and adulthood, are more hostile toward each other, and who have created a family environment that is more likely to foster the continuation of such behavior than to moderate it.

Subjects for the study were 91 families with sons between 3 and 6 years of age who were at risk due to the father's alcoholism. Multiple measures were used. Results indicated that for both fathers and mothers, physical aggression toward children was related to their life troubles, which included long-term alcohol involvement, antisocial behavior, and depression. Level of parental alcohol involvement was not related to physical aggression, either to the child or from the child to the parent. Children's  aggression toward their parents was related to the parents' life troubles and certain aspects of the perceived environment. The child's age contributed significantly to the prediction of aggression by and to the mother, but played no role in predicting father-child behavior. Parental aggression and long-term alcohol-related difficulty appeared to be heavily implicated in the predictive equation. While the model used was moderately successful in a predictive sense, other child-related factors need to be specified for a more complete picture. Twenty-eight references and five tables are included. (RH)",

The data were derived from a large-scale, longitudinal study of causes of alcohol abuse and the development of patterns of family violence. Subjects in the part of the study discussed in this paper were 75 working class couples with a male preschool-age child at risk for alcohol problems in adulthood due to the father's alcoholism. The violence of husband to wife and the violence of wife to husband, during the year before the assessment, were analyzed. Severity and cumulative intensity of violence scores were recorded. A severity score was the highest level of physical violence perpetrated during the  past year. Cumulative intensity was a summation score based on the level of violence intensity times the frequency of the violence, summed for all levels of violence items. As expected, positive, zero order correlations were found between antisocial behavior, long-term alcohol involvement, family conflict, and husbands' reports of violent behavior toward their wives. A history of alcohol-related troubles was associated with a negative family environment and increased violence in the home. Findings suggest that different dynamics contribute to severity of violence and cumulative intensity of violence. (RH)",

The study focused on intact nuclear families with a son who was 3 years old at the time of initial data collection and a father who was diagnosed as definitely or probably alcoholic. Alcoholic families were recruited from the population of males convicted for driving while impaired or driving under the influence of alochol. Both parents independently completed the Antisocial Behavior Checklist and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist. Data indicated a strong relationship between fathers' antisocial behavior and their perceptions of behavior problems in their sons. Maternal aggression was not related to mothers' perceptions of behavioral  problems in their children. But maternal antisocial behavior was significantly related to mothers' perceptions of level of depression in their sons. It is concluded that even though the data provide no basis for inferring causal relationships, they clearly demonstrate that parents in families with alcohol problems perceive real or imagined behavior problems in male offspring even at the age of 3 years that have been linked to the etiology of alcoholism.

Parents completed the Beck Depression Inventory, the Progress Evaluation Scales on self-esteem, and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist. Children were given the Block & Block delay of gratification task. Results are best viewed heuristically due to the small sample size. Findings indicated no significant relationships between fathers' and mothers' problem drinking or self-esteem. Parents' ratings of children's immaturity and aggression were significantly related. Mothers' depression and low-esteem were related  to perceived problems in their child and their children's ability to delay gratification. Fathers' lifetime problem drinking was related to children's aggression, immaturity, and social withdrawal. The data suggest that a model stressing an indirect developmental pathway, whereby the father's depression affects the mother's depression, self-esteem, and, consequently, her child rearing practices, is worthy of further testing.

Alcoholic families were recruited from the population of males who had been convicted for driving while impaired or driving under the influence of alcohol, who lived in an intact family, and who had a biological son between 3 and 6 years of age. Of particular interest was the interrelationship among parental cognitive and neuropsychological functioning, perceived problems with the child, and the child's ability to delay gratification. Measures included two subsets of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, and the Block & Block delay of gratification task. Results revealed a clear and consistent relationship  between level of parental cognitive functioning and children's problem behaviors and ability to delay gratification. Fathers higher in cognitive functioning experienced fewer problems with children. Cognitive functioning of both parents was positively related to children's ability to delay gratification. It was suggested that fathers higher in cognitive functioning may have a more realistic expectation of their son's behavior or have sons who are less problematic, whereas mothers' perceptions are dependent on influences other than cognitive functioning. Parental cognitive functioning may affect the child's ability to delay gratification. (Author/RH)",

Child rearing practices were measured with the Block Child Rearing Practices Report. Psychopathology was measured with the Quantity-Frequency-Variability Index, the Lifetime Alcohol Problems Score, the Antisocial Behavior Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Data indicated that families of higher social prestige and parent intelligence were associated with reports of parents being more affectively positive toward the child, more child-centered, more encouraging of autonomy, and more in agreement about parenting.  Parents' self-reported depression was negatively associated with positive affective parenting and interparent agreement on child rearing. Fathers' history of depression was positively related to child-centered parenting. Mothers' involvement in antisocial behavior was associated with negative affective parenting and encouragement of competitive achievement. Results provide evidence that the spectrum of life circumstances of these parents is associated with a lack of opportunity and achievement, lower intelligence, and increased levels of depressed mood.

Early childhood education had its largest growth during the depression years, when the federal government created and financed nursery schools. The emergency nursery schools came at a time when nursery education had been well-established and there was a strong interest in the education of the child before kindergarten. The emergency program represented the first federal recognition that the education and care of young children was a responsibility  warranting the appropriation of public funds. Nursery schools were identified as an educational program, were located in public school buildings, and were controlled by the local public school system. Through the emergency program, nursery schools became widely recognized and demonstrated their value. It was hoped that the program could be incorporated into the public school system for the benefit of all children. The experience gained from the program provided a basis for further increase of nursery schools in World War II. (RH)",

Implications for Head Start are highlighted for these and other  early intervention efforts. The paper presents models that might account for salient outcomes and discusses demographic and societal trends which affect Head Start research and evaluation design.

Six middle-grade teachers in a suburban, midwestern school district were observed during spring, 1988. Information on misbehavior in teachers' rooms was coded according to four categories: activity type; form of misbehavior; teacher response to misbehavior; and student response to teacher's desists (a desist is defined as a specific teacher action directed at stopping a student misbehavior). Three classrooms were rated as effectively managed and three as ineffectively managed. Effective classroom managers were those who permitted the fewest misbehaviors and were most successful in stopping misbehavior once it occurred.  Teachers who changed activitites in the class or varied the type of lesson from day to day were able to prevent more misbehavior than those who did not. The most effective desists used by teachers were nonverbal cues (low level desists) and rule reminders (high level desists). A general discussion of the classroom management research is presented, along with an examination of studies that deal with desist strategies of teachers. Implications for definition of a teacher's classroom management effectiveness are discussed. Thirty-nine references are cited, and the coding instrument is appended. (RH)",

The paper also covers reasons for changes in entrance age and in funding and indicates the relevance of these changes for current issues in early childhood education. Sections address: (1) the colonial period: 1642-1776; (2) post-revolutionary common schooling from 1777-1840; (3) infant schools with public funding, and their decline by 1842; and (4) current public funding issues. It is asserted that public opinion about the education of young children has demonstrated a continuity since the early colonial days of America, its roots being in the Calvinistic beliefs of the Puritans. During the past 3.5 centuries, other philosophies  and systems have fertilized and been entwined with those roots, but basic elements remain. Preschools remain primarily funded by parents of the children enrolled. Public schools are provided for through tax revenues. Entrance age dropped from 7 to 4 or 5 years. Since play is still suspect as a way of learning, expenditure of tax funds for child care centers or other programs is considered justified only for pre-academic compensatory education for children of families considered to be so deficient that their children will grow up to be a burden on society.

A Norwegian perspective on Project No. 8 was offered by Mrs. Laila Brunvand, the rector of Vardasen Primary School, Kristiansand. The rector summarized the main features of the project's contact school plan and described the role of the Vardasen school in the project. Participants discussed issues in groups  organized around the topics of the process of starting school--length of school days, science education, differentiated teaching, and leadership in schools. A second address, by Chief Director Oddvar Vormeland, of the Royal Ministry of Church and Education, concerned a rational framework for the development of primary education. Concluding material includes reports on group discussions and the final plenary session, in which speakers gave their views on priorities for the future. (RH)",

Four questions are addressed: (1) Why is child care a work option for the older worker? (2) What is the target population of older persons interested in preparing for this field of work? (3) How can adult learner characteristics be integrated into a training program that prepares older persons for employment in child care? (4) What are the outcomes of a training program that prepares older persons for employment in child care? The training program discussed is a training model designed for low-income older persons that provides 90 hours of course work followed by subsidized 3-month, on-the-job training and subsequent placement as an unsubsidized child care aide. Outcomes of the  training program were favorable. During the 10 weeks of training in each of six program cycles, there was 95 percent attendance. Of the 78 persons enrolled, 73 completed the training, received their certification, and attended graduation. Of the 73, a total of 47 continued to work in the child care field. (RH)",

        "description":"In any consideration of the ways in which intergenerational child care meets the needs of parents and children, attention should be given to the needs of the older persons who are involved in significant numbers in the child care work force. Individuals over the age of 65 account for 25 percent of U.S. family day care providers, 13 percent of other child care workers, and 7 percent of preschool teachers. Given these numbers, the following questions are appropriate: (1) Why is child care an appropriate field of work for older persons? (2) What criteria need to be met if child care is to be an appropriate field for the older worker? (3) What are the options for older persons in child care? (4) What are the anticipated outcomes for older workers in child care? Discussion provides  responses to these questions and a description of an intergenerational child care demonstration model designed to empower older workers to participate in the development and management of a self-functioning, solvent child care program. The model involves 15 children and a staff of five adults, all of whom are over 55 years of age. In 1987, of 108 older adults completing their first year of participation in an intergenerational child care program, 67.6 percent reported improvement in their feelings of being valued, 63.9 percent reported improvement in their feelings of happiness, and 54.6 percent reported an improvement in satisfaction with life.

An instrument based on National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) guidelines (1987) for developmentally appropriate practices (DAP) was developed and distributed. Items were designed to assess beliefs concerning curriculum goals; teaching strategies; guidance of socioemotional development; language and literacy development; cognitive, physical, and aesthetic development; motivation; parent-teacher relations; assessment of children; program entry; and staffing. Participants were 401 elementary and special education administrators, and prekindergarten, kindergarten, primary, intermediate, and special education teachers from a large  Northeastern state. The sample included subjects from 104 school districts with rural, suburban, and large metropolitan populations. Findings revealed that special educators, prekindergarten teachers, and elementary and special education administrators had significantly better knowledge of DAP than kindergarten, primary, and intermediate grade teachers. It is concluded that the findings are especially problematic, since kindergarten through sixth grade teachers, who had the least knowledge of DAP, make up the primary pool from which teachers are most likely to be selected for public school preschool programs.

It was expected that those who continued as providers or went on to do other things in family day care would: (1) belong to professional organizations; (2) have had training in family day care; or (3) be in family day care support groups. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to 200 providers attending the Fifth Western Region Family Day Care Conference. A random sample of the 200 providers were asked to nominate a former provider. Of the 182 questionnaires returned, 138 were from current providers and 44 from former providers. After a brief introduction in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 describes family day care. Chapter 3 reports the data gathering  process. Chapters 4 and 5 describe those who answered the survey and those who did not. Chapter 6 indicates pre- and post-service characteristics of providers, and Chapter 7 describes the programs they operated. Chapter 8 delineates outside influences on providers. Chapter 9 describes support groups and other resources. Chapter 10 provides a summary and Chapter 11 offers personal notes on the survey. Findings tended to confirm the hypotheses.

Participants were 200 students from a school district in east central Michigan. A questionnaire was developed and administered to obtain information concerning transescents' physical, educational, social, and emotional needs. Findings revealed that females were more academically inclined than males. Both sexes seemed to enjoy physical education, with females' interest and participation declining considerably from fifth to eighth grade. Eating habits continuously changed, but the shift was more noticeable for females than males. A  class in history and social studies was the least liked. Friendliness and understanding were qualities of favorite teachers. Having many good friends was considered important. Working in groups was favored. Parental influence declined while peer influence increased. The future was viewed positively. Teachers' role in non-academic areas diminished. Few subjects indicated that they sought advice or assistance from an adult significant other. Recommendations for educating transescents are offered. (RH)",

A series of weighted, two-way analyses of variance were performed on positive and negative initiations among the Americans and Hmong-Americans. Results revealed significant main effects for culture on positive and negative initiations to Americans, and significant main effects for culture on positive initiations to Hmong-Americans, males, and females. Significant main effects for sex were found for positive initiations made to Hmong-Americans, Americans, and males. Evidence demonstrating that young children's  peer interactions are often segregated on the basis of culture and sex was found. Overall, frequency of initiations was greater within culture and sex than across culture and sex. The failure to find significant effects of culture or sex on negative initiations suggests that the lack of cross-cultural peer interactions is not motivated by hostile intentions. The lack of cross-cultural interactions is discussed in terms of peer familiarity and communication skills. (Author/RH)",

Studies cited are those that meet relatively high standards of research quality. The term &quot;at-risk&quot; refers to children who are considered liable to develop behavioral problems and experience school failure because of their low socioeconomic or minority status or the limited education of their parents. The four questions addressed in the report concern trends in preschool enrollment, common characteristics of exemplary preschool programs for at-risk children, effects of such programs, and evidence on the durability of those effects and the reasons why they may fade. Elements common to exemplary preschool programs include curriculum and teaching practices based on  principles of children's learning; sustained parental involvement; and periodic monitoring and evaluation. The research shows that preschool education programs for at-risk children have effects in six major areas: cognitive abilities; classroom learning behaviors; socioemotional development; family; long-term school success; and school and societal costs. Evidence on program effects indicates that, for seven possible reasons, cognitive gains of participating children diminish between preschool and the end of grade five, and under some circumstances disappear entirely.

Subjects were 271 undergraduate, early childhood teacher education majors. Demographic data supplemented measures of subjects' general attitudes toward parental involvement, perceptions of the impact of different types of parents, and attitudes toward five forms of parental involvement outlined by J. L. Epstein (1987): (1) basic obligations of parents, such as the building of positive home environments; (2) basic obligations of schools, such as communication with parents; (3) parent involvement at school, i.e., volunteer work in classrooms; (4)  parent involvement in learning activities at home; and (5) parent involvement in governance and advocacy. Analyses indicated that although subjects held positive attitudes towards the five forms of parental involvement, they perceived themselves to be unprepared for implementing parental involvement strategies. Subjects with student teaching field experiences held significantly more positive attitudes than those without field experiences. Results are discussed in terms of implications for teacher education programs. (Author/RH)",

Chapter 6 suggests ways to respond to student misbehavior and lack of engagement in lessons. In this second edition, Chapter 6 has been revised and expanded to include additional suggestions and examples. A section on drug abuse among students is included. The suggestions for teachers are an outgrowth of classroom experiences and the findings of numerous  studies related to behavior management, student engagement, and time on task. Suggestions are concisely stated and printed in bold type. Techniques for helping students develop cooperative behavior patterns and suppress those that are uncooperative are based on principles of positive and negative reinforcement, punishment, modeling, satiation, shaping, schedules of reinforcement, generalization, and discrimination. Numerous vignettes of good and bad instruction are included in the text. A total of 46 citations have been added to the 84 references of the first edition, and the two lists are provided separately.

        "description":"This paper describes an observational methodology designed to permit increased understanding of the day-to-day social world of school children. The methodology was developed in the course of investigations of the extent to which children classified as rejected on sociometric measures actually experience overt rejection at school. Discussions of the consequences of rejection and of observational research on rejected children precede a description of an intensive observation that combined audiotaping and videotaping. The wireless transmission system used for audiotaping recorded rejected and average status children's conversations in all student settings is described. During lunch, recess, and physical education, children's behavior was videotaped by a camcorder. In children's  classrooms, and in their art, music, and library classes, audiotapes were supplemented with coding of behavior. Students wore a microphone attached by cable to a belt pack transmitter. The observer carried the receiving equipment in a backpack. In the classroom settings, the observer also carried a tape recorder. Illustrative conversations bearing on rejection experiences conclude the discussion. A list of equipment costs is appended. (RH)",

        "description":"In a study of links between group acceptance and friendship among children in elementary school, 278 third- through sixth-graders, nearly evenly divided by sex, were assessed with measures of level of peer acceptance, primary and secondary friendship, friendship quality, loneliness, and social dissatisfaction. Findings suggested that the distinction between group acceptance and friendship is meaningful. Although fewer children with low degrees of acceptance have friends in comparison to other children, marginal group status does not preclude the possibility of a reciprocal friendship. Having a friend and the quality of the friendship appear to make contributions to the prediction of loneliness over and above the sizable contribution of level of acceptance. Problematic group  acceptance is indicative of problems in dyadic friendship adjustment. The quality of children's friendships drops off as level of acceptance decreases. While it is clear that friendship and acceptance domains are linked, the reason why they are linked and what difference the linkage makes remain unknown. It is concluded that reaching an understanding of linkages between group acceptance and children's friendship success is an important research task with implications for intervention with children at risk due to poor peer relations.

In 1984, Arkansas sponsored its first 5 summer AEGIS programs, involving 275 students. In 1988, programs served 1,300 students. Day-programs offered outdoor biology and ecology courses, drama classes, and mathematical modeling studies. Residential programs offered experiential learning in art, science, languages, outdoor studies, theater, and environmental education. Arkansas' 1986 Sesquicentennial celebration sparked an AEGIS history program that used an interdisciplinary approach and integrated art, literature, humanities, drama, and music into historical studies. Forty high  school students selected for the program were divided into four groups, each of which focused on a particular period of Arkansas history. Students listened to lectures, heard poetry, took field trips, wrote creative fiction, and worked collectively to produce a play incorporating what they had learned during the program. The students used brainstorming sessions, improvisational exercises, and videotape to create the final production. Within 2 weeks, the talented and gifted students had written and produced a play, which was presented on the final night of the summer program. (TES)",

The program came into being in a hasty and expedient manner that satisfied the superintendent's desire for the notoriety accompanying school improvement while avoiding resource allocation for curriculum reform. The original admission standard was a standardized test score of 85th percentile or above for total basic skills. In the first months of practice, however, the principals supervising program implementation chose to admit students on the basis of subtest, rather than composite scores. Then, the superintendent bowed to pressure from the board and agreed to admit any student whose parents  requested it. As the teachers found that their \"gifted students\" could not handle the challenges of accelerated materials, they responded by presenting regular college preparatory materials but with more assignments. This response frustrated the brightest students and angered their parents. During program evaluation, teacher workshops, surveys, and interviews revealed that five program aspects were troublesome: (1) organization and coordination; (2) course requirements; (3) student selection procedures; (4) curriculum; and (5) standards for student retention. Values conflicts centering around student identification standards and the nature of program content paralyzed the staff's ability to take any action with respect to the program and led to program deterioration and teachers, parents  and students disaffection.

This paper discusses the issues surrounding interagency transition procedures and introduces a guide for helping agency personnel define problems with the transition process. It also discusses strategies rural providers can use to plan efficient interagency transition procedures and components of assessment tools that facilitate transition. Service providers should begin by being aware of other programs, other services, and their eligibility requirements. Transition pre-planning should be well-documented and specific to the student's needs. Agencies can address their community's interagency transition process by evaluating  transition procedures that are currently in place. Once they have identified problems, they can begin to examine solutions. Student assessment is one of the most important factors to be discussed. A number of models might be considered for conducting multi-disciplinary assessments. Once an interactive process for conducting assessments has been chosen, the next step is to select assessment tools to meet agencies' needs. Cooperative or team members should consider the purpose of the assessment, the quality of test materials, and applicability of the instrument to the targeted population. Providers who work together to comprehensively assess the children and families they serve can also eliminate transition redundancy. (TES)",

Therapists need to have an understanding of rural school systems, educational aims, philosophy, and the structure of the system itself in order to integrate their services effectively. Students (N=58) at the University of Kansas Medical Center participated in the pilot MORE project. Pre- and post-tests were used to identify students' attitudes and expectations of children's classroom and social behavior, and the changes which occurred as the students acquired more information. One of the measures used was the S.B.S. Inventory of Teacher Social Behavior Standards and  Expectations developed by Walker and Rankin (1980). Respondents rated appropriate classroom behaviors as critical, desirable, or unimportant to classroom function. Items were grouped into four content areas: cooperation with teacher and peers, independent work skills, communication skills, and attention ability. In all groupings, students decreased their &quot;unimportant&quot; ratings and increased &quot;critical&quot; ratings. The results suggest that occupational therapy students need to become aware that &quot;ideal&quot; classroom behaviors are not always &quot;critical,&quot; and that educational personnel have the responsibility to teach children even if all adaptive behaviors are not intact.

However, reforms may cause hardships for rural schools because of the historically lower status of rural schools. The recommendations made by the Holmes Group for improving the quality of teaching and teacher education may cause problems in the small and rural schools. First, the recruitment of teachers for rural schools is difficult because the main source of rural education personnel, rural youth, is poorly educated; second, most of the research institutions eligible for teacher education are located in urban areas; third, rural schools need generalists with several  minors, rather than specialists as suggested by the Holmes Group report. Rural school teachers are found in survey research to be less favorably inclined toward extended programs, more liberal arts coursework, field experience, and professional coursework, and less likely to agree that the standards in teacher education are too easy. Direct threat to rural schools by reforms in teacher education includes: reducing the numbers of teacher in the pipeline; driving up salaries due to career ladders and teacher shortages; increasing recruitment difficulties due to urban oriented professional institutions. Reform must recognize the unique living conditions and needs of rural communities. (GGH)",

Teacher shortages are reported in 37 states, and the problem is particularly acute for rural schools. To solve the problem, strategies for recruiting potential teachers are proposed in four categories: national strategies, a sample plan for a rural state, strategies for a university interested in recruiting and training teachers for work in rural area, and strategies at the local level. The real solution is not reallocation of able students, but the development of strategies to increase the potential pool of students who complete college, and to recruit from alternative pools not currently oriented to the education  profession. Efforts to change student attitudes should begin at an early age. Other efforts that should be made to attract qualified people into the education profession are briefly suggested.

Vision provides a sense of direction for the school and facilitates accomplishment. Administrators must move from authoritarian and managerial modes of operation to proactive leadership, and maintain a focus on the vision through turmoil and change. In developing a personal vision, one needs to ask questions about one's strengths and weaknesses as a leader and write the answers in a vision statement. In much the same manner, one can develop this into an organizational vision, and then identify knowledge of the organization and involve others to facilitate the implementation of the vision. The final component of vision is future vision which often uses metaphorical  statements, symbols, or personal models. Administrators should allocate funding, materials, and time to sustain the vision, and apply various administrative strategies to pursue the vision. The changes in rural education demands visionary leadership. This paper contains 20 references. (GGH)",

        "description":"Cooperative group learning involves organizing students in small heterogeneous groups to work on academic assignments. This paper reports a staff development project to implement cooperative group learning for 417 general education middle school and junior high school students, including 41 special education students. To impart cooperative learning skills, a cooperative approach to staff development was used, including teacher support teams, teacher decision-making, and peer coaching. Teachers were involved in project-related decisions on format, class content, and training session schedules. By the end of the year, students in cooperative classes experienced greater decreases in alienation or feelings of estrangement from school, peers, and classroom activities than students in  control classes. They also experienced greater feelings of positive interdependence with their classmates than students in control or contrast classes. Special education students in cooperative classes were rated more favorably over the year by their regular class peers; non-handicapped students in cooperative classes also rated one another more positively than students in contrast classes. Teachers were using cooperative learning procedures from 25% to 50% of the time in their classes by the end of the year. They evaluated the project favorably. (DHP)",

        "description":"Rural school districts have problems providing specialized training to staff in remote areas, and rural teachers often need specialized knowledge because of the lack of programs for rural students with low incidence handicaps. Emerging videodisc technology may lessen some of these difficulties. Utah State University has developed a videodisc-assisted training program for preservice teachers entitled \"Effective Instruction: Techniques for Classroom Interaction.\" This group instruction program contains four units: (1) a five-step sequence that teaches trainees to monitor student responses, reinforce accurate performance, and correct errors; (2) how to use modeling, simplify complex responses, and use physical prompts and leading questions to help students arrive at correct answers  on their own; (3) how to minimize problem behavior and encourage student attention to work; and (4) effective strategies for teaching overly dependent, careless, or mildly disruptive students. All units use the same lesson structure: home study of reading materials followed by in-class videodisc-based discrimination training, roleplay simulations, and supervised practicum. Level 1 (instructor controlled) videodisc programs have particular promise for inservice education in rural and remote areas because they are easy to disseminate, require only a videodisc player and monitor, and can be taught effectively by a wide range of instructors. However, it is important to emphasize that videodiscs elicit primarily verbal responses and must be integrated with applied training methods such as  roleplay and supervised practicum. (SV)",

Special education high school graduates encounter many difficulties in assuming community living and work roles. EES materials are consistent with the competencies and subcompetencies of the occupational domain of the LCCE Curriculum and address on-the-job interpersonal skills, vocational coping skills, vocational decision-making and job-seeking skills. The universities of Missouri-Columbia and Arkansas have been observing school districts using the LCCE/EES materials with learning-disabled students. The project involves six sites in Missouri, California, Minnesota, and Arkansas. Project elements to be evaluated during the 4-year  demonstration project include assessment and implementation strategies, an inservice training program, a cross-agency training program, and a service delivery monitoring system. The two major components of the program are assessment and instruction. Students' LCCE competency attainment is assessed using a curriculum-based instrument measuring career education knowledge and performance. The LCCE instruction component is composed of 97 skill units, each of which includes a comprehensive discussion of important teaching considerations, lesson plans for career education stages, and lesson plan evaluations. Initial data on students in the demonstration districts indicate that many support systems and materials are required to improve career education for learning disabled students in secondary  school settings.

When the authors set out on their goal in rural Hart County, Kentucky, they discovered that no instrument existed to measure changes in the level of parental involvement. Using research material found in the ERIC database, the team set about building a new, reliable, and valid instrument. They based their work on activities that already had proven to reflect parental involvement and came up with 30 items, each consisting of a statement about some kind of parental involvement. Parents receiving the survey were asked to indicate, on a five-point scale, how much they agreed with the statements. The team planned to  compare scores taken before and after the parental-interest project had carried out some of its activities, thereby determining resulting changes in parental interest. Initial tests show the new instrument to have high reliability, although the project is preliminary.

        "description":"In a sweeping effort to improve science education in Tennessee, a new curriculum framework was developed that mandated &quot;hands-on&quot; experiences for students, beginning in kindergarten. To smooth out problems in elementary science instruction arising from the mandate, the Center of Excellence for the Enrichment of Science and Mathematics Education at the University of Tennessee at Martin developed training programs and materials. The teacher education program model, called the Elementary Science Education Institute (ESEI), included a four-member team training structure that was central to its success. The ESEI was a response to traditional problems in science education, including the lack of supportive administrators and science specialists in rural areas. Administrators and  elementary teachers took part in the two-phase program, which consisted of intensive academic preparation for nine four-member teams, and in-service field training carried out by the teams in their schools and surrounding districts. Science academicians and educators provided the initial instruction. Use of the model produced favorable changes in science content mastery, attitudes toward science, computer literacy, knowledge of the &quot;hands-on&quot; approach, and achievement by the teams' elementary students. Through their participation, ESEI teachers, principals, and superintendents assumed leadership roles. Also, public awareness and support for elementary science education were among the most important benefits the model produced. (TES)",

        "author":["Luetke-Stahlman, Barbara"],
        "description":"This paper discusses ideas for teachers to increase successful comprehension of their questions by language delayed students. Three kinds of questioning techniques are described. Most often used by teachers are \"WH-words\" (e.g., who, what, how). Noun-verb reversal (e.g., Can you come to the group?) follows in amount of usage. The least used questioning technique is raised intonation (e.g., This one? The pencil?). Failure to respond to any of these question signals does not necessarily mean the student does not know the answer. Question forms often are not adequately coded into sign, and hearing-impaired students may not recognize ordinarily routine strategies signaling questions. Teachers, therefore, should be careful to make question forms comprehensible. A table of \"question  prompts\" provides teachers with alternatives to repeating questions numerous times. Educators can use the prompts to ask questions with brief answers or to encourage discussion. Cognitively challenging questions can be task analyzed by using a four-quadrant language proficiency matrix, in which a line of context intersects with a line of cognition. Classroom teachers often ask context-imbedded, cognitively undemanding questions, while the opposite might be more effective. Teachers should also ask questions at a pace that provides adequate opportunity for students to practice cognitive operations. By setting goals, teachers may be able to help language-impaired children better understand and answer their questions. Four tables and nine references are attached. (TES)",

The cooperative &quot;effective schools&quot; effort used a broad base of support to establish a director of curriculum, create new school-university ties, focus a reading K-12 curriculum improvement effort, and hold instructional leadership sessions for district administrators. The Baxter Springs Board of Education shows continuing support for these curriculum efforts, which are the result of cooperation among educators, students, and the community at large. Success of the program relied upon the common effort to develop motives and processes for school improvement. A school improvement team should be selected and given time to work with all the school's constituents. In Baxter  Springs, seven correlates developed by Lezotte and Bancroft (1985) were used to assess school needs. The correlates included such items as a safe and orderly environment, a clear and focused mission, and frequent monitoring of student progress. Responses to a questionnaire by nine rural school boards overseeing &quot;effective schools&quot; were categorized under each of the seven correlates. Questions dealt with such issues as the extent of teachers' non-teaching duties, long-range planning by principals, staff evaluations, home-school relations, and student attendance policies. This document outlines the questionnaire results and describes plans for a weekend training session for school board members. The document also includes a copy of the questionnaire and a description of the seven  correlates. (TES)",

The model is a way of conceptualizing and organizing the employment-related needs of mainstreamed mildly handicapped youths who are exiting secondary schools. The model emphasizes the role of secondary school transition programming, the need for the school to establish work experience programs, the development of an active network between the secondary school and post-secondary settings to assist students in their transition from school to community, and the establishment of a center that can be individually tailored to the needs of the community. The center helps teachers provide employment preparation skills; responds to the need for services beyond a school's  capacity; and pools resources among schools, adult services providers, and employers. The CTC model consists of three major components. First, it is a school-based program with a curriculum that focuses on transitional programming. The program also is designed to address organizational issues within the school. The second component is the CTC service capacity, a way of organizing and conceptualizing the types of additional job training services. The third component is the transition steering committee, the primary mechanism for bridging between the various community resources, secondary schools, and the CTC. The primary benefit of the CTC model is that it provides a way to organize and evaluate transition programming among the various key players in the school and community.  (TES)",

The plan was designed for the specific needs of rural special educators, who generally have greater need for materials, personnel support, and financing than their urban counterparts. The resource plan includes: needs assessment; grant writing; cross-age and peer tutor training; the use of volunteers and paraprofessionals; implementation; and evaluation. To implement the plan, a model special education teacher must first perform a self assessment using Frank Hewitt's (1980) list of competencies as a framework. The school's resource room program is then evaluated. A community resource plan cannot be implemented until one establishes the basic  components of an effective resource room. Finally, a teacher should assess the needs of the students, define the necessary clerical tasks of the proposed program, and prioritize the levels of service being offered. Once initiated, the community resource plan should include elements of recruitment, orientation, selection, placement, training, and evaluation. Cross-age and peer tutors may be trained using a similar format to one used for training community volunteers. After the program was instituted, the number of referrals to the school's multidisciplinary team dropped by 75%, as did the number of students eligible for special education services. (TES)",

This document describes the model, demonstrated at four sites in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The model is based on four key assumptions: (1) children with chronic health conditions and their families face a common set of problems, regardless of the specific disability; (2) services for these families can be improved by enhancing cooperation among existing health, education, and community programs, rather than by creating new ones; (3) community network building can be best facilitated if the network is initiated at the community level; and (4) community network building for these  children and their families will be most effective if the parents are involved in the planning and development of the network. Phase one of the program involves formation of a local task force, catalyzed by the common perception of problems and a shared need to find solutions. The second phase is to determine needs of and resources for children with chronic health conditions. Phase three is the development and implementation of an action plan, setting goals and priorities before planning appropriate strategies. Such strategies include interagency cooperation, parent group development, educational programs, and resource development. The fourth phase is evaluation of the network. Successful collaboration is based on cooperative working relationships between individuals and agencies, a  formal needs identification process, leadership development, and realistic funding. (TES)",

Data were drawn from the High School and Beyond database, a national sample of high school students surveyed four times from 1980-86. In the rural schools, socioeconomic status (SES) explained between 10-20% of the variability in all of the dependent measures except two; gender explained as much variance in the writing measure as SES; and school size was not significantly related to any dependent variable. Once socioeconomic status was controlled, urbanicity produced only negligible differences in academic  outcomes. School size produced nonsignificant but consistent differences in educational outcomes. In all cases except the mathematics measure, students from small schools had higher mean scores on the dependent measures than other students, and students from moderately sized schools had higher mean scores than those from large schools.

        "description":"During World War II Arizona's Mexican-American communities organized their own patriotic activities and worked, in spite of racism, to support the war effort. In Phoenix the Lenadores del Mundo, an active fraternal society, began this effort by sponsoring a festival in January 1942. Such &quot;mutualistas&quot; provided an essential support system in the face of racism and discrimination, and were sources of cultural, social, and religious cohesion in Mexican-American communities. These societies spoke out after several blatant incidents of discrimination against Mexican-American teenagers, and later organized a Phoenix youth group that collected 2,200 pounds of old rubber for the war effort. Community organizations in Phoenix and Tucson also: (1) organized volunteer cotton pickers when a  labor shortage threatened the crop, badly needed for parachute and blimp manufacture; (2) sponsored social gatherings in honor of Chicano military cadets; (3) arranged bilingual community education classes in American citizenship; (4) collected donations to provide cigarettes to soldiers overseas; (5) sold war bonds and war stamps; (6) collected clothing for the Red Cross; (7) planted victory gardens; (8) collected scrap metal and foil for recycling; and (9) provided child care services for mothers performing war-related activities. After the war most organizations disbanded, but one Tucson women's group continued to perform community service until 1976. This paper contains 30 endnotes. (SV)",

        "description":"The contributions made during World War II by Mexican-American women on the home front have not been recognized in their proper historical perspective. Like their Anglo counterparts, these women took up the responsibilities left by their men and worked to support the war effort. In 1944 the Mexican-American women of Tucson formed La Asociacion Hispano-Americana de Madres y Esposas. Its functions were similar to those of other patriotic community organizations during this period, but the Asociacion had two unique goals: to lift the morale of Tucson's Chicano soldiers away from home and to build a recreation center for the exclusive use of the Mexican-American soldier. The organization published and distributed the &quot;Chatter,&quot; a newspaper carrying notices of events in the  Mexican-American community and news about Chicano soldiers. The newspaper was sent to soldiers to keep them in touch with home. Proceeds from local sales of &quot;Chatter&quot; were intended for the construction of the recreation center. In 16 months Asociacion members sold over one million dollars worth of war bonds and war stamps. Members also collected clothing for the Red Cross, gathered scrap metal and foil, planted victory gardens, and provided child care services for mothers performing war-related services. Although land was purchased, the recreation center was never built. With the end of the war, membership and interest declined sharply. Nevertheless, the Asociacion continued to perform community service until it disbanded in 1976. This paper contains 31 footnotes. (SV)",

This paper describes implementation of the process in four school districts, one each in Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia. State advisory groups selected districts to participate on the basis of size, poverty, rurality, evidence of community leadership, and evidence of school leadership. In each demonstration site, AEL, working with the local school board, set up a school/community steering committee comprised of equal numbers of official and unofficial leaders from the school district and the  community. Initial local data collection included a community needs assessment and a profile of school excellence, a diagnostic system which uses survey and interview data to assess schools' strengths in 11 areas associated with effective schools. All four communities selected a school improvement project, two involving parental involvement, one involving facilities feasibility, and one involving school climate. AEL staff will develop training materials and implementation manuals for use in replication of the process in other communities. (DHP)",

        "description":"Based on statewide surveys of school superintendents, these two papers examine cooperation in the organization of Minnesota school districts, concentrating on cooperative arrangements between two or more districts tailored to meet those districts' needs. Such cooperation includes efforts ranging from sharing instructional technology to sharing entire grades. Most common types of sharing involve sharing teachers, athletic/extracurricular programs and facilities, or equipment. The least common types of cooperation are sharing grades and sharing administrators. Districts use cooperation primarily at the secondary level, reflecting the needs of these students for more choice in courses, athletics, and extracurricular activities. Small rural districts have the highest participation  levels in every type of cooperation except instructional technology. Most districts use cooperation to maintain or expand curriculum, but it may also help manage low and declining enrollments, reduce costs, save schools, avoid consolidation, and maintain autonomy. Cooperation can effectively ameliorate all these problems. But cooperation between large and small districts can be difficult, governance can be cumbersome, and administration can be difficult and impractical. Parents and the community are often the greatest impediment to cooperation, but a strong public relations program can swing opinion toward cooperation. If students are pleased with the results, even skeptical parents will become supporters. (DHP)",

Based on the results of the Delphi exercise it was recommended that the Saddleback College program consist of an optional, tutorial laboratory course and two arithmetic/introduction to algebra courses. One of the latter courses would be directed at those students needing extensive development work in this area and the other would be designed for those needing only a review or those already in possession of a high level of computational skills.

Children were interviewed individually and asked to make decisions and explain their decisions related to eight problems. Accuracy rates for different types of problems and various solution methods used by children were analyzed. Solution strategies were categorized into three groups: (1) statistical; (2) proto-statistical; and (3) other/task-specific strategies. While  sixth-graders were more accurate than third-graders, many of the sixth-graders had difficulty reasoning proportionally. Very few students reasoned statistically about the data. Many students used proto-statistical strategies. The more successful solvers seemed to choose solution strategies, which took into account those particular characteristics of the data sets which were relevant to the solution of the given problem.

Three programs comprised MIC: the Elementary Program, the Middle School Program, and the Middle School Pilot Program. In the first two (the non-pilot) programs, selected pupils were served in computer-assisted-instruction (CAI) labs. The MIC-CAI programs served 661 pupils in grades three through seven for an average of 3.6 hours of instruction per week. Analysis of the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS) total mathematics scores indicated an average growth of 16.6 normal curve equivalent (NCE) points for the 5.7 month instructional period. The amount of NCE change varied inversely  with grade level. The MIC-Pilot program served 810 pupils in grades three through eight for an average of 1.4 hours of instruction per week. Analysis of the CTBS total mathematics scores indicated an average growth of 17.0 NCE points for the same 5.7 month period. Three inservice meetings were rated highly by program teachers. Recommendations for each program were suggested. Tables and instruments are provided in the appendices. (YP)",

        "description":"Analogical reasoning is frequently used in acquisition of mathematical concepts. Concrete representations used to teach mathematics are essentially analogs of mathematical concepts, and it is argued that analogies enter into mathematical concept acquisition in numerous other ways as well. According to Gentner's theory, analogies entail a structure-preserving mapping from a base or source to the target. Although concrete aids can provide valuable assistance to concept acquisition, their oft-noted failure to provide the anticipated benefits has been a source of some puzzlement. It is suggested that the reason for the failure may be the processing loads imposed by structure mapping. Some representative mathematical concepts are examined, together with typical concrete  representations, and the nature of the processing loads analyzed. These loads can be reduced by recoding concepts into more abstract form, but it is argued that structure mapping also plays a role in abstraction. Analysis of this process provides insight into sources of difficulty, and recommendations are made for improving the efficiency of instruction. Thirty-nine references are listed. (Author/YP)",

        "description":"The document reviews the literature concerning the goals of elementary school science teaching. The review indicated a consensus among scientists and science education experts that elementary school science instruction should promote meaningful understanding of science concepts, processes, and attitudes. Students should not just be memorizing scientific facts; they should be developing higher order thinking skills. However, the experts differ in their descriptions of the kinds of higher level thinking that elementary children should develop. As a result, teachers are faced with long lists of goals that do not support them in providing coherent, meaningful science instruction. The paper argues that a coherent model that focuses on a limited set of goals may be more productive in  helping elementary teachers provide meaningful learning opportunities for their students. It reviews three perspectives on science teaching that hold promise for providing such a framework; an inquiry perspective, a science-technology-society perspective, and a conceptual change perspective. The similarities and differences of the three perspectives are discussed and the paper concludes with personal reflections from the author's own teaching. (Author/CW)",

The seven papers on general issues across educational levels take a  broader perspective and examine the past and future of STS and TL programs. Technological literacy, writing, and the liberal arts is a clear area of interest, with seven papers focusing on this topic.

This volume, the &quot;Report of the Committee on Social Studies of the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education of the National Education Association,&quot; has developed a mystique of its own and inspired tones of reverence when the work is mentioned; yet, few social studies educators have read it. The recent spate of reports on history/geography in the schools places much of the blame for the woeful status of history knowledge on the erosive effect of social studies on history over the past 75 years. The reference is to the 1916 report. The &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; regarding this  report needs to be presented and assessed in the light of today's use of that wisdom. The 1916 commission report is presented in this paper in both educational and historic contexts. From whence did the ideas for this report emerge and why? The procedures and content of the report are then examined with particular focus on the commission members and their respective ideologies. The last section looks at the commission report today, in light of the recent rash of curriculum reports and recommendations. A 19-item bibliography is included. (JB)",

The teachers sampled were those who sat for entrance examinations for the University of the West Indies (Mona) Faculty of Education Bachelor of Education and Certificate of Education programs from 1985 to 1989. The investigations conducted were based on the extensive work carried out in the United States by Robert Ennis and his associates. Deductive logic studies those situations in which a given set of statements, the premises, necessitates another set, the conclusion; that is, if the premises are true, then the conclusion has to be true also. Six examples of each formally identified logical principle were given to  those being tested. Respondents were held to have mastered a principle if they got at least five of the six questions right. Results did not reflect a satisfactory level of elementary reasoning ability. The findings are presented in 11 detailed statistical tables and 3 appendices. An 11-item bibliography is also included.

        "description":"Looking back over the past 40 years, one can observe at least seven trends in public policy substance and in the study of public policy: (1) There is a trend toward higher goals for society in economic, social, political, and science policy. (2) Major changes in almost all fields of public policy have resulted in increased benefits for the less privileged groups. (3) There is a trend toward the use of positive incentives like subsidies, tax breaks, and low-interest loans for encouraging socially desired behavior. (4) There is a trend toward more policy-making on the part of the national government relative to the states and cities and on the part of the executive branch relative to the legislative and judicial. (5) There is a trend toward a more pragmatic, mixed approach in  dividing responsibility between the public and private sectors for public functions. (6) There is a trend toward evaluation methods which emphasize multi-criteria decision-making and spreadsheet analysis. (7) There has been a substantial growth and now a plateauing out at a high level of activity with regard to policy evaluation training programs, research centers, funding sources, scholarly associations, and other policy evaluation institutions. Examples are given of super-optimum solutions regarding economic, social, technological, political, and legal policy problems, i.e., solutions that do better than either the liberal or conservative alternatives. Nine tables chart these and related trends. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"There is no need to create a new curriculum in heritage education. Rather, there is an imperative to use the existing curriculum more effectively, to infuse it with the best content on U.S. history and culture, including models of the built environment that embody and reflect the values, aspirations, and achievements of preceding generations. There are at least five pitfalls that heritage educators must avoid, however: (1) Elitism is an overemphasis on the dominant political and social figures in the past that excludes the heritage of the majority of people. (2) Extreme pluralism is an overemphasis on diversity. Such an approach would foster ethnic group separatism and divisiveness in society and diminish national unity and identity. (3) Localism refers to an overriding concern  with the history and culture of particular places and promotes parochialism at the expense of cosmopolitanism. (4) Romanticism in heritage education refers to an indiscriminate and uncritical education about the nation's history and culture, which overlooks the blemishes of the past. (5) Anti-intellectualism stems from an overemphasis on experiential learning. Avoidance of these pitfalls can open the way to cultural literacy for students, knowledge of key facts and ideas of a human community needed for intelligent and fruitful participation in the community. Cultural literacy can be enhanced by visiting historic sites. In this way abstractions of the past can be linked to tangible forms of the present, and empathy for people of the past is encouraged. The use of historic landmarks to  foster cultural literacy is one of the strongest justifications for historic preservation and heritage education. (JB)",

After all the experiences (stories) were told, the group collected the insights they had gained. These 50 morals sounded like platitudes or cliches; they had very little power without their stories. There was no common theme throughout the stories, but four themes did recur with great frequency: (1) Many stories told of a personal struggle. (2) Often they were stories of people putting, or attempting to put, their passion into action. (3) They were stories of risk taking and of a willingness to intentionally face the unknown, the unfamiliar, and the unpredictable. (4) Very often they were stories of people deeply moved by their  compassion and energized to act. For these educators, a discussion about education was an exploration of how to learn rather than how to teach. The power of storytelling as a teaching device was revealed as people shared their experiences, and it was obvious that this kind of personal sharing and teaching one another, so valuable as a way of exploring the human experience, can only happen among people who are willing to trust one another. A further lesson learned by the participants was that experiencing theories authenticates what one knows. Experiences make what a person already knows to be true (e.g., the 50 cliche-like morals), known at another level. (JB)",

        "description":"The United Nations (UN) enjoyed a renewed prominence in the international spotlight during 1988 as the world recognized UN successes in the areas of peacemaking and peacekeeping. Conference participants agreed that the lessening of tensions between the superpowers has had a very positive impact on the general international political atmosphere. Other factors may have contributed to the UN's accomplishments as well: conflicts were, perhaps, winding down of their own weight or, perhaps, the world is entering a new era of greater peace. To clarify how the UN goes about resolving conflicts, the participants distinguished between peacemaking and peacekeeping activities. Peacemaking is generally thought to be the full range of activities aimed at ameliorating conflicts between nations.  Suggestions to strengthen the UN peacemaking role included early intervention and a more assertive stance by the Security Council. Participants gave the Secretary-General much credit for recent peacemaking advances and supported his continued efforts. Often a peacekeeping force is deployed after the first stages of peacemaking have succeeded. Some participants favored overhauling the operational aspects of peacekeeping. Others favored fine-tuning the system. As for the future UN role in peacemaking and peacekeeping, the participants discussed ways of preventing conflicts, how the international community might respond more effectively to massive human rights violations, and how to protect citizens and diplomats who travel internationally. A list of conference participants and the  conference-opening address are included. (Author/JB)",

The international effort to deal with environmental problems is fragmented and underfunded. The UN has no mechanism for the routine identification and analysis of problems and the proposal of solutions to them. In the peace and security area, the changed objects of war from those that prevailed at the end of World War II confound the UN approach. Most wars that are fought today try to bring down a regime or force it to change its policies rather than seize land from the country.

        "description":"The conference reported on in this document focused on the profound changes taking place in the world, changes characterized by their international nature and requiring multinational cooperation. The security of national borders continues to be a concern, but internal threats to governments are the more common phenomenon. The combination of poverty and mushrooming population in the developing nations presents a new threat to security in the North. Other security threats are drug-trafficking, terrorism, and increased worldwide conventional arsenals. New threats to the environment have caught the attention of world leaders. The transformation in global economic activity was targeted as an important change that has yet to be adequately addressed. Directly related to the economic  transformation is the technological revolution. The United Nations (UN) has traditionally been handed many of the world's most insoluble problems. Given the recent successes of the UN in defusing regional conflicts and a generally more positive world attitude toward the institution, the outlook for the UN to effectively handle traditional security concerns has improved somewhat. The prospects are not as bright for dealing with new security issues. The problems emerging cannot be contained within national boundaries and are not prone to control either intra- or inter-nationally by governments. World leaders must recognize that the world is entering a new era and develop an agenda that ensures that peaceful change is possible.

United Nations (UN) conference participants discussed the degree of political acceptance of concepts such as environmental security and sustainable development. Their reading of the political situation was then used to analyze possible international responses to environmental degradation and natural resource depletion. Some themes which arose in discussing the international response were: (1) The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has done a generally good job in carrying out its limited mission with limited resources. (2) There is a need for policy coordination among nations, across international institutions,  and bridging sectors such as economics, population, and environment. An intergovernmental body that meets at a high level is needed to cut through bureaucratic rivalries and to put political muscle behind initiatives. (3) A major institutional deficiency of the international system involves the failure to adequately measure and internalize all sorts of production in many economic enterprises. (4) The forthcoming 1992 UN conference on the environment should be a UN meeting, not a UNEP meeting, and there should be high-level participation from nations. If the momentum for change in international environmental efforts can be sustained, there is hope for near-term agreement on measures to curb planet-threatening abuses of the environment.

The general principles underlying these recommendations are as follows: (1) The long-term U.S. policy goal in the region is to assist in bringing about a peaceful, prosperous, and stable Southeast Asia, in which Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos are fully integrated as sovereign nations with whom the United States has normal relations. (2) In  developing this policy, a proper balance must be maintained between regional and global concerns. (3) U.S. policies toward these countries must be in harmony with U.S. bilateral relations with the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). (4) The United States should continue to engage the Soviets in high-level dialogue on Cambodia. (5) The principal leaders and the genocidal practices of the Khmer Rouge should not be given an opportunity to return to Cambodia. (6) U.S. policy should promote less reliance on the Soviet bloc by Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos, and the removal of Soviet military facilities in Vietnam.

Perestroika touches every aspect of Soviet economic life, including relations with the international economy. Soviet specialists and international economists must find common ground so that they can successfully analyze and prescribe policies for perestroika. The conference participants agreed that Gorbachev is serious about perestroika and that it is above all an internal process. Therefore, the implications for the international economy must rest on an understanding of current domestic conditions. Discussion focused on two basic problems that must be overcome for perestroika to succeed: reform of Soviet agriculture to increase productivity and the  introduction of a more realistic pricing system. It was agreed that the Soviets must become more involved in the international economy through trade if they are to succeed in their economic reforms, but that the Soviet Union would remain a marginal trading nation for some time. The group agreed that the question of whether encouraging a stronger, economically viable Soviet Union was in U.S. interests would form the core of the policy debate about U.S. responses to perestroika.

Conference participants agreed that Central America, for historic, geographic, economic, and political reasons is of vital interest to the United States and that disengagement is not a viable option. U.S. credibility, in the region and at home, requires a clear set of priorities and congruence between stated and real goals, and it also requires a consensus on the nature of U.S. interests in Central America and how they can be protected and advanced. Defining points of intersection between U.S. goals and interests and those of the Central American countries is also necessary.  The group was able to agree on a framework for a workable policy, though not on specific recommendations. The main points of consensus were: (1) The United States must look to revitalize the regional diplomatic option as part of its political agenda. (2) The Central America issue demands immediate attention and should be a top priority. The United States must recognize that it has a stake in the positive resolution of the Central American crisis. (3) Policy must be formed from a bipartisan consensus and must not be implemented without backing from the American people.

        "description":"This paper argues that the teacher should be understood as a gatekeeper for curriculum and instruction in social studies, and that gatekeeping is a product of the frame of reference the teacher brings to it. The teacher plays the primary structuring role in the social studies classroom and, regardless of the official curriculum, constructs the curriculum that is actually provided in the classroom. As the curricular-instructional gatekeeper, the teacher makes the crucial decisions concerning content, sequence, and instructional strategy that determine the social studies experiences of students. The criteria the teacher employs to determine interpretations and uses of a curriculum are a product of his or her frame of reference. Curricular-instructional gatekeeping is a  decision-making process often based on unexamined assumptions and conventions, that is, they are not conscious decisions. Though research relevant to gatekeeping is disparate and sketchy, some conclusions can be drawn and areas in need of research identified. Several studies illustrate specific aspects of gatekeeping by teachers in three domains: (1) the meaning of social studies, (2) planning for social studies, and (3) instruction in social studies. Teachers tend to substitute their own meanings of critical thinking in social studies for that intended by the curriculum developers. There is a general neglect of continuity of lessons by social studies teachers. Though social studies curricula are textbook-based, the instruction is teacher-dominated, therefore there is much variation in  gatekeeping from teacher to teacher. It is important to raise the consciousness of teachers about their gatekeeping. (AS)",

        "description":"The criteria that elementary school teachers use to guide their decisions concerning content, sequence, and instructional strategy in geography and their frames of reference toward geography were examined through interviews and classroom observations. Research indicates that the teacher determines the curriculum that the students actually experience. The criteria that teachers use to make curricular instructional decisions are comprised of an interactive system of beliefs and contextual influences that need to be understood holistically. After an initial interview of 40 minutes, each of 3 experienced teachers was observed for 6 weeks for a total of 21 hours. The study was conducted at a metropolitan area school (in a mid-Atlantic state), where most students were from the lower  half of the socio-economic scale. In all the observed classrooms, evaluation of student learning focused on facts and skills. Within the constraints of the curriculum guide and available materials, the teachers made subject matter choices less on the basis of their conception of what social studies should be ideally than as the product of three interlocking elements of their frames of reference. The elements were: (1) a commitment to coverage of major facts and skills in the textbook, (2) low expectations for what children are capable of learning, and (3) their beliefs about the subject of geography. The teachers seldom examined their frames of reference. This combination of unexamined assumptions and the interactive character of a frame of reference explain why geographic education has  remained dominated by recitation of facts and skills even though reformers agree on the need for a geography curriculum that is more focused on geographic relationships. If relationship geography is to be implemented, major efforts will be needed to assist teachers to reflect on what they do, why they do it, and what educational effects this has. (JB)",

        "description":"Each year, all students at the Yeshivah of Flatbush Joel Braverman High School (Brooklyn, New York) take a minimum of 17 periods of Jewish Studies in addition to a full program of secular studies. Halakhah (Jewish law) used to be taught within the Talmud class, but teachers often relied on the fact that students had absorbed the basic lexicon of Halakhic terminology at home and gave it a cursory treatment in class. But because students came from a wide spectrum of homes, many lacked the basic skills and vocabulary of Halakhic studies. In addition, teachers generally taught Halakhah from their own perspective of Halakhic observance, and some traditions were thus being ignored. In order to address these problems, a four-year curriculum in Halakhah was instituted. This document  describes the goals of the program, gives an outline of the program, describes the teaching staff and their preparation for the program, and discusses how the program was refined. A series of tests and classroom observations indicated that the students did not have the desired skills before the course, but by its completion they had mastered these skills and understood the basic structure and development of the Halakhah. A summary test administered to graduating seniors and covering all four years' work indicated that there was a high retention rate. Parents and students have commented on the serious attitude that students now have toward the study of Halakhah. Sephardic students and their parents have praised the program for presenting Sephardic customs and traditions as having equal  standing with those of the dominant Ashkenazic community. (JB)",

In addition, cooperative learning research has provided evidence of the effectiveness of cooperatively structured group work aimed at problem solving. This paper identifies concepts and findings in the fields of cognitive psychology and cooperative learning relevant to teaching and learning higher-cognitive thinking skills. Special reference is made to a study by Voss, Greene, Post, and Penner (1983) that focuses on political-economic problem solving. Implications are derived from the research to use as criteria for evaluating instructional programs intended to teach students to reason  with historical and social scientific knowledge. Particular attention is given to the roles of domain-specific knowledge, including cognitive schemata and metacognitive knowledge in the problem solving performance of expert and novice problem solvers. Three models for teaching students intellectual skills in the social studies curriculum are critiqued with the criteria. The three instructional models are the \"jurisprudential approach\" to teaching public issues in the classroom (Oliver & Shaver, 1966; Newmann & Oliver, 1970), Beyer's (1987; 1988) thinking skills program, and the economic reasoning model recommended by the Joint Council on Economic Education (Saunders et al., 1984).

They may suspect that where discrimination exists, revolt is only an inch below the surface.

The struggle against these forces, the strength necessary for the struggle, and the odds against success in the struggle are little known, especially in international circles. It required great coverage to fight for inclusion into the economic, social, political, judicial, and educational mainstreams as a matter of right, not a matter of privilege. The struggle was a challenge to the U.S. definition and  practice of democracy and a challenge to move beyond that definition as practiced.

        "description":"Economic literacy is important because economics is such an integral part of daily existence. Individuals who understand basic economic concepts will be better equipped to make the important decisions that effective citizenship requires. The 15 economics lessons in this booklet are designed for elementary and middle school students. Each lesson introduces an economic concept such as: goods and services; production; scarcity; consumers; producers; trade; money; specialization; capital; saving and investing; market price; costs and profits; inflation; and Gross National Product. The unique feature of these lessons is the use of modeling clay in each lesson. This is not only motivating, but also provides concrete learning experiences that promote learning for most elementary and  middle school students. The lessons are primarily activity-oriented simulations that stress an inductive approach to learning. The lessons are best taught sequentially as a complete unit of instruction, but may be used individually to supplement other economics curriculum materials. There are two similar multiple choice tests that accompany the lessons. One test covers lessons 1-9 and has a somewhat easier vocabulary than the second test, which covers all 15 lessons but is divided into two parts, one covering lessons 1-9 and the other lessons 10-15. A key to the answers is provided. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"The Iowa State Board of Education mandated the teaching of global education across the curriculum, effective July 1, 1989. This guide is intended to point the way for school districts developing their own models of global education defined as an approach to learning that promotes greater understanding of the world as an interconnected aggregate of human and natural systems. These systems operate within a single planetary life-support system on which the destiny of all humankind depends. The purpose of global education is to promote long-term human survival by developing greater respect for and cooperation between fellow human beings and greater concern for the environment on which all people depend for their very existence. A rationale for global education is offered, and  suggests that content be structured around five basic themes: (1) global interdependence; (2) human resources, values, and culture; (3) the global environment and natural resources; (4) global peace and conflict management; and (5) change and alternative futures. Broad goals derived from these five basic themes are presented. Checklists for identifying elements of these themes that a school system may already include in its curriculum are provided. Examples of how global perspectives can be infused at every grade level and in every subject area are given. The concluding chapter lists 63 printed resources for global education and 16 organizations and resource centers. (JB)",

        "description":"The 1984-85 academic year was the first in which women's studies courses were included in the core curriculum at Eastern Connecticut State University (Willimantic). This paper examines the effects of this inclusion. In general, these courses have enjoyed increased and diversified enrollments, with more men and continuing students electing to take these courses. While classroom methodology has been affected somewhat by the altered composition of the classroom, the changes are seen as positive and can be traced to heightened awareness in society in general of women's changing roles. Besides the obvious benefit of having the chance to reach other students than liberal arts majors--students who might not otherwise be exposed to a feminist liberal arts perspective--and to encourage in  these students a more pluralistic and egalitarian world view, the validation gained through core inclusion and the upsurge in enrollments have evidently led to heightened interest in women's studies among a variety of students. Since the inclusion of women's studies in the general education core, four new courses have been added to the women's studies curriculum at the University. (JB)",

        "description":"This study explores reverse discrimination as a cultural phenomenon that should be studied by anthropologists, and to which anthropology has inadvertently contributed. Discrimination by minority group members is taught and encouraged under the guise of ethnic pride and promotion of traditional beliefs. Ethnocentrism may be a cultural defense mechanism for dealing with actual or alleged hostility and abuse suffered by members of a minority group, and may be used as rationalization of thwarted aspirations. Accompanying ethnocentric attitude is discrimination against others, and in-group/out-group conflict. Cultural elitism is encouraged by religion, as a conservative/conserving institution, that reinforces traditional values and a sense of exclusivity and inclusivity. Judaism is an  example of this. Cultural elitism is reflected in discrimination through language, which is almost universal. More education, cross-cultural education, or education in anthropology are often given as solutions to the problems of discriminatory behavior, but have not necessarily been successful. For education in anthropology to successfully reduce discriminatory behavior, anthropologists must examine their assumptions and concepts, and make significant changes in their approach to curriculum.

        "description":"Art instruction in Iowa schools lacks cohesiveness and continuity. This may be due in part to the state government's commitment to local autonomy. The Iowa Department of Education does not mandate what schools must do; it only suggests and encourages. In 1986, the department published a five-year plan for the achievement of educational goals, including a guide to curriculum development in the arts. The Iowa Arts Council saw an opportunity to blend its objective, to promote the practice and appreciation of the arts, with this five-year plan and new arts curriculum. The result was the Arts in Schools Basic Education Grant (AISBEG). The objectives of the project include: (1) providing comprehensive sequential arts curriculum for grades K-12 in visual art, music, dance, and theater  and for these disciplines to be infused into the school's traditional academic curricula; (2) utilizing a wide variety of community arts resources to enhance arts education; and (3) emphasizing the development of cross-curricular, interdisciplinary, multicultural, non-sexist experiences, and global and career education, as well as learning for all students. The progress of this project is noted, and the plans that have been developed are outlined. Appendices provide excerpts from the Department of Education's five-year plan and from the new standards for Iowa schools as well as a directory of people involved in the AISBEG project. (JB)",

        "description":"This book reports the findings of the Ethnic Heritage and Language Schools Project undertaken by the American Folklife Center in 1982. Twenty-one researchers used participant observation to study ethnic schools in different parts of the United States. The project studied schools that correspond to Fishman's classification of ethnic education programs: (1) all-day schools, (2) weekday after-hours schools, and (3) weekend schools. Each survey fieldworker conducted research independently, under the direction of the project coordinator, using general interview guidelines. Thirteen fieldworker essays are reproduced in this report, covering schools affiliated with the following groups: (1) Cambodian, (2) Islamic, (3) Portuguese, (4) Korean, (5) Turkish, (6) Polish, (7) Buddhist, (8)  German-Russian, (9) Lebanese/Arabic, (10) Greek, (11) Jewish/Hebrew, (12) Hupa Indian, and (13) Czech. The community-based ethnic schools studied demonstrate each group's perception of itself and its cultural legacy, and are examples of conscious transmission of cultural knowledge. Their curricula show what each community perceives as important components of their ethnic identity; language, religion and history are the focus of classes, with the most value normally placed upon language. As forums for learning and presenting songs, dances, crafts and other traditions, schools play an important role in formulating and defining what constitutes ethnic cultural expressions for the children. This investigation recognizes the importance of community-based ethnic schools in helping the United  States retain its multicultural profile and notes further study is warranted. (AS)",

        "author":["Grunig, Larissa A."],
        "description":"Feminist scholarship has the potential of modifying the assumptions, values, and methodologies of any discipline because it examines that field from the viewpoint of both men and women. Faculty development programs across the country are aimed at incorporating this new scholarship into the curriculum. One such program, the University of Maryland's \"Thinking about Women,\" is used as the model for this paper. Curricular transformation projects share the goal of teaching about women and diversity with sensitivity in the classroom. Statistics show that women comprise 51 percent of the public relations field. This feminization of the field is cause for concern to both males and females, for history shows that shifting from a male to a female majority brings with it a depressed salary  schedule and loss of prestige. Since men remain in positions of power in public relations, public relations educators should feel compelled to sensitize them to their responsibilities to the entire field--males, females, and minorities. This paper argues for curriculum review and revision of courses in public relations to reflect the new scholarship on women both in the field itself and in related disciplines. The effects of such a transformation should extend well beyond the classroom. While helping to create an inclusive community of scholars in public relations at the time, it should also establish a future generation of managers who will reject any asymmetrical model of practice that does not value the diversity, the cooperation, the equity, the ethics, and the responsibility that  have characterized their education.

Chapter 1 uses this measure to summarize the levels of proficiency displayed by students in the 1988 assessment, offering an overview and examples of their knowledge and understanding. Chapter 2 compares U.S. history proficiency across the grades and across subpopulations defined by race/ethnicity, gender, region, and other characteristics. Part 2 of the report takes a closer look at the assessment results. The chapters in this section  provide information not only on the results of the assessment of students in grades 4,8, and 12, but also on trends in the performance of approximately 2,300 eleventh-grade students, based on a special study conducted in 1986 and 1988. Chapter 3 explores students' knowledge of historical periods, chronology, documents, and persons, while chapter 4 summarizes their familiarity with the historical contexts of political and economic life as well as of cultural, social, and family life. Part 3 describes the amount and nature of social studies and U.S. history instruction reported by students who participated in the 1988 assessment and in the special trend assessment. Chapter 5 summarizes the extent of students' instruction in these subjects, and chapter 6 reports on various aspects of this  instruction--particularly the topics studied and the prevalence of various instructional activities. Many tables of statistical data are included. (JB)",

Data were gathered from a random survey of Florida elementary, middle, and secondary teachers. The number of factors which indicated dissatisfaction and the characteristics identified by literature were tallied for each respondent to determine the possibility of that respondent's projected attrition. Factors identifying the typical &quot;Likely Leaver&quot; fell into two categories, demographic and attitudinal. Approximately half of the respondents were found to be &quot;Leaver&quot; candidates in the demographic category who felt that &quot;the business  world&quot; offered greater intellectual stimulation. Dissatisfaction in the attitudinal factors reflected: (1) negative student attitudes and discipline problems; (2) disappointment and stress; (3) low salaries; (4) poor working condition; and (5) little professional recognition. Recommendations are made for improving the demographic area with more rigorous screening of teacher candidates and, in the attitudinal area, improving the existing atmosphere of the school environment.

        "description":"Iowa has implemented educational reform by providing state financing without state mandates. This paper describes the achievements of Iowa's decentralized educational reform effort. Phase I of the reform effort provided salary relief to the beginning teacher, Phase II provided salary relief for the experienced teacher, and Phase III linked future salary relief to educational reform in such areas as performance based compensation and supplementary student-centered activities. The paper's three sections offer (1) a definition of Phase III; (2) a discussion of its specific achievements; and (3) a consideration of future steps. It is concluded that the &quot;bottom up&quot; approach to reform has built trust, promoted innovation, engendered diversity, raised salaries, and provided many  worthwhile programs for students. However, it has not yet integrated its innovations in ways which promote systemic change at the building level. The ultimate success of Phase III will depend upon the ability of major stakeholders to provide support and leadership for comprehensive, interactive changes in school buildings. Central to this goal is the availability of additional time for teachers to participate in the demands of shared governance which systemic change will require. Time can be provided only if additional state support is sequestered as a restricted fund. This resource should be allocated to buildings and administered by building-level committees of teachers and administrators. (JD)",

The emphasis of the Danforth program is on experiential learning opportunities for prospective principals providing future administrators with hands-on experience in schools under the guidance of mentor principals while earning their master's degree. The strength of the two programs is that both are based upon cohort groups which allow participants to draw from experience of fellow students. The unique aspect of the programs is the willingness  of students in both programs to participate in the shared experience. The students in the programs are interns at the same time, with the Danforth interns being replaced in their classrooms during released time by MAT interns. Descriptions are given of the types of MAT internships and the advantages and disadvantages of each internship format.

        "description":"This study examined career paths and job satisfaction of teachers completing their preparation and entering the profession during the 1980s. Annual follow-up studies of teacher education graduates at the institution during the year after graduation over several years have indicated from 45 to 55 percent of the graduates were employed as full-time teachers in public or private schools during the school year following program completion. Many others indicated that they intended to teach in the future. The study was undertaken to determine to what extent program graduates became a part of, and were likely to remain in, the teaching profession in the years after graduation. Because of changes occurring in the profession and the preparation program at various points in time, data from  cohorts are examined separately to look for possible effects of time of exit from the program. A random sample of 100 graduates completing teacher certification requirements at the University of Tennessee was selected for the study from each of four cohorts: 1979-80, 1981-82, 1983-84, and 1985-86. The relationship between years of teaching experience and job satisfaction is moderate and not strictly linear. In general, the teachers with the least amount of experience were most satisfied, while the highest levels of dissatisfaction were evident at completion of the 4th, 5th, and 7th years. Because teachers delay entry, enter, and leave at various times, it would probably be erroneous to decide that data taken at any one period accurately reflects the contribution of a cohort to the  teaching work force.

After a specific mentoring model was constructed, the objectives of the study were to identify leadership behaviors cooperating teachers used, to determine if any of the inferred mentoring styles that incorporated the leadership behaviors tested were dominant, and to determine if any of these leadership behaviors or mentoring styles influenced a student teacher's success as measured by a final evaluation checklist. The Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire Form XII was administered to 212 University of Northern Iowa student teachers during the final week of the clinical field experience. The questionnaire sought responses  on 12 leadership behaviors and 4 mentoring styles. It was found that cooperating teachers used multiple leadership practices and these flexible practices were observable by student teachers. A cooperating teacher's leadership behaviors both positively and negatively influenced a student teacher's success. The interrelatedness of the leadership behaviors with the mentoring styles was significant for all four mentoring styles. A cooperating teacher's mentoring style can positively, negatively, and neutrally affect a student teacher's success. It was also found that cooperating teachers who have a closer relationship with their student teachers will evaluate them higher. It is suggested that there is a need to know why some mentoring styles and behaviors positively, negatively and neutrally  affect a student teacher's success. (JD)",

The paper discusses specific problems confronting distance education course planners. First, while the objectives of professional ethics courses appear to be obvious, they are, in fact, often unstated and obscure even to the instructor. Can the course planner clarify what a particular course is trying to achieve? Are there any typologies which might assist in this process? Second, depending on its objectives, each ethics course will require its own unique blend of instruction and interaction. Are the techniques and technologies required to develop the correct &quot;mix&quot;  available to the course planner? In particular, can the interaction required by most ethics courses be transposed effectively and at reasonable cost from the classroom to the distance mode? Finally, when one is talking about right and wrong, grading becomes a problem. Are any evaluation techniques especially relevant to professional ethics courses offered at a distance? These considerations are discussed in the context of a description of three distance courses developed at the University of Victoria. What emerged from this experience is the fact that ethics courses can have quite radically different objectives, thus illustrating the potential dimensions of the goal identification dilemma. (JD)",

Very few of the second jobs were actually related to the primary vocation of the teacher. Activities reported included bus driving, club activities, tutoring and coaching. Most of these activities pay a minimum wage. For most who moonlight, the extra income is an economic necessity, and for a great many more, the economic need to work a second job exists but the employment opportunity does not. Most of the teachers who responded to the  survey did not believe that working a second job lowered their prestige nor did it cause the majority to become dissatisfied with teaching. There seemed to be little concern that working a second job jeopardized school evaluation or caused the teachers difficulty with the school board. (JD)",

Determination of shortage areas is based on the number of teacher vacancies, new certificates issued by the Department of Education during the previous year, and the number and types of classes being taught by persons without the appropriate certification. Analyses of individual positions and position categories with reference to the number of school districts with vacancies provide detailed information on the possible existence of teacher shortages. The most precise estimate of teacher shortages in the report is made through the calculation of a teacher shortage index. This index is a  relative indicator of a teacher shortage which is used to identify areas with a greater need for teachers than other areas. The greatest number of school districts reported full-time vacancies in the following areas: (1) elementary education; (2) teachers of the learning disabled; (3) English; (4) music; and (5) speech and hearing.

Specific attention is devoted to those critical institutional changes which have occurred over the last five years as each has worked to improve the quality of their education graduates and their preservice teacher programs while successfully coping with enrollment declines, higher admissions standards, and major proposals calling for restructured  teacher education programs. Information is provided on the following key variables: (1) enrollment and graduation patterns in teacher education since 1985-86; (2) academic standards and curricula; (3) performance on competency and/or certification examinations; (4) other departments/institutional initiatives; (4) placement rates of graduates; and (6) other items of importance related to the success of the program and the potential impact of state policies on their future success.

Little research data exists on specific opinions, attitudes and needs of young males regarding the array of services available. This paper describes: (1) how market research (including focus groups, a client services audit, an educational services audit, and a client satisfaction survey) was used to determine a client-oriented approach to designing new services for males; and (2) results of a pilot project which compared two types of (\"traditional\" and \"interactive\") school-based sexuality education programs based on the market research findings. Results showed that the \"interactive\" educational program was associated with  statistically significant gains in knowledge for both males and females, although knowledge gain was greater for males than for females. While male communication skills improved more than female, the difference was not significant. Overall results suggest that market research can be used effectively to design sexuality education programs and family planning services that are more consistent with the needs of young males.

This report presents case studies of assessments of students performed by colleges in Scotland, based on the innovative assessment design associated with the National Certificate. This paper is the second of two reports that discuss the findings of the SED's research project on Assessment in the National Certificate Development Program. Focus is on the quality of assessment for summative purposes; that is, the procedures and instruments that were used to decide whether a student should be credited with having successfully completed a  National Certificate module. Topics addressed include the assessment model itself as well as its application to mathematics (in a case study of one college), stock control (in a case study of two colleges), communication (in a case study of one college), and electronics (in a case study of two colleges). The components of the system that seem most responsible for the quality of assessments include the institutions and procedures that have responsibility for the policy at the national level; the process that determines the form and function of module descriptors; and the policies and practices within colleges, departments, classrooms, and workplaces where the assessments actually take place.

Focus is on demonstrating how rules for the simultaneous optimization of sequences of decisions can be found. The main advantages of the simultaneous approach, compared to the separate approach, are the more efficient use of data and the fact that more realistic utility structures can be used. The utility structure dealt with in this combined decision problem is a linear utility function. Decision rules are derived for quota-free as well as quota-restricted assignment situations when several culturally biased subpopulations of subjects are to be distinguished. The procedures are demonstrated with an  empirical example of instructional decision making in an individualized study system that involves combining two elementary decisions.

A total of 46 scholars, educators, and leading figures in CT theory and CT assessment research were gathered for the panel meetings. About half of the panelists were primarily affiliated with philosophy departments; the others were affiliated with education, social sciences, or  physical sciences. Recommendations resulting from the discussion rounds address the cognitive skill dimension of CT, the dispositional dimension of CT, and specific recommendations on CT instruction and assessment, including development of a CT curriculum.

The computer presents items to students at the appropriate level, and students take different versions of the same test. Computerized testing increases the flexibility of test management in that: (1) tests are given on demand and scores are immediately available; (2) differences among administrators cannot affect scores and trained administrators are not needed; (3) tests can be individually paced; and (4) test security is increased. Computerized testing also offers options for timing and formatting, increases efficiency, and can provide accurate scores over a wide range of abilities. Some limitations to CATs are considered. CATs are not appropriate for some  subjects and skills. Hardware limitations restrict the types of items that can be administered by computer, and many schools simply do not have the resources to administer CATs. A relatively large sample is needed to norm test items; comparable scores depend heavily on the quality of the estimates of item characteristics because each student answers a different set of items. The military has been among the pioneers in using CATs and at least two public school systems have begun to use them.

The most instructionally relevant achievement tests are those developed by an individual teacher for use with a particular class. This digest describes the steps of test construction and presents suggestions for interpreting the outcomes of the achievement tests. The first steps involve identifying what the students should have learned and designing the test. The learning objectives emphasized determine the material to include and the form the test will take. Once the objectives have been designed, the second step--writing the questions--can be attempted. General principles of test construction are reviewed. Guidelines for construction of  multiple-choice tests, probably the most difficult to construct, are also given. The third step is a final check and review of the finished test. Considering the questions related to the various learning objectives as separate subtests can help the teacher develop a profile of each student's knowledge of the objectives. A carefully constructed achievement test can help the educator teach more effectively and the student master more of the objectives. (SLD)",

        "description":"A well-planned and well-conducted evaluation can provide useful information to funding agencies, sponsoring institutions, instructors, and participants. Evaluating an instructional program, such as a workshop or institute, involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, and reporting data about several features of the program and its impact on the participants. Evaluating a workshop or institute can help in at least four areas: (1) planning (deciding on the overall content, major goals, and more detailed objectives of the workshop/institute); (2) programming (deciding on the procedures, faculty, facilities, budget, and other resources needed for running the workshop/institute); (3) conducting the workshop or institute; and (4) making changes. Planning the evaluation requires the same  care that planning the program requires. Both the overall effectiveness of the program and the progress each participant makes toward the specified goals should be evaluated. Both of these levels can be addressed through formative evaluation during the program, summative evaluation at its conclusion, and follow-ups to assess the lasting value of the program. Suggestions are provided for conducting each of these types of evaluations. (SLD)",

A teacher evaluation system should give teachers useful feedback on classroom needs, the opportunity to learn new teaching techniques, and counsel from principals and other teachers on how to make changes in their classrooms. Standards for evaluation should: relate to important teaching skills; be as objective as possible; be clearly communicated before the evaluation begins and reviewed after the evaluation is completed; and be linked to teachers' professional development. Some procedures evaluators can use are to: (1) observe classroom activities; (2) review lesson plans and classroom records; and (3) expand the number of people involved in the evaluations. Equally  important is reporting the results of the evaluation to give teachers adequate, but not overwhelming, feedback. Linking teacher evaluation to professional development is essential. Teachers often have real concerns about the evaluation process; these concerns include the following: teachers do not have any input into the evaluation process; evaluators do not spend enough time on the evaluation; evaluators are not well trained; and results of the evaluation are not being used to further teacher development. To make teacher evaluation a positive experience for both the teacher and the evaluator, the evaluator must ensure that the process is more than an empty exercise. (SLD)",

The use of tests as instructional tools and administrative tools is discussed as well as teacher and administrator attitudes toward testing and teacher competency in interpreting test results. The term &quot;tests&quot; covers standardized tests of achievement and aptitude, less formal paper-and-pencil tests, performance tests, and the like. To link testing directly to teaching, tests can be used at the beginning of the school year to gain an overview of student knowledge, in decisions about grouping students in the classroom, in diagnoses of each student's knowledge, and in attempts to determine the appropriate pace of classroom instruction. Tests can be used to make student promotion and retention decisions, to share  information with parents and other non-student stakeholders, and to measure the effectiveness of instruction and learning. Teachers generally seem to be more supportive of testing than is indicated by the literature, and teachers' attitudes seem to be a function of their experience and knowledge. Superintendents report a higher level of satisfaction with use of tests by practitioners for decision making than do measurement specialists. Students favor frequent testing, but while most of them want to know the results of their tests, less than half want to discuss them with their teachers. A short reading list is appended. (TJH)",

The jacknife technique uses different subsamples derived from the original total data set to provide empirical estimates of the generalizability of effect sizes. The bootstrap technique estimates the statistical accuracy of effect size estimates and creates a megafile by copying the original data sample over and over again many times. The researcher then randomly selects a given number of bootstrap samples of size &quot;n&quot; from the megafile. The effect size is computed for each bootstrap sample; these correlation coefficients are treated as a distribution from which statistical estimates of result  stability are derived. Cross-validation methods involve the arbitrary splitting of a sample. Prediction equations developed for each group are crossed so that each group will use the other group's prediction equations. A small data set is used to illustrate in more detail how the cross-validation procedure is performed and interpreted. Two data tables and sample Statistical Analysis System commands are provided.

These estimates are based on a national probability sample of private schools surveyed in the fall of 1989. Basic data are collected through the ongoing Schools and Staffing Survey and a Private School Universe data collection system currently under development as an ongoing data system. Early in October 1989, questionnaires were mailed to a national probability sample of 1,169 private elementary and  secondary schools from a universe of 27,000 schools. A total of 127 of these schools were subsequently determined to be out of scope. The overall response rate after telephone follow-up was 95% (986 of the 1,042 eligible schools). Comparable estimates for public school teachers, students, and graduates are collected through a survey of state education agencies.

        "description":"A frame of reference for studying culture in middle schools was developed. Items for the Middle School Description Survey (MSDS), which was designed to test elements of the ideal middle school culture, were created based on middle school advocacy literature. The items were conceptually categorized according to E. H. Schein's (1985) cultural content model. R-technique factor analysis of the instrument using data from 295 educators failed to support the validity of these conceptual cultural categories, but did identify the existence of a single &quot;g&quot; factor with which most of the items correlated highly. In a separate phase of the study, the MSDS was completed by 146 educators in 7 middle schools. Data from each of the schools were used in separate Q-technique factor analyses in an  attempt to determine the instrument's usefulness in identifying distinct groups of individuals in these schools relative to their orientation to the culture construct. A number of identifiable &quot;person clusters&quot; were present in the several schools, with a high degree of uniqueness associated with the orientation of each cluster. These results indicate that the MSDS is a promising tool for measuring organizational culture in middle schools. A 48-item list of references, a list of items included in the MSDS, and 4 data tables are included. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"J. M. Richards (1989) has demonstrated that when individuals' reports about environments are aggregated to create environmental measures, the use of coefficient alpha to estimate single occasion reliability can be misleadingly elevated and that alpha cannot distinguish an environmental measure from a &quot;disguised measure of individual differences.&quot; In this paper, the split-sample reliabilities of the Effective Schools Battery teacher psychosocial climate and population measures are examined. These reliabilities are compared with school-level alpha coefficients and with 1-year and 2-year retest reliabilities previously reported. Split-sample reliabilities are usually somewhat smaller than the alpha coefficients calculated at the school level for psychosocial climate measures, but  they are nevertheless generally substantial. Population measures also show substantial split-sample reliabilities, implying that teachers are clustered within school environments in ways that are associated with their personal characteristics (individual differences). Five tables showing selected results from an examination of the correlates of these school environment and teacher population measures with student scholastic performance, attendance, and dropout are included to stimulate interest in a related research report. Fifteen references and two figures are included. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"Theoretical and empirical work was conducted on the role of the &quot;mental model,&quot; or how-it-works information, in learning to operate equipment. The original project was concerned with empirical and cognitive modeling studies of how people learn to operate equipment from the kind of information contained in technical documentation. The goal was to understand how knowledge about equipment could be presented effectively and how knowledge about the equipment should be conveyed to the reader. These studies were described in prior publications, which are listed in this final report. The second part of the project was a separate line of work on a computerized aid for comprehensible writing, a computer program intended to provide feedback to the writers of technical documents about  comprehensibility problems. A general conclusion of the project was that high-quality training on specific procedures is generally superior to training limited to system knowledge. The developed feedback system was sophisticated and fast. Future work on this topic might best be focused on documenting the redundancy and insignificance of much mental model content. The reports and publications of this portion of the project are also listed. Applications of the work of both parts of the project and the problems encountered are summarized. (SLD)",

        "description":"Advantages of the use of multivariate commonality analysis are discussed and a small data set is used to illustrate the analysis and as a model to enable readers to conduct such an analysis. A noteworthy advantage of commonality analysis is that commonality honors the relationships among variables by determining the degree to which predictors in a set share variance with the criterion variables. Since commonality indicates the extent of overlap of the variables, it is especially useful in the behavioral sciences where predictor variables are often correlated with each other. Commonality also reinforces the recognition that canonical analysis is the most general case of parametric significance testing. The disadvantage that there are no statistical significance tests for  commonality analyses is outweighed by the advantages. The illustrative example uses a hypothetical data set of 22 observations, 3 predictor variables, and 2 criterion variables. Seven data tables are provided. (SLD)",

        "description":"To establish a comprehensive national database on postsecondary student financial aid, the National Center for Education Statistics conducted the 1987 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). Objectives were to: (1) determine the costs of postsecondary education for aided and non-aided students; (2) evaluate how students finance their postsecondary education and the role financial aid plays in meeting these costs; (3) assess how families cope with postsecondary education costs; and (4) show the total education debt acquired by students. Information was also collected on characteristics of the participating students, parents, and institutions. This methodology report covers the general scope and design of the study, with emphasis on the in-school sample and sampling  design. The sample design included four stages of sampling--area sampling; institution sampling; student sampling; and parent sampling. The 59,886 students who were eligible for participation in the NPSAS were attending eligible institutions on or about October 15, 1986. Project management is discussed, with a description of data collection and update. Chapters are devoted to the student survey and the parent survey. File creation and data analysis are described, and a chapter reviews weighting and variance estimation for the survey data. The size and complexity of the study required methodological innovations, some of which are the basis for recommendations for future studies growing from the experience of the NPSAS. Eight figures, 21 tables, and 9 exhibits supplement the report. Four  appendixes contain: NPSAS data collection instruments; NPSAS measurement task reports; NPSAS student survey food and housing expenditure flags; and imputation for records abstract file. (SLD)",

The range varies from a low of 21.4 percent to a high of 45.9 percent. Financial data were analyzed from the survey responses of 110 of Wisconsin's 431 districts. The reasons for the average proportion spent on teachers and the great differences among districts are not clear. Substantial variations across districts in costs per pupil, number of pupils per classroom, and average teacher compensation each play a role, but there is no consistent pattern among them. Districts have made choices in each variable that affect the outcome, but the districts are unlikely to have considered these allocation decisions with the classroom teacher in mind. The  amount spent on classroom teachers is a fundamental question for parents, citizens, and school districts. Therefore, the State Department of Public Instruction (DPI) should collect and analyze such financial data on a regular basis and develop a modified reporting form so that citizens in each district can better understand where specifically money is spent and why the relative expenditures in a given district vary from those of other districts. Two case studies illustrate the detailed expenditure differences between Shorewood, a suburban Milwaukee district, and Fall River, a small rural district. Statistical data are included on one map, three graphs, and nine tables.

The following general findings are discussed: (1) statewide, most citizens do not believe that the quality of education is excellent or that students today receive as good an education as they did, and in  Milwaukee, 72 percent of the residents view the quality of education as poor; (2) most respondents believe that teachers and administrators should be accountable for the quality of education, and urban, poor, and minority respondents strongly support a voucher system that would allow parents to choose their child's school; (3) special education programs are strongly supported, but there is disagreement between the elderly and blacks, urban residents, younger people, and women over child care programs; (4) while 33 percent of the respondents felt that too little was spent on public education, approximately half opposed higher taxes in their communities and would prefer to shift the tax burden to the state.

The following topics are covered: (1) why it is desirable for Great Britain to be a pluralistic society; (2) how far the needs of minority communities can be accommodated without threatening British status quo; (3) what happens in other countries; and (4) what lessons can be learned from these experiences. The major political and intellectual impediments to more judicious consideration of the available policies of cultural diversity in contemporary British society are explored. The meaning of cultural diversity is discussed and then applied to the situation in Great Britain. Political opportunists, both antiracist activists and defenders of a more limited acknowledgement of cultural diversity, are criticized, as is  organized religion. The extent to which Great Britain can become structurally pluralistic is discussed. (JS)",

Major objectives were to enhance the core instructional program, to provide parents with an active partnership experience in their children's education, and to finalize the teaching staff. Evaluation was based on a comparison of enrollment and staffing in the magnet schools with non-magnet schools and the district as a whole, and on analysis of a survey measuring teacher satisfaction at the magnets. The following major findings are reported: (1) enrollment in the magnets was below capacity; (2) enrollment by sex at the magnets was comparable to the district proportions, but  minority student enrollments were below the districtwide average; (3) the average daily attendance rate for the magnets was below target; (4) the discipline rate for the magnets was less than half that for the district; (5) performance on districtwide tests by magnet students was not significantly better than for non-magnets; (6) only one magnet parent-teacher association had an acceptable membership level; (7) Parent Conference Day attendance levels were not acceptable at any magnet; (8) all magnet teachers were state-certified and had training and experience in appropriate curricular areas; (9) two of the magnets did not have acceptable percentages of minority group teachers on their staffs; (10) three of the magnets did not appear to have enough teachers interested in teaching students  with a wide range of achievement levels or participating in curriculum development, implementation and evaluation.

The goal of SIP, an effective schools project, is to improve the academic achievement of students' basic skills and to lessen the disparity between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. The Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS) at grades 2-8 and the Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT) at grade 1 were administered as a pretest and a posttest to 8,600 students in 33 schools. The following major findings are reported: (1) increases in reading comprehension achievement were slightly greater than  expected; (2) increases in mathematics computation achievement were substantial, with 29.1 percent more of the students at grade level on the posttest than on the pretest; (3) low income students scored consistently lower than other students during the 7 years of the program; and (4) overall patterns of increases in student achievement have been consistent for the 7 years of the program.

Chapter 2, \"Determinants and Outcomes of Curriculum Tracking in Public and Private Schools,\" reports on how tracking favors advantaged and white students but locks lower track students into an unchallenging curriculum that limits later academic pursuits and produces deleterious psychological effects such as decreased satisfaction  with school, lower self-esteem, and lower educational aspirations. Chapter 3, \"The Role of Child, Parent, and Teacher Beliefs in Motivational Factors in Children's Learning,\" reports that children whose families and teachers strongly value effort and personal responsibility are more apt to develop the discipline needed to persevere in the face of educational difficulties, while students whose peers disparage academic achievement have more obstacles to overcome in the effort to succeed in school. Chapter 4, \"Middle School Education as the Critical Link in Dropout Prevention,\" cites studies demonstrating the importance of a nurturing, supportive middle school environment to dropout prevention.

About 30 percent of the present school population is estimated to be at risk of failure, and demographic projections predict a dramatic increase in the poor and minority school-age populations that largely comprise this group. This document comprises a review of the demographic factors associated with educational disadvantage and school failure, the scope and nature of problem behaviors associated with school failure, and educational programs and practices that appear to be effective in increasing the cognitive development of high risk students.  The following predictors of school failure are discussed: (1) poverty status; (2) race and ethnicity; (3) family and household characteristics; (4) parent education; and (5) language minority status. The following problem behaviors of high risk youth are discussed: (1) truancy; (2) grade retention; (3) school suspension; (4) dropping out; (5) drug and alcohol abuse; (6) teenage pregnancy; and (7) teenage childbearing. The following effective educational strategies for high risk students are discussed: (1) types of school-based compensatory education programs and extended day/year programs; (2) some examples of school-wide reform and community-based approaches; (3) parent participation; and (4) instructional techniques. Further research would benefit from attention to definition and  measurement of risk factors, and from the use of ethnographic research methods. A list of 178 references is appended. (FMW)",

The studies demonstrate that a wide range of educational, familial, and social influences can either put children at risk of educational failure early in their lives or help them overcome their disadvantages later in their school careers. No single aspect seems to explain a child's achievement, and several of the studies even contradict the findings of others. Studies are arranged in three sections that reflect the influences of school, home, and society in general on a child's educational experiences. Several authors are represented by different papers in more than one category. Recent research is  emphasized, but some seminal studies on at-risk children that were conducted a decade or more ago are also included. Most studies are dated between 1982 and 1989. (Author/FMW)",

        "description":"This document offers a detailed description of the dynamics involved in the choice of an independent neighborhood school. These primarily urban schools are an expression of cultural power and identity among minority groups who wish to ensure access to opportunities for academic achievement for their children and also to control the content and context of their children's education. Information was analyzed from the following sources: (1) telephone interviews with 220 school administrators; (2) a survey of 211 schools; (3) a survey of a sample of parents of students from each school; and (4) interviews with 35 families selected from 10 different schools. The following major findings are reported: (1) 221 schools serve about 12,000 students, most of whom live in urban areas; (2)  most are elementary schools, and enrollment averages between 100 and 149 students; (3) approximately one-half are religious; (4) most enroll more than 80 percent black students and their curricula stress affirmation of the racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds of their students; (5) schools are characterized by operational autonomy and dependence on tuition; (6) 87 percent of the students' families earn annual incomes of less than $49,000, 57 percent earn less than $30,000, and 24 percent earn less than $15,000; (7) most families live within three miles of the school; and (8) educational environment and quality of the educational program were most frequently cited reasons for choosing the school, but cultural and religious affiliation and low tuition were also cited. Statistical data  are included on five graphs and 15 tables. The following materials are appended: (1) the school data form and suggestions for telephone surveyors; (2) the school survey questionnaire; (3) a letter to schools soliciting cooperation; (4) the parent survey questionnaire; and (5) the parent, administrator, teacher, and student interview questions.

        "description":"One very active approach that school personnel can employ to help at-risk students to successfully complete school is to maximize the natural parent support system as early as possible. Parent training programs generally adhere to one of the following models: (1) the parent-as-teacher model, which trains parents to use behavior management techniques and assist their children to learn interpersonal, communication, and academic skills; (2) the mixed model, which trains parents to identify and access community resources to meet specific and unique family needs; and (3) the parent-as-trainer model, which incorporates features of the other models and trains parents to train other parents. Three Lehman College projects involving parent training, the Parent Training Program (1983-86),  the Science and Technology Entry Program (STEP), and the College Discovery and Development Program (CDDP), are described. The following parent skill needs are highlighted: (1) communicating with their children; (2) setting realistic academic goals, including collaboration with school personnel; (3) advocating for their children in the school system; (4) disciplining and setting limits at home, including teaching children to evaluate their own behavior; and (5) supporting, maintaining, and extending the academic program to the home environment. The pivotal roles of teachers and guidance personnel as parent trainers are discussed in light of recent research. A list of nine references is appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"Utilizing specialized classroom strategies to foster greater social acceptance of mainstreamed learning disabled students may be more efficient than having school personnel constantly involved in resolving student-to-student conflicts and assuaging hurt student feelings. Learning disabled students assigned to mainstream classes often present serious social skill deficits which impede their social acceptance by their non-disabled peers. Skill deficits can be caused by the following factors: (1) perceptual and linguistic processing deficits; (2) non-verbal ingratiating behavior deficits; (3) dysfunctional patterns of family relationships; (4) failure-laden prior school history; and (5) differential treatment in the mainstream environment by teachers and peers. The following  strategies for use by regular classroom teachers and personnel are discussed: (1) manipulation of antecedent events and use of cooperative goal structures; (2) behavior modification, including reinforcement and group contingency management; (3) cognitive and/or instructional strategies, including description, modeling, rehearsal, and feedback; and (4) self-evaluation procedures.

The study involved observing and interviewing 59 families of a group of higher achieving and lower achieving fifth and sixth grade students of Puerto Rican descent residing in southeastern urban Pennsylvania. The following factors that may affect a child's achievement are discussed: (1) the child's degree of language proficiency as well as the everyday functional distribution of language; (2) the parents' educational aspirations for their child and the comparison of this measure to the child's chosen vocation; and (3) the levels of parental controlling strategies. Mini-case studies are presented to illustrate the differing family life situations. The results indicate that in the  higher achievers' homes both Spanish and English are spoken, the parents always know the whereabouts of their child, and they have higher expectations for their child's educational achievement. In the homes of lower achievers Spanish is the preferred language, the parents had lower expectations of educational achievement, and they were either more permissive or extremely restrictive with their children. Structural variables such as socioeconomic status were less important than environmental factors in predicting academic achievement. Twenty-three references are included, along with three tables.

The primary purpose of the project was to help disruptive pupils make a positive adjustment to elements that interfere with their success in school. One objective of the project was to have the HSCA serve as a liaison to the home, school, and community to promote understanding and provide assistance for the pupils' adjustment to the school environment. Another main objective was to have 50 percent of the selected pupils show a more positive attitude toward teachers, education, and school behavior, and to demonstrate positive adjustment to those elements in their lives that interfere with school  success. The program was evaluated by using data from the following sources: (1) Demos D Scale; (2) Pupil Entry Information Sheet; (3) Pupil Census Form; (4) Pupil Questionnaire; (5) Professional Staff Survey; and (6) HSCA Log Sheet. The data indicate that the project was successful in helping pupils make some positive adjustments to the disruptive elements in their lives. One reference is included, along with 16 tables.

Preschool children attend day care on site. The adults participate in a varied program that includes academic classes, life skills classes, job readiness training, and vocational training. Students attend classes 4 days per week, allowing them a business day to visit the social service agencies or to go to the clinics. Staff members use the time for planning and developing programs, visiting clients at centers, and for needed rest and relaxation. Focused interviews were conducted with seven participants after the project had been in  operation for 6 months. (It is now in its second full year of operation.) The interviews, reported through quotations from participants, showed that homelessness has many causes, most stemming from physical and emotional neglect in childhood. The participants suffered from low self-esteem and lack of a feeling of belonging, which prevented them from making conscious, rational, future-oriented decisions for themselves. The WORTH project attempted most of all to raise self-esteem and to get participants to think of their own and their children's futures, especially in terms of education. At the time of the study, the project seemed to be succeeding. (KC)",

Child care, transportation, and food service were provided to make participation in the training program possible. Of the 264 individuals who entered Project WORTH, 132 actually participated in the training. Possible reasons for nonparticipation include the fact that no stipends were offered, no evening vocational classes were offered, no child care or transportation was available to those who participated in the evening classes, and the length of the training program. Forty-two students enrolled in General Educational Development (GED) preparation, and 11  obtained the GED by the end of the project year. Seven of the 11 people who received the GED were placed in jobs, and 5 of the 7 were still on the job after 13 weeks. Of the 42 people placed in jobs by the project, 24 retained their jobs after 13 weeks. Almost twice as many females were enrolled in the program as males and almost twice as many of the participants were white, compared to black.

        "description":"Performance-based policy in postsecondary vocational education and employment training programs has two major goals. First, it seeks to increase the basic and job-specific skills needed by program participants to perform effectively in occupations related to training. Second, it aims to stimulate debate over what the appropriate outcomes for vocational education and employment training programs are, while freeing program providers to determine how such aims can best be achieved. For performance-based policy to be effective, it must meet four requirements: (1) it must be possible to define desired outcomes clearly; (2) it must be possible to measure these outcomes accurately and efficiently; (3) measures of performance must affect levels of funding; and (4) useful information on  outcomes must be available for consumers and policymakers. Research has demonstrated that it is possible to meet these four requirements. Policy implications for crafting a performance-based approach to vocational education and employment training policy include the following: (1) it is important to restate the primary goal of adopting a performance-based orientation; (2) state policy should require the adoption of multiple definitions of performance; and (3) in linking funding to performance, the state needs to consider carefully the differences between employment training and vocational education programs, with performance contracting more appropriate for employment training.

        "description":"The study reported in this document was conducted to identify, describe, and assess the potential of innovative approaches to integrating vocational and academic education as one way of helping students to understand the utility of academic learning. Research activities included case studies of five integrated-curriculum programs in California, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania; a literature review; consultation with experts; and cross-site analysis of integration issues. The study found that innovative efforts to achieve a new relationship and closer alignment between vocational and academic curriculum and instruction appear to be a highly promising trend. Some of the findings are the following: (1) curriculum development and professional development are key activities for  implementing an integrated vocational/academic curriculum; (2) both academic and vocational instructors should be involved from the start; (3) social, intellectual, and physical barriers between the vocational and academic staff must be breached; (4) 5 years is a minimum time to integrate the curricula; (5) curriculum integration efforts should not be focused strictly on &quot;high technology&quot; subjects at the expense of more traditional subjects; and (6) evaluation is weak in most programs, providing only anecdotal evidence of student benefit from curriculum integration. The report concludes that further research is needed but that vocational education can play a strengthened role in an integrated curriculum, especially if state support is provided.

        "description":"Profound changes in the economy and the labor market have an effect on the role of employer-sponsored training in preparing and educating the country's work force. On the demand side of the labor market, these changes include the increase in international trade, the changing economic status of the United States relative to its trading partners, the continuing increase in the role of services in all sectors of the economy, and the diffusion of computers and sophisticated communications equipment. Supply-side developments include the increasing average levels of education and the depletion of reserves of labor, either from rural areas, from among women not engaged in paid labor, or from the relatively large cohorts of young people who can be brought into the economy at low levels.  In many industries, these developments have brought about profound changes in markets, technologies, work organization, and industry structure, which in turn have reshaped human resource strategies and educational training requirements. As a result of the changes in the economy and the labor market, firm-based education will play a more important role in preparing the country's work force than it has in the past. Firms that can successfully integrate work and learning into the ongoing operation of the business will have an important advantage. (41 references.) (KC)",

Previous research on employee training has focused on the impact of training on an individual's success in the labor market. Economists have also studied why employers are more likely to train certain persons than others. This study, on the other hand, uses a unique data base on human resource practices in U.S. businesses (the Columbia Business School Human Resources Survey) to study the variation in the training effort across companies. A simple economic model is used to derive several testable hypotheses about the variables that can explain why some businesses invest more in employee training than others. The role of firm characteristics as well as characteristics of the company's industry are  studied. The model correctly predicted that large businesses, those with high capital-labor ratios, and those with a high proportion of internal promotions were more likely to have formal training programs. In the case of cost, however, the model performed poorly. Further research is needed to obtain alternative measures of the extent of training and its cost-effectiveness in terms of the organization.

The following issues were identified: (1) presently, there is no such thing as a vocational program of studies in the average U.S. high school; (2) vocational students experience different academic course content and lower expectations are held for them than for other students; (3) legislated minimum competencies tend to become maximum goals for vocational students; (4) the purposes of vocational education are too narrowly defined; (5) the policy structure for vocational education is weak at the local level; and (6) closing the gap between academic and  vocational education will require considerable staff development. Strategies for improving the basic competencies of vocational completers include the following: (1) stressing basic competencies in vocational classrooms; (2) encouraging and requiring students pursuing vocational studies to complete higher-level academic courses; (3) raising expectations for vocational completers; (4) revising state and local policies for secondary vocational education; (5) providing students access to new academic courses; (6) using a program of study approach to connect vocational and academic studies; and (7) providing preservice and inservice preparation and certification of vocational and nonvocational teachers.

The public also pays by tax support for many educational programs. However, students often have little information about the effectiveness of these programs in terms of job placement, wage rates, and career potential. Some efforts to determine and disclose these outcomes have been made by Florida and Arizona. These states used Social Security numbers and state unemployment files to follow up on vocational education program completers. Although this method has some deficiencies, it is fairly simple and not too costly. Arizona attempted to do such a study and publish the results. However, missing information such as type of job  obtained, not just employment obtained, undermined the results. Finally, political pressures contributed to the demise of the information disclosure program. It is recommended that future information disclosure efforts take into account the effect of the disclosures on school systems and students and the means of distribution before such a program is undertaken.

        "author":["Butler, Erik Payne"],
        "description":"During the years since 1982 when the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) was passed, program and management practices have evolved in ways quite different from JTPA's much-criticized predecessor, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). The most significant evolution has been the strongly results-driven nature of the program accompanied by the development of formal national, state, and locally administered systems of outcome measures and standards for aggregated program achievement performance standards. Two other practices that have evolved over the several years of full implementation of JTPA have been performance-based contracting and competency-based programming. The performance standard approach has much in its favor, notwithstanding important issues about its  effects on the design of programs and the selection of clients. The performance contracting system may conceal rather than reduce administrative costs, and it may result in serving only those clients easiest to train and place; however, it has merit. Finally, the competency-based program movement has been slower to develop and is harder to evaluate, although it has good points. These three aspects of the JTPA have implications for adult vocational education. JTPA has shown that is possible to establish a program driven by clear, measurable outcomes, and vocational education should move in that direction. At the same time, JTPA could use the training expertise of vocational education. (46 references.) (KC)",

In between, section 1 notes implications of the state and local education reform movement of the 1980s that are relevant for the reform of secondary vocational education, and section 2 describes the proposed model itself. The model recommends that the federal government avoid  direct regulation and instead adopt incentive grants for state governments to engage in broad-scale reform of vocational education under federal guidelines; the establishment of a national task force to develop standards and options regulating course selection, course content, indicators of performance, access of special groups, and governance; and establishment of a new agency with authority over the incentive grants and capable of making substantive judgments, under guidelines, about educational quality.

Data were collected from officials and staff at state agencies that administer vocational educational programs in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas. Among the findings reported are that state agencies have not selected the LEP programs (or any other program) as a statewide priority; local program administrators have no incentive to identify the number of adults with LEP served nor to identify the number in need of services in the future; less than half of funding from the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act is targeted at programs for adults, with the  majority of funding going to secondary-level programs as decided at the state level. Although vocational training services are readily available in most jurisdictions, their requirements for oral English, reading, writing, and math skills result in the exclusion of adults with LEP. English as a second language (ESL) programs are the most frequent service offered to and used by these adults. LEP programs were seldom funded by the Job Training Partnership Act, nor were they the focus of community colleges. The LEP adults were found to need training in occupational skills, basic skills, employability skills, and, while in training, they needed support services such as child care and transportation. Among the barriers to extending training are the lack of precise numbers of adults with LEP,  the lack of coordinated planning among state agencies, the difficulty of finding bilingual teachers, and the lack of strong advocacy leadership groups lobbying for increased services.

        "author":["Manski, Charles F."],
        "description":"Lowering dropout levels would not necessarily make society better off and, consequently, student aid policy should not be evaluated by its effects on dropout. Analysis of the model of postsecondary enrollment and completion developed in this paper results in two striking findings. First, making reduction of dropouts the policy goal yields the perverse conclusion that it would be best to eliminate student aid entirely because eliminating aid would make enrollment less attractive than work and hence reduce the number of students who choose to enroll. The students who choose to work rather than enroll are those with the lowest completion probabilities, so eliminating the aid shifts the composition of those enrolled toward those students with the highest completion probabilities.  Second, a policy that reduces dropout probabilities does indeed lower dropout among those students who would have enrolled in the prepolicy regime; at the same time, however, it also induces new students to enroll. The dropout level rises if the number of induced enrollees who drop out exceeds the gain in completion among existing enrollees. The dropout rate rises if the completion probabilities of induced enrollees are sufficiently lower than those of existing enrollees. Completion subsidies may induce students to choose programs with high pass rates and thus may inhibit good matches between students and careers. The document develops a model elaborating on the idea that completion of schooling is exogenous, applies the model to the study of enrollment and completion, and extends the  analysis to allow for the possibility that completion is partly endogenous. An appendix provides proofs for the two major propositions. Seven references are included. (CML)",

        "description":"This paper summarizes a comparative study of the impact of market and technological changes on human resources in banks and insurance companies in five countries: France, Germany, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. The research was organized around case studies of changes in 12 firms--9 banks and 3 insurance carriers. The paper discusses the findings by focusing on what they might tell about: (1) the changing nature of employer-based training; (2) the distributional implications of the emergence of core-periphery employment structures within firms for those who may benefit or fail to benefit from employer-based training; and (3) the alleged lack of competitiveness of U.S. firms in world markets. Following the introduction, the paper is divided into four major sections. The  first section describes the origins and nature of recent market changes as well as the connection between those changes and technological changes. In the second section, the effect of change on the kind of human resources needed by firms is described, emphasizing the emergence of a new matrix of needed skills. The third section reviews how firms are adjusting to these new needs both by altering the training of their own workers and by reshaping their relationship to the external labor market. The fourth section concludes with a review of current policies and trends that provide lessons for the United States. (KC)",

        "description":"This document identifies and describes the sources of public support for postsecondary vocational training in the United States, including the mix of public assistance that is currently available to economically disadvantaged individuals. Following an introduction, the second section is an overview of the general financing situation. Tables report amounts of assistance for 1988 and the distribution of high school graduates from the classes of 1972 and 1980 entering postsecondary education within 4 years. The third section provides a more detailed description of public support for institutions and programs, describing the distribution of postsecondary credits by field for the class of 1980; the level and the recipients of state and local assistance; and federal appropriations made  under the Higher Education Act, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, and the Job Training Partnership Act. The fourth section describes publicly provided student financial assistance, including the three types of student aid (need-based, merit-based, and aid designed to serve special populations) historically available to postsecondary students. The impact of student financial aid is discussed. The fifth section describes tax subsidies for postsecondary training. It is concluded that while the variety of available subsidies is effective and while there are remarkably few overlaps between programs, there are still four areas that warrant further study. The document concludes with a brief description of these areas. A 19-item bibliography is also provided. (CML)",

Part 1 reviews the public purposes of public vocational education (which are postulated as: to increase individuals' satisfaction at work; to increase the access to employment of underrepresented groups; and to increase the economy's total output of goods and services) and considers how to measure outcomes that indicate whether those purposes are being served. Part 2 describes how the multiple purposes of public vocational education conflict with one another and points out tradeoffs that become necessary when multiple purposes are pursued in a finite span of time. Analytic procedures for evaluating programs with multiple objectives are discussed.  Part 3 discusses cost-benefit considerations in school-based and company-based public vocational education, describes as an example of subsidized on-the-job training a program funded by the California Employment Training Panel and located at New United Motors Manufacturing, Inc., and considers who should pay for public vocational education.

The first part of the paper explores three topics: (1) who wants to know about the earnings of vocational education program leavers and why do they want to know? (2) what problems are encountered in using other available data sources that are not found in working with wage-records data? and (3) what specific data items does the quarterly wage-record source offer? The second part of the paper then examines process issues that are encountered in using the wage-record data. Brief mention is made of complementary data sources that enhance the usefulness of  the wage-record data. The paper concludes that it is only a matter of time before the wage-record data are used and that procedures must be worked out for the most effective and efficient use of the data.

An introduction discusses reasons for the research questions and the reliability of existing reported measures of training. An overview describes the most important data sources which contain self-reported training measures and the limitations of this information. The overview also contains a broad description of who gets trained, by whom, the types of training provided, and estimates of how much training is provided. The determinants of training are taken up in the next section. The determinants investigated include educational attainment, industrial rates of technical  change, labor market experience, race, union membership, and labor market conditions.

        "description":"Overall, federal and state tax codes treat employer investments in human capital more favorably than investment in physical plant and equipment. The most important advantage is that training expenditures can be dispensed immediately, rather than depreciated over time, possibly resulting in a subsidy of 33 percent. In addition, employers who use public institutions to train their workers will rarely have to pay the full cost of these services. Employer-provided training is important for the overall growth of the economy and an important way in which many people acquire more marketable skills. However, there is no strong case for further subsidies to encourage employers to invest more in the work force. The evidence of overall underinvestment in the United States does not imply  that there is underinvestment in human capital acquired on the job. Employers can use contracts to capture the benefits of the training for which they pay. However, employer-provided training rarely compensates for poor education--rather, it is concentrated on employees who are well-educated. Many useful mechanisms for subsidizing employer training of the work force are in place. Most public training institutions are already developing programs to train workers for local businesses and to train economically disadvantaged workers. Because employer training is complementary to basic education, the best way to encourage employers to invest more in the work force is to reduce the number of high school dropouts and to improve the quality of basic education.

        "description":"This document summarizes the conclusions of research papers and participant discussions at a conference on employer-sponsored training in 1988. Following an introduction, the first section offers support for the statement that employers invest heavily in training their best-educated and trained employees. The following are among the conclusions reported: (1) employer-sponsored training accounts for about two-fifths of U.S. investments in human capital; (2) company-sponsored training is complementary to, not a substitute for, investments in academic and problem-solving skills; (3) low income employees are poorly educated and receive little training from employers; (4) nonwhite employees are less likely than white employees to be trained by employers; and (6) women are more likely  to enroll in training programs without employer sponsorship and are less likely to receive training from employers. The second section addresses the statement that employer-sponsored training raises employees' wages and improves their employability more than other forms of training. Among the conclusions reported are the following: (1) whether employers over- or underinvest in training is not known; and (2) trained workers are less likely to quit their jobs. The third section supports the statement that slowing work force growth, expanding trade, and accelerating technological advances are changing the nature of work, the skills required, and the level and type of employers' investments in training. The fourth section considers what is involved in the participants' pledge to promote  employer-sponsored training, strengthen academic and problem-solving skills, use training institutions more effectively, and rethink the postsecondary education and training system for the disadvantaged. The document concludes with 15 unanswered questions that suggest further research. (CML)",

Research procedures included a literature review, an analysis of 1980 U.S. census data, and projections of the population. Two measures, constructed from census data to assist in the analysis, were used to categorize individuals as either limited English-proficient or as English-proficient and also to categorize them by poverty status. The following are among the findings reported: (1) the flow of immigrants has grown steadily since 1965 until now it is almost as high as it was in the 1900s, with the most recent  immigrants being less educated and skilled than those who entered 15-20 years ago; (2) the number of persons with LEP aged 16-64 was estimated to be 6.8 million in 1980, which is about 4 percent of the U.S. population; (3) their number is projected to be 11.6 million by 1990 and about 17.4 million by 2000; (4) a projected 5.5 million could require services in 1990 and 8 million could need them by 2000; (5) over half of the adults with LEP speak Spanish; (6) the likelihood of becoming proficient in English is highest within 10 years after arriving in the United States; and (7) over 70 percent of the adults with LEP living below the poverty level in 2000 will be Hispanics.

The role of nonprofit organizations is discussed, using information from 15 major organizations. The pivotal role of the federal Job  Training Partnership Act programs is examined closely. The analysis includes a look at the representation of disadvantaged groups in these programs, the kinds of training offered, the level of funding, and placement-earnings outcomes. The concluding section offers preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of these work-related programs in fostering integration of disadvantaged youths into the labor market.

The four conditions require that: (1) it must be possible to specify the desired outcomes precisely and unambiguously; (2) these outcomes must be easily, accurately, and fairly measured; (3) performance must be tied directly to funding so that success is rewarded or failure penalized; and (4) information on outcomes must be disclosed to consumers and policy makers to improve choices and decision making. The first of the report's five chapters explains why performance-based policy seems desirable at this time. The second chapter addresses issues surrounding definition and measurement of performance in  postsecondary vocational education, covering labor market outcomes, learning outcomes, and access to education outcomes. Chapter 3 concerns how performance can be linked to funding, discussing performance contracting, performance-based funds allocation formulas, and performance-based student financial aid, and offering guidelines for federal vocational education policy. Chapter 4 explains information disclosure for potential consumers of postsecondary education, including the benefits and costs of disclosing more information, the necessary conditions for effective disclosure, and Arizona's experience with disclosure. Chapter 5 considers how to introduce performance funding into the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act and discusses several objections that proponents of the changes are  likely to confront.

The case studies were conducted in three communities in each of nine states. The first of the report's six chapters gives an overview of vocational education and the role of the federal government. The purposes of the study are also described in this chapter. Chapter 2 gives a more detailed description of vocational education, focusing on the role of the state and of local urban, rural, and suburban communities. Chapter 3 describes state initiatives, access of institutions to Perkins funds, funds for special populations and program improvement, state action on specialized provisions, intergovernmental relations, and  the influence of state policy on local practice. Chapter 4 addresses the funding of vocational education for special populations in both secondary and postsecondary education. Among the topics covered is factors that affect access of special populations to institutions offering vocational education. Chapter 5 describes program improvement and change in vocational education. Chapter 6 offers conclusions and implications regarding the legislation and special populations, program improvement, special Perkins issues, and the state role in the administration of the Perkins Act. An appendix contains methodological information regarding the study, including information on sampling, respondents, data collection, and data analysis procedures. (CML)",

        "description":"A study examined the circumstances underlying the school-to-work transition problems of disadvantaged youth and strategies that school systems in Detroit, Pensacola (Florida), New Castle (Indiana), and Pittsburgh have adopted to address these problems. Among the problems studied were lack of information about jobs and careers, too few role models in good jobs, lack of the skills and attitudes needed in the workplace, inadequate access to high quality vocational education programs, employers' negative perceptions and attitudes, and poor labor market conditions for youth. The districts studied exhibited important differences in their circumstances, priorities, and methods for assisting the transition of disadvantaged youth. The study's analysis indicates that program components  play key roles in encouraging the creation of employer linkages with disadvantaged youth. Those components are: early intervention; the availability of tutors, mentors, and advocates; supervised work experience; and placement assistance. The study recommends a new federal policy on improving employer linkages with disadvantaged students by expanding local and state activities in each of these service components. The following changes in the Perkins Act are recommended: (1) a statement endorsing the development of better links between disadvantaged youth and employers; (2) language authorizing demonstrations of approaches likely to promote such linkages; and (3) establishment of a new set of required services to disadvantaged youth that are separate from the services required for  handicapped youth.

        "description":"A study examined the way Japanese schools help their students find jobs and considered whether those aspects that seem to account for their success would be desirable and applicable in the United States. Hiring occurs in a three-step process in Japan. First, Japanese employers assign a certain number of jobs to a high school, depending on their relationship with the school. Second, school staff select students to nominate for these jobs. Third, employers interview nominees and make final selections. That third step is very important in the United States but is the least important of the steps in Japan, where 81 percent of the applicants are hired when they are first nominated and, of those rejected, 85 percent are hired by the second firm for which they are nominated. Students  essentially compete academically for jobs, since grades are the primary determinant of whether a student receives a nomination from school staff. In cases where schools fail to send them qualified workers, employers stop offering jobs through that school. Two advantages of the Japanese system are that employers have a clear picture of the grades their potential employees received and the students have a good incentive for keeping their grades up. In the United States it appears that job placement programs can improve work entry but the benefits are not long lasting and do not improve wage rates or job quality. The counselors and other staff at many public high schools in the United States are ambivalent about whether it is to their students' and the public's advantage to build strong  links with businesses. A great deal more research should be conducted to determine whether the Japanese system of job placement would work in the United States. (A 46-item bibliography concludes the document.) (CML)",

        "description":"Arguing that educational disadvantage, underachievement, and dropping out are problems that originate with schools as well as students, this document describes the Work and Learning Center in Madison, Wisconsin, that was designed to meet the needs of high school dropouts. The first section gives disadvantaged students' perspectives on the school social environment, the high school curriculum, high school completion, and work. Included are brief descriptions of relevant research findings that contribute to a theoretical framework that can guide educational planning in this area. The second section describes the Madison Work and Learning Center (WLC), begun in 1977 for severely disadvantaged students and dropouts. The section contains information on the social environment of the  WLC, the WLC's graduation requirements, and community-based vocational education in the WLC's curriculum. The third section discusses barriers to effective educational planning for dropouts and potential dropouts, including a fragmented approach to school reform, the existing social dynamics of high schools, centralized curriculum planning and standards, and prerequisite courses for community-based training. A summary lists four common characteristics of successful programs such as the WLC: small (60-100) number of students; teachers' belief that they can be creative and inventive in responding to students' needs; teachers' sense of program &quot;ownership&quot;; and a cross-disciplinary team of teachers that fosters collegial relationships. The summary also encourages readers to imagine large high  schools developing schools-within-schools that have these identified characteristics and attracting students from among those who would otherwise drop out.

        "description":"Analysis was made of financial aid to postsecondary vocational education students, using data from two primary sources, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (1986) and High School and Beyond (1980-84). The study found that most financial aid subsidizes students in four-year institutions. However, two-year public schools, which account for 80 percent of all vocational enrollments, received more than $1 billion in direct revenues from federal sources in 1986-87 and more than $7.6 billion in direct revenues from state and local sources. Federal vocational aid increases access to vocational education for economically and educationally disadvantaged students, handicapped students, and other target groups. Most vocational students were enrolled in relatively inexpensive  schools. Most of the direct costs to aid recipients of vocational education were covered by financial aid. Students enrolled in two-year public schools were less likely than students enrolled in the other institutions to receive financial aid. Vocational students were especially dependent on federal financial aid and on loans. Receipt of financial aid appears to be related to better persistence and higher rates of completion in postsecondary vocational education. However, the study also notes that financial aid does not direct students into the technologically more advanced fields that may hold the jobs of the future; rather, that decision is left to individual student choice. (The document includes 50 tables and figures; appendices include a description of federal financial aid programs,  tables showing regression analysis results, a classification of postsecondary education courses, and technical notes.)

The study showed that between 1969 and 1987, public high school graduates consistently earned more high school credits on average than had the graduates of prior years. During the 18 years, there have been two distinct trends in course-taking patterns in the academic curriculum. Students tended to earn a relatively high number of academic credits in 1969; the number of credits  then declined, to a low in 1979-82, and then began to increase again, reaching the highest level in 1987. The increase since 1979 occurred mostly in mathematics and science courses, whereas foreign languages and social studies declined. Asian student earned more academic credits than any other racial/ethnic group. Participation in the vocational curriculum by high school graduates was almost universal between 1969 and 1987. The average number of credits in vocational education by high school graduates increased rapidly between 1969 and 1975-78, peaked in 1979-82, and then declined slightly through 1987. However, graduates still completed more vocational credits in 1987 than in 1969. (Twenty-six tables, 19 figures, and an appendix containing technical notes are included in this report.)  (KC)",

        "description":"The Secondary School Taxonomy (SST) was developed as part of an analysis of the high school course-taking behavior of high school graduates between 1969 and 1987. Based on high school transcripts, it is intended to answer questions about secondary vocational education, such as: (1) who took vocational education and how much did they take?; (2) what was the relationship between vocational enrollment and enrollment in the academic curriculum?; (3) did patterns of participation change over time?; (4) have recent state educational reforms had a measurable effect on vocational enrollments?; and (5) have Congressional vocational education policy objectives been achieved with respect to access and equity? The SST contains four main curriculum divisions: academic, vocational,  personal/other, and special education. The academic courses are divided into six main subject areas: mathematics, science, English, social studies, fine arts, and foreign languages. Within each of these categories, distinctions are made between topical concentrations, and when possible, between levels of course work. The vocational curriculum is divided into three groups by the type of preparation offered: consumer and homemaking education; general labor market preparation; and specific labor market preparation. They are arranged in seven major vocational fields by the taxonomy: agriculture and renewable resources; business; marketing; health; occupational home economics and services; trade and industrial; and technical and communications. A report preceding the taxonomy describes the  overall format of the SST, outlines its development, and details the categories included in it. Appendixes include taxonomies for four other data sets: the National Assessment of Educational Progess; High School and Beyond (1982); National Longitudinal Survey Youth Cohort (1975-82); and the Educational Testing Service's Study of Academic Prediction and Growth (1969).

Methodology included review of recent research, consultation with a panel of experts, preparation of detailed case studies based on site visits to seven high schools, and analysis of issues relevant to the implementation of the programs elsewhere. The schools studied were the following: Washington High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Fridley High School, Fridley, Minnesota; High School Academies, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Walter Biddle Saul High School of  Agricultural Sciences, Philadelphia; A. Philip Randolph Skills Center, Philadelphia; Wright Vocational Cooperative Center, Buffalo, Minnesota; and Woodland Cooperative Center, Staples, Minnesota. Among the chief findings were the following characteristics of exemplary programs: (1) clear and uniform understanding among administrators, teachers, parents, and students concerning the goals of vocational education; (2) consistent attention to the development of student self-esteem; (3) strong programs of school leadership; (4) inclusion of employability skills development in the curriculum; (5) presence of a strong cooperative education component; and (6) implementation of strategies to provide effective programs for special needs students. There is some evidence that these models can be  adapted and implemented in other vocational education programs. (The case studies and 67 references are included in the report.) (KC)",

Data examined include the following: (1) initial enrollments in higher education; (2) fields of study in postsecondary education; (3) progress through institutions of higher education and the tendency to drop out; (4) completing credentials; (5) the special problems of dropout and completion of minority students; (6) the nature of transfers among institutions; (7) course enrollments and credits earned by noncompleters; (8) late entrants into higher education; (9) employment during postsecondary education; (10) postsecondary vocational institutions compared; and (11) vocational students in  postsecondary education. The study found that although access to postsecondary education has expanded, some of the increased enrollment may serve no purpose if students are &quot;milling around&quot; without clear goals. However, the study concludes that it is still unclear how to interpret many of these results--are students who fail to complete credentials really dropouts, are they experimenters who have learned that higher education is not for them, or have they learned what they needed for employment?

        "description":"This document examines the options for federal financing of postsecondary vocational education. The first section describes the federal funds that now support public vocational education, emphasizing funds distributed to institutions through the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act and funds distributed to students via financial aid. The second section raises the question of what federal policy ought to accomplish, given the fact that federal funding is now and probably will continue to be a very small fraction of total support for public vocational education. The third section considers a series of potential federal goals for public vocational education and then analyzes the pros and cons of different ways of achieving them. The fourth section outlines several different ways  in which the division of funds between the secondary and postsecondary levels can be determined. The fifth section presents several models of what federal programs are and can be and suggests federal approaches that are different from those embodied in the Perkins Act. (CML)",

Some of the stories were written in the context of their participation in the LaSalle Adult Learning Project. Some come from interviews that were then transcribed and edited into a form that could most easily be shared with other adult learners. A number of themes around employment and unemployment run through the variety of experiences recounted by the four people. Each remembers moments in his or her personal history when being out of work was a positive step toward something better. Issues of self-respect and personal development are raised: questions of what it means to pick up roots in the course of seeking employment; to say no to a dangerous or disrespectful work situation; to take  more responsibility on the job; to work for oneself. Stories are illustrated with photographs. (KC)",

The texts have been chosen thematically, rather than by skill level. The materials are designed for group work--oral reading and discussion. Readings focus on housing repairs, court procedures, eviction, leases, organizing public housing tenants, tenant management, organizing the homeless, gentrification, and black urban development, especially in the Philadelphia area. The curriculum guide offers examples of how various kinds of texts can be used for teaching adult basic education. The use of poetry, fiction, interviews, newspaper articles, and technical consumer information is modeled. Appendixes list resources on housing and  resources on South Africa and provide a housing code checklist, guidelines for grievance procedures, and sample letters. (KC)",

The document describes the target population and supportive activities offered as a collaborative effort by staff members from JTPA, Public Aid/Project Chance, the Illinois Department of Rehabilitative Services, and Catholic Social Services; these activities included self-improvement sessions, the loan of clothing suitable for wearing to job interviews, a newsletter, and a fitness club.  By December 1989, 80 disabled students had participated in the program, been referred to the employment development specialist on staff, or been referred to a program more appropriate from them.

        "description":"In fiscal year 1987, approximately 12,000 inmates, or 29 percent of the 44,000 incarcerated adults at least 18 years old, enrolled in adult basic education (ABE) programs. Six thousand five hundred completed their programs. Another 3,500 enrolled in the General Educational Development (GED) program and 2,800 received diplomas. All inmates who enter the federal prison system must take the Adult Basic Level Examination (ABLE). All inmates whose score on any subtest is below the 8.0 grade level must enter ABE for 90 days. During that time, they must attend at least 2 hours per day, unless they have only one subtest to remediate. Inmates who complete the 90-day period may choose to drop out of school. However, only inmates who have obtained their ABE credential can be paid more than  entry-level pay grades in any industry or institutional work detail. The teaching staff encourage inmates to remain in school until they finish. Handicapped learners are exempted from the 8.0 grade-level performance requirement for promotion and can instead be promoted after demonstrating sustained effort, remaining in school to work to their potential for an agreed-upon amount of time, and receiving a recommendation from their work supervisor. The ABE program receives top priority within the school and is one of only two mandatory programs within the Bureau of Prisons. The other mandatory program is work. The total budget for all education programs, including ABE, GED, vocational training, recreation, postsecondary, social education, and leisure time is approximately $25 million. That  includes salaries, contracts, equipment, and operating costs. (The document also includes answers to such questions as the following: Who is learning to read and how is that measured? How are teachers trained to assess student progress? What has been the biggest problem with assessment procedures? and What is best for motivating students? Also included are two references.) (CML)",

Students at this level receive instruction in one of four environments: adult basic education classes at an education center or at an apartment complex, or workplace literacy classes at one of two sites. The average student receives 46 hours of reading instruction per semester (10 weeks), with workplace students receiving 56 hours over 8 weeks. The mean grade-level gain for students after about 50 hours of instruction is approximately 1.8 years, although individuals vary considerably, with those completing a  semester usually gaining 2-3 years of growth. Those who stay for a school year or longer can achieve as much as 4 years of growth. Students are taught by a diagnostic-prescriptive model, with continuous monitoring and refinement of students' programs based on current assessment. The most beneficial aspects of this process have been the use of standardized testing and student intake interviews. The program continues to emphasize the diagnostic-prescriptive method and plans to add diagnosis of learning disabilities. (KC)",

Use of microcomputers is particularly appropriate, because such use can impart knowledge as well as develop skills. Three philosophies of computer/software instruction in technical education can be identified: (1) problem-solving procedures in which students identify and attempt to solve problems; (2) measurement-driven instruction (MDI) with its stress upon specific predetermined objectives for student attainment; and (3) decision-making strategies with learners selecting content to acquire in a rather open-ended environment. The problem-solving strategy is recommended, because problem solving is salient in the school curriculum as well as in life. MDI  strategies could use subject matter acquired by students to solve life-like problems. Decision-making approaches might well emphasize using software content to solve problems. Thus, decision-making approaches may advocate students choosing, from among alternatives, problems to solve. (15 references.) (KC)",

These employers have recognized the problems of workers with poor literacy and deficient basic skills, and they have chosen to attack the problem by providing educational opportunities at their worksites. Almost 400 employees participated in various types of adult basic education (ABE) classes supported with federal funds. Of these, about 54 percent were taking high school equivalency programs, 23 percent were in ABE classes, 18 percent were in English-as-a-Second Language (ESL) classes, and about 6 percent were studying  for their General Educational Development (GED) diploma. Teachers used any materials they found appropriate, and also developed materials specific to some worksites. The classes initially ran for 40 hours. The project facilitator and counselors regularly visited classes to make students aware of help available. After 40 hours, some classes stopped because they had attained their goals, while others continued enthusiastically and also added new students.

The manual is intended for programs and organizations in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. RRX transitional services include any short-term training activities and/or related services that promote the transition of persons with disabilities to competitive working life and may be targeted to persons with a wide range of disabilities, such as learning disabilities, mental retardation, mental illness, and/or physical disabilities. Services may be offered through secondary or postsecondary schools or  community-based programs and facilities for adult clients. The manual provides information about the background and purposes of the RRX, identifies the scope of the RRX project, lists the prerequisites and criteria for validation, describes the RRX validation process, identifies 10 critical factors (program goals and objectives, target population, documentation and good recordkeeping, success rate, cost effectiveness, comprehensiveness, evaluation criteria, staffing patterns, transportability, and innovativeness) used in determining exemplary programs, provides information on completing the Information Request Form, and identifies implications for validated programs. A completed sample Information Request Form for transitional services is included. (CML)",

        "description":"In a nation where only about half of high school students go on to 4-year postsecondary institutions, vocational-technical education plays a critical role in preparing thousands of people for their first work experience and in retraining thousands more to take full advantage of new job opportunities. As part of the educational reform movement of the 1980s, vocational-technical education is making significant inroads into restructuring the education delivery system. The second phase of reform has now begun. Of the seven priorities identified at President Bush's &quot;education summit&quot; in September 1989, those for assuring functional literacy and ensuring a level of training necessary to guarantee a competitive work force have particular significance for vocational-technical education.  Over the next few years, vocational-technical education should be: (1) firmly established as an essential ingredient of the nation's human resource development policy through the replication of successful techniques and practices already developed; (2) recognized for the contributions that it has already made to the education reform movement; and (3) benefiting from its role as a full partner in expanding economic opportunity. To establish that role, the U.S. Office of Vocational and Adult Education must do at least four things. It must: (1) make sure vocational education gets recognized for its contributions; (2) continue to recognize that vocational-technical education has extensive interrelationships with other service providers; (3) help business and industry recognize the value of  vocational-technical education in meeting its needs for skilled workers and at the same time continue to help define requirements of a world-class work force; and (4) it must be extremely responsive to the needs of the states where vocational-technical education is administered.

        "description":"A study documented agriculture faculty members' and students' perceptions regarding statements of undergraduate educational mission and objectives. The study involved a stratified random sample of 50 universities that offer undergraduate degree agriculture programs. A purposive sample of faculty members at each was asked to rate the importance of seven objectives, the objectives' attainment by students, and their own and their colleagues' ability to help students achieve the objectives. A random sample of up to 50 graduating senior agriculture students at each university was asked to rate the extent to which they had achieved the objectives and the degree to which the college/school of agriculture activities had help them achieve the objectives. A random sample of nonagriculture  students at each university was asked how they perceived the nature and importance of agriculture, agriculture degrees, and agriculture careers. The following are among the findings reported: (1) faculty agree that all seven of the objectives are important; (2) many faculty lack a mission orientation; (3) few comprehensive assessments of students' attainment of educational objectives are being made; (4) responses from agricultural students indicate that agricultural colleges are contributing significantly to the competency achievements of baccalaureate degree graduates but that many graduates are not receiving a well-rounded undergraduate education; and (5) nonagriculture students seem to equate agriculture with farming and ranching.

The program aims to strengthen the curriculum and to shorten the technology and vocational training process by eliminating duplication of course work. The program will achieve its purpose through the formation of partnerships between secondary and postsecondary technology educators, and the process it will use has the following phases: (1) identification of schools by regional articulation coordinators, assignment of interested administrators to a regional articulation  committee, and selection of technology subject matter areas targeted for articulation; (2) classroom teacher identification of any duplication among courses between levels and development of articulation agreements between schools so that students do not re-learn material in which they are already competent; (3) review of the agreements by representatives of all schools involved; and (4) implementation of the agreements, including informing students, teachers, and counselors that the agreements, which provide for direct credit transfers, advanced placement standings, and/or credit by examination, exist. By December 1989, 19 agreements had been implemented for drafting, 42 for electronics and electricity, 8 for computers, and 13 for welding programs.

To move up through the levels of instructor, senior instructor, and master instructor, persons must complete the Professional Development Institute during the first year of teaching, demonstrate competence in varying numbers of performance-based instructor education program modules, attend professional meetings, become active in community service projects, complete a bachelor's degree, accumulate continuing education units (CEUs), and teach at the postsecondary level. To remain at the level of master instructor, one must accumulate an additional 4 CEUs every 8 years. (CML)",

        "description":"A number of factors have led to the crisis of work force unpreparedness that the United States now faces, including revolutionary changes that mean businesses now succeed on the qualities of their human rather than material resources. Jobs are demanding better reading, writing, and reasoning skills, and mental agility has replaced manual dexterity as a required skill. Yet 70 percent of all high school seniors cannot write a basic letter seeking employment. The work force is growing at the slowest rate in 40 years, and as a result an increasing number of businesses are facing a shortage of skilled workers. These problems and challenges are so big that no single agency, no single individual, no single group can solve them on its own. The proposed amendments to refocus the Job  Training Partnership Act (JTPA) would redirect funds to the least skilled and most economically disadvantaged citizens, those facing such barriers to employment as basic skills deficiencies, homelessness, teenage parenting, or a poor school record. Each trainee would be assessed for needs, and goals would be set that focus on achievement and growth rather than on filling job slots. The JTPA program could provide job-seeking and job-readiness skills. Vocational programs could provide youth with the technical occupational skills that lead to a whole career field, not just a job. The result would be an integrated, comprehensive system that would turn young lives around and provide employers with a skilled work force. (CML)",

The second section addresses some common concerns about equivalent credit, in a question-and-answer format. Some of the concerns examined include the relationship between equivalent credit and high school graduation requirements; the awarding of equivalent credit versus lowering standards; colleges and equivalent credits; polarization of the teaching staff; curriculum updating and staff development; the at-risk  student; needs for additional space and staff; and recording equivalent credit on transcripts and in course descriptions. In the third section, a model process for setting up an equivalent credit system is outlined. Steps include reviewing local policies and guidelines; beginning with programs for which a strong case for equivalent credit can be built; establishing support groups; building connections between vocational and academic teachers; determining credit possibilities; disseminating information; and monitoring the process. The final section lists 20 references, and appendixes provide information on Alaskan graduation requirements and examples of the system in other areas. (KC)",

Based on six national hearings, the report describes how the system operates from the perspectives of those who run it at the state and local levels. Following an introduction to the problem, the report begins by discussing how the amount of JTPA funds and the formula for distributing them across the nation have affected Hispanics' opportunities for participating in training. The next  section explains how the law's criteria for determining eligibility unintentionally make many economically disadvantaged Hispanics ineligible for Title IIA programs. This section also discusses the documentation required to verify eligibility and how these requirements affect Hispanics' interest in participating. The next two sections turn to decisions made at the state and local level. These sections make two points. First, the presence of Hispanics (or others willing to act as their advocates) in policymaking positions can be critical to the direction the programs take. Second, the ways states and localities implement several of the functions assigned to them by JTPA strongly affect the likelihood that economically disadvantaged Hispanics will enroll. The final section provides  conclusions and recommendations. Appendices contain: (1) a list of the six hearings with names of the witnesses who appeared at the hearings; (2) a discussion of data problems as a possible explanation for Hispanics' underrepresentation; and (3) a description of &quot;The Hispanic Factor&quot; in the performance standards adjustment models of the U.S. Department of Labor.

Each of the centers is staffed by some of the most experienced and nationally recognized cooperative education trainers and administrators. Among the topics on which training is provided are computerizing cooperative education programs, developing a cooperative education program in an academic environment, the benefits of cooperative education for faculty, staff, students, and employers, and the essentials of public relations for cooperative programs.

Chapter 1 describes the system's background. Chapter 2 explains five issues that affected its development, including the fact that literacy providers already had systems in place; the length of time necessary for preparing to collect data; the range of questions about New York City's literacy program needing answers; progress made in integrating the city and state reporting requirements; and the need for keeping student identities confidential. Chapter 3 addresses the system's conceptual framework, including its functions  for tracking, monitoring, conducting research, evaluating, and conducting in-depth investigations. Chapter 4 describes the system's methodology by describing its component parts, including its data sets; forms, documents, and supplements; data collection and entry procedures; and reports that may be generated through the system. Chapter 5 describes the development of the system by displaying by year the input, processing, output, and summaries the system produced from 1984-85 through 1987-88. Appendix A contains sample forms used to enter data into the system and reports generated by the system. Appendix B contains a list of supplemental materials available about the ALIES design. (CML)",

Usable data, collected through two questionnaires, were provided from 78 colleges and universities and from 633 vocational teacher educators. The institutional questionnaire was used to obtain information from institutions that provide preservice vocational teacher education about the characteristics of their institutions, characteristics of their teacher education program, the requirements for student entrance and exit, and the respondents' perspectives on any educational reform taking place at the institution. The teacher questionnaire collected  data from professors of vocational teacher education on their demographic and professional characteristics, occupational experiences, education experiences, time spent on professional activities, future plans in higher education, and courseload and advising duties. In addition, the teachers were asked to describe any recent important changes in vocational teacher education at their institutions. Among other findings, the data indicate that the typical teacher educator is white, male, a full professor, tenured, 49 years old, earning $35,745 for 9 months' employment, and that he earned a doctoral degree in vocational education in vocational education 14 years ago. It was also found that of the 20 universities awarding such degrees, the largest percentage was awarded by Ohio State  University. (The document contains 14 tables and 1 figure.) (CML)",

Data were collected through a review of research and of education-work models; telephone and personal interviews with vocational education administrators, special program directors, Virginia Department of Education staff, and industry representatives; and the examination of nontraditional vocational education programs in the state. Education and industry personnel reviewed and critiqued the first draft of the study's recommendations. The following major recommendations are reported: (1) vocational education should be restructured to include a  culminating, supervised on-the-job educational experience not to exceed 20 hours per week while school is in session for those students likely to enter full-time employment immediately after high school; and (2) scheduling supervised on-the-job experience should be a local decision and should include ample time for students to receive quality work experience. Four supporting recommendations were also made, including one suggesting the provision of a comprehensive program incorporating a vocational education component that begins in middle school for &quot;at-risk&quot; students. (The document contains a 24-item bibliography and two appendices, the first describing nontraditional vocational education work programs in Virigina and the second citing facts and statistics that provide evidence of the  nature of the &quot;at-risk&quot; problem in the schools.)

The first section explains the proposed federal legislation's impact on secondary vocational education, pointing out that it dramatically alters the structure of funding at that level. The second section addresses the proposed legislation's changes in postsecondary vocational education funding and draws attention to the fact that these changes represent a first-time recognition by Congress that the problems of postsecondary vocational education are different from those at the secondary level and that they require different solutions. The third and fourth sections discuss respectively the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards and the issue of national goal setting and performance accountability in education. (CML)",

        "description":"&quot;Autonomy&quot; is an ambiguous term that can denote either the right of adults to manage their own affairs or their actual or potential ability to do so. These various senses of the word are regularly, and often indiscriminately, employed by adult educators. Personal autonomy is probably developed most effectively in a traditional kind of instructional situation, since people who initially lack the confidence or ability to undertake the management of their own education are likely to find the traditional situation a less threatening context in which to learn. A process of education that embodies the principles of individual choice, democratic control, rationality, and respect for persons in a realistic way can help adults to become more self-directing and more self-determining both  in their thinking and in their behavior. However, there is very little scope for compulsion in adult education. Attendance is essentially voluntary and means of punishment or coercion generally do not exist. People who are not already autonomous and independent are unlikely to become so unless they feel they are learning in an environment where the process of personal change and its results will be accepted. Teachers seeking to promote the development of personal autonomy must be ready to challenge and provoke intellectually; to provide sympathetic emotional support; to provide additional educational help, such as basic study skills; and to consider the use of learning contracts.

        "description":"A study was undertaken to determine whether Delaware should attempt to maintain two shared-time area vocational schools or whether the schools should be converted to full-time vocational high schools. A number of state and local officials, including all of the superintendents in Kent and Sussex Counties, were interviewed and documents were reviewed. Among the findings were that the arrangements for operating shared-time vocational-technical schools were not working and enrollments at both vocational-technical schools were down more than 40 percent from peak levels in 1977-78. Factors contributing to the declining enrollments included a general decrease in secondary school enrollments of approximately 20 percent, increased graduation requirements, higher rates of students' failing  required courses, structure of the curriculum, lack of communication and integration between sending schools and area schools, structure of the funding system, transportation conflicts, inadequate attention to extracurricular activities, and incompatible governance structures. The most significant explanation was considered to be the combination of independent governance with a &quot;win/lose&quot; funding system that created competition for students that greatly inhibited cooperation and coordination among districts. It was felt that without forceful state action, enrollments at the shared-time schools would almost certainly continue to decline; however, conversion to full-time schools was not considered a guaranteed improvement.

The enabling behavior of questioning was found to be used in approximately 4 percent of class time, whereas for 80 percent of class time, instructors were exhibiting structuring behavior. Responding behaviors were practiced by the instructors for about 11 percent of total class time. The study concluded that (1) the community college instructors observed are not using the enabling behavior of questioning that &quot;best&quot; stimulates  critical thinking or modeling behaviors that will enhance students' abilities to think critically; (2) the amount of pedagogical course work taken by the teachers did not seem to influence the teachers' use of enabling behavior; and (3) the students thought their instructors were stimulating critical thinking.

The same results probably could be applied to Canada. Career planning skills are not instinctive. Young people and adults need to be taught basic skills they can use in evaluating their needs, identifying their options, and making good career choices. Job changing is thought to cost business and government in Canada about $7.5 billion in costs and lost wages per year. Lost productivity is no doubt the greatest economic cost of inappropriate career decisions. However, Canadian youth receive little help in making  these decisions. Counselors are involved with many other problems besides career planning. A new vision is required, one that sees career planning as a community responsibility, rather than just an educational, or worse, a counselor responsibility. More attention must be paid to the career-related developmental needs of clients across the full spectrum of community service agencies. People must be taught how to locate and process information that has personal relevance. Community goals should be set to reduce school dropout rates, increase productivity of area firms, and increase career awareness. Such programs will ensure brighter futures for the citizens and the communities. (KC)",

        "description":"Based on the assumption that something is fundamentally wrong at its definitional roots about the concept of adult education upon which the profession is organized, this paper identifies seven troubling characteristics of the profession. These characteristics, which stem from failure to root the definition in philosophical foundations, are (1) the claim that adult education preexists its formation as a profession; (2) use of an existing tacit definition of adult education; (3) giving power to third parties with roots outside the profession; (4) loss of social ethics; (5) loss of focus on the person and failure to achieve universality; (6) continuing use of the terms of children's education; and (7) explanations and theories that become ideological and distanced from the concept  of education. It then offers a theory to account for these characteristics and describes a design problem for the invention of a new concept of adult education. The paper suggests a definition of adult education as \"self-education\" as an appropriate response to the design problem, one on which a more substantial profession could be founded. (Author/KC)",

Section 402 is a special program within JTPA that delivers training, employment, education, and support services to migrant and seasonal farmworkers. The survey: (1) documents the various literacy and basic educational programs available to migrant and seasonal farmworkers; (2) examines the level and extent of the programs offered by each grantee; and (3) highlights special literacy initiatives being undertaken by some grantees. The review found that all or some of the 53 Section 402 grantees contacted offer the following literacy-oriented activities: testing aptitude and achievement potential; adult basic education; General  Educational Development (GED) test preparation; English-as-a-Second-Language courses; and other literacy initiatives. The study also found that program grantees feel that they could accomplish more with students if regulations were more flexible and less emphasis was placed on cost of training in each case.

        "description":"Federal legislation, such as the Education Amendments of 1976 and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984, recognizes the urgent national need for vocational programs that adequately serve limited-English-proficient (LEP) persons. In order to meet the need, vocational teacher education programs must be adapted to train preservice teachers to work with LEP persons in vocational education programs. Because requiring additional coursework is undesirable, curricular infusion is regarded as the most effective and realistic method to achieve this. The Bilingual Vocational Instructor Training (BVIT) Train the Trainers Project was conducted to provide inservice training to preservice trainers (vocational teacher educators) to help them infuse LEP-related content into their  existing courses. During the project, content for such courses was identified, and a manual for infusion and adaptation was written. Guidelines were developed for adapting: foundations courses; methods courses; course construction/curriculum planning courses; and special needs courses.

        "description":"The problem of adult illiteracy in Canada is now accepted as socially significant, whether defined in terms of numbers, impact on the economy, or implications for the future. A reasonable estimate would be that one in five Canadian adults has a severe enough problem with reading, writing, or arithmetic that his or her functioning in society is to some degree impaired. Some misgivings have arisen about present treatments of the illiteracy problem: financial resources have not been equitably available to adult basic education and literacy training, major resources have been dedicated to the upper end of the educational spectrum, and there does not seem to be a consistent philosophy for curriculum or program development or for instruction of adults at the literacy level. These  perceptions of needs lead to the argument that the development of more effective literacy training programs and delivery systems must start with the needs and preferences of the students, addressed innovatively. Future programs should take into account the functional, the personal, and the cultural/social reasons for attendance in training, and they should attempt to provide learning opportunities in all of these areas for those who wish them. Finally, effective programs must respect the fact that the learners are adults and therefore must provide choices and be extremely flexible in terms of pace and location of training; in other words, they should treat students as &quot;customers.&quot; (KC)",

The programs operated at the level and pace of each learner. Data were gathered using a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods in order to address the five anticipated results of the project. The anticipated results of the project and whether they were achieved were as follows: (1) the training did attract and maintain the interest of a greater  segment of the target population, as evidenced by enrollment increases in all programs, including typically low-prestige compensatory education programs upon which the computer technology seemed to confer prestige; (2) the training did not produce faster progress in academic training in that there were no differences between the Tests of Adult Basic Education scores of the computer-assisted students and those of Inuit students in other regions who did not have access to CAI; (3) the training did provide job readiness skills, including improved reading and speaking skills, greater awareness of and realism regarding their goals, skill at using software applications programs, and greater writing ability; (4) the training did increase students' chances of obtaining employment, with 46 percent  of graduates employed 6 months after the course ended and the most common reason given for unemployment being the pursuit of more training; and (5) the training did develop an effective new educational model for the North, of which computers will be part.

Visits to 63 randomly selected service delivery areas provided information on 5,500 adult participants, which was included in a database for one complete program year that is projectable to JTPA service delivery areas and program enrollees nationwide. Two significantly different groups of participants and nonparticipants eligible for participation--those who experience less difficulty in the labor market and those who experience more difficulty--were constructed from demographic statistics, employment  data, the results of previous research, expert opinion, and multiple regression analysis on Current Population Survey data. The following major findings are reported: (1) the study found little evidence that service was being targeted to those eligible adults whose demographic characteristics suggest they may have been least ready to obtain employment on their own when they came into the program; (2) the least job-ready group tended to receive less intensive services than those who were more job ready; (3) participants obtained jobs with skill levels similar to the skill level of their training, which may indicate that outcomes could be improved if more people were trained for more highly skilled jobs; and (4) some long-term contracts with employers for excessive on-the-job training  periods may indicate that they were actually receiving wage subsidies.

The qualitative research methodology used in the needs assessments involved framing the problem, gathering data, interpreting it, restating the problem, and cycling through the other processes again to improve reliability and validity. This recycling process occurred several times in each needs assessment. Follow-up interviews were conducted with training personnel in the firms in which the needs assessments initially took place. The second section describes the purposes of  the document, which include reporting on changes in the training staff and financial resources provided, newly assigned training goals, and the perspective toward the takeover of those who are directing the training effort. Section 3 describes incidents associated with unwanted and friendly threatened takeovers and addresses possible implications and questions raised. Section 4 deals with the period of adjustment after the takeover, highlighting changes in function, changes in scope and focus, changes in performance standards, potential problems, and changes in corporate culture. Section 5 explores decisions to be made by the trainer, including whether to act or react. Section 6 poses continuing research questions. Section 7 is a short conclusion. (CML)",

During the year of project operation, 13 General Educational Development (GEDs) diplomas were awarded, and 12 other individuals had begun the GED testing process. Quantitative data showed grade-level increases and GED passing rates significantly greater than those customarily seen in a traditional adult education setting. A monitoring process was found essential to ensure enrollment and ongoing participation with this population. Qualitative information indicated that the teaching philosophy and techniques implemented in this project had a positive effect in changing attitudes and perceptions. (Eleven appendices contain an  instructional preference scale, two graphic explanations of the project's instructional design, a referral form, an education plan form, a weekly progress report, and three charts and a table that report the study's findings.)

Released offenders are either required or encouraged to attend the program by their parole officers. Interviews with 12 program participants, age ranging from 20 to 39--selected so that half of the group was male and half female, half white and half black--were conducted to assess the program and provide input for recommendations for improvement for the second project year. Program participants were generally positive about the teachers, the opportunities to acquire the GED, and their increased self-esteem and ability to think about the future. They, along with their teachers  and the project director, noted that they often lead chaotic lives, going from crisis to crisis, which prevented them from getting the full benefit from the program. Recommendations for strengthening the program included that: (1) attendance be mandatory; (2) judges, correctional officers, and &quot;significant others&quot; of participants be included in receptions and kept aware of participant progress; (3) child care be provided; (4) locations and access be considered; (5) more materials be provided, especially consumables for lower-reading students; (6) a clinical psychologist be hired to help participants solve their immediate problems and make lasting life changes; and (7) a vocational training component be added.

        "description":"The focus of the adult education field is shifting to adult learning. Current trends are the continued development of the concepts of andragogy and self-directed learning, increased emphasis on learning how to learn, and real-life learning. Cognitive psychology is influencing work in adult learning. The concept of intelligence as it relates to adults is moving away from the notion of IQ toward a recognition that intelligence has multiple aspects. Application of the concept of learning style has been hindered by confusion over terminology and lack of appropriate measurement instruments for adults. The teaching of learning strategies to adults tends to emphasize metacognition, memory, and motivation. Critical thinking is becoming more important in an environment complicated by an  information explosion and rapid social and technological change. The influence of the social environment and culture upon learning is also being examined. The goal of learning in the social environment is action, often intended to cause social change. One method increasingly being used is participatory research, the ultimate goal of which is empowerment. Current trends in adult learning research point to a new image of the adult learner as an empowered learner--one who understands the learning process and the social environment and who can respond to the challenges of improving that setting. Adult educators must take a more active stance to meet learner needs for individual development and social reconstruction. The shift of research focus to the adult learner holds potential for mending  the fragmented nature of the field of adult education. (145 references.) (SK)",

        "description":"Learning disabilities among adults are more prevalent than was once believed, although estimates of numbers are difficult to make. Problems faced by adults with LD include difficulties with academic and information processing and adult life adjustment. Many adults with LD exhibit strengths that enable them to compensate for their disabilities and function successfully without supportive services. Key issues in assessment include the following: (1) assessment should be a means of helping the adult live more fully; (2) formal diagnostic tools appropriate for use with adults should be used with caution; and (3) assessment should consider the adult's ability to provide information about strengths, weaknesses, and goals. The following principles guide selection of diagnostic  instruments: (1) consult standard guides to measurement to determine whether test norms apply to adults; (2) read reviews of test reliability and validity; (3) consider whether timed tests are appropriate; and (4) use input from intake interviews to determine a test's relevance for individual goals and needs. Intervention approaches should take into account principles of adult learning. Policy concerns include increasing public and professional awareness; early intervention; training and staff development; a system of interinstitutional coordination of services; funding for assessment, diagnostic, and prescriptive services; and the impact on the family of an adult member with LD. Systematic research on LD causes, assessment, rehabilitation needs, and effectiveness of intervention  approaches is needed. A comprehensive, holistic approach to assisting adults with LD should move away from a deficit focus and shift toward identifying talents, skills, and resources that can aid success in adult life.

        "description":"Adult literacy programs need reliable information about program quality and effectiveness for accountability, improvement of practice, and expansion of knowledge. Evaluation and assessment reflect fundamental beliefs about adult learners, concepts of literacy, and educational settings. Resources for planning program evaluations include surveys, handbooks, instruments, and policy studies. Evaluation issues include the following: (1) program goals and mission are subject to scrutiny and change; (2) data about teaching and learning are essential; (3) expanded outcome measures for learner progress are needed; and (4) the roles of staff, managers, learners, and external evaluators affect the evaluation process and outcomes. Four major approaches to learner assessment are considered:  (1) standardized testing is norm referenced and cost effective; (2) materials-based assessment is commercially available and follows a systems management model; (3) competency-based assessment involves real-life tasks, predetermined performance standards, a continuum of difficulty, and a range of strategies; and (4) participatory assessment allows learners an active role and involves a range of texts, tasks, contexts, and strategies. Evaluation should: (1) be both external and internal; (2) be both formative and summative; (3) involve learners and staff; (4) generate design questions from theory, research, evaluation, and practice; (5) involve critical reflection on program philosophy and goals; (6) give prominence to the processes of teaching and learning; (7) capture a range of learner  and program outcomes; (8) require a variety of longitudinal data collection methods; (9) be integrated with program functions; and (10) be systematic and systemic.

        "description":"School-to-work transition helps at-risk youth secure and maintain employment and an adult life-style. Transition focuses on individual characteristics, training needs, and choices that result in the development of realistic long-range goals and selection of appropriate programs and services. Effective school-to-work transition necessitates a wide array of transition options, articulated services, systematic prescription procedures, and an information tracking system. The following program and service barriers compound the societal barriers faced by at-risk youth: lack of systematic service delivery, lack of case managers, lack of career exploration programs, lack of agency coordination, underuse of parents as resources, and shortage of adult service programs. The unemployment and  underemployment problems of at-risk youth are significant enough to the nation's economy to merit mandating a systematized school-to-work transition process for all at-risk youth. Major policy concerns include lack of an advocated transition model, trained personnel, and longitudinal information about the outcomes of transition processes. Recommendations for improvement include identification and training of case managers, especially for youth with disabilities and limited English proficiency; integration of career development/exploration in middle schools; research on outcomes; funding for the development of a standardized and computerized management information system to improve decision making and provide outcome measures about the cost effectiveness of programs and services.

Each of the eight sessions of the conference opened with experts discussing their respective research projects and electronic technologies: their origins, current status, research implications, lessons learned, and likely future applications. These presentations are summarized: (1) \"'Downstreaming' New Technologies to Older Americans\" (James Gollub); (2) \"Prodigy, a New Electronic-text Information Service\" (Suzanne Biegel); (3) \"Audiotex Services and the Elderly\" (Bruce Kushnick); (4) \"Computers as a Tool Facilitating Transition to Retirement\" (Tora Bikson); (5) \"Electronic Mail and the  Elderly\" (Sara Czaja); (6) \"Videotape \"Visits\" with Institutionalized Individuals\" (Karen Warburton); and (7) \"Employment Prospects for the Elderly\" (H. R. Moody). The final session was devoted to exploring participants' special hopes for how new electronic technologies would evolve to serve the elderly. The report concludes that although the conference did not come up with clear conclusions about the future, it did illuminate some of the issues that must be dealt with if new electronic technologies are to be successfully designed, marketed, and effectively used by elderly Americans.

        "description":"Compelling reasons for diversification of research methods in counseling psychology must exist in order to overcome natural academic inertia. The two most common arguments for implementing diversity--inapplicability of quantitative research to counseling practice and a need to derive research methods from the &quot;new paradigm&quot; of human knowledge--are too weak to warrant major revisions to current instructional programs. Another rationale which could be used, that of a natural-language approach, is solidly rooted in the knowledge goal of counseling psychology and envisions an understanding of the full range of human experience and behavior. The primary reason for adding natural-language research methods to the field of counseling psychology is that important questions are not easily  addressed by quantitative methods alone. Two areas of particular utility for natural-language methods are the generation of categories for understanding human phenomena and the investigation of the interpretation and meaning that people give to events that they experience. An inventory of diverse research methods--those which use numeric data formats as well as those which use natural-language data formats--is required to address the spectrum of questions relevant to the field of counseling psychology.
