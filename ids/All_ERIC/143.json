        "description":"The rationale for present manpower programs and its utility for future manpower policy are discussed. The approach focuses attention on such questions as the following: Does the present de facto meaning of manpower policy, which is implicit in what is now being attempted in the so-called &quot;manpower programs,&quot; exhaust the potential operational meaning of that policy? Is there a more comprehensive and basic meaning which can govern the current and future development of programs, a development which is oriented toward the nation's total manpower problems, of which that concerning the disadvantaged is only a part? Indeed, is concentration on the meaning of manpower policy implicit in the present programs inhibiting the realization of that more comprehensive and basic concept of  manpower policy which could give direction to government action in this area? These problems are related to the maintenance of resources (both supply and demand) and the processes of a system of particularized employment, which is the foundation not only for the economic and social well being of all workers, but also for the economic and socialist ability and progress of the nation.

It is concerned primarily with (1) the nature and source of staff in electronic-data processing units, and (2) the extent and nature of staff displacements resulting from the introduction of electronic-data processing (EDP). Data were gathered on 13,743 persons in 277 establishments which employed 527,000 workers during 1962 and 1963--approximately 50 percent of all workers in establishments with EDP installations at that time. The survey found that staffing of EDP units was largely accomplished by utilizing existing employees rather than recruitment from outside sources; 48.6 percent were transferred with no substantial change in duties;  27.1 percent were reassigned with substantial change in duties; and 24.3 percent were newly hired personnel. In most transfers, skill requirements remained about the same; however, there were instances of upgrading, but downgrading rarely occurred.

The gap between occupational and general education must be narrowed by recognition that both may contribute to occupational choice, competence, and advancement, and also to the objectives of general education. As unsystematic as citizen evaluations have been, their effects upon occupational education have been great. Therefore, there is a need for a more equitable representation of the total public in the evaluation of occupational education and its consequent remodeling. The major purpose of citizen evaluations should be to influence the development of adequate public policies which would make possible more realistic and effective occupational education for  all who would receive it in public institutions. Typically, evaluations have been of programs, teachers, students, and former students and facilities. There has been little attention to public policies and attitudes responsible for the conditions discovered, or to the processes by which public policies of occupational education are derived. Proposed procedures for a citizen evaluation are outlined. A 70-page bibliography and reference list is appended. (DM)",

The major experimental and control groups consisted of 56 sophomore students matched individually by age, sex, grade average, and intelligence quotient. After the second quarter, the remaining students who could not be individually matched were used as additional experimental and control groups of 51 students each. Although the experiment failed to confirm the hypothesis in terms of gross speed there were differences significant at the 1 percent level  in terms of net speed on the basis of errors in the timed writing in favor of both experimental groups. A strong relationship was found between the control variables and gross speed but not between the control variables and errors or net words.

Subjective evaluation of the program has shown that when underachieving youth are given work responsibility as tutors, both they and the tutees make progress in gaining the following: (1) a sense of work responsibility, (2) an appreciation of learning, (3) improved  literary skills, and (4) motivation to work and stay in school. The success of the project resulted in the installation of the program in 15 other school districts. In addition to the formation of a new type of effective job station, the outcomes of the demonstration project include the development of multi-media materials and methods for enriching the enrollees' work experience and a strategy for spreading \"Youth Tutoring Youth\" to schools around the country.

        "description":"The effects of task complexity and vicarious reward upon children's ability to learn a substantial educational task through modeling were investigated. After observing a models performance, all subjects (elementary school students) were offered direct reward for matching responses. Accuracy of imitative learning was inversely related to task complexity and facilitated by the presence of vicarious reward. However, as predicted, vicarious reward had a significant effect only for subjects in the high complexity condition, and had negligible effects for subjects exposed to the low complexity task. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that vicarious and direct reward may operate additively, with the former serving primarily to enchance subjects attention to the relevant  modeling cues.

It was hypothesized that high father's job satisfaction, high mother evaluation of the father's work, and high son self-esteem would produce the greatest similarity between father and son vocational interests. Subjects were 33 male undergraduates. They completed the Strong Vocational Interest (SVIB) Blank and Biographical Data Form. The SVIB was sent to subjects' fathers, and additional questionnaires to both father and mother. The dependent variable was developed by comparing interest patterns of fathers and sons. The independent variables were ratings from the SVIB and a self-esteem score. The effects of the  variables on degree of interest similarity were more complex than hypothesized. A father's satisfaction, mother's satisfaction and son's self esteem did influence high father-son similarity but always in combination with some other variable and never alone. Implications include correlations between the SVIB and identification degree of identification and personality type. (KJ)",

None of the hypotheses were borne out by the data. The only significant t value obtained as a comparison between Group One's pre- and post-test mean score on the Liberalism Scale of the SCQ, wherein the members of this group scored significantly higher after two years of college.

High school seniors (73) completed the instrument and a biographical data questionnaire. These students and five teachers also submitted the names of seniors whom they regarded as possessing strong leadership characteristics. The findings include the following: (1) there were significant inter-correlations between the self-report scores, peer nominations and teacher nominations; (2) there was no significant difference between  the two weighting systems ability to predict peer and teacher nominations, but in a second study the differentially weighted system demonstrated greater predictability; and (3) there was a correlation between leadership scale scores and an outside criteria of leadership - the biographical data items.

In discussing these confrontations, however, several fallacies need to be dispelled: fallacy 1, disruptions typically occur at big, impersonal universities; fallacy 2, only a small percentage of students are involved; and fallacy 3, the Viet Nam war and the draft are basic causes of student unrest. The author feels that student radicals do not really wish to escape from authority, but rather that they badly need some authority which can be respected and in which they can place confidence. Young people also have a  short time horizon, both looking backward and looking forward. They have a sense of urgency for the immediate as well as a growing disbelief in progress, or a growing disbelief in the gradual nature of progress. What is required from adults is neither indignant repression nor disgusted withdrawal, but constructive and patient efforts to respond on the campuses to the legitimate criticisms and to help restore an atmosphere in which there can be a more fully shared responsibility for the changes that need to be made.

        "description":"The differential validity of subject area tests of academic ability is investigated. Principal components analyses of test scores, high school grades, and college grades in English math, social studies, and natural sciences show a dominant general ability dimension and a consistent configuration of subject areas on second and third dimensions. Data from approximately 250 colleges yield correlations of subject area college grades with subject area test scores on the American College Tests (ACT) and high school grades. A criterion of differential validity is proposed and calculated for the ACT tests and high school grades in predicting college grades. The moderate differential validity found is interpreted in terms of the first analysis. The modest differential validity in the ACT  tests and minute amount in high school grades indicate that neither general tests of academic ability nor grades are ideally suited for efficient classification of students into one of several subject area curricula.

Members of approving couples were no more like each other in personality than those who expressed no approval.

        "description":"The psychological role of the father in the life of an adolescent is crucial. Delinquent adolescent males have severe problems in the oedipal area. Most have had negative father-son relationships. The study group was composed of 25 boys who were on parole. Outpatient psychiatric treatment was a condition of their parole. Of the 25, 23 had fathers who fell into a negative father role. The group therapy approach used in this study was similar to the Relationship-Experential Focus outlined by Scheidlinger. The group therapist needs to establish a therapeutic relationship where the positive attitudes of a father transference predominate. The three different phases of the group's existence are: (1) engaging their (individual) interest, (2) encountering a caring adult, and (3) leaving  the group with the image of a positive experience with an adult. Potential group members are seen individually until they have begun to relate to the therapist. Then they are placed in the group. The most meaningful changes seen so far in this type of therapy are: (1) changes in the adolescent's perception and relationships toward adults, especially adult authority figures, (2) changes in behavior toward adults outside the group, and (3) a decrease in undetected delinquent activity.

A total 600 bilingual students, 300 from each of two high schools in Laredo School District (Spanish usage reinforced) and Corpus Christi (Spanish usage discouraged) were administered the Torrance Creativity Tests (TCT) and the Hoffman Bilingual Scale (HBS). The 87 students from Laredo who scored the highest on the HBS and the 87 who scored the lowest on the HBS from Corpus Christi were analyzed. Results indicate: (1) bilingual students from Anglo oriented homes were no more original, on a figural originality test, than those from non Anglo oriented homes,  (2) those from Anglo oriented homes were more elaborate on a figure elaboration test than those from non Anglo oriented homes, (3) there was no significant relationship between Laredo students (non-Anglo-oriented) intelligence score and performance on the creativity test. In general, the Anglo oriented bilingual student reflects a greater ability to carry out or embellish creative ideas than the non Anglo oriented student. (Author/KJ)",

The concept-learning task has been very successful with fifth and sixth grade children for whom concepts of this kind are difficult. The conventions used in presenting this task may be modified to suit the requirements of a particular  experiment.

Special attention is given to the mechanisms of internal domination and colonization, reflecting the influence of Lima as the country's power center and cultural, social, and financial metropolis. The growth and problems of Peruvian public education between 1958 and 1968 are discussed and an explanatory model is outlined that  describes each of the four social groups in terms of their location in the country's social hierarchy, their physical location (whether urban or rural), the languages they speak, their occupations, the schools they usually attend, and their usual length of schooling.

In the curriculum materials for art and music, an attempt was made to clarify the relationship between physical objects and art form and music, to add to their appreciation. In science, new techniques were devised in developing genetic models and in the presentation of general subject matter by using the common household fly. The final report, in history, dwelt on better success in the presentation of history from an interpretive  approach as opposed to the traditional chronicle presentation.

(3) The State superintendent of public instruction should be an appointive rather than an elective position. (4) Programs and services of the SDE should be modified to meet public school objectives and the needs of the Wyoming citizens more adequately. (5) The department should be structurally reorganized. (6) Utilization of the professional staff should be maximized. (7) Coordination among the school districts can be  improved. (8) Within the districts themselves, minimum school unit size by attendance would improve the educational services of the districts. (9) Personnel positions and salaries should match responsibilities and compare with those in other States. (10) Multistate and intrastate educational agencies should cooperate.

Eighteen articles define this type of study, discuss its applications to the educational process, advise when to use longitudinal inquiry, and describe barriers formed by lack of statistical techniques in manipulating the data. The traditional argument involving the major variable of time in longitudinal studies, with the uncontrollable dimensions it imposes on the study group, is examined and some novel ideas are proposed. One such idea is the unanticipated changes that occur to the researcher himself as he acquires new methodology. Another is an application of statistical assumptions to the study group by approaching the subjects as random variates, thereby overcoming the loss of data  from loss of subjects in the group. The lack of knowledge about classroom anatomy adds unidentified variables to longitudinal studies even under ideal conditions. Therefore, research on this subject must progress in order to strengthen longitudinal studies. In general, the respondents feel that this type of study provides a broad framework within which all of the tools of science can be used. (LN)",

Literature on change, the change process, decisions, and the decision process is reviewed and a framework within which to study planned change is constructed. Decision making, in the change process, should follow eight steps to achieve good, consistent decisions. In descending order, the process calls for recognizing the need for alternatives, establishing criteria for judging alternatives, exploring alternatives, establishing alternatives to be tested, making trials, analyzing data, finding the decision point, and, finally, implementing the decision. Each step must be carried out effectively to obtain favorable results. To  assist the decision maker in recognizing decision situations, decisions are classified according to the target, general policy, objectives, program, resources, schedules, and program policy.

The report proposes a look at decision-making theory to see if there exists some conceptualization of decision making which can be varied to fit the context in which decisions must be made. To provide for situational adjustments, a behavioral character must be graphed into a normative framework to provide for some measure of deviation from the norm that is being sought. In building this conceptual framework, two criteria were followed: (1) Throughout the model, logic and consistency must prevail; and (2) the resulting model must be useful to the problems at hand. The final conceptualization is a piecing together of current decision theory and its application  to the planning situation. A literature review makes up the body of the document, followed by the proposed model and a summary of its shortcomings and implications. (LN)",

Four functions are analysed: remedial reading, guidance, psychological services, and library assistance. No real pattern evolved as to deployment of any one function at either school level. To examine the people with whom specialists spend their time, five categories of recipients were established: desk work, students, classroom teachers, other specialists, and with others. It was found that the function would relate to a recipient pattern (i.e., specialists in remedial reading work mostly with students and little if any with the other recipient categories). Specialists in guidance, however, distribute their time among all recipient categories. A related  document is EA 002 629. (LN)",

Data from 47 school districts of the Metropolitan School Study Council show a progressively larger difference as class size decreases. In the elementary grades a significant break occurs between the 11-15 and 16-20 and the 21-25 and 26-30 class size intervals. In the secondary grades, the only significant break occurs between the 11-15 and 16-20 class size intervals. This process measure provides useful categories on large and small classes.

Federal aid should come under the direct control of the executive branch to consolidate and simplify all education aid programs. This reorganization should include continuous and effective presentation of the State point of view to the responsible authorities. A new three-tiered structure of Federal aid programs was proposed: general aid, functional block grants, and categorical aid. General aid would assist in providing more years of public education with provisions for increased quality. Functional block grants would more specifically aid in areas of education for the disadvantaged, educational research, improving administration, vocational education, and educational facilities. Categorical aid would induce  special effort in projects which should be self-sustaining after the projects are undertaken. The commission concluded that the Federal Government should strengthen higher education through Federal resource allocations that provide equal opportunity to all applicants and that consider the long term needs of higher education.

The scores were categorized into elementary, secondary, and district levels. The high and low scores were separated by roughly four standard deviations in the district-wide calculation of each aggregate score. In addition, an intercorrelation of the four scores was run showing no dependence. In general, each item had at least one component, either positive or negative, that discriminated well, and most items had high  difficulty levels and high discrimination indices. The reliability of the total instrument was estimated by means of the Spearman Brown formula, which provided a reliability coefficient (r = .91).

School administrators should anticipate changes which will accompany the new social studies in the areas of finance, space utilization, program supervision, and teacher preparation.

        "description":"To verify the existence of a communication gap between the contemporary music composer and his general listening audience and to assess the scope and causes of the gap, interviews were conducted with a cross-section of composers, performers, conductors, educators, and listeners throughout the nation. During the 9-month study, (September 1968-June 1969) structured interviews with 231 subjects were supplemented by informal conversations with hundreds of people. Although opinion was divided as to the causes, respondents generally agreed that a large gap exists between nonconservative contemporary composers and the general audience. The findings suggest several methods for bridging the gap, including composer-performer symposia, better teacher training in 20th-century music, more  quality live performances of new music, creation of college-community resource centers, increased use of news media to provide information and recordings of 20th-century music, and inclusion of courses on new music in the curricula of schools and colleges.

Although research evidence on the effectiveness of human relations training is ambiguous, due to difficulties of research design and measurement, the following conclusions may be drawn: (1) Many individuals report significant behavioral changes following human relations training, (2) individuals who experience sensitivity training are more likely to improve their leadership skills than those who do not, and (3) the incidence of serious mental disturbance during training is estimated to be less than 1% of all participants.

The entire data bank system was piloted by second-grade, middle-class children with self-administering orientation units developed to introduce students to the data retrieval process and to present them with instruction and learning tasks. Second, a set of studies were conducted to explore the use children would make of the banks. These studies led to development of a set of principles on which first-generation information systems can be built for children. Last, several investigations were designed to explore the relevance of the data banks as settings for teaching concepts and inquiry systems from  the social sciences and also to explore the utility of the data banks as settings for research into the social science education of children.

To the neglect of the first four functions, evaluations of ESEA Title I programs have been primarily restricted to the program certification function. Five proposals are advanced for improving the evaluation of compensatory educational programs; these include the adoption and dissemination, by the U.S. Office of Education, of guidelines for  evaluation and a requirement by that office that explicit evaluation designs accompany program proposals.

An introductory lecture points out the potential effectiveness of video technology for gearing programs to individual needs, specifically the needs of the deaf. The necessity for formulating specific objectives in utilizing video hardware, as opposed to random experimentation is considered, and practical experience in industry is outlined in a presentation which describes the use of videotape in training personnel in a telephone company. Limitations and advantages of using videotape in deaf education, and demonstrations presented by institutions of deaf education concerning application of video technology in equipment,  techniques for the classroom teacher, and the use of closed circuit television are discussed. A final paper summarizes the workshop in terms of current progress and suggested areas for research. (JB)",

Sixty non-disabled children were at times used for controls. The findings indicated that children with spina bifida and hydrocephalus lagged behind other handicapped children in reading, arithmetic, psycholinguistic abilities, richness of interpersonal recall, and listing of occupations. The spina bifida hydrocephalic children showed better performance in verbal ability than in performance skills and tended to act socially deprived regardless of verbal intelligence. Non-hydrocephalic and amputee  children seemed to show normal social awareness.

The Stanford Achievement Reading Comprehension Test was administered with three degrees of distraction. The visual distraction consisted of either very few items per page, a normal amount of items, or pages with a superimposed jigsaw puzzle design; the auditory distraction was supplied by a tape recording of school sounds. Distractions did not affect the reading performance of either group, did not affect the brain injured any more than the normal, and there was no trend for comprehension to decrease concomitantly under combined increases of visual and auditory distractions. The high  dual distraction negatively affected the non brain injured group more than the brain injured group. The conclusion was that the basic assumptions of teaching materials and methodology for brain injured children should be reevaluated. (Author/JM)",

The results of the testing revealed that visual-motor-perceptual dysfunction is more frequently found in deaf than hearing children, and this lag does not seem to be the result of brain damage; a visual perceptual lag is more often found in those who test at a dull normal level; and a positive relationship exists between visual motor perception and intelligence, linguistic ability, and academic status. Some recommendations were that differential diagnostic testing should include assessment of visual motor perceptual  functioning, training in this function should be emphasized throughout elementary school, motor encoding should be used for concept learning, a refined teacher evaluation scale for assessing language is needed, and further studies along these lines should be made.

A second study was conducted to determine the success of the deaf attending regular institutions of higher education. Results indicated that those attending regular institutions came from socioeconomic backgrounds similar to the general college population, their school background  was generally in oral residential schools, and successful completion depended simply on academic ability. An ongoing project to investigate occupational status is mentioned. Results of a survey concerning supervision and supervisors in programs for the deaf indicated the following needs: increased supervision, improved quality of supervision, setting professional standards for supervisors, and discussion and resolution of problems in supervision by professional persons in education.

Results indicated that the longer the phonation time and pause time of speech, the longer the integration time of hearing. It was suggested that the time involved in hearing affects the ease with which a person processes another's speech. Phonation time and pause time were thought to be related to the ability of the  auditory system to bridge silent intervals. The left ear appeared to be more sensitive to speech timing than the right ear. Significant correlations existed between personality measure and timing measures of speech and hearing, but data did not indicate whether personality measures dictated the speech and hearing measures.

Each double confrontation subject was videotaped while completing the same process; he then watched himself watching himself. The student was able to study the sequence of events and the responses of himself and his clients. There was little difference between the single and double confrontation for most students, but for those with relatively poor self concepts significant shifts were made toward higher self esteem in  double confrontation.

An evaluation instrument was developed from the Flanders system and employed 20 categories and 11 modes of description. Results showed that in all grade levels the majority of communication was teacher initiated, but that at higher levels there was a gradual increase in student response and initiation. Questioning and informing were the two most frequently observed categories used by teachers in both language-dependent and specialized instruction; these categories were also the ones  used most frequently by students in initiating communication. The oral mode was predominant at primary and intermediate levels in the day and residential schools in which data was gathered, but non-oral modes increased noticeably on the high school level in the residential school but not in the day school.

The results indicated that parents were greatly interested in multiple aspects of their children's education, and although these children were generally below the norm in reading ability, the fault seemed to lie not with home environment but with the school. It was found that the behavior  inventory of the children with highest reading levels was in the upper half of the scoring range and those with the lowest reading scores were in the lower half. Bilingual children did not appear to have a language development deficiency, but examiner testing style did appear to affect total score. Over a 3-year period, the intellectual level of both Puerto Rican and white middle class children tended to remain fairly stable. (JM)",

The 87 words of the Irwin Integrated Articulation Test were randomized and presented over a series of nine stimulations of four new words each day. The results were that combined aural-visual stimulation produced fewer errors than aural stimulation alone; errors from visual stimulation alone could not be meaningfully calculated. Words under aural-visual stimulation were rated as significantly improved from the third to the twentieth day but were still considered below average on the scale. The  difficulty of sound production did not differentiate conditions analyzed according to manner of articulation or place of articulation. Voicing improved under aural-visual stimulation, but negligible correlations were obtained with sex differences, age, and IQ. Indications were that brief periods of cumulative imitation under aural-visual stimulation can bring about better motor control for articulation in cerebral palsy. (Author/JM)",

The Brentwood Reading Program evidenced that the curriculum accommodated individual differences and that student terminal behavior did not interfere with learning. Extensive testing data show some statistical improvement. Form-class study continues to determine if there is some evidence for the psychological reality of degrees of grammaticalness. Data from the Logic and Algebra Program indicates that students should begin with algebraic rules of inference. The Dial-a-drill Program is testing  branching criteria and the relative difficulty of fraction problems. The success of the Elementary Russian Program promises to be statistically significant. No data are available for the Spelling Program. Adaptations for the new PDP-1 System are in process. Coding changes, curriculum revisions and supporting materials are itemized.

        "description":"Conceptualizations concerning role changes of classroom teachers due to the use of computer assisted instruction (CAI) are contingent upon what system is used and how long it takes. However, some factors within CAI which may cause teacher role changes can be identified. Also, it is likely that the pattern of computer development will be gradual, culminating in a new form of individualization due to the availability of advanced computers and multimedia resources and to the differentiation of staffing. The teacher's role, then, can potentially change toward involving more strategizing, managing, individual counseling, discussing, specializing, and diagnosing functions; and fewer correcting, lecturing, and disciplining functions. Future teacher education programs should feature CAI  and prepare teachers for these new roles. (SP)",

Within the format of five 40-minute lessons (including preview frames, instruction, examples, practice problems, criterion frames, and daily quizzes), 23 concept units were developed. Thirty-six of the 54 participating students were paired for all activities except the final examination; the remaining 18 students participated individually. Data collected included results of various pre-course algebra knowledge tests, preview questions, criterion questions, daily lesson quizzes, the final examination, and attitude questionnaires. Analyses (which included reliability estimates, the F test,  and correlation coefficients) of results showed no significant differences between the two groups in post-course achievement or in individual concept unit scores, indicating that paired instruction using CAI techniques is as effective as individual instruction. Further investigations are indicated as a result of the study into paired versus individual achievement, the pairing variable, student controlled instruction, task difficulty, and pair-individual alternation.

The program's objectives are improvement of the quality of standard teacher-lesson presentations, redirection of teacher time and energy to individual student help, expansion of students' educational experiences, improvement of teacher competency, implementation of new curricular offerings, encouragement of the team approach to planning, releasing of teachers from classroom responsibilities to prepare and record video tapes, provision of a means for teachers to compare their teaching performance with previous performance and with other teachers' performance (thus bringing about  a more favorable attitude toward self-assessment), and more efficient use of student time. Extensive summer workshops have trained participants to prepare video tapes to be used in the coming school year and to further explore and develop new techniques to be used in closed circuit television. Other program activities are dissemination of information, an inclusive demonstration program for visitors, consulting services, and extensive self-evaluation. (MM)",

School guidance counselors can no longer cope adequately with the available information, nor can they help all students to see the complex range of alternative life styles. Computers are now programed to give students information. They can also provide for students' decision-making experiences and the chance to study various value systems by playing life-career games. These guidance systems are programed to understand English. If student interaction with the computer is monitored by the counselor, he may detect personal problems and help solve them or quickly refer the student to the school psychiatrist. However, whether computers should have programs with value orientations, whether students and counselors will  accept these machines, and whether the machines will in fact better equip the student to make decisions wisely remain matters for discussion and careful study. Even the simplest use of computers for individualized scheduling raises these problems. The document contains summaries of fifteen papers on these issues and a description of ten guidance systems under development. (MM)",

Further drawbacks to CAI are the enormous effort required to prepare even the simplest course material, the large cost of both hardware and software, extremely difficult man-machine communication, poor software support from IBM, the inability of  the machine to judge partially correct answers and to ascertain whether the student has successfully grasped the concept involved, decreased student concentration span, inefficient use of student time, the lack of an indexing system to compensate for the forward-structured system, and the undue complexity which requires a student to work with several media simultaneously.

The children of these poor are oriented to the physical and visual rather than to the aural. They are content-centered, problem-centered, externally oriented, inductive, spatial rather than temporal, inclined to communicate through actions rather than words, short in attention span, characterized by significant gaps in learning, and lacking experiences of receiving approval for success in tasks. One solution to the needs of these learners is the language laboratory which teaches standard English as a second language. Further oral language programs serve as the underlying base for the  development of reading and writing skills. Microteaching, interaction analysis, and simulation sensitize teachers to the problems of these learners by providing feedback and insights into the procedures and consequences of instructional decisions. The only positively significant means found so far of sensitizing the learner to a non-distorted view of the nature and operation of a pluralistic society is proximity to middle class students.

The study was not designed to reorganize the curriculum for television, nor was it designed to maximize the television presentation. The same instructors taught the courses to both the experimental and control groups. The groups were matched for intelligence on the basis of the Army Area I scores. The use of kinescope recordings as a review method was also explored. The results of the study indicate that television instruction was at least as effective as regular instruction and was especially effective for lower-aptitude groups. When kinescope recordings were  used for review purposes following initial instruction, test performances were significantly higher, especially in the low-aptitude groups. These results suggest that the two possible applications for television contemplated by the Army, mass training during emergency situations and routine training at Army Schools and installations, could be carried out without a loss in learning effectiveness.

Subjects, 27 female and 26 male eighth grade students, were administered a retention measure through computer-assisted instruction (CAI) and randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, each providing similar CAI mathematical concepts and different methods of determining the number of examples per concept provided (variable, choice, or fixed). A two-way analysis of variance, with sex and treatment group as the independent variables, was performed; results showed that females in the \"variable\" group performed significantly better on  retention measures than did females in \"choice\" or \"fixed\" groups, and that males in the \"choice\" group performed better on retention measures than did males in the other two groups. In addition, it was found that the use of the preinstruction index resulted in overall better retention for females but not for males, indicating the possible usefulness of such an index in mathematics instruction and a need for further research into the sex variable in retention.

The power of motion pictures lies in the range of symbols that can be employed and in the degree of their integrated expression of meanings. We can improve the effectiveness of motion pictures in instructional communication when we understand the function of pictures, language and musical symbols, and develop skills in using these symbols both uniquely and in reinforcing patterns as appropriate; for instruction is the arrangement and administration of learning situations. The effectiveness of instruction may be expected to improve when learning situations are arranged and administered so that basic principles of  learning are in operation. Thus proper use of symbols can give an instructional film tone, context, novelty, opportunities for audience identification, and a feeling left with the audience of the necessity for further personal effort in order to achieve closure. More research and experimentation are needed so that instructional films will at least not violate principles of learning. (MM)",

Descriptions of the purposes of the study, of the DIALOG system (developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Co.), and of the procedures involved in conducting a search of the ERIC file using DIALOG are followed by information on the nine people, from various areas of education, who were asked to help evaluate the system. The major portion of the report, consisting of nine case studies, is based on the reactions of these evaluators (gathered in debriefing interviews) to one or more DIALOG searches which they themselves conducted. In addition, 19  evaluations (based on questionnaires from other system users) are presented. These, along with the nine original evaluations, stress the speed and &quot;horizon-widening&quot; effect of the system. A final section examines the variety of uses for the system at the Clearinghouse. The pre-DIALOG questions, the debriefing outline, and records of the evaluators' searches are appended. (SP/MT)",

Freeman. Descriptions and general objectives of the Language Development Program in the 37 NDEA Institutes for some 2,000 teachers are reviewed as well as evaluation procedures used in the report. Discussion of advanced-level and second-stage Institutes underscores the problem of too great a diversity of linguistic achievement in participant background; program flexibility is discussed as a possible solution. Faculty, briefing conferences, teacher competence, opportunity for practice of audio-lingual skills, housing and physical arrangements, demonstration class, culture courses,  and language laboratory utilization are favorably emphasized in this evaluation. Major problems described relate to: (1) quality control of participants' practice teaching, (2) pattern drill construction by participants, (3) participant reaction to applied linguistics courses and their structuring, (4) damaged student morale resulting from taking standardized tests, and (5) credit for Institute study.

The first section considers the area of aptitude testing, particularly the diagnostic function of aptitude tests. A taxonomy of foreign language teaching objectives points out the need to classify the aims of foreign language instruction. Another section on measuring achievement explores techniques and recent research, strongly urging the use of criterion-reference tests. The use of tests in the classroom and methods of evaluating teacher competence are discussed. Research needs are spelled out and a bibliography offered. Several tables graphically illustrate key concepts in this paper. (RL)",

A strong defense of literature is made, proposing that literature is the noblest form of language and, as such, is the proper study of language students.

        "description":"In the spring of 1969, a short computer course comprising three hours of lectures and two hours of working with a computer was offered at Hofstra University to 101 natural science students. A questionnaire, which was designed to assess the impact of the 5-hour course, was administered to the students before and after they took the course. This paper presents evidence on the extent to which the students' attitudes toward and appraisal of the computer changed after they had taken the course. Post-course student responses to five questions in the questionnaire revealed that 34 to 52% of the students felt they had learned a great deal; 50% indicated that too little time, and the other half felt that too much time, was spent on various parts of the course; the average student spent  2.7 hours listening to lectures and 2.4 hours studying or working at the computer center; the computer course, when compared to the regular course, approximately matched the regular course in terms of amount learned and ease of understanding, but was considered to be a little more interesting; and 63 of the students made suggestions for improving the course. These and other data seem to confirm the value of the short computer course, especially since it resulted in more favorable student views of the computer and of its general usefulness. The paper discusses some of the course's limitations and suggests improvements for future presentations. The questionnaire and six tables are appended. (WM)",

        "description":"This report, the sixth in a series of ten, was prepared by the Steering Committee, the Study of Education at Stanford. The series, based on the concept that education should be a continuous process of discovery throughout life, sets forth recommendations for strengthening the academic enterprise at Stanford. To enhance the educational value of extracurricular activities, this report offers 24 recommendations in 3 major areas--cultural events, publications, and athletics. The proposed changes are designed to promote the personal growth (i.e. self-esteem, interpersonal relations, creativity) of student participants. Recommendations cover the responsibilities of a proposed faculty-staff-student Committee on the Extracurriculum; the establishment of 3 additional physical facilities  for extracurricular activities; improvements in the Stanford Daily, supplements to the Daily, literary and political publications, course evaluations, and non-student publications; and the division of the athletic department into 2 separate departments, the Department of Athletics (inter-collegiate) and the Department of Physical Education. Further recommendations deal with orienting freshmen athletes, organizing the Department of Physical Education, and integrating the Department of Athletics with the University community. The report is available from: Study of Education at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305. (DS)",

        "description":"The concept underlying the research discussed in this paper is that governance has to do with the perceptions of campus problems held by different groups and the perceptions of those who are knowledgeable and influential in dealing with these problems. Data were collected from over 3,000 persons on 19 selected campuses, and more than 900 interviews were held with students, faculty, administrators, department chairmen, and trustees. At some institutions, the administration and faculty favored student participation on the ground that better decisions would result, while at others students were placed on major committees merely to \"take the heat off.\" Administrators at some institutions asserted that students should have absolutely no say in the governance of the institution, while  some at others gave students more responsibility than they were willing to accept. In most situations, student participation in governance has worked well, but problems that they face include the inflexibility of some administrative structures the lack of information on budgetary and other fiscal matters, and the diversity of student bodies for whom no one student representative can speak. However, data show that students are more concerned about the quality of teaching than are faculty or administrators, and because of this reason they are needed to improve the quality of university decision-making.

        "description":"If an institution of higher education is to function, it is necessary that all components--trustees, administration, faculty, and students--fulfill their individual responsibilities. However, students cannot fulfill their responsibilities for self-development unless they are allowed certain rights and freedoms. Any college or university can benefit from the talents of its students. To facilitate their involvement, institutions should: 1) provide for more information exchange; 2) consult with students; and 3) give students decision-making responsibility in many areas of university life and complete responsibility for some areas of student life. As \"consumers\" of institutional services, students should be heard on all academic matters that concern them. The proper student role in  non-academic life is difficult to discover, but a good beginning can be made in intensive cooperative study--such as that at Brown University and Pembroke College. A great deal of misunderstanding between students and the local community might be avoided by instituting channels of communication. Students have valid complaints about the conditions of the country and should not hesitate to offer considered approaches to solving our problems. There is no group better qualified to improve the colleges and universities than the students in them. (DS)",

Seven of the 10 motivational factors revealed in that study were related to academic criteria that are considered to be of practical importance in the admissions process. In this study, cross-validation of students from a new class comprising 82 men and 56 women revealed that items loading each of the seven factors continued to correlate and to predict four academic criteria: team work, standing (academic), independent study, and faculty ratings (of participating students). Multiple regression showed that three of the seven factors were useful predictors when they were used with SAT scores and high  school ranks. The three factors are emotional stability, concerned responsibility toward society, and conscientiousness in studying. The recommendations present a list of these three factors, loaded with their corresponding items, to be used either for obtaining factor scores or as part of a battery of individual predictors. It is felt that the factors can be of definite usefulness in the admissions process at New College. (WM)",

The report gives the weekly time distribution of each of the academic ranks in each area both for the summer  session and regular academic year. An analysis of the more significant results shows that 82% of the professors' time was devoted to strictly academic activities, and that the average annual unit cost of graduate students was about 4 times that of undergraduates.

Public education is being threatened today by national and state proposals that the student be required to pay the full costs of his education. But with such a requirement, public higher education as it has traditionally existed in this country would cease to be. One may assess the values of public higher education by considering three words: (1) Opportunity. The goal of public universities involves excellent education for the many rather than the few. Despite tax and other pressures, low fees have prevailed, and today they are  fundamentally tied to current pressures for providing opportunities for low-income groups. (2) Relevance. Land-grant and other state universities, which were set up to provide opportunities and practical curricula, not only developed professional education along with general education but linked research theory with practical work to improve the human condition. (3) Involvement. Public institutions have never endorsed the ivory tower, but have sought to link public service to teaching and research, to educate adults, and to render service to those who could not attend institutions of higher education.

        "description":"This essay, describing events surrounding a student demonstration at the University of Massachusetts, provides an understanding of the mechanics by which the confrontation came into being, and analyzes relevant opinions and attitudes of students. In 1968, the university's student majority supported radical student leaders in a tactical switch from Vietnam-related issues to others concerning student power. But when the radicals made subsequent demands for change &quot;right now&quot; in the entire administrative structure of the university, the student majority reacted negatively. A sample survey of the student body revealed widely held feelings of discontent with certain aspects of university life but not a desire to overthrow the university's administration. A survey conducted a year  later showed that student opinion had shifted toward greater support of student power and black issues, and that there was a close connection between new left positions and black power advocacy. Student power and new left positions were related to age, sex, class, major, and membership in conventional student groups, but advocacy of black power was not. The conclusion of the study is that if there continues to be a wide gap between the radical leadership and a student-government oriented &quot;left wing&quot; of the student body, the prospect is for incremental changes in university policy but little or no challenge to the university's administrative structure.

An example of government-university cooperation is Oklahoma University's &quot;Professor of the City&quot; program in which faculty advised and assisted the local governments in working on the city's ills.

This report notes that joint staff meetings, university faculty and staff assistance to the city, and campus-city police  cooperation are among the areas of cooperation between Lincoln and the University. Formulation of the cooperative structure and communication are the 2 main problems they have had. It is pointed out that the tax base of many local governments is decreasing because of university expansion that results in additional tax-exempt property. As a partial solution, universities can pay for the cost of fire protection to their campuses, and means of computing this are offered. Other suggestions to help relieve the city's financial plight are: 1) additional kinds of taxes and assessments; 2) increased state aid for local expenditures, and 3) in-lieu-of-tax payments. Arrangements for in-lieu-of-tax payments exist at several universities, and some of these are described. (DS)",

The information was obtained from responses to letters of inquiry sent to several universities and national organizations. Much of this report describes the Center for Urban Affairs at Omaha. The scope of the Center's effort  includes community service, education and teaching, and basic and applied research. Specific activities in each of these areas are listed. In addition to the Center, other activities of the University are described. The Industrial Research and Information Service was established to assist industry in growth and development.

The statement proposes that US colleges and universities adopt an open admissions policy so that students from racial minority groups may also have equal access to higher education, and that students be allowed to: express their views in the classroom and in student publications; organize and join associations to promote their common interests; participate in the formulation and application of institutional policy; and exercise their  rights as citizens both on and off campus. The separation of students' academic and disciplinary records by their institutions and the confidentiality of these records are also dealt with. A lengthy section that deals with institutional procedures for the administration of student discipline is followed by a 3-point resolution on the implementation of the statement.

The proposed 77-member University Senate would comprise 30 undergraduate students, 30 faculty members, 12 administrators and five graduate students. Its work would be organized by an internal Executive Council that would, among other things, serve the President of the University in an advisory capacity, prepare the agenda for Senate meetings, recommend nominations to all  Senate committees, and take actions on an interim basis between meetings and during vacation periods. The faculty and student caucuses would be composed of senators representing faculty and undergraduate students respectively. Every year, each caucus would select a chairman from one of its members who would serve on the Executive Council and preside at meetings of the respective caucuses. The hope is that the proposed unicameral structure will unite the university community by bringing together and promoting trust among students, faculty members, and administrators. (WM)",

It focuses exclusively on relationships between student involvement in decision-making and intellectual liberty and suggests that before any significant change in the university is allowed to take place, the impact of such change on academic freedom should be considered. Increased student involvement in university decision-making, one such significant change that may have either beneficial or  adverse effects on intellectual liberty, is discussed in the context of non-academic matters, teaching, scholarship, and research. One complete section deals with the avoidance of activities that are inconsistent with the exercise of intellectual liberty. Another presents inherent differences between students and faculty, the most important of which are considered to be age, experience, permanency of relation to the university, degree of professionalization, numbers, and the difference between being a teacher and being taught.

For this report, data were drawn from those collected on faculty attitudes toward student participation in campus governance. While the 1069 responding faculty were generally favorable toward student participation in the formulation of social rules and regulations, they were reluctant to share their academic power with students. Ninety-five professors thought that students should have an equal vote with the faculty on academic matters (equal vote group) and 41 others felt that students should have no role in the formulation of academic policy (no  vote group). The remaining faculty fell between these two extremes. Both \"extreme\" groups were composed of committed and responsible teachers, but their responses to student participation in governance were found to be related to their educational philosophies, conceptions of and extra-academic contact with students, fields of study, political orientation, and involvement in campus affairs. The equal vote group had a liberal view of society and life and a positive view of students, and the no vote group was basically conservative and tended to believe that external control, motivation, and direction were needed in order for students to profit maximally from their education.

Some states limited this type of legislation to public institutions, while others applied it to all. At least 8 states permitted or directed financial aid to be withdrawn from  students involved in campus disruptions, and over 6 states banned firearms from campuses. Five states enacted legislation to allow barring individuals who are not part of the university community from campuses. Some states required or requested the chief campus officer or school administration to take various forms of punitive action with disruptive students. Several states made provisions requiring or requesting college boards of trustees to set up rules of conduct for their campuses.

When viewed from the standpoint of scientific productivity, these programs have substantially expanded the science base of the US, increased the scope of graduate and professional education, and enriched general education. But the overall impact of these programs on education has been uneven, since their effects have been predominantly on graduate education and some associated professional schools. In 1966 and thereafter, sharply imposed constraints on federal funds had a serious impact on institutions of higher education, many of which had become dependent not only upon the maintenance of a given level of federal support but upon continuing program expansion. This  seems to indicate a necessity for restructuring the working relationship between the federal agencies and higher education. Universities, professional societies, and educational associations need to: (1) analyze the needs of society in order to assign the particular roles that they can play in a rapidly evolving social structure; (2) determine for themselves the most effective set of goals that would best serve the US; (3) define the general areas within these goals that are best suited for federal action; and (4) strengthen their power structures through clear-sighted analyses and planning.

This led him to the conclusion that the quality of education in the Negro Colleges is not a matter of race but of resources. Accepting McGrath's challenge to multiply the financial resources that were available to Negro colleges, the Phelps-Stokes  Fund obtained a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and undertook a three-year project in an aspect of fund raising not yet covered by the UNCF: raising capital funds to meet endowment, building, and special project needs. Development offices were established on the campuses of 23 selected public and private Negro colleges. The program's success justified its expansion to additional institutions and a second grant. With federal support, a consortia of development programs for 40 colleges was subsequently formed. Recognition of the development function by Negro colleges is growing, but there is a need for more effective trustee involvement, better use of presidents' time, and more support of development offices by administrative teams.

        "description":"In an attempt to discover why students are demanding participation in the decision-making processes of the university, the author examines four of the most common issues they have raised: (1) student conduct codes and disciplinary procedures. This is an area in which modern college students reject institutional authority; (2) a voice in the hiring, promotion, and discharge decisions with reference to faculty, and sometimes administrators. This issue seems to stem from students' concern with instructional quality; (3) curriculum planning. A major concern is for the relevance of undergraduate education to students' needs, goals, and lives in general; and (4) admissions and graduation requirements, grading systems, and other matters which lead to certification. Today's students come  to college with the intent of learning \"how to make life good to live\" rather than \"how to live the good live.\" Because students and faculty are more heterogeneous than before, are more aware of social issues, and are less patient with the traditionally slow academic pace, it would seem that the goals of colleges need to be changed from those stated 20 years ago. Conflicts seem to stem from the college goals perceived by faculty and administration as opposed to those seen as appropriate by students. When communication among faculty, students and administration breaks down, or the students are unable to bring about changes by going through regular channels, then demonstrations take place. (WM)",

        "description":"The psychological environment of a college is determined by the inner needs of the students and environmental press, i.e. the stresses, conformity-demanding influence, and rewards of the college. To determine the psychological environment at the Agricultural and Technical College at Delhi, 100 males and 85 females were administered the College Characteristics Index during spring 1969. This index is composed of 30 scales that measure various intellectual and non-intellectual factors. Standard scores were derived from individual raw scores and plotted on factor score profile sheets that indicated norms based on students from 32 colleges. Plottings for the total group as well as various subgroups, such as males and females and selected program areas, were presented. Comparisons were  also made among Delhi students and those from Hudson Valley, Rockland, and Onetona Colleges. It was found that the scores of the Delhi students were significantly lower than the norm group on the factors of aspiration level, intellectual climate, student dignity, academic climate, academic achievement, and self-expression. It was emphasized that these findings do not necessarily, however, represent anything good or bad about the college; the factor scores must be interpreted in terms of the purpose of the college.

Small-group (triad) participations and psychodramas were used to provoke discussion, and eight models of preparation were presented. They were: an interdisciplinary background combined with work experience, a  master's degree, and a year of teaching internship; experience in business and industry, plus one of three variations on a master's program; for a mature person, a year's study in the subject field, a second year of the subject with teaching observation, and a third year of internship; a 2-year specialist-degree program with three possible tracks; a statewide cooperative plan offering diverse approaches to varying degree levels, either subject or professional; establishment by the colleges themselves of an institution to prepare their own teachers; a doctorate-of-teaching program in an academic department; and a master's degree base, with two additional years of subject and professional preparation.

Factors analyzed included: (1) educational terminology; (2) the influence of early 2-year colleges; (3) the changes in self-concept, program, faculty, and students the junior college has undergone as the result of changes in pattern of control and organization since 1940; (4) standards used on regional and professional levels in evaluating the 2-year college; (5) pertinent legislation and legal regulations; (6) curriculums offered; and (7) articulation, or the manner in which legislators and educators deal with intercommunication among the various levels of education. This analysis was prefaced by a  review of pertinent literature that revealed historical and contemporary views of the status of the junior college in the educational hierarchy. It was concluded that the 2-year college is presently much closer in status and identity to the senior colleges and universities than to the secondary schools. The junior college is, however, an ever-changing educational innovation that selectively characterizes certain aspects of both secondary and higher education but, maintaining a still greater degree of its own character, it represents a new and unique institution of higher education.

It covers only continuing or refresher studies for current faculty and staff, not pre-service academic preparation. Presidents of AAJC member colleges were asked to describe their own school's needs, and to compare them against the known national supply. Results from the 38% response are shown in graphic form. The data were collected and analyzed from March to June 1969. For each course area, data are given on existing and planned in-service training for college faculty and staff. Each section of the study has detailed and summary  data on the national results. One appendix summarizes the results for the five geographical regions of the country, lists the states in each region, and the participating institutions. A second appendix gives more detailed tabular data on the survey's major results. A third reproduces the data collection instruments. The major observation was the deficiency of in-service training, which must be met by both 2- and 4-year institutions. The Association hopes this survey will serve as resource and stimulus to colleges, universities, government agencies, and all professionals concerned with the quality and quantity of in-service training. A later study will collect similar data from 2-year college faculty members. (HH)",

From a survey to determine students' reasons for attending Harcum, it was concluded that substantial numbers of students view their college education as a means of acquiring future direct, material rewards. A study on student attrition demonstrated the variety and complexity of factors, both situational and personal, associated with withdrawal from college. The results of a national study of retention and withdrawal patterns, a survey of &quot;dropouts&quot; from five selective women's colleges, and a study of Harcum students not returning for their second year were reviewed. The most frequently stated reason given by Harcum students was &quot;transfer to a 4-year college.&quot; Another study to determine the  national picture of eligible first-year students not returning for their second year surveyed 100 junior colleges. Results showed an average retention rate of 70%. There was, however, no consistent retention rate among institutions, either in terms of enrollment size, types of student body, or types of institutional control. An instrument that measures study habits, attitudes, and orientation was incorporated in the freshman battery of guidance tests and inventories. In comparison with a normative group of 3,054 freshmen from nine colleges, Harcum students fell at approximately the 50th percentile on each measure. Students scoring at, or below, the 25th percentile were given direction for developing better study habits. (MB)",

Just as the business community exchanges benefits with local colleges, so, he feels, could the Navy cooperate with those near its installations. Unless special equipment is required, classes can be held on campus or on the base. If held on the base, they eliminate transportation and scheduling problems for men on normal duty hours. In some places,  facilities of affiliated colleges are available and the U.S. International University plans to expand to other continental and overseas sites. Sometimes credit is given for naval courses related to the college's regular program and residence requirements can be modified. Transfer, with full credit for Navy programs, would encourage more men to continue their education--at least to the associate degree level. Seminars, workshops, and the like, as well as full-credit courses, would also be useful. The college, in turn, can often profit by using the many highly-qualified Navy men to teach such courses as oceanography, electronics, astronomy, mathematics, foreign languages, physics, personnel management, and geopolitics.

As higher education shapes our society more strongly, the federal role becomes more visible. Many historical influences have formed the national character--notably a steady rise in the education level. Increased religious and social pluralism and less isolationism have also affected social mobility; status is now judged by skill or knowledge. The government has long fostered this situation by aiding post-secondary schools. The Manpower Development and Training Act and the Higher Education Facilities Act have enabled 2-year colleges to meet some needs of the increased population. As federal aid grows, however, so does its influence on local power structures, overriding  institutions based on family, economic, and racial factors and bringing increased guarantees of human rights, more education, and social justice. Considering these issues, the 2-year college must adapt to a pluralistic approach, to community interests rather than to self or special interests. Faculty selection, community and industrial needs, social and athletic programs, academic and vocational courses must all be balanced and the impact of federal money on any one of them noted. Legislation and funds must be directed to developing human resources. Board, administration, and faculty can help by staying attuned to international, national, and community issues and to the proper federal function in education. (HH)",

His position must be clear to faculty and students so that all may agree on goals. A modern administrator, more facilitator than authoritarian must follow the advice of his staff and constituency in setting up democratic, jointly-developed policies, rules, and procedures. Their combined influence will help the institution find its own identity, decide its role in the total educational effort, choose the quality and  variety of its programs, and determine the activities to be augmented, curtailed, or discarded. It will thus decide its own direction, free from external constraints. A sound management information system will permit better long-range planning, avoid most emergencies, and allow regular review for instructional improvement. Faculty, students, and administrators must all agree on the planning process and purpose, professionally recognized and encouraged, to soften resistance to the drastic changes that will follow. Several suggestions are given for minimizing irrational responses to change. If the junior college is to help man fashion a creative environment, all must be involved in making the learning process successful. (HH)",

The computer can be the subject of instruction; in response to the demand for programmers by the computer industry, the junior college should establish a 2-year program of computer instruction culminating in an Associate degree. The program should be geared to the employment market two or three years after its  inception. A junior college can provide the first two years of preparation for many computer related areas. In these cases, transfer requirements must be considered. The computer can also be a tool of instruction in mathematics, statistics, physics, and engineering, where it operates as a rapid calculator. In other areas, student and computer interact to perform drills and exercises. The computer can aid instructors in test preparation, scoring, and bibliographic searches. It can also greatly facilitate administrative procedures, including student registration. Sharing the cost of a computer with other nearby institutions may be desirable for small colleges. (MS)",

In the modern, task-oriented system, his role can hardly be generalized as decision-making, direction and control, problem-solving, inspiration, communication, or any other simple function. It consists rather of realistically assessing environmental forces or constraints, articulating the organization's mission, vying for and securing resources for the functions of the organization, providing internal coordination, communication, and conflict resolution, and representing the organization to its constituency (taxpayers or shareholders). His leadership style is characterized as neither authoritarian nor  democratic, but as flexible and adaptive. He must correctly assess the forces in himself, in the organization, and in the larger environment; he must then respond appropriately to these factors in each situation. He is neither a strong nor a weak administrator, but an integral part of a complex social system, in which his primary mission is to integrate productively both human and non-human resources into an organization working toward a common goal. Charts show the evolution of organization theories and their characteristic faults and strengths. (HH)",

        "description":"The author speculates on the results of a change in perceptions of \"community,\" currently seen as the territory of the taxpayer, with his right to set rules through his representative, the board of trustees. The board members, usually conservative businessmen, do not truly represent the community, but they hire the administrators and, through them, all the staff. The staff, however, only seems beholden to the board and soon forms its own constituency. When staff and board disagree, or when he is caught between the board and students and area residents, the president becomes more mediator than leader. A new view of community is not as a taxpayer bloc, but as many elements that contribute to the life of the college, including administrative leadership, staff dedication, faculty  creativity, students, and their families. A model board to represent all these elements might have seven seats--three for taxpayers (maybe for women, minorities, and employees of commerce) and four for the president, a faculty member, a sophomore, and a graduate or adult evening student. Power would rest with those contributing most in knowledge and involvement. Changes under such representation would include: recognition of political reality, not the myth of public-spirited service; more interest in education, less in finances; easier resistance to political pressure; removal of some causes of student unrest; no more blaming \"the board\" for any group's own inadequacies; a colleague relationship instead of paternalism.

The second task resulted in development of a core curriculum, whose absence had been a great problem for the junior colleges. All units submitted examples of their own transfer problems. The Committee also studied catalogs, matching hypothetical cases to different requirements, and received recommendations from academic committees. Most schools were found to require courses in the humanities, natural  science, mathematics, a laboratory science, social science, and introductory work in the student's major. While establishing this core curriculum, the Committee tried also to (1) preserve the school's right to its own curriculum development and experimentation and (2) allow students to change or delay choice of their major. When the lower-division subject areas, quarterly course loads, credit hours, exceptions, provisions for revision, etc. were determined, each member unit was asked to develop its programs accordingly. A committee, mostly of registrars, worked out details of implementing the new articulation procedures, including counseling students that certain 4-year programs require specialized courses at the junior college level.

        "description":"Despite problems of growth, the newness of junior colleges permits activities that might otherwise be stifled by tradition. It fits the trend toward making education relevant to individual community needs. It can make improvement of education a continuing process by doing research on how to facilitate learning and applying it to teacher training and curriculum. Linked to an area's economic life, the college can use the creativity of business and industry. It can coordinate community action programs with its own remedial and work-study programs, as in making a neighborhood reading clinic part of its literacy project or combining teacher training with day-care centers. Accommodating, as it does, adult education, vocational training, and academic preparation, it has many chances for  innovation. Connecting the public school system, higher education, industry, and private fund sources, it is a natural spot for fiscal experiments. New laws aim to let the college coordinate and support diverse agencies, not overlap or compete with them. They will provide grants to individual schools for career education programs. The open door is a primary service to the poor, giving immediate job training with a chance for later transfer to professional work. The federal plans will encourage coordination with government manpower programs, with feeder high schools, and with 4-year schools. Full use of the junior college can reduce the artificial separation of the academic, economic, and social worlds. (HH)",

        "description":"This paper explains the systems approach. Of several definitions, the simplest is that a system is a set of parts coordinated to achieve a [goal or] set of goals. A modified systems approach could likely be an effective tool in educational planning. The information feedback loop permits the manager to base his actions on the actual performance of the system as related to its overall mission and on the performance of any subsystems as related to their objectives. The need constantly arises to determine alternative courses of action, which must be traded off according to system constraints and mission, and to accommodate successive generations of design, directed by re-evaluation as feedback on the initial system becomes available and as constraints and resources change. A course  in remedial mathematics was set up under certain constraints: existing programed material was designed for children; it gave more drill than instruction; other departments needed students with particular math skills; money for change was scarce; new staff could not be expected; no grade, only competence, was required. Its aim was to help students qualify for several departments served by the math department. The author describes the components of this mission by subsystem, and the solution of the problem by the use of a core of courses in arithmetic supplemented by units in algebra, geometry, etc. Other details of the innovation are given.

A developmental program was designed for Puerto Rico Junior College to improve the performance of high school graduates with low academic averages and entrance examination scores. After a year of pilot operation, the &quot;Ahead in College&quot; program has been evaluated. It includes training in the basic skills and concepts of English, Spanish, mathematics, and several business skills. Courses in human relations, music, arts, and sports are also offered. Individual counseling is provided. The maximum program load is 17 hours a week, with no more than 12 credit hours. On the basis of monthly progress evaluations of each student,  transfer is granted to the regular 2-year curriculum of the college. Participants in the program pay regular tuition and fees. During the pilot year, the program had 46 participants. Student profiles showed that personal and family problems had been responsible for previous low achievement. The performance of students promoted from the pilot program compared with the performance of regular students showed that the pilot group competed successfully. In view of this, it is suggested that more such programs be started to serve students with an average or low level of achievement in high school. An essential target for such programs is student attitudes and motivation. (MS)",

        "description":"The role of counseling is especially important in junior colleges, with their wide range of courses and diverse student population. It must be determined whether or not junior college counselors should practice \"psychotherapy\" and to what extent they should be academic advisors. The first aim of counseling is to help students to make decisions; the personal adjustment of the student must be considered when resolving vocational problems. Since many junior college students need psychotherapeutic help, colleges may wish to have one or more psychologists on their counseling staffs. The inadequacy of most faculty academic advisement programs has been demonstrated; it is suggested that the counselor can get to know the student better if he also acts as academic advisor. However, there  is no data proving that the counselor provides the student with more accurate academic information than the faculty advisor. It is also doubtful that the counselor has time to perform both duties well. At Meramec Community College, St. Louis, an academic advisement program prepares personnel with intensive in-service training. They then act as academic advisors, with close supervision by the counselors. An alternative, using programmed materials, allows students to prepare their own programs. The author feels that professional counselors should spend most of their time helping students with developmental problems. (MS)",

In lieu of final exam, 17 experimental (Minority) and 28 control students received tests of creative thinking. Two forms were used, each with three separate figural tasks. The first form presented a circles, a triangles, and a squares task; the second, circles, squares, and then triangles. The first two tasks were timed, the third was not. All were scored for fluency, flexibility, and originality, and the timed and untimed tasks compared. Except for a few individual experimental subjects, the controls were much higher on all counts. Comparison of originality scores in the timed and untimed tasks showed  erratic differences in individuals in both groups, indicating a group rather than a task difference. Though inconclusive, the study highlights the lack of screening for the minority group, their possible anxious reaction to testing, and their lack of broad background, in contrast to the screened and generally able students of the dominant culture; it suggests identifying creativity in the disadvantaged in early school years. In short, comparisons between culturally different groups showed wide and unpredictable individual differences; the dominant culture has an advantage over the minority; an untimed task gave no anxiety relief to the disadvantaged; general education for minority cultures must be maximized.

A Spanish teacher used dramatization to catch her students' interest. Innovative methods for teaching literature and speech were described.  One teacher had an \"incentive grading system\" that enabled students to cancel out poor grades by showing improvement on the final exam.

The information has been compiled from tabulations of data prepared by the Bureau of Census and offers a general picture of the populations served to date and where possible includes program information. The report is divided into six sections and includes both an introduction and an overview. These sections represent a description of the Head Start children and their families, the medical status of the children, center information where available, staff member characteristics, evaluation of the program, and parent activities. Tables included with each section consist of item frequency distributions of the data  collected to date. The data depict selected trends in the composition and characteristics of the Head Start participants by comparing them from one program term to the next. The overview provides a context for interpreting the data. The paper is planned to be suggestive of leads for additional and more refined analysis of data, and should be useful in both program planning and the design of research and evaluative studies related to Head Start.

The authors hypothesize that the first step toward better classroom management is a teacher's recognition that how children behave is largely determined by the teacher's behavior. When teachers employ operant conditioning they systematically use rewarding principles to strengthen children's suitable behavior. Ignoring unsuitable behavior will discourage its continuance. Behavior can be changed by three methods: (1) Reward appropriate behavior and withdraw rewards following inappropriage behavior, (2) Strengthen the rewards if the first method is unsuccessful, and (3) Punish inappropriate behavior while rewarding  appropriate behavior if methods (1) and (2) fail. The booklet explains each method and offers supporting research and evaluations of the use of different methods. It outlines step-by-step procedures and has appeal for parents, teachers, and anyone involved in training children. (DO)",

        "description":"In the language-experience approach to reading instruction, communicative skills are viewed without distinction among listening, speaking, spelling, and writing. The children learn to conceive of expression and reception of expression as natural parts of experience, rather than as separate tasks that occur during a break in regular activity. The skillful language-experience teacher weaves opportunities for communication practice (listening, speaking, writing, reading, and dictating) unobtrusively into the fabric of daily experience. Through this practice, the child comes to feel that he can talk about what he thinks, that he can talk about what he can communicate in other ways, and that he can recall what he or others dictate and what he or others write through reading. The child  comes to recognize letters and their function, and learns little by little the details of language use, because he wants to. New skills are put to immediate use and receive immediate positive feedback. Through this method, children not only learn to read better, but they also develop mature concepts about the value and use of reading and other communicative skills.

After the session, the observer dictated a descriptive summary of the session. He filled out a rating scale on aspects of the child's behavior, including speech and play behavior, nature of social interaction, interest in play materials, ability to focus attention, inferences about his previous experience with caretakers, and general developmental assessment rating. Eighteen months later typed copies of the dictated summaries were distributed to the two observers and to five independent judges, all of whom were psychoanalytically oriented. Analysis of the ratings suggests that pre-entrance ratings do provide information for readiness  groupings and can be made on the basis of the child's response to a new adult and his interaction with preschool materials. The stability of the observers' two sets of ratings was high, as was agreement between observers, agreement among the five independent judges, and agreement between observers and judges. Finally, it is suggested that grouping children into competence groups, based on ratings by experienced observers, will facilitate preschool program planning and make children more accessible to growth through preschool experience.

The result is the present overemphasis on environmentally caused cognitive development. Yet a very basic biological law is the law of human variability. The overemphasis on the intellectual aspect of child development is harmful if other crucial personal development areas involving emotion, motivation, and social competence are ignored. If the general aspects of a child's development are attended to and appropriate conditions established, the child will learn because learning is an inherent feature of being a human being. The child's history of deprivation or failure, his motivation for attention  and affection, his feelings towards adults and his self-concept are as important determinants of how he functions as is his formal cognition.

        "description":"The concept of deprivation has become very appealing to specialists of many disciplines as an explanation for deviations in human development. This is understandable, since the phenomenon does seem to be a key factor in development, but several technical and methodological considerations hinder immediate efforts at understanding and alleviating it. Ambiguities in definitions of the concept of deprivation and the necessity to rely on field study research designs constitute major deterrents to the acquisition of definitive data. To determine more clearly the effects of psychosocial deprivation on human development there have to be improved techniques for assessing the psychosocial environment and for standardizing change-sensitive measures of early development. Also, more attention  needs to be given to clarifying the relationship between constitutional factors and susceptibility to deprivation. The single case model deserves more use in attempts to demonstrate the effects of the operation and removal of psychosocial deprivation. Finally, psychosocial enrichment might have an optimum level which should be taken into consideration. (Author/MH)",

The project, which is in the early stages of developing procedures and techniques, hopes to investigate the preliminary observation that teachers' verbal responses to children have the function of ending a child's thinking rather than extending it. Some of the research related to children's intellectual development which has come from studies of mother-child interaction will be applied to the classroom process. If research indicates a need for improvement of teacher's verbal responses, it is hoped that techniques will be developed to make this possible. Related research confirms hypotheses that certain characteristics of adult verbal behavior are crucial  aspects of the child's environment and that teachers do differ in their speech styles. Project plans are to analyze transcripts of teachers' classroom speech in terms of function (effect it will leave on the child) and message (actual information carried). The methods for classifying functions and messages are not yet perfected. The project hopes to determine an optimum level for different types of verbal behavior by teachers and to study situational determinants of teachers' speech. (MH)",

        "description":"The object of this study was to determine the extent to which disadvantaged kindergarten pupils would benefit from association with advantaged pupils and teachers in the improvement of basic skills and self-concept. The sample for 1967-68 was composed of 20 disadvantaged rural Negro and Caucasion 5-year-old children randomly selected. The sample for 1968-69 was reduced to 16 children. In each instance these children were integrated with approximately 30 foreign and Caucasian middle class children. In 1967-68 only the disadvantaged children were administered pre- and posttests approximately 7 months apart. Comparison of results showed significant gains in total performance, language skills, and self-concept, while IQ scores yielded nonsignificant results. In 1968-69, evaluation  focused on comparisons of experimental (deprived) and control (underprived) means for pretests, posttests, and mean gains from pre- to post for each group. The results must be viewed with caution, for although scores did not show that the disadvantaged gained more, they did gain as much as the advantaged. More statistically significant divergence in favor of the control group was found between pretest results than posttest results. This reduction of difference could have been due to a combination of socialization and curriculum. (JF)",

Two studies compared pedagogical attitudes of EP and NP teachers regarding classroom application of contemporary principles and the needs and nature of disadvantaged youngsters. In the first study, inculcation of EP attitudes was effected indirectly through classroom interaction with specially trained EP personnel. Attitudes were measured by a 75-item Survey of Educational Attitudes (SEA). The second study examined a 6-week  intensive workshop training project, also evaluated by SEA. In both studies the EP teachers had substantially and consistently acquired the desired EP viewpoint. Long-term diffuse and short-term intensive training produced significant modification of teacher's pedagogical convictions. (MH)",

The increase for preprimary enrollment of 3- and 4-year-olds was 26 percent from 1966 to 1967. Accurate figures on preschool teaching personnel are not available, but a large proportion of Head Start teachers had less than 6 months experience with young children before employment. However, one third of Head Start professional staff and almost two thirds of program assistants were drawn from minority groups. Certification and credentialing vary widely from state to state. Nursery school teachers are required to hold certificates in only 19 states, although preschool programs receiving federal funds must hire teachers with training or  ability in child care. Teacher training programs in colleges reflect inadequate credentialing regulations. The present growth rate suggests double enrollment of preschool children by 1972. It is concluded that the critical shortage of trained preschool personnel will continue to grow. (DR)",

Early childhood education programs have been conceived as agents of change, particularly for disadvantaged groups. A major problem now facing the field is a shortage of trained personnel, because increasing numbers of children are enrolled in preschool programs each year. Most preschool staff members have little experience or training in early childhood education, and present training programs are inadequate, particularly for inner city personnel. Resources available for developing training programs are based on inappropriate criteria.  To meet the continued growth in preschool programs, it is proposed that (1) inservice training programs be developed, (2) a minimum of six regional teacher-demonstration centers be created, (3) preservice training be offered by community colleges, (4) national certification standards be established, with professional organizations acting as the legal regulatory agencies of the local and state levels, and (5) a National Institute on Early Childhood be established to integrate and innovate practices in early childhood education.

This paper reports on two studies that attempted to upgrade practices in two teaching skills; classroom management and individual tutoring. The classroom was divided into five activity areas which the children could use freely. However, children switched areas so frequently that there wasn't enough time to offer instruction in any one area. Furthermore, when an academic activity (anagrams) was initiated in one of the areas, the children tended to avoid it. To solve these problems, a rule change was made. Children had to complete a task (similar to the anagram activity) before they could switch areas. Observations showed that, as a result,  children switched areas less often and played the anagram game more often. The mothers were deficient in individual tutoring because they too often made negative or irrelevant comments and too seldom made reinforcing or helping comments. Written instructions did little to rectify this situation, but &quot;tele-coaching&quot; over earphones quickly increased the mothers' use of sound learning principles and decreased their use of undesirable tutoring behavior.

The normative data was collected from taped oral responses or written language samples of 180 white middle class children, 30 each from kindergarten and grades 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Analysis was based on the mean length of the T-unit (a single, independent predication with all its complements and modifiers), which Kellogg Hunt (1964) claimed to be a discriminating indicator of the degree of syntactic mastery in children's language production. This study  supported Hunt's finding. T-units were further analyzed for Chomsky's \"sentence combining transformations.\" Results indicated that mean word length of total language production increases with every advance in grade level. The most significant increases in speech mastery were found in grades 1 and 7, and in writing mastery in grade 5. In grade 3 speech was better than writing, but this reversed in grades 5 and 7. Boys were better speakers than girls in all but grade 5. Girls wrote better than boys in the middle but boys surpassed them in seventh grade. (MH)",

Individual subskills such as arithmetic and language arts are learned for a larger project that the children are interested in, and skills are developed as the need arises. The project discussed here is cooking stew in a third grade classroom. Preparatory discussion and a colorful, illustrated storybook prepared by teachers heightened the interest the children had in the project, and they cheerfully took on the various tasks involved in making stew, from buying the ingredients and collecting the utensils to following the recipe and tasting the fruits of their efforts (gratification).  Post-stew exercises presented the opportunity for further learning as children wrote brief stories about the cooking experience using new \"stew\" vocabulary words. Skillful interaction by the head teacher and her aides weaves the substantive content of academic subjects into the turned-on group activity, and the children receive immediate and gratifying feedback for their new skills.

The subjects were 25 male and 24 female 5 1/2-year-old poor Mexican-Americans. Generally, the Wechsler Preschool Scale showed high reliability with this sample, full scale reliability being .95. The impact of disadvantage can be seen by comparing the scale scores of this group with the results reported for an Anglo-American standardization group. The Mexican-American group falls below the general mean in all subtests, noticeably in the verbal section and most notably in the information and similarities sections of the Wechsler Scale. The high reliability of the scale  suggests implications for testing children from ethnic minorities. Since most of the children had limited facility with English, study results will encourage researchers who want an accurate measure of intellectual skills required for successful performance in technical cultures. Measurement within a disadvantaged group may not require new tests to predict skills but may depend upon the use of tests sampling existing known factors and utilizing them to predict within groups. Norms should be established for the specific group tested. (JF)",

It was hoped that the approach could (1) improve achievement in reading and arithmetic, (2) improve ability in written composition, (3) improve students' attitudes toward self, the school, the teacher, and peers, and (4) increase students' ability to think creatively. To assess this approach, a comparison was made between three third grade classrooms (N=62) in which the English school approach was used and three other third grade classrooms (N=58) in which a traditional approach was used. At the end of the year, all the children took the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, The Way I Feel About Myself, and the Pupil Attitude Toward School  Inventory. Teachers' subjective evaluations were also collected. Students in the new approach group showed neither significantly greater achievement gains nor significant advantage over the control group in attitude toward self, school, teacher, or peers. Teachers' opinions pointed to improved cooperation, participation, and student-teacher relationship. Recommendations include securing teacher aides, parent participation, an on-going staff development program, and careful planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the project. (Author/MH)",

Subjects were 108 children, predominantly middle class, 3 1/2 to 5 years old. Treatment conditions were analyzed according to (1) previsit to school vs. no previsit, (2) mother present vs. mother absent, (3) peer group experiences vs. no experience, and (4) male vs. female. Children's emotional reactions were rated according to (1) reaction to separation from mother, (2) position and activity relative to others in the last 20 minutes of each session, (3) motility (locomotion in the environment), (4) feeling toward school, and (5) comfort in class. All emotional reactions, except motility, were mutually intercorrelated. The teachers' rating of comfort had the highest  correlation with the other indices of emotional reaction. The four experimental treatment variables had no significant effect on a child by the last 20 minutes of the first session, and follow-up studies supported this finding. It is concluded that most middle class children readily adapt to a nursery school situation, regardless of treatment conditions at time of entrance. (DR)",

Subjects, 24 white children of welfare mothers, were assigned to an elaborative (experimental) or non-elaborative (control) group. Experienced teachers conducted four 20-minute sessions each day for 17 days, modifying their teaching style depending on the group being taught. Recordings and observations of teaching style and child verbalizations were made. Results indicated reliability of teaching styles over time and greater frequency of elaborative statements in response to teacher elicitation for the experimental group. A  possible modeling effect of teachers on children was suggested for both groups. Results on pre- and posttests designed to measure problem solving abilities showed few differences between the two groups. Greatest differences appeared on verbal tasks.

Migrant individuals tended to be younger, had lower incomes, had more education, and came more frequently from the middle social strata. Migration referred to the movement of a person from one community to another. Motivation underlying job mobility and migration centered on a desire for economic betterment or improved social status. A distinction between voluntary and involuntary mobility and migration, relative to giving up  farming, indicated that the voluntary individuals moved to jobs closely associated with past experience while non-voluntary individuals moved to positions of a semiskilled and unskilled nature.

As a result, the present system permits, and in some states, encourages independent school districts to continue operating when their programs are inferior even when compared to minimum standards of the North Central Accrediting Agency. This report presents the background and plans for developing a rural area model school for grades 9 through 12. A planning grant for the model school was funded under Title III, Elementary and Secondary Education Act, in January 1966.

Inquiry was directed toward ascertaining the type of education Navajos desire for their children, the extent Indian culture should be included in the curriculum, and how Navajos want their schools operated. It was concluded that the student at Rough Rock is happy, is engaged in the learning process, and is interested in what he is doing. The most outstanding instruction comes from the classroom teacher although dormitory parents are also effective instructors. The parents and community are involved in school operation and activities. Areas of concern were needs for greater emphasis in teaching English, for curriculum guides in the bilingual and bicultural areas, and for  follow-up evaluation of students pursuing higher education. It was concluded that Rough Rock Demonstration School has proved successful, needs continuous funding, and should be renamed and continued as a model for other Navajo community schools. (JH)",

Fifty-one teachers and 1,114 pupils participated. Teachers were pre-rated by a 5-member rating team utilizing the Stanford Teacher Competence Appraisal Guide and the Ryans' Classroom Observation Record. Each teacher assessed his own attitude using the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory. Teacher performance was recorded on videotape, which was utilized for suggesting improvements. Following a 12-week \"laboratory teaching period,\" teachers were again rated and self-assessed. A second videotape was made. The statistical techniques utilized in this study  were linear correlation analysis, variance analysis, and canonical correlation analysis. It is concluded that a rural school teacher's opportunity to see and hear his performance in the classroom by means of videotape has a highly significant improvement effect on his instructional behavior. The variables of sex of teacher, level of teaching (elementary or secondary), and years of teaching experience make no significant difference in improvement of classroom teaching performance gained through methods utilized in this project.",

Each subject was administered a pre- and post-test on the California Test of Personality, Muncy's Scale of Acculturation, Winslow's Scale of Alienation, the MSU Work Beliefs Checklist, and Haller's Occupational Aspiration Scale. The complete analysis produced several significant results both in change within each group and differences in change between groups. The study suggests that adult education projects should anticipate and try to enhance the  observed attitudinal changes as measured by the California Test of Personality. Changes in attitudes as observed in this study should result in the student being more capable of functioning in the Anglo middle class culture and this should be one of the aims of any adult education program.

Need-achievement was related to the following types of measures: academic, aptitude, intelligence, and self-efficacy. A factor analysis of 104 test items yielded 3 factor dimensions. The first delineated a broad achievement, aspiration, teacher rating, and aptitude factor; a second yielded a more specific academic achievement and clustering of specific aptitudes; and a third factor is principally defined by a generally positive clustering of positive semantic differential measures. The validation of the test is judged as sufficient to  warrant a follow-up study for the comparative purpose of establishing the most absolute validity possible, for both academic and nonacademic predictor variables. Part I of this document deals with the test product itself. Part II is devoted to the methodology and validation of the need-achievement test. (Author/JH)",

Public school findings included the lack of Indian participation or control; coursework which rarely recognized Indian history, culture, or language; and anti-Indian attitudes on the part of school administrators and teachers. Federal schools were found to be grossly underfinanced, deficient in academic performance, unsatisfactory in quality and effectiveness of instruction, seriously deficient in guidance and counseling  programs, and characterized by a rigid and impersonal environment.

In these villages, opinion leaders comprise the primary source of basic information and play a very significant role in the day-to-day life of the ordinary villager. Personal characteristics of opinion leaders and nonleaders are compared. Leaders were found to be more progressive and more in contact with the outside world. It was found that opinion leaders have a higher caste status and a higher level of living than nonleaders. In the 8 sample villages, formal leadership and opinion leadership were found to overlap. It was also found that opinion  leadership in Indian villages is polymorphic. Leaders in more modern villages were found to be more innovative than leaders in more traditional villages. It is concluded that communication flows vertically from leaders at the top of the village power hierarchy to the lower strata. The importance of opinion leaders as key communicators, particularly where the availability and use of mass media are limited, is revealed in this study. (SW)",

A sample of 139 families were assessed by the Straus Rural Attitude Profile and by a structured interview technique which provided information on economic factors and social status. The results indicated that change for its own sake or for purely economic reasons would not seem to have a very high priority, that rural living had a high value but farming as an occupation was dimly viewed, and that off-farm occupational opportunities in the vicinity would be welcomed. The analysis of value orientation through a study of factors determining social  status revealed a configuration basically the same as that of the rest of the country, but with considerably less emphasis on success or achievement in the usual sense of these terms.

A checklist is provided for evaluating a secondary reading program, and a guide for planning such a program suggests involving interested staff members through the leadership of a person especially trained in reading.

        "description":"The improvement of teaching characteristics and teacher behavior are important issues when discussing reading programs. Therefore, the following six major questions and conclusions about the effective reading teacher comprise the emphasis of this discussion. (1) What criteria can be used to measure teacher effectiveness? The main criterion used is pupil gain on standardized tests. (2) Can observers really distinguish degrees of teaching competence in reading instruction? Supervisors' evaluations of teaching effectiveness do not correlate well enough with pupil gain to be substituted for objective measurement. (3) What forms of motivation or class management produce superior results? The relationship between a teacher's motivational style and pupil learning is not distinct, as  criticism and praise by teachers draw varying results. (4) What forms of cognitive teacher behavior are related to good achievement? Preliminary findings favor frequent verbal interchanges between teacher and pupil and the balanced use of several types of questions. (5) How can the beginning teacher be helped to develop teaching skills? There are such promising new developments in preservice teacher training as microteaching and programed tutoring. (6) How can the experienced teacher keep his interest and enthusiasm high? Superior leadership which involves teachers in planning and encourages them to try out ideas is important.

        "description":"An audiovisual sensory test on 66 educational psychology students supported the contention expressed in Holmes'\"Substrata Factor of Reading\" that the individual differences in the sensory modes are not necessarily highly correlated. It further suggested that there exists an \"intersensory facilitation,\" but that facilitation is probably not at the level of elementary perception but on the somewhat higher levels of cerebral association. Students were assigned to two groups alphabetically; those in group 1 were asked to distinguish between tone pairs and then between pairs of visual wave patterns. Group-2 students were tested first for visual and then for auditory discrimination. Statistically insignificant correlations were found between age and ability to discriminate both sound  and visual pairs. No sex differences were found in either test. Although group 1 second higher than group 2, the auditory test was much easier for both groups than was the visual test. An analysis was made of the auditory and visual scores of the upper and lower 27 percent of students in order to determine whether greater sensitivity in one sense modality necessarily facilitates, inhibits, or is compensated for in the other mode. All the correlations were low and not statistically significant. It did not seem that extreme visual and auditory discrimination abilities measured by the tests were correlated.

There are, however, no clear and concise concepts of the different faces of comprehension which deal with higher mental processes. If the thinking skills are to be implemented, certain objectives must first be met: more research must be conducted in regard to the development of the thinking skills in connection with reading content; techniques in stimulating depth reading must be improved; and there must be an understanding of why studies show that children are not doing well in grasping meanings in reading. Comprehension has taken on many indistinct and overlapping meanings since it first became a facet of reading about 50 years ago; therefore, the author suggests that comprehension be divided  into four distinct categories of thinking skills: (1) literal comprehension, the skill of getting the primary, literal meaning; (2) interpretation, the probing for greater depths of meaning; (3) critical reading, the evaluating and passing of personal judgment; and (4) creative reading which starts with an inquiry and goes beyond implications derived from the text.

The Stanford Achievement Test, Primary I, was administered at the end of first grade, and the Stanford Achievement Test, Primary II, Form Y, was given at the end of second grade. There were no significant differences  between the control and the experimental groups on the two variables at the beginning of grade 1. Mean achievement test scores for pupils in the experimental group were significantly higher than those for the control group both in grades 1 and 2. A significantly higher percentage of pupils in the experimental group than in the control group were reading in grade level in grades 1 and 2.

Reading deficiency was defined as a discrepancy between the level of reading ability expected on the basis of a subject's total mental ability as measured by the California Test of Mental Maturity and the level of actual performance as indicated by the California Achievement Test total reading score. Both tests were administered in the sixth grade during the 1954-55 school year. The discrepancy score was used to define three groups of students: underachievers; average achievers; and overachievers. These groups were compared on concurrent measures of performance, later  academic performance, and later behavior and outcome. Underachievers in reading, as a group, were found significantly lower in performance than average or underachievers in other scholastic areas in the sixth grade, and over the subsequent secondary school grades these results were consistent on ratings of performance reflected in grade point averages and on objective test measures. No significant later behavioral differences were noted across groups. Underachievers had the highest attrition rate. Tables, graphs, and references are included. (Author/WB)",

New words have been coined to describe developments in new industries such as space exploration and computer science, and new concepts have required new words. Therefore, today's students must have large vocabularies. Instructors can make the acquisition of a large vocabulary challenging for the student by developing interest in the origin and development of words.

While aiming at the life style of the student--particularly the student in the ghetto--in terms of reading interests, educators should be less defensive, vague, and secretive about their program results. While applying the eclectically balanced approach required in each teaching situation, they should strive for more results; they should be  goal conscious. To succeed, the Right to Read impetus must become a grass-roots effort. The U.S. Office of Education in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and also state education departments are preparing steps that will support such a movement.

Procedures used in the development included a study of documents describing the five cities' reading programs, questionnaires sent to school officials, on-site visits, analysis of the results of questionnaires and interviews, and the use of these results to design a suitable teacher education program. The five cities studied (New York, Washington D.C., Detroit, St. Louis, and Los Angeles) all had a high proportion of Negroes, extensive \"de facto\" segregation,  depressed achievement levels, and financial problems. The plan devised included course work to bolster gaps in general education; work concerning Negro language, literature, history, and culture; and extensive training in reading. Combined with the course work would be observation, participation, and tutoring in the inner city. Reading training would emphasize pragmatic approaches. A program taking 5 years to complete was envisioned. (WB)",

Outdoor activities for elementary school children, suitable for use in camps, parks, playgrounds or sanctuaries are described. Programs are designed for one-day (K-4), two-day (grade 5), and three-day (grade 6) camps, and are intended to supplement an indoor-outdoor approach to teaching. The programs have been tested with elementary school children at camp Ashokan, New York. Thirty-one investigations are described, each contains a problem to guide observations, suggested observations to be made, and lists of questions for discussion. The investigations aim to increase the childrens' understanding of animal and plant adaptations and of the  interrelationships between organism and their habitats. Possible effects of disturbing the habitat are emphasized. Some investigations require a minimum of simple equipment, others require none. Several activities suitable for rainy days are described, including six games. The appendix gives a summary of themes and teaching schedules, drawings of leaves of common trees and of pond insects, charts for use in some of the investigations, a complete list of materials and equipment required, and a short list of references for teacher and pupils.

It is designed for use with the SPRUCE &quot;Discovery Box&quot; and contains twenty-one sets of investigations based on the twenty-one packets of specimens in the box; three sets are recommended for each of Grades K through 6. Each of the twenty-one topics is introduced by a &quot;background&quot; section giving the rationale of the investigations and background information for the teacher. This is followed by four to ten &quot;investigations&quot;--questions and suggested activities which require students to observe and compare, sometimes to do simple experiments, and usually to extend their observations outside the classroom. The early topics emphasize the use of the senses in  observing, later ones enable students to make discoveries about the characteristics of organisms and habitats. Themes which run through the investigations are constant change in nature and the interaction between organisms and their environments. The introduction to the manual describes the approach of the materials and makes a plea for improved conservation education. Ways in which this can be fitted into the general curriculum are suggested. The contents of the &quot;Discovery Box&quot; are not listed, but can be inferred from the background sections and investigations. This work was prepared under an ESEA Title III contract. (EB)",

Students, supposedly representative, are more often more prosperous or bright or problem-prone than their age group in the general population. Parents, perceiving the school as another private school, often view with doubt or alarm its research and experimentation functions. The dream contemplated no conflict between the demonstration-observation-participation functions and the research-experimentation-inservice functions, but the conflict exists, centered in the differing views of education professors. Instead of combining the roles of master teacher, research partner with professors, and mentor to hordes  of visitors, laboratory school teachers usually see themselves fundamentally as good teachers developing experimental innovating programs. Finally, instead of scarcely requiring justification, the laboratory school has had to fight for its life financially at the mercy of budget-cutters in legislatures or in university governance. Meanwhile the public schools have increasingly become the locale for student teaching or extensive research, and innovations in education come from massive projects financed by national government or by foundations. The friends of the laboratory school must build a better school on a reconstructed dream or it will continue to drift toward extinction through internal neglect and external assault. (JS)",

Two experiments were performed on 40 and 96 subjects respectively, from grades 5 and 6. Each experiment utilized a factoral design involving two levels of test anxiety (Ss having upper- or lower-quartile TASC scores) and two memory conditions (supported and not supported). Experiment 1 subjects, selected from 170 who had completed the TASC, were paired: high-anxious (upper quartile) subjects with low-anxious (lower quartile) subjects by matching with respect to sex and IQ before assignment to the two memory-support conditions. Experiment 2 subjects, selected on the same basis  from a similar group of 379, were divided by sex and assigned at random (with some restrictions) to the two conditions. Experiment 1 involved a puzzle; dependent measures were errors committed and recognition of potential errors. Experiment 2 involved concept formation; dependent measures were trials to criterion, and positive- and negative-exemplar memory errors. Analyses of variance and chi square analyses were performed. Significant main and interaction effects indicated that test anxiety interfered with short-term memory, and memory support reduced differences between performance of high- and low-anxious subjects.

The sample of 57 girls and 76 boys chosen at random from grades 5 and 6 of a suburban upper-middle class school, completed HFD tests, a test-anxiety and defensiveness questionnaire, and a problem-solving task which yielded four behavioral measures. Intercorrelations of all measures, and stepwise regression analyses between subscales, six independent anxiety measures, and IQ were obtained. Findings indicate that total HFD scores were related to self-reported test anxiety (r=.40), defensiveness (r=.24), and response latency in problem solving (4=.91). Individual HFD indices and  subscales had little predictive value. Results indicate limited clinical value of the HFD test as a predictor of test anxiety.

Two seminar groups of seven student teachers met for a series of 10 2-hour seminars during their senior student teaching. They were matched in a pretest-posttest design with control group subjects on the basis of stress or anxiety, social interaction, honor point average, age, sex, and subject matter and/or grade level taught. Seminars, focusing on the immediate problems faced in the classroom, were led by a Specialist in Continuing Education (SCE) whose role was to involve them in self-assessment activities by utilizing a specific problem-solving model. Activities included developing and defining instructional objectives in  behavioral terms, collection and analysis of several types of feedback data, use of force field analysis in resolving differences between goals and practices, and utilization of new resources. Gain scores on attitude scales, pupil opinionnaires, and verbal behavior classification were compared and t tests and chi square tests conducted to determine significant differences. Seminar participants exhibited changes in attitude, verbal communication, and pupil perception which differed significantly from control group subjects; differences were consistent with expectations.

Techniques of modeling (e.g., use of short videotape recordings of a master teacher performing a lesson to illustrate uses of a specific skill) are discussed. A previously unpublished study by the author, in which methods for acquiring the skill of higher order questioning were investigated, is described in detail. Several other studies illustrating the definition of skills in behavioral  terms are reviewed, and the methodology used in the investigation of skill acquisition is described; specifically discussed are the skills of higher-order questioning, reinforcement, probing, stimulus variation, silence and nonverbal communication, and control of small groups. Related research in technical skill development is presented including discussions of inservice adaptations of the approach (e.g., minicourses) and extension to other areas (e.g., microcounseling). The final section on research needs contains some critical analysis of current research and summary of important questions requiring investigation in subsequent studies. (Author/JS)",

It is helpful to distinguish between such materials and the ways in which they can be used and the various educational purposes thereby served. The procedures or formats used in staff development programs can be called \"protocols\"--the way things are done, the step-by-step process by which the goals of professional growth programs are accomplished. \"Protocol materials\" are then defined as audiovisual components of a protocol which are not created within the specific occasion of the protocol. Protocol materials can \"hop\" from protocol to protocol, e.g., an audiovisual model of a paraprofessional leading a  small group discussion may be used in an illustrated lecture or in the more highly structured protocols of model-making or miniteaching. Greater flexibility is thus possible, but no \"mix\" of protocols and protocol materials is of educational worth until the protocol purposes (e.g., the acquisition of various skills, the development of certain attitudes, etc.) are delineated. Some agency or amalgam of agencies should systematically collect and distribute or create and make available such materials in an \"Instructional Performance Library,\" a national communications network which distinguishes materials, formats, and purposes while monitoring results achieved by using certain purposes.

Standardized achievement tests (including the Metropolitan Readiness Test, the Scholastic Aptitude Tests, and the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills and of Educational Development) were administered in the fall of 1968 and the spring of 1969 to control group students and students enrolled in the PLAN program, in grades 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10. Comparative analysis of the data has not been completed, but preliminary results indicate little or no significant difference between the two groups of students in terms of the limited number of instructional  objectives these tests are designed to measure. The experiment supports the contention that standardized tests are inadequate for a comprehensive evaluation of a program of individualized instruction. Results also suggest the need for the development of a new series of achievement tests adapted to specified and expanded instructional objectives of both PLAN and control classes in order that the differences between the two can be more thoroughly analyzed and more effectively evaluated.

Techniques, which consisted of making some consequence (reward) contingent upon appropriate behavior emitted by the individual or group, were demonstrated at teachers' meetings in a predominantly white elementary school, a predominantly Negro junior high, a special education center, a parent group, and a guidance counselor group. Teachers who volunteered to participate (24 percent of a possible 111) recorded data on 367 students and met weekly with consultants for instruction, discussion, and plotting of behavior graphs. Seventy-seven behaviors were observed and counted with 50 attempted modifications of individual  behavior, 20 of group behavior. Data was to have covered three basic observation phases: premodification--for baseline data; modification--introduction of the contingency; and postmodification--withdrawal of contingency. However, 37 premodification phases were not followed by modification; 26 behaviors were graphed through modification and 19 were completed through the final phase. Results indicate that modification techniques can be applied by teachers, parents, and guidance personnel to produce significant changes in behavior of children from all walks of life.

        "description":"An 8-week summer institute (three weeks background and preparation, two weeks practice, three weeks summary and translation) was conducted to improve and reorient the abilities of selected high school teachers by giving advanced academic training in the areas of Mexican language, literature, and culture; and by relating these areas of experience to the teaching of Spanish to Spanish speakers in the American Southwest. Four participants were Anglos; 24 were native speakers of Spanish in the Southwest. A core of continuing classes included study of the literary and cultural heritage of modern Mexico, teaching methodology, and culture conflict. Flexible scheduling allowed for a number of guest lectures, field work with junior and senior high school students (demonstration classes,  tutoring, etc.), an unscheduled field trip to Huasabas, Sonora (in isolated rural Mexico), extracurricular newspaper and theatrical groups, and films. Participants gained (1) new knowledge of books and other materials suitable for the classroom; (2) new knowledge of programs in other districts, some with federal funding, designed for Mexican-Americans; (3) new awareness of Mexican-American publications, organizations, and activities across the Southwest; (4) a clearer idea of the nature of large-scale public dissent and its repercussions, planned and otherwise, personal and organizational; and (5) for the Anglos, a sharp awakening to what it feels like to be a minority.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the effects of student evaluation of teachers on teaching effectiveness and on student ratings of their instructor. The effectiveness of student evaluations as a measure of teacher merit were also observed. Subjects were the students of four psychology instructors, all of whom taught separate sessions of the same course for two successive quarters and used the same textbook. On the first day of the winter quarter all students were given an exam under the pretext of obtaining data for an independent experiment. Achievement was measured by the improvement on a second exam given the last day of class, at which time students were asked to rate their instructor. During the spring quarter an identical procedure was followed except that the instructor  was aware, as he had not been the previous quarter, that evaluations would be used. Major conclusions: The instructor's knowledge that he would be rated by his students (1) did not improve his effectiveness as measured by achievement tests and (2) tended to improve the rating given the instructor by the students. There was a low but significant relationship between the student's rating of how much he had learned and his test achievement. The student's evaluation of the effectiveness of a particular instructor were as valid as similar evaluations by the department chairman when compared to achievement test scores. (Achievement test, rating scale, and analyses of variance results are included.) (JS)",

Ninety student teachers were randomly assigned to five treatment groups: a control group and four experimental groups differing in the extent to which students were matched to cooperating teachers on the basis of demographic and/or personality variables such as socioeconomic status, rural-urban background, religion, security, autonomy, innovativeness. Demographic and personality data was collected from a variety of sources including files, questionnaires, Q-sort, and interviews. Performance and attitude measures included attitude inventory pre- and posttests, student and teacher questionnaires and interviews, supervisor  and cooperating teacher evaluations, and time budget analysis interviews and interaction analysis observations conducted three times at equal intervals for a sample of 10 randomly selected students from each group. Data analysis included various statistical tests for verification of controls, determination of predictor variables, and analysis of differences among the five groups. Major findings: The methods of matching used, as a composite, did not produce results superior to traditional student assignment; within-group comparisons appear to demonstrate the theoretical advantages of matching in general. Full findings and data-gathering instruments are included. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (JS)",

The differences between the pairs of observation were expected to reflect positive  change over the hypothetical period of accelerating growth. Significant differences were found on 14 IA scales and on 15 OScAR scores; OScAR scores were also rescaled to form orthogonal contrasts, and 14 of these new scales indicated significant changes in teaching behavior. Overall results: In May the intern teachers were describing more, using more divergent questions and less convergent questions, and being less evaluative and more neutral in their responses; there appeared to be a shift from direct student response to student initiated responses with student responses more often accepted or neutrally evaluated rather than praised or criticized.

The program consisted of (1) two preservice conferences covering information on materials organization, room arrangement, computer services, individualizing the student's programs, tutoring and counseling skills and (2) inservice consultant services. Behavioral objectives were written to be achieved in the conference setting and performance criteria developed to define desired classroom behaviors. Materials were presented as modules consisting of sets of objectives and activities which could be completed independently or with  partners or small groups; they included written material, filmstrips, slides, and problem-solving games. Training conference activities incorporated the social learning techniques of scheduled reinforcement, imitation, and successive approximations. The use of consultants as change agents provided the means for individualization of the affective variables. Consultants visiting a teacher's classroom identified and reinforced some desired behaviors and aided in the acquisition of others through such techniques as review and supplementation of conference materials, reinforcement of approximations of appropriate behavior, and several types of modeling procedures.

Stufflebeam includes sections on the state of the art in educational evaluation and on the nature of  evaluation. The final essay by Walcott H. Beatty, \"Emotion: The Missing Link in Education,\" focuses on self-concept, motivation, and learning and the promotion of affective development. The second half of the book is an annotated resource list of 133 instruments already developed or under development for measuring eight different categories of affective behavior. The categories and number of instruments reviewed in each are Attitude (10), Creativity (7), Interaction (15), Miscellaneous (19), Motivation (27), Personality (23), Readiness (3), and Self-Concept (29).

Thus it needs to deal with the functions of stimuli, laying the foundations of a prescriptive theory that concerns itself with the relationship between how things are presented and how they are learned. Research questions must be formulated in terms of the interaction between stimuli and cognitive functions. The hypothetical stimulus dimensions suggested here might lead to the formulation of theory-oriented research questions. The first dimension--the amount of information or response uncertainty--is superordinate to the others and should provide answers to  the general question of how much motor, observational, perceptual, or conceptual activity is undertaken by the learner. The second--the explicitness of presenting information to be learned--ought to indicate how much specific mental activity takes place as a result of exposure to a certain kind of stimulus presentation by a particular learner. The other dimensions--the distance between the mode of presentation and the learner's level of mental development and the activation of specific operations as a function of stimulus structure--answer the question of what mental operations are called for by different kinds of stimuli and which are prerequisite to extracting information from them.

        "description":"A pilot inservice training program for supervising (cooperating) teachers was planned in which traditional roles were modified. It was theorized that decentralization of the responsibility for supervision of student teaching would allow better utilization of the college supervisor's training and time, opportunity for inservice growth and increased professionalization for the supervising teachers, and more relevant supervision for student teachers. The focal point of the plan was the acceptance by the supervising teacher of the major responsibility for guiding the professional growth of the student teacher. College supervisors did not observe student teachers or confer with supervising teachers except as invited consultants. Instead they conducted weekly seminars for supervising  teachers (during a half day of released time) to provide knowledge and skill development in effective student teacher supervision. Typical seminar topics were role expectations, conference techniques, behavioral objectives, verbal and nonverbal interaction analysis systems, and student teacher evaluation. College supervisors also conducted weekly or bi-weekly seminars for student teachers for application of methods and curriculum background and discussion of problems they faced. An instrument utilizing the critical incident technique and two questionnaires were developed to evaluate the program; overall findings indicated that general reactions by both teachers and students were consistently favorable.",

A systematic program of recorded observation (involving 70 first-year junior or senior high school teachers enrolled in an internship training program for college graduates) yielded four pairs of records made in the classrooms of each of the 70 teachers--a total of 280 pairs of records. The 10 factors considered in comparing the two techniques according to the principles of rotated factor analysis are: (1) lecturing behaviors, (2) question type, (3) question difficulty, (4) pupil initiations, (5)  criticizing behavior, (6) listening behavior, (7) extended accepting behaviors, (8) question source, (9) permissive behavior, (10) managing behavior. Although each observation system gives some information not provided by the other, the authors suggest that, since OScAR 4V keys are based on twice as many basic categories as are used in FIAT, they may prove more helpful in feedback applications (i.e., in giving clearer indications of the specific kinds of behavior which a teacher might consider if he wished to change his score in a particular area).

Research into diagnosis and remediation of  specific linguistic deficiencies of a selected group of educationally disadvantaged pupils involved (1) an analytical study which showed positive results in describing the linguistic deficiency, (2) a summer program undertaken to design specific instructional procedures aimed at remediation (described in appendix A), and (3) an evaluation of the effectiveness of these procedures as applied in the classroom (to be completed in the near future).

The recommendations are presented in two major sections, one concerned with standards for basic teacher education programs (programs for the initial preparation of teachers through the fifth-year level, including M.A.T. programs) and one concerned with advanced programs (post-baccalaureate programs for the advanced preparation of teachers and the preparation of other professional school personnel). Standards relevant to each of these two program levels are further classified according to the following categories: (1) curriculums, (2) faculty, (3) students, (4) resources and facilities, and (5) evaluation, program  review, and planning. Each standard is defined in a one-sentence statement which is accompanied by a general explanation and by specific questions intended to aid in interpretation and application of the standards. The introduction to the booklet presents background information related to the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and to the purposes and process of accreditation. Emphasis is placed on the attempt which has been made to maintain flexibility and \"to develop standards which encourage individuality, imagination, and innovation in institutional planning.\" (ES)",

Among the essential elements of the internship program are: (1) its role as a part of South Brunswick's long-range system-wide Organization Development Program; (2) a 2-week summer program involving interns, cooperating teachers, and college supervisors in human relations training and in the cooperative planning of the work of the following 4-week period; (3) the 4-week inquiry-centered school in which teacher-intern teams worked with small groups of pupils who came to school mornings only, leaving afternoons free for  further planning and continuing and immediate diagnosis and evaluation; and (4) follow-up during the fall semester of teaching, being observed and participating in periodic seminars under the direction of the college supervisor. Objectives and values of the program are summarized, with emphasis upon the genuine professional contributions the interns were able to make to the total school program and upon their increased sense of involvement, self-confidence, and personal and professional growth.

        "description":"Realizing that most teachers are quite adequate in their own background of knowledge and skills, sensing the growing threat to students and teachers of the impersonalization and isolation in many crowded classrooms today, the In-Service Training Program Emphasizing the Affective Dimension was innovated at Wheeling High School, Illinois, during the 1967-68 school year. The main objectives were: (1) to expose teachers to situations which would result in their being willing to look at their own behavior and its effect on the atmosphere as well as the behavior of the group, (2) to develop in the teachers an increased desire to consider each student as an individual, and (3) to involve the teachers in assessing their own behavior in the classroom setting. Most of the sessions were  video-taped. This gave the participants the opportunity to see first-hand the value of video-taping and analyzing their classroom activities. Monthly all-day seminar sessions were held involving three types of seminar groups: (1) for beginning teachers, (2) for second-year teachers who were members of a seminar group last year as beginning teachers, and (3) for \"veteran\" teachers. Membership of each group represented all disciplines and remained the same throughout the year in order to build a strong expansion of the program to involve five of the six high schools in District 214 is now in process.

The teacher of a heterogeneous group must insure individual student progress by differentiating the levels, content, and objectives of work assigned. In the homogeneous class structure, he must create experiences which differ in kind, not volume, for high, average and low groups--e.g., independent study for high, teacher-directed committee work for average, and concrete, utilitarian objectives for low. The core program implies a thematic, interdisciplinary approach where the understanding of language arts is enhanced by sociological,  historical, and other implications of a topic, with the use of varied audiovisual materials and resource people. If teacher performance is to be evaluated competently, then an awareness of new developments and goals is essential. (MF)",

For example, language research in generative grammar can be used as a basis for providing the student with a \"descriptive consciousness\" of the way components are taken apart; literature can be viewed as an object to be used to enhance one's articulation through allusion or quotation; and composition can be an activity to develop the writer's natural ability to  speak with a unique voice on his chosen subject. The teacher would become a trained counselor who listens and then prescribes specific books, exercises, and programed texts to meet each student's individual needs. (JB)",

Mellon points out, for example, that \"mature syntactic fluency,\" not \"mature style,\" is the chief concern of his method of sentence-combining and that this method is not intended as a writing program, but rather as a game-like activity to enrich language development. He also indicates what he believes to be of final importance in his experiment--that (1) planned enrichment of the student's language environment does foster linguistic development, (2) syntactic fluency can be  used successfully as a variable to measure this enhanced development, and (3) sentence-combining tasks do provide successful enrichment activities.

The notion of a deep structure of meaning underlying a sentence's surface structure was revised to embody elements representing negation, command, and interrogation, and to reveal subordination and coordination. \"Meaning-changing\" transformations became unnecessary. The complicated subcategorization system was replaced by a non-hierarchical model which represented the characteristic features of individual words in a part of the deep structure called the lexicon. Although a 1965 book by Chomsky, \"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax,\" incorporated these modifications, linguists were still not satisfied with the  adequacy of deep structure in representing some areas of meaning. They sought a deeper, more abstract level of structure \"where the various semantic notions would be separated out\" and where a concern with sentences would give way to a concern with propostions. Nevertheless, the essential human mystery of language remains. (LK)",

The communication approaches of the classical period, dialogue and argumentation, gave way to a more \"manuscript culture\" in the Middle Ages, and, by modern times, books had almost completely replaced oral communication. Today, however, communication by sound is enjoying a revitalization. This trend is illustrated in the new emphasis on spoken language, in the audio-visual resources available in libraries and homes, and in the enormous influence of radio and television. The heightening of the oral-aural element has subtly enlarged the personalist element in American culture. The TV  discussion show, the emphasis on personality problems, and the perpetual search for personal identity reflect this self-conscious personalism. For language and literature study, the cultural change has shifted the focus from rhetoric back to dialogue and has underlined the importance of voice in human activities. To respond today to literature and culture, the teacher must seriously reflect on contemporary communications media. (LH)",

Teachers should initiate for children meaningful experiences with other cultures to help them appreciate the differences and similarities among people. One way to develop positive self-images in culturally different children and thus introduce the sharing of home traditions with classmates is through the \"show and tell\" time in class. Tape recorders and cameras can be useful in recording stories and classroom projects; puppets, songs, dances, and masks can draw children into role playing; ceremonies and feast days of ethnic groups can stimulate the learning of traditions; parents and  community members may participate in discussions of their cultural backgrounds; and books can enlarge children's contacts with other groups of people. Through such meaningful experiences, children can engage in interdisciplinary study, acquire pride in their own culture, practice the cultural roles they will play as adults, and, later as adults, be able to respond to other cultures on an international level.

A non-dogmatic approach, a free classroom climate, and the use of an inductive, team-teaching method are essential, although a variety of teaching methods should be used. The humanities curriculum should be spiral, extending over a number of years, and should be considered a vital part of the school's overall plan. The faculty should be committed to humanistic values and should teach students, not courses. The  humanities program should be open to all students for exposure to a wide range of experiences relatable to their own lives and for encouragement in creative expression.

The papers of the control groups were evaluated by marginal comments, whereas the compositions of the experimental groups were evaluated with the aid of the dictating machine. The teacher's remarks were transcribed in duplicate; one copy was returned with the student's paper while one was retained by the teacher. The first and last papers of all groups were evaluated by a three-man team in terms of content, mechanics, diction, and expression. The experimental  group was found to have made more improvement than the control group on 19 of 25 comparisons. The results, too indeterminate to indicate superiority for the experimental process, suggest that the experimental procedure has merit for improving composition and that further research over a longer period of time should be undertaken.

Participants relate experiences which show that students enjoy such improvisational activities as role-playing, and in the process develop self-confidence and sensitivity to themselves and sometimes to literature. Geoffrey Summerfield outlines the uses of  drama in British schools, and Robert F. Hogan indicates the potential of improvisation for developing students' power over their language and for stimulating imaginative involvement with literature.

The subjects were elementary and junior high students, who were placed in both summer school and full-year programs. The full-year program group at junior high level showed the most improvement. These initial findings indicated that disadvantaged children with learning problems were responsive to individualized instruction programs. Data also showed that misbehavior, poor attendance and unsustained  effort are reflective of avoidance motivation rather than a lack of interest in and concern about academic achievement. (KG)",

Such children are verbal, possess a language fully developed to serve the needs of their \"world,\" and think effectively enough to survive in a sometimes hostile environment. Certain basic assumptions must be made in order to communicate with such group: for example, that in non-standard English, time, whether critical or not, is only optionally expressed in the verb if expressed elsewhere in the sentence or indicated by the context. Thus, from the linguist's point of view, the language behavior of this population is highly predictable, and what appears to be occasional divergences from the standard are really parts of a pattern,  which every teacher must understand if efficient teaching and learning is to take place in the classroom. This can be said for other minority groups as well, with the modifications made necessary by contrastive analyses of the specific groups' native language and English. (EM)",

Subjects tended to perceive themselves--and to see significant others as seeing them--in generally positive ways. However, Negro subjects scored significantly lower, on the average, than white subjects. Both Negro and white subjects reportedly held high positive perceptions of the ways in which they are seen by their mothers and their peers. Subjects who  perceived themselves positively tended to see others as perceiving them positively, as was the case with negative perceptions.

Specifically, Jensen's identification of IQ scores as a measure of abstract reasoning and problem solving and of levels of ability, and his evaluation of the magnitude of the genetic component in IQ scores, are stated to have raised serious questions. The alternative hypothesis presented is that the distribution of the genetic component in the white and Negro populations both, which Jensen postulated was a reflection of the observed differences in IQ scores, is considered the same in both groups. Using the model from quantitative genetics, it is assumed that the IQ score (the phenotype) can be represented as the sum of two  components: (1) that resulting from the genetic structure of the individual (the genotype), and (2) the sum total of all the non-genetic influences (the &quot;environment&quot;). Detailed but simplified mathematical analysis is used to demonstrate that Jensen has omitted consideration of the effects of environmental influence. The need for research on the evaluation of environmental effects involving a wealth of hitherto ignored cultural and psychological factors is emphasized.

The major findings show the Negro and white populations of Stamford to be estimated as 10.0 percent and 90.0 percent respectively in 1966. Any school having more than double, or less than half the percentage of the representation of Negroes in the city population, was classified as racially segregated. By this definition and on the basis of the 1966 student census conducted by the superintendent of  the Stamford public schools, 12 of the 17 public elementary schools were classified as either Negro or white segregated.

Teachers should help a student develop his ego, or internal control, as a controller and rewarder of his behavior. Order and consistency in the class room situation and individualized instruction help strengthen ego control. Students need to learn to predict their own learning in relation to their effort to learn. A successful program should let students know what their  responsibilities are, participate in making decisions about their work and give them accurate information on their progress.

It gauges the effect of the complete desegregation of Chapel Hill schools on its fifth, seventh, and ninth grade students. The achievement scores of those students who attended segregated schools during 1965-66 were compared with the scores of the students who later attended desegregated schools. Comparisons were then made between students in grades five, seven, and nine of segregated schools with students at the same grade level who had experienced one and two years of desegregation. Desegregation in itself does not appear to have had any significant negative effects on the academic achievement of either race, the only significant changes having  been of a positive nature. In general, Negro students failed a higher percentage of their courses than did white students during the period of this study. However, this may well be due to the orientation of the curriculum and teaching methods of Chapel Hill schools to the average middle-class white student. (JM)",

Reportedly, lack of sufficient time  prevented MOREL staff from conducting complete analyses of the evaluation findings.

        "description":"The key factor to the de facto inequality typically maintained in America's city school system is found to be the teacher assignment system. Data from 69 cities are examined to determine whether this meant a systematic tendency to assign Black teachers to Black students. Poor and non-white students are kept at least partially segregated, and the more experiences and more verbally able white teachers are assigned to schools attended by the less disadvantaged white children. There is a strong regional dimension to this inequality and discrimination found existing in the school systems. Effective discrimination rises more or less continously as the South is approached, reaching a maximum level of complete segregation of students, with all Black students taught by Black teachers, and  all white students taught by white teachers. Outside of the South, there is also some evidence that racial integration in the schools is reduced as the percentage of Black students, and especially of Black teachers, increases. Black students are then more likely to be segregated, and less likely to be assigned to white teachers. The relationship of effective pupil discrimination to pupil segregation and to a discriminatory teacher assignment is analyzed in a technical appendix. (RJ)",

The migration during the 1950's of the urban white population to the suburbs initiated a significant change in the economic and demographic structure of the American city. Simultaneously substantial numbers of nonwhites, mostly Negroes from the South, were migrating to the inner city in search of job opportunities and high wages. However, traditional job opportunities in urban manufacturing were decreasing. For example, manufacturing employment in New York City declined by 18 percent between 1953 and 1965, compared with a gain of 7 percent for its suburban counties.  Also, between 1960 and 1965, the inner city Negro teenage population increased by over 50 percent. Within this setting of industrial and demographic change, vocational education and employment are examined with particular reference for minority youth and for requirements of manpower and training programs. Related reports on national trends and on profiles of the states are available as ED 029 112. (CH)",

Teacher responses consisted of the assignment of ratings to 40 items on a Likert-type scale. Ten teachers were selected from each of the 4 states with two teachers representing each of five disciplines: vocational agriculture, home economics, trade and industry, distributive education, and business education. The verimax rotation method of factor analysis extracted a total of 14 vectors in which one or more of the 40 variables showed a factor loading of .50 or greater. One implication of such commonalities within the five disciplines is a  possibility for a common core of training experience within broadly based vocational teacher education curriculums.

The 12,000 teachers of these students also conducted programs for approximately 350,000 young and adult farmers. Vocational education programs in agriculture are being updated through increased use of multiple-teacher departments, development of area vocational centers, curriculum revision, work experience programs, addition of prevocational programs, and development of programs for youth with special needs. Post-high school technical and continuing education is becoming more imperative in order to advance and  retain jobs. Persons who have studied vocational agriculture in high school achieve as well or slightly better in college than student who have not. In a 40-year study, it was indicated that slightly more than 40 percent of the high school graduates were employed in farming and related occupations.

The Vocational Education Act of 1963 established broadened objectives and enlarged appropriations but did not tie funds to performance. Lacking that tie, no effective leverage existed to entice federal, state and local vocational educators from the orientation of 1917 to that needed by an advanced technical society. The 1968 act did more than relate appropriations to objectives. It expanded the definition of vocational education and removed some of the narrowing structures which had sharply differentiated vocational from academic education. It insisted upon comprehensive state planning and sought to strengthen the federal leadership role through  national and state advisory councils with independent staffs, budgets and authority. Though there are pitfalls in the act's interpretation and administration, it represents a major contribution toward preparing people for employment and substantial leverage toward achieving new objectives. A discussion of the 1968 Report of the Advisory Council on Vocational Education serves as a basis for evaluating the potential of the various thrusts of the 1968 amendments. (DM)",

The analysis of occupations is presented from both a group-centered and person-centered position. Within the group-centered analysis, organizations, work groups, and communities are discussed, and types of social relationships are delineated. In the person-centered analysis, situs and station concepts are introduced and discussed. Some of the dimensions of roles useful in analyzing occupational structure are studied, including orientation to group boundaries, span of association, and dominance. Four independent variables--culture, personality, situation, and interaction--are introduced and their relationship to the occupational  structure is described. The study also covers occupational role stresses, several theories of occupational ranking, and the dynamics of occupational behavior. Finally, a methodological framework is suggested for research in occupations using the role theory approach, including attention to data-collection methods, interviewing, sampling, questionnaires, and analysis.

A pretest, post-test, random choice design was chosen to obtain data from over 900 subjects of technical-vocational schools, area community colleges, and high schools of Iowa, with emphasis on grades 11 and 12 and upon technical and scientific subject-matter. An apparatus consisting of a visual shield, an audio-blocking control, and an audio-control system, was developed to control the experimental subject's environment. Mental ability records of high school students were used to group subjects in three categories, while the analysis of variance single class and the t-test were used for grouping the other subjects. The findings indicated that three  of the four hypotheses were accepted: (1) Visual control was not effective in increased learning, (2) Audio-visual control using commercial ear pads to block sound was not effective in increasing learning, and (3) No interaction was found between mental ability levels and the types of treatments.

The relationship between competency in shorthand accuracy and achievement in shorthand dictation, is studied in Part I. Results of three word-list tests of 200 words each, administered to 135 students, indicated that success in shorthand was significantly related to ability to construct accurate shorthand outlines. Part I describes a comparative analysis of the results obtained from the Gregg Shorthand method and an experimental instruction method. The results at the end of 9 months of instruction were in favor of the experimental group, which had a significantly higher dictation rate, and higher shorthand accuracy and transcription scores. An analysis of the  effect of selected variables on achievement, discussed in Part III, found that: (1) Student achievement declined significantly when the length of dictation increased from 3 to 5 minutes, (2) Student achievement declined significantly when the transcription was deferred by 1 week, and (3) Students who wrote incorrect shorthand outlines in taking dictation usually did not transcribe correctly.

The groups in the study were: (1) farm families who submitted records for analysis in the 1967 Minnesota Farm Management Program, (2) farm families who had dropped out of the program later than 1964, (3) farm families selected at random from 10 counties, and (4) agriculture instructors responsible for farm management programs. The 70 percent response to the 90-item attitude instrument revealed a general improvement in  attitudes related to more years of instruction, with a strong suggestion of diminishing marginal returns. Families in other than well-organized programs had scores negatively related to instructors; in well-organized programs scores were positively related. All differences in attitudes were very slight. There is a need for a revision of methods, subject matter, or both if adult vocational agriculture instructors want to claim significantly-improved attitude as a product of their educational program.

The Cobb-Douglas production was used to evaluate the relationship. The function used labor nonfarm capital, agricultural capital, and the average level of education for the independent variables, and a linear equation was developed using logarithms. The results of the survey were not conclusive. The labor and agriculture variables were significant at the 95 percent level but the latter had a negative regression coefficient. The negative sign showed that agriculture was not in equilibrium, which in turn caused overinvestment in  agriculture. The signs were positive for the nonfarm and education variables, but they were significant only at the 90 percent level. One explanation was that the education variable did not account for the variations in contribution to economic growth of the different educational expenditures. Another reason was that the nonfarm capital estimate was not a good approximation of the true capital value. (BC)",

Specifically, this report considered labor market experience of Negroes and Caucasians, personality variables, social and family characteristics, community factors, and educational and training opportunities. A structured interview questionnaire was developed for school dropouts, business and industry, and educational institutions. The interviews were made by trained personnel. The study concluded that the unemployment rate for teenagers was not high, and that the difference between Negro and Caucasian jobless rates were not as great as anticipated. There was some discrimination in the labor market, but the results were not conclusive. Occupational  training and level of schooling were correlated with a favorable labor market experience. (BC)",

The Commission's task was to determine if belief in technology's value for education is justified. The starting point of the study is learning. The value of any technology used in education is therefore measured by its capacity to improve learning. In the conviction that technology can make education more productive, individual and powerful, give instruction a more scientific base, make access to education more equal, more democratic, the Commission concludes that the nation should increase its investment in instructional technology. Six recommendations are proposed: (1) Establish the National Institute of Education--well funded and broadly  based; (2) Establish a National Institute of Instructional Technology within the National Institute of Education; (3) Establish a national center or library of educational resources; (4) Propose projects to demonstrate the value of technology for instruction; (5) Support programs based on stepped up research and development to train and retrain administrators, teachers and specialists; (6) Establish a National Council of Education and Industry. The Commission envisions that education can be improved by the possibilities inherent in the new technology. The Commission believes that following its proposals will help achieve this vision. (ON)",

Summer  training workshops for counselors, and the establishment of large and small pilot centers in each state, are now part of the project.

Methods were a literature review, a questionnaire survey of deputy heads, followup interviews with departmental officers, a study of industrial policy, and consultation with an advisory panel. Much unevenness was found, with marked variations in frequency of reimbursement by occupation, salary, and size of jurisdiction. Reasonable satisfaction with terms of the present policy was expressed except regarding the bar on second language learning. Training Board expectations about department and agency management had not been met and improvement was required. In many cases  planning and programing of training had been incomplete; policy interpretation and application, defective; and need determination and benefit assessment, rudimentary. It was recommended that reimbursement be total for job related employee training, with extended scope to cover certain direct training costs beyond tuition and examination fees.

A series of biannual conferences for those interested in adult education began in late 1954. A more formal structure, the British Columbia Adult Education Council, was created in 1957 and continued until 1962, when it was replaced by the British Columbia Division of the Canadian Association for Adult Education (CAAE). The Council, run by a committee of eight representing a broad range of agencies and organizations, had been set up to coordinate individuals and organizations in adult education and to provide a clearinghouse for ideas. Among its activities had been seven semiannual meetings on liberal education, current trends in adult education, adult  learning, public affairs education, the role of adult education, and correctional education. As set out in a CAAE annual meeting on June 2, 1962, functions of the new Division included providing special focus and leadership, information services and consultation, representing the CAAE in negotiations with other bodies, promoting adult educator training, increasing and diversifying the CAAE membership and financial base, and conducting special projects and research.

Three of these might be referred to as the intellectual model (consisting of lectures on the host country culture), the area simulation model (placing the trainees in a surrounding which in some way resembles the country in which they will be working), and the self-awareness model (providing sensitivity training in the hope that it will make the trainee receptive to a new environment). A more valid approach would be to follow the culture-awareness model: by making trainees aware of the nature of culture, in the anthropologists' sense of the term, they will be better able to view a culture, either their own or someone else's, with objectivity. A drawback in developing a  consistent approach in Peace Corps training programs is the emphasis on short term arrangements in planning and staffing, with little or no continuity from one program to the next.

Three 30-week courses (Communication, Elements of Government, and Economics) were included in a special supplement to the paper; the publishing of the supplement was financed mainly by a grant from the Milton Obote Foundation. Although problems were encountered with finding and holding tutors competent to mark the exercises, and with maintaining the interest of students for the length of the course, it was felt that the newspaper was an excellent instrument for exploitation in formal adult education programs, and that more courses should be initiated through the  newspapers. Resident tutors assigned to specific areas of the country attempted to arrange evening classes and lectures in conjunction with or supplementary to the correspondence course; where this was possible, the face-to-face teaching experience was found to be very valuable. Results of a questionnaire completed by students indicated generally positive impressions of the program. (mf)",

It was asserted that written symbolization serves as an economical means of reality comprehension and testing. This basic function of symbolization must be learned and accepted psychologically as an essential operational premise if symbols are to be employed profitably. It was argued that the failure of the illiterate to accept this premise may account in part for his illiteracy. The performance level was first tested on symbol items which were visually tied to \"real\" things. The attention span of the two samples were tested on a paper-and-pencil task. Finally, an instrument using abstract symbols was administered. The  results were in the direction predicted. Further studies seem warranted to differentiate the several factors involved.

        "description":"This project developed an informal reading test from adult basic education teaching materials and investigated reading performance at six levels among adults attending basic education classes. Graded word lists, readiness oral reading passages, and graded oral reading passages were administered to 37 adults. The six most discriminating word lists were identified, along with six pairs of adult interest reading passages having similar readability levels and producing similar error scores. The work identification test, the warm-up passage, and a form of the informal oral reading test were then given to 56 adults. (The first two instruments helped determine the difficulty level at which testing could begin.) Substitutions, examiner help, and added or omitted word endings were the  most prevalent errors. Poor readers required more words pronounced than better readers. Reading speeds of better readers began to decline by the seventh level while error rates and comprehension remained steady. Comprehension remained fairly consistent for all levels of readers. The average adult answered three out of five factual questions correctly. (author/ly)",

The key element of the Lantran coding is the use of the Pinyin phonetic romanization which has been officially standard in Communist China for the past 10 years. The end letters in the full coding for each character are the phonetic transcription of the pronunciation of that character in the Pinyin. Since many characters have the same pronunciation, the first part of the coding indicates as concisely as possible which particular character is intended. In general this means specifying the radical of the character and the number of additional strokes required, these two items together with the  pronunciation being sufficient to correctly identify the written character in all but a few cases. The key board arrangement pictured is that of the Frieden Communications Terminal generating USASCII code for computer. (Authors/AMM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to discover: (1) whether or not adults can discriminate between the babbling of babies learning different languages, and (2) the approximate age at which discrimination is possible. There were two tests involved in the experiment. The identification test consisted of 20 babbling samples, each of which was 15 seconds long. Of the 18 different samples (two were repeated), six were from American babies, six from Russian babies, and six from Chinese babies. The babies ranged from 5 months, 29 days to 17 months, 9 days. The same-different test consisted of 24 pairs of babbling samples from the three linguistic environments. Half the samples were from 5-6 month old babies and the other half were from 16-17 month old babies. The items in each pair were  matched for age, and the &quot;different&quot; items were matched for sex; all possible combinations, within these limitations, were presented in equal distribution. Results indicate that adults can neither identify the babbling of infants raised in different language communities as English or non-English up to the age of 17 months, nor judge whether two samples from infants at a given age are from the same or different language communities. However, subjects' decisions were not entirely random. (Authors/DO)",

Priority has been given to the aspects of the child's language which identify him as a nonstandard speaker, particularly in grammar, as it was felt that there is less social toleration of grammatical differences than other differences (in pronunciation or vocabulary). The lessons in this manual focus on the absence of forms of the verb \"be,\"\"were\" as the past plural of \"be,\" and the third person singular ending \"-s\" or \"-es.\" The instructional sequence begins with the teacher telling a story or asking questions to  elicit the desired sentence patterns. Sentences are described as \"Everyday Talk\" or \"School Talk,\" depending on the verb pattern used. After the activities stemming from the children's own statements are concluded, pre-written sentences and stories in \"Everyday Talk\" are introduced for practice in changing from one form to the other. These activities are followed by pattern practice drills and dialogs as well as written exercises in \"School Talk.\" Each child is asked to give an informal oral presentation using \"School Talk\" at the end of each unit. Detailed teaching suggestions are given. (AMM)",

Previous attempts (Stanford Achievement Test, California Achievement Test) have failed to test American Indian children's performance in reading, vocabulary, and language because these tests are not designed to measure linguistic skills. The norms and standards of such tests are derived from populations far different from the American Indian children in BIA schools, many of whom are either non-English speaking, or seriously deficient in English. The major objectives of this Project are to develop a battery of tests consisting of three parts: (1) three oral-aural techniques to measure proficiency in  perception and production of spoken English, (2) two techniques for testing proficiency in listening comprehension, and (3) a paper and pencil test designed to measure the level of proficiency in written English grammar. Although not specifically within the scope of this three-year project, it is felt that the testing instruments being developed will be of great use in assessing proficiency in English for other non-English speaking groups.

The focus is on differences in verb usage existing between the children's oral speech and the standardized dialect; each of the units in the Series places emphasis on only one verb pattern. Each unit (book) contains two versions of the same story--the &quot;Everyday Talk&quot; story and the corresponding &quot;School Talk&quot;  story. Books 1-3 appear as one edition, Books 4-7 are in two sets. Book 8 has only one set of stories, which serve as a review of standard verb forms introduced in the Series. The stories are about the child himself, his community, and his ethnic group. The books are illustrated and contain blank pages for the child's own sentences, stories, and drawings. These books, as well as the present Teacher's Manual which provides teaching suggestions and an explanation of the methodology, are available from the Psycholinguistics Project of the Chicago Board of Education.

The author covers the following points: (1) transformational grammar--some background and some claims, and some linguistic and psychological implications; (2) which, if any, of the claims of transformational grammar are germane to language teaching; and (3) how, specifically, some of these claims might be utilized by teachers of language. He concludes that the teacher should know the structure of the language he is teaching from a transformational grammar point of view. He feels, however, that not all the claims of transformational grammar (for example, linguistic universals) have relevance to language teaching. Some interpretation and selection are  needed and must be supplied by the language teacher himself after he has made his grammatical study. The author concludes with a discussion of several areas where a transformational view of grammar might be of some assistance in second language teaching: (1) the phrase structure rules of transformational grammar can serve as a meaningful guide in selecting simple constructions for presentation before more complex ones, (2) transformational analysis can help determine which sentences are really more complex, and (3) it can show relationship of one structure to another.

A three-way instrumental technique of research was developed: (1) The spectrograms of utterances that have been composed and recorded for a special purpose were analyzed and those of English compared with the corresponding ones of German, Spanish, and French. This led to hypothesizing about the acoustic differences between English and the other languages regarding certain phonetic characteristics. (2) The hypotheses were verified or refuted by  means of spectrographic synthesis. (3) Motion picture X-rays of the utterances were made and studied frame by frame by means of special projectors, to discover the articulatory features that correlated with the acoustic ones found by spectrographic analysis and synthesis. As a complement to this instrumental research, phonetic features of English and foreign languages were investigated by statistical analysis, related to such features as phoneme frequency and distribution and syllable types. &quot;Two notes on Semitic Laryngeals in East Gurage&quot; by R.

The possibility of applying sociological-geographic models for the diffusion of innovation to linguistic diffusion is investigated. The case of the Macedorumanian nomads in the Balkans is used to illustrate the method. (Author/DO)",

        "description":"The relevance of general semantics to subject areas in the behavioral sciences has been established many times over, although the application of the principles concerned does not always reflect acceptance. The problem of semantics as related to mental retardation has great importance as life affecting decisions are made in accord with beliefs and practices growing out of the use of the system. Some of the characteristics of a semanticly appropriate system are: (1) it would produce some desirable results, (2) it should allow better communication, and (3) there would be greater agreement among users on the use of the system. In examining outcomes beyond school, the classification system for mental retardation has even less success in prediction. One of the reasons that the mental  retardation classification has continued is the involvement with the medical profession, where classification systems are very strong. Many problems that recur seem ample evidence of the results of ignoring the importance and relevance of general semantics principles in devising a classification system. (Author/KJ)",

For this study, eleventh grade students from four states completed a questionnaire. Several new areas of student life were investigated in this report. Among these are guidance contacts with counselors and teachers about work, and information about counselors and teachers. Students also used a series of 20 role behaviors to describe themselves in three different situations: (1) at home, (2) at school, and (3) with friends. For each item  response in this grade 11 report, it is possible to observe similarities and differences between the sexes, across aspiration groups, and among the four states. One noted conclusion was that grades as an incentive to learning are more attractive to girls than to boys. Complete data tables are presented according to student response to the questionnaire.

The results showed the following variables distinguishing boys and girls who entered work directly: (1) living in either a rural or metropolitan area; (2) wanting to remain near home; (3) having fathers with an elementary school education; and (4) having poor mathematics and science achievement. Boys who entered work were also rated poor by their teachers in personal appearance, industriousness, and getting  along with others.

The developmental model depicted in Chapter Two is based upon several premises underlying guidance in the elementary school: (1) guidance is an integral part of the total education process, (2) guidance is concerned with the developmental needs of all children, (3) guidance is focused on the student as a learner in the educational setting of the school, and (4) guidance activities should be organized along a developmental continuum. In Chapter Three the  assessment techniques used are described. Results include the belief of teachers that counselors have something special to offer to the elementary school. Chapter Five gives comments and recommendations by teachers and parents. Among these are recommendations on: (1) the introduction and role of the counselor, and (2) working with parents.

Facilitative conditions are discussed relative to the research in this area. Models of counselor client functioning are discussed. These models are based on levels, one being the lowest and five being the highest level of facilitative conditions. The research done uses these levels in evaluating taped interviews. Results include: (1) the level of formal preparation bears little relationship to the helper's level of functioning, and (2) at least half of the counseling relationships in which the typical school counselor  participates are apt to have harmful consequences to the student who comes for help. Implications of these findings indicate that: (1) a clear division of labor among counselors depending on the facilitative conditions they can offer is needed, and (2) there is need for continued development of counseling skill and sensitivity as well as personal development beyond formal training programs.

Cross-agency comparisons have great potential and emphasize the importance of the development of a data bank equipped to handle both descriptive and evaluative material. The Counseling Services Assessment  Blank was recently developed and adopted, along with a standardized mailing for the evaluation of counseling center feedback through a data bank being developed at Colorado State University.

        "description":"Using Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance as a model, this study attempted to change the attitude and behavior of children toward well liked toys. The results offer only limited support for the theory. The subjects in the three groups did play a significantly different amount of time in the two play periods. The t-tests indicated it was the children who received the mild threat who were playing differentially. They played less in the Post play period and most in the Final play period. This study does not support Freedman's (1965) findings of the effects being maintained across time. These results indicate that the effects of not playing initially are at least partially compensated for later. The results of this study though tending to support the theory of cognitive  dissonance for short-term behavior change raise doubts about generalizing the positive results of published studies to populations that have not been investigated. It further indicates that more careful empirical study should be given the nature of threats and toys selected, for use in studies of this kind. Finally, this study warrants the conclusion that studies of dimensions as complex as attempted attitude and behavior change in young children require the utmost precision and preliminary research to rule out other factors which may effect results in an unascertained manner.

Instruments included an interview schedule, a thematic apperception test depicting school scenes, an opinion survey, a questionnaire, a Q-sort and a decision-making interview schedule. Results indicated that the major differences in attitudes, perceptions, motives and decision-making styles were almost exclusively due to school differences, and not to sex. Urban school pupils viewed learning as passive obedience to  teacher directives. Suburban pupils exhibited both the strongest hostility toward learning the strongest extrinsic motivation for studying, a trend most prevalent among the boys. In decision-making the suburban pupils tended to rely on directions from others but to a lesser extent than in the urban school. In the small private school, the pupils manifested intrinsic interest in learning, substantial self-direction decisions and a strong sense of personal independence. (Author)",

Subjects were 71 students (graduate) enrolled in the Counseling and Personnel Services curriculum at Western Michigan University. The Rokeach Dogmatism Scale (RDS) was used to test for open-mindedness; the Berkeley Public Opinion Questionnaire (Berkeley POQ) for tolerance; Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) for general mental health; and the Strong Vocational Interest Blank (SVIB) for  personal-social interest. Peer Group Ranking (PGR) was also used. Conclusions include: (1) strong predictive potential of PGR, (2) the relationship between open-mindedness, tolerance, personal-social interest, general mental health and effective counseling was found to be positive but insignificant.

A major hypothesis was that the impact of reference groups on this decision will be a function of the extent to which an individual identifies with that group. Consequently a major effort was made to determine the nature and extent of identification with the reference groups of family, peers, and school. Data were collected from 2,030 ninth, tenth, and eleventh graders in two Chicago high schools by use of an administered questionnaire. Results indicated that family influence could partially explain not dropping out, particularly if high family integration, strong identification with parents, or pro-education values held by  parents are considered. Peer influence was also found to be important. If a student's friends place a relatively low value on education, he will be more likely to drop out. Teacher's values toward education was not found to be a meaningful variable. However, whether or not students identified with the teacher indicated some influence on students' behavior. (Author/KJ)",

However, the distinction is made between the social obligations of a psychologist as a citizen and his obligations as a professional. The main concern of the psychologist lies in the study of small groups and individuals. Social reform on the large-group and institutional level is in the domain of other behavioral scientists: anthropologists, sociologists, and political scientists. The need and value of retaining psychotherapy and individual treatment as sources of self-initiated change is emphasized. Three suggestions are made for  the professional contribution of psychology in the field of social reform. First, psychologists should involve themselves in changing social institutions in which they are involved. Second, psychologists should serve as consultants to governmental agencies which implement change. Third, and most important, psychologists should concern themselves with the development of methods for fostering good human relations by changing the social stimuli to which individuals are subjected.

Results show that: (1) group E1, which was the only group exposed to the films, showed a  significant pre-post change; (2) group E2 showed the next greatest change, perhaps due to group process supervision which was present in groups E1 and E2, but not in group C-1.

Drugs are any substance which by its chemical nature affects the structure or function of the living organism. Abuse refers to any use of a non-medically approved drug or of a medically approved drug for non-medically approved purposes. The greatest increase in drug usage is in the use of mood changing drugs, particularly marihuana. Many of the reasons young people use drugs are the same as the reasons for adults using drugs: for fun, to facilitate interaction (social), to feel better, and to relieve boredom. The effects of drugs are varied depending on sex, age, state of health, and individual  differences. Whether the outcomes or reactions are good or bad is a value judgment. Much research is needed for more information on drugs and their use. Limiting the supply of a particular drug does not decrease drug use, but rather causes the user to look for another drug. Drug education is badly needed. Furthermore, instead of treating the problem, we are attempting to regulate the symptoms. Perhaps more care in dealing with basic problems or at least identifying these problems will help solve today's drug problems. (KJ)",

The propinquity index may be used in two ways in helping the individual develop his educational and vocational plans. Converted to a propinquile, it can constitute one of many separate items of information used in arriving at important decisions. In many circumstances the propinquity index may function  better as one of the predictors in a multiple regression equation to predict a dichotomous group membership criterion. (Author/KJ)",

The sample consisted of 198 younger (under 50) and older (over 50) blacks in a low income area within a Southern city. The three major areas studied under kinship relations included interactional activities, mutual assistance patterns and subjective patterns of kinship relations. Regarding the changing conceptions of growing old, the younger persons were rejective of old age while older persons tended to emphasize some advantage, in addition to negative factors. With the probable increase in the number of unhealthy older blacks and negative attitudes toward the aged the status of the aged black  will probably tend to more nearly approximate that of the elderly white. The maintenance of effective kinship relations however provides some base for companionship and assistance in old age and unless too many social workers interfere black communities will continue to maintain the greatest amount of support and comfort for the elderly and their aged will continue to try and be useful.

        "description":"The goal of the present study was to investigate the relation between sex, social class as indexed by parental education level, and performance on three different types of cognitive tasks among two year old children. It was expected that social class would be related positively to superior performance on all the tasks for girls but unrelated for boys. The subjects for this study were 48 white children aged 27 months. A trained woman administered the first two tasks to each child. These were an Embedded Figures Task (EFT) and a two choice discrimination task. The third task, vocabulary recognition and vocabulary training, was administered during a home visit made within a week after the administration of the other tasks. The findings clearly support the hypothesis that parental  education is related to performance on cognitive tasks among two year old girls but not among two year old boys. The possible reasons for this are: (1) girls may be biologically more homogeneous than boys due to girls' general developmental maturity relative to boys, and (2) social class has a stronger influence on the way mothers treat their daughters than on the way they treat their sons.

Separate analysis of males and females in five classes between 1962-1968 indicated significant increases in more recent classes in regard to cynicism and distrust of human nature. Another major finding was an increase in overt anxiety.

Data were available from 159 males and 199 females from 17 sixth grade classrooms in 17 schools within the Kansas City school district. Attitudes toward school were measured with the Pupil Opinion Questionnaire (POQ). Items were formulated on an a priori basis to tap three distinguishable components of school experience: (1) teachers, (2) school work, and (3) peers. A fourth component was labeled school in general. Academic achievement data consisted of grade equivalent scores averaged over the six components of the Stanford Achievement Test. Results include: (1) in the reciprocal effects between attitudes and achievement,  achievement is much more frequently the causal factor but, except in the case of attitudes toward teachers, those effects are in an incongruent direction, and (2) among the four attitude objects, the preponderance of incongruent over congruent achievement was greatest in the case of attitude towards school work. One implication noted is that incongruent achievement influence on school orientations should be very infrequent in a \"good\" educational program. (Author/KJ)",

        "description":"The problem examined concerns the extent to which the family orientation, in terms of its status characteristics and socialization patterns, has influenced the unique styles of campus-based politics that have emerged in the United States during the 1960's. The objective is accomplished through a general statement of the role of the family, accompanied by a discussion of the associations between family status and socialization, socialization and student politics, and between family status and student politics. This is followed by the presentation of the multivariate theoretical model under investigation, a description of the student sample, the theoretical model operationalized in terms of its endogenous components, the method of investigation, research findings and a discussion  of results. Results indicate that of the 600 college students in the sample, representing most forms of political beliefs: (1) about 30% of the total variance in direction of student politics could be explained by the variables in the model; (2) family politics proved the strongest predictor of the direction of student politics, with offspring closely following the political views of their parents; (3) both social class and family politics directly affected student politics but had no effect on socialization; and (4) religion alone was able to explain variance in the direction of student politics directly and sequentially through family political argument.

        "description":"Some observations on the nature of altruistic behavior and the consequences of these observations for a theoretical and experimental psychology of altruism are discussed. Altruistic behaviors are very pervasive since they satisfy a wide array of egotistical motivations in addition to having an autonomy of their own. Because of their ability to meet numerous human needs altruistic behaviors are difficult to interpret but it is suggested that normative altruism, which arises from maximizations of personal gain, and autonomous altruism, which is done for its own sake, may not be as separate as they appear and may develop from the same constellation of capacities. A theory of altruistic development is outlined which states that the first stage, normative altruism, is dominated by the  dynamics of reward and punishment and this is characteristic of young children. Once children surrender egocentricity they become capable of an intermediate level called affective altruism and this involves experiencing the needs of others as your own, an alteration from egocentrism to allocentrism and the presence of empathy and sympathy. The final level of altruistic commitment requires the elements which characterize earlier stages plus prosocial affective learning. (RM)",

The three main roles in a group are: (1) facilitator, (2) focal member, and (3) observer. The use of an additional therapist affords the opportunity for therapists to assume the focal member role without loss of group control, that is without clients assuming the facilitator role defensively. Further advantages include: (1) the focus of authority is distributed over the several therapists, making it easier for each to participate as a real person, (2) group therapy trainees can participate without the full responsibility for the group and freely assume all three roles, (3) therapists who are present can observe the group interaction for research purposes and  during post session analysis, check out their \"inter-judge reliability,\" and (4) therapists of different orientations and styles can interact to their mutual enlightenment and individual clients can find, from among the available therapists, the one with whom each can communicate most effectively.

Findings suggest that students from a middle socioeconomic background who were enrolled in the individualized-contract form of classroom organization attained expected levels of academic achievement. There were numerous indications that students in the individualized program were acquiring less positive attitudes about learning, school, fellow classmates, and themselves. The teachers in the  program were generally positive in their responses to the program.

After each, the effectiveness of the series was measured in game-like tests given to several hundred children both before and after viewing the exhibits. Results showed that gains from pretest to posttest were highly significant. The learning effect appeared fairly uniform for all age groups and for boys and girls.

In study I, the necessity of postulating separate learning processes for tasks which are traditionally classified as STM tasks as opposed to LTM tasks was investigated. Results indicate, for both Study I and Study II, that the same storage system is involved in learning a span series, requiring only one presentation and in learning a supra-span series, requiring multiple presentations. In Study III an investigation was made of the relationship between memory span and the retention of a sub-span series of numbers following a period of intervening activity. Results showed that large memory span subjects (Ss)  show better recall after intervening activity than small span memory Ss. In Study IV two experiments were performed to determine whether memory capacity measured by a digit span (DS) test is the same memory capacity involved in solving syllogistic reasoning problems mentally. Conclusions bore out the above hypothesis, however, training in solving problems reduces the load that is placed on STM. Two experiments in Study V showed that memory capacity measured by a DS test is also involved in storing \"Meaningful\" English words when the words are stored verbatim. (Author/KJ)",

There are four different alienated student groups: (1) the New Left activists, (2) the advocates of Black Power, (3) the Hippies, and (4) the Third World Liberation Front. Each group is discussed and the difference between previous difficulties and present day difficulties is considered. The reasons for today's problem of student unrest being so different and so difficult is twofold: (1) the peculiar nature of youth today as affected by historical forces, (2) the opening up of schools beyond their essentially intellectual function to a direct and reciprocal contact with society and conflict. One marked difference between yesterday and today's alienated youth is the level of hostility directed toward  existing institutions. Concerning the second point on the role of schools, three main points are made: (1) educator's need to discover the fine line between talking and doing, (2) this line must be nurtured into healthy vigor and its centrality to the community must be explained, and (3) channels for active involvement in community affairs must be provided through outside organizations. A total of nine specific suggestions of how schools might take the initiative in involving students in constructive ways are given. (Author/KJ)",

The second best predictor is the extent to which \"Salvation\" is valued. On an 18-item scale, militants valued salvation 14th while non-militants ranked it 3rd. Occupational preference is the third best predictor, students preferring science or business being less militant. A fourth predictor is father's education, with the father of militants tending to be better educated.

An Interest Opinion survey was also conducted among all residents of married student housing.  The survey was concerned with housing, social organizations, and social activities.

The second project consisted of three student marriage seminars consisting of four couples each.

The third project was the setting up of an experimental social center. The social center was not totally a success; few people used it.

The first experiment was designed to examine \"contrast effects\" (shifts in the rated value of a stimulus away from the contextual values) when all attitudinal information was received from two strangers before attraction responses were assessed and each stranger expressed agreement or disagreement on different topics. Subjects were 40 students pretested on a 44-item attitude scale. Each subject listened to tape recorded responses of two strangers who responded alternately to 22 items on the attitude questionnaire and then the subjects responded to each on the Interpersonal Judgment Scale. With 10 subjects in each group, four  combinations of agreement (A) and disagreement (D) were created. (AA,DD=no contrast; AD,DA= contrast). Agreers were more attractive when paired with agreers than when paired with disagreers and disagreers were less attractive with agreers than when paired with disagreers. Thus when stimulus and context were inconsistently paired, a contrast effect was evident. The second study partially replicated the above but used sequential mimeographed attitude responses. A contrast effect was again found. Findings are discussed in terms of the Stapert-Clore drive arousal and reduction hypothesis. (RM)",

A third priority of concern is not only with the role of the patient or with the sickness in an individual, but with the well behavior of the designated patient. Fourthly, there are those with special needs growing out of the  nature of their life experiences, the criminal, social deviants, and mentally retarded. The next high priority is for those who lack essential services (the poor), the children and youth, and the elderly. The sixth group high in priority is those persons who occupy a negative imposed social position such as ethnic minorities. The two final target groups are: (1) the minority of white men in positions of real power, (2) the vast majority of white men who have power ascribed to them simply by virtue of their being white.

This theory is an individual-environment matching model with four basic components: (1) the work personality of the individual, (2) the work environment, (3) measured work adjustment, and (4) work adjustment outcomes. The individual's work personality is defined by two major sets of structural components: his abilities and his needs. The work environment is also defined in terms of two major sets of variables: abilities required for successful performance and rewards or reinforcers. Work adjustment can be measured by job satisfaction and job satisfactoriness. The instruments used for operationalizing the Theory of Work Adjustment are: (1) for abilities, those tests used by the  U. S. employment service; (2) for job satisfactoriness, the Minnesota Satisfactoriness Scale (MSS); (3) for job satisfaction, the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ); (4) for vocational needs, the Minnesota Importance Questionnaire; and (5) for occupational reinforcers, the Minnesota Job Description Questionnaire. The development and use of these tests are presented. Implications for further use are given including actual use in industrial psychology. (KJ)",

He also points out Williamson's philosophy on student participation and responsibility, as well as communication and university responsibility. Willis E. Dugan, in \"The Impact of the Minnesota Viewpoint on Counseling Under the Leadership of Edmund G. Williamson, uses the Greek term arete in describing the development of the Minnesota SPS. Arete, while difficult to define, means an emphasis on man and his relation to the ideal of excellence. He goes on to describe three models for arete: (1)  the Homeric, (2) the Sophistic, and (3) the Socratic. He uses these models to describe then the programs Williamson set up. He also discusses Williamson himself. The pamphlet concludes with an article by Edmund Williamson, \"On Striving to Become a Liberally Educated Person.\" In this article, Williamson presents his philosophy of student responsibility and its relationship to violence and dissent.

Research on instructional media has demonstrated that any format for training can be effective if designed according to what is known about teaching-learning linkage. Audiovisual hardware, macro forms of learning, laboratory experiences, and curriculum level structure are considered. Relating continuing educational  outcomes to job performance criteria for the rehabilitation counselor is complicated in many ways, including the relative independence among intermediate criteria of counselor performance.

Six topics are discussed. First, institutional disruption or dissatisfaction with the institution of marriage in whole or part seems quite prevalent among college students. Secondly, since this is a time of rapid change during which old ways are being reevaluated, alienation from established ways, i.e. marriage, is increasing. Next, given a certain amount of institutional looseness and a sense of alienation, there are new opportunities for deviance, such as living in a non-marital arrangement. Further, universities may, today, in some ways be creating a radical intelligentsia which focuses on social forms not seriously  considered previously as within the realm of possibility. Communes and communal living may be the result. Group support, by teachers, peers and parents also has a definite influence on unmarried liaisons. Finally, many themes, values and sentiments contribute to the adaption of unmarried liaisons, including individualism, resourcefulness, and self reliance. (KJ)",

The parents were told about their role in their child's school performance, the skills their children would need in school, and how they could foster the development of these skills in their child rearing practices. Results show that participation in a parent education program can produce significant changes in child rearing attitudes and practices. The experimental mothers showed a significant increase in behaviors nurturant of  identification and cognitive growth in the child. Among the greatest changes in group members were an increased sense of mastery, and enhanced aspirations for themselves.

Time limits on tests pose a bigger problem since another variable is introduced, pressure. Test taking motivation must also be considered. The test could be too easy or too difficult, thus boring or frustrating the individual. Reliability is also a difficulty, since there is no true reliability computed for an individual. Proper application of computer technology permits a solution to many of the problems raised by standardized tests. The tests would be individualized, with items of known difficulty grouped or stratified by level of  difficulty. The testing situation could be tailored to fit an individual's preferences and/or abilities and disabilities. Administrative fluctuations and test taking motivation could be eliminated. Individualized item sequence would tailor the test to the individual, as far as difficulty is concerned. Through the item sequence, reliability would become more accurate, as the computer could more exactly pinpoint levels of difficulty. (KJ)",

This paper presents a plan that is being initiated in Minneapolis. The plan is based on the premise that highly trained psychologists should make their contributions on the broad front of school or system-wide problem solving and problem prevention, and assessment functions and studies of individual children are also an important part of psychological service. The broad objective of the plan is to experiment with the utilization of differential levels of training and function. The functions of the master's degree level psychologists  (Level One) include: (1) individual mental measurement, (2) assist in the use and interpretation of group test data, (3) crisis intervention, and (4) discussions with parents. The Level Two psychologists will supervise Level One psychologists, and work on staff developmental programs as well as provide other psychological services in the community. Graduate students and other resources in the community can also be used in this plan. (Author/KJ)",

Experiment Two duplicated the above using digit-nonsense syllable combinations as the paired associates. The next three experiments were designed to investigate the contributing effects of practice time to superiority of response prompting over confirmation in paired-associate learning. Experiment Six duplicated One and Two except that the first letter cues were provided both during the learning and recall sessions. Experiment Seven investigated the influence of mode of stimulus presentation, partial stimulus support, and length of item on short term memory.  Although the facilitating effects of the prompting technique have received a great deal of attention, Experiments Three, Four and Five indicate that the advantage is primarily due to the additional practice time available with this method. In a second paper, subjects in two experiments learned lists of paired associates with or without prompting on first letter cues.

The concept formation task required the production of instances of the concept embedded in sentences. The treatments were: rule verbalization (RV), rule application (RA), production of instances of the concept (P), and no training (NT). Subjects (Ss) were 75 Negro fifth and sixth graders run individually. The analysis of variance and post hoc comparisons indicated that treatments RA and P did not differ in effectiveness and both were significantly more effective than treatment RV. RV was significantly superior to NT. The high SES group learned  in significantly fewer trials than the low SES group in all treatments except NT. On a mastery test requiring the production of instances of the concept embedded in sentences, the Ss who had attained criterion on the concept attainment task were superior to both the Ss who had failed to learn and the control group which received only the mastery test. The latter two groups did not differ significantly. These results indicate that concept formation is facilitated by the same instructional procedures for both high and low SES Ss. (Author)",

This project was able to conduct functional task analysis of jobs in 16 human service agencies. From 217 interviews and extended observations, the project task force has recorded over 2,000 tasks, which upon restructuring, produces new job descriptions for career ladders in 7 related functions: community organization, health service, group work, social service administration, case work, child care, and mental health. The  findings to date indicate the feasibility of utilizing the existing resources of the community colleges for a correspondingly restructured core curriculum to facilitate the widest possible choice of career entry. This report therefore presents the beginning works of both the career ladders (lattices) and the core curriculum on the two-year college level.

Recommendations derived from the study encourage the strengthening of existing linkages for citizen participation and point out the need for new methods especially to involve poor and minority groups. In those cities where mechanisms for citizen participation were working well, leadership was emerging within the schools as well as in the community to solve  educational problems.

The major causes of ineffective councils are homogeneous membership, weak leadership, and misinformed faculty advisors. Principals should take the initiative in solving these problems. To break down homogeniety, the council should represent groups divided along curriculum lines and student members at large should be appointed to broaden membership. To avoid weak leadership, the council should select its own officers. Full faculty support of the council is necessary if the faculty advisor is to be successful. In addition, the advisor must balance his actions to achieve a feeling of independence by the council. Of necessity, the faculty advisor must be aware of  parliamentary procedure and school law and policy, and be able to empathize with the young. To insure viability of the council more concern for activities relating to teaching, learning, and community service should be encouraged, rather than the customary fund-raising and dance-sponsoring activities.

This study was designed to sample parent opinion. Four hundred parents, constituting a 20% random sampling of the 2,000 students enrolled in grades 10-12, were mailed questionnaires in May 1969. Responses were received from 328 parents for an 82% return. The 25-item questionnaire measured attitudes toward large-group instruction, small-group instruction, independent study time, and general attitudes toward the Mitchell program. Parents expressed positive feelings toward all aspects of the program, with small-group instruction being rated the highest followed by large-group instruction. General attitudes and opinions on independent study time  tied for third place rank. Parents of college-bound students favored the program more than parents of students headed for a job, vocational training, or the armed forces. For the total sample, 72% believed modular scheduling should be continued, 22% wished it would be discontinued, and 6% were uncertain. (Author)",

Religious communities tend to be organized structurally according to the traditional bureaucratic model of (1) relatively rigid structure; (2) carefully defined functional specialization; (3) direction and control implemented through a formal authority hierarchy; (4) fixed patterns of rights, duties, and procedures; and (5) relative impersonality in interpersonal relationships. Criteria for describing interpersonal competence are listed as: (1) perceiving the situation accurately, (2) solving problems so that they remain solved, and (3) continuing to be able to work with the other person(s). The structure of the formal organization, along with the existing values  and norms governing interpersonal relations in religious communities, combine to maintain a decreased level of interpersonal functioning.

In the revision, items were written at a transformation or evaluation level. Based on a field test at Loyola University, an item analysis of the data indicated an improvement. The revised background information form was constructed to be more selective among applicants and thereby to improve future institutes. Both a second and third edition of the attitude inventory were tested in a field sample of 29 Loyola  students to determine the relationship of the inventory's factors to the individual's performance on the achievement quiz and his background information form.

Six elementary schools in three school districts in a Midwestern State were studied. Three schools were \"traditional,\" the others were multiunit schools. Questionnaires were administered to 132 elementary school personnel asking them to (1) list the main tasks that they performed; (2) nominate people in the school that they felt had power of three types--authority, influence, and esteem; and (3) answer questions concerning job satisfaction and the types of behavior that they perceived as being rewarded by administrators and teachers. The study supports, to some extent, the relationship between the task structure and power  allocation. Three basic findings that support the need for further research are: (1) Influence and esteem seem to be related to the same task factor in the schools; (2) power seems to be located in the same task factor where fewer people score high; and (3) of the three power variables, authority seems to be more closely related to \"official title.\" (Author/MF)",

The study population totaled 25 high school debate directors and 40 college and university debate directors. Four tape-recorded debates, in which an affirmative team presented a \"typical\" comparative-advantages case, were sent to coaches for critique and evaluation, structured around several suggested questions. The objective of the study was to develop models to aid coaches and students in developing their comparative-advantages cases. The models also could eliminate the confusions present in textbooks and articles concerning speaker responsibilities and the proper organization of such cases. In  general, however, the study was disappointing. The population sample was too small and the general nature of some critiques made evaluation difficult. However, the comparative-advantages method is an acceptable form of case construction although a model case seems difficult to organize. (Author/DE)",

The data used in the study were gathered from 1,250 professional staff members in 49 public schools in Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Idaho, and Utah. The participating schools were classified into innovative and organizational-climate levels through use of questionnaire instruments. Another instrument determined whether the decision-making structure in each school was centralized or decentralized. The findings indicate that the educational decision-making structure does not measurably influence decisions of professional staff members to adopt innovative practices. However, more innovation was indicated in schools with greater  openness of organizational climate. It is concluded that factors such as personality characteristics of the administrator, his willingness to adopt innovative ideas, his leadership style, and the diffuseness of the communication network may have more influence on decisions to adopt innovative ideas than the structure of decision making.

The workshop was designed to (1) develop an understanding and appreciation for systematic planning and programing techniques, (2) develop an understanding of the social and economic problems that face distributive education, (3) acquaint its participants with types of base line data needed to develop balanced programs, (4) develop an understanding of the scope of the distributive education program including pre-high school services and interdisciplinary approaches, and (5) develop a model for use in program development and evaluation. Consultants gave presentations covering seven major areas of systematic program planning.  Participants completed a workshop problem designed to take them through a total PPB experience. They produced a model for use in PPB for distributive education personnel. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (Author/MF)",

Ninety-five persons from all parts of the nation attended the sessions, including directors of educational research and development programs, professors, administrators, and research associates. The training sessions sought to provide participants with a background in selected management concepts and principles. The participants are expected to implement the concepts and principles through specific programs, to instruct others in the techniques, and to disseminate information about the research management process to educational administrators. Content areas of the program included the management concepts of planning and controlling,  network analysis, the systems approach, work-flow techniques, problem analysis, and decision-making procedures. The report includes participant evaluations. Bibliographic material and a list of all participants are appended. [Forms on pages A-2 and A-3 may reproduce poorly due to small print.] (JK)",

The problems involved in determining optimum school district size are discussed and characteristics of inadequate districts are studied. Five criteria of optimum size are described, including (1) scope of program, (2) range of educational services, (3) the community, (4) administrative and instructional staff, and (5) the economic base. Trends in district reorganization, especially decentralization and community control, are discussed and a table is included that summarizes, from research literature, recommendations for optimum size. The conclusion of the report is that size must be viewed as a variable and not as an absolute factor. Situational  variables are strong and may profoundly influence the size-quality relationship in a district. (Author/MF)",

Case histories were assembled from available medical and psychological data. During a program of experimental relationship therapy, controlled observations were conducted to evaluate each child's linguistic functioning. Although case studies constitute the main contribution of the research, additional findings were as follows: there was a high incidence of first born males of Jewish parents of relatively high socioeconomic status; severe family disorganization had occured in seven of the 12 families; prior to residential placement the children had a wide  range of diagnoses; many atypical medical signs were present in the children's birth histories and later diagnoses; there was a significant correspondence between reports of their behavior during the study and reports made previously by other case workers; the majority of the children exhibited indifference, unresponsiveness, minimal or no speech, stereotyped or ritualistic behaviors, hyperactive behavior, and eating and sleeping problems. Observations of speech and language suggested central nervous system dysfunction and the language deficits persisted despite the relationship therapy. (JB)",

Forty institutionalized and 40 special education educable mentally retarded male adolescents, randomly selected from among the 93 pilot study subjects, were assigned to one of the following four treatment groups: easy task-knowledge of past performance plus statement of goal, hard task-knowledge of past performance plus statement of goal, easy task-knowledge of past  performance only, and hard task-knowledge of past performance only. The 80 subjects were tested alone on the spelling tasks by a single experimenter. Results indicated that higher scores were associated with goal setting than with feedback information only, and that higher scores were associated with the easy task rather than with the hard task. The expectation that goal setting would be superior to non-goal setting in terms of performance on a hard task but not on an easy task was upheld for the public school sub-sample but not for the institutionalized sub-sample.

The techniques employed were children helping each other, making their own worksheets and tests, charting their own progress, tutoring those in lower grades, doing independent projects, and using and devising their own diagnostic tests. The results indicated that the children developed better attitudes and enjoyed school more, improved in  social skills, learned to progress by their own efforts, worked harder, and gained more than a full school year's progress.

        "description":"Recognizing that punishment for aggression often is noneffective or inadvertently reinforces the aggressive act, the authors discuss an alternative approach and provide an explanation of the exchange theory of aggression. Three classroom experiments, operated with children chosen as the most severe behavior problems in a local school system, are reported. Teachers were initially allowed to teach as they usually would to provide baseline data. Observational reports showed chaotic classrooms with the teachers rewarding aggressive behavior. Token exchange systems were introduced according to the needs of the classroom. Anecdotal records and tables of data showed substantial reduction of hyperactive behavior and destructive acts with a resulting significant increase in attention  level and class cooperation. Reversals of the conditions with the return to the baseline, no token exchange environment, showed a return to the original aggressive behavior, however, when the token exchange system for cooperation was reinstated, a significant decrease of aggressive acts resulting in a more productive learning environment was noted. Case studies detail the effects of the exchange system on two pupils and show the effect of restructuring the rewards in token exchange programs which were not immediately effective. (WW)",

At the end of the 1-year program the results indicated that phonemic braille could be used with beginning braille readers; the analytic approach appeared to function more effectively for the  phonemic materials than the synthetic approach; grade 1 approaches were not adequately measured; and further research is necessary with development of more adequate materials utilized to make generalizations concerning approaches in braille reading.

        "description":"The utilization of non-professional personnel as language teachers was investigated using forty residents and an equal number of controls who were matched on the variables of CA, IQ, and Language Age (mean CA 13.28 and mean IQ 33). Two former psychiatric aids were trained as language developmentalists by classroom experiences, informal discussions and reading material pertinent to language acquisition. The language aids were provided with appropriate language development materials and supervised by a speech pathologist. A token reinforcement system was used in all classes. Results showed the children attending language classes made significantly greater raw score gains in the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities than did the control group (CG) over the 18 month period.  Significantly greater gains in IQ scores were made by the Language Training Group; their mean pre to post IQ score gains were 3.64 points compared to .22 points for the controls. Results suggested greater use of nonprofessional persons in the education of retarded children, while utilizing professionals as consultants. Lesson plans for this project can be found in EC 004 827.

Analysis of the data indicated that a score combining the subscores from the body-part and laterality sections was predictive of the total battery score (r equals .92); no significant sex differences were obtained, but those with IQ's above 80, the totally blind, and children above 13 years scored generally superior to lower IQ, younger, and partially sighted children; the IQ and total test battery score were related (.40); and the total population was incapable  of projection into the tester's reference system.

The growth of suburban metropolitan areas surrounding populous urban areas in the past several decades contributes to complex school building problems. The lack of adequate planning by suburban school officials has frequently caused school children to be housed in substandard school environments. Reasonably accurate predictions of future school enrollment prevent overcrowding crises and tax revenue wastes. This Baltimore study considers the variables of location, type, number of bedrooms, number of children, living in assessed valuation or rental costs of dwelling units. The study  concluded that pupil yield varies by geographic area, type of dwelling unit, number of bedrooms per unit, value of dwelling unit, and the size of the lot on which the housing unit was constructed. The method developed by this study for predicting future pupil enrollments has applicability for other large emerging suburban school systems. (JZ)",

A maintenance or rehabilitation oriented approach is not a realistic answer to continued facility usage.

Several examples of realistic modernization programs are shown in which emphasis is placed on new functions and activity relationships. The answer to the problem might be found in utilization of advancing technology. Old buildings should be developed as supporting facilities for a flexible system of readily transportable learning environments.

For upper floor rooms of two story houses, overall insulations of 35-40 dB were obtainable, providing transmission through the roofs and down flues were also reduced. The noise levels caused by ventilator fans operating at maximum output varied from 45 to 33 dBA, and the noisier units should be quieted to not more than 35 dBA. The numerical values of sound insulation in dB averaged over the range 100 to 3150 Hz, and the level reductions, outside to inside, in dBA, agreed closely. The helicopter noise source spectrum used for testing typified many broad band noise spectra, so this close agreement may therefore find application in practical  noise control. (TC)",

The approach of each institution to the Act's major emphasis on research and training is illustrated by publication schedules and substantive focus; 178 publications and major unpublished reports generated collectively by the seven institutions are listed. The variety of substantive focus was, in part, due to institutional responsiveness to manpower problems peculiar to their particular geographical areas. However, broad manpower issues, such  as labor force behavior of special groups and manpower utilization, were also researched. Other facets of the programs included integration of the manpower studies into masters and/or Ph.D. degree programs, involvement of 110 faculty members through an interdisciplinary approach to manpower research, substantial financial support for approximately 150 students participating in the manpower programs, and conferences and symposiums.

Each year 750,000 people enter the job market without the necessary skills and attitudes for employment. Schools can prepare young people to realize their potential; the failure rate is so high because of improper attitudes, inadequate programs, and insufficient money. There is a national attitude that says vocational education is designed for somebody else's children. The federal government invests $14 in universities for every $1 it invests in vocational education programs. Students should have multiple choices within high schools; separate vocational schools or distinct vocational tracts should be exceptions in a technical and changing society. A full range of post-high school  programs and prevocational education is needed. Educating youth for employment costs less that educating them for the college they will never reach and providing remedial training thereafter. The added cost of vocational education is a reason why most school districts have failed to take responsibility for providing it adequately. It is recommended that the federal government exercise leadership by allocating funds to correct the basic problems identified. (DM)",

Vocational education served almost one million more persons in 1967 than in 1966. Every occupational area showed an increase in total enrollment. Approximately 95 percent of those completing vocational programs and available for placement found employment. Ancillary services were supported as essential elements to the further development of vocational education. Efforts in the areas of program management, planning,  and budgeting indicate a trend toward closer coordination and control of vocational education programs.

This document is that report. Sources of information include: the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, other federal agencies, professional associations, and educational institutions. Deliberations of the National Advisory Allied Health Professions Council are also reflected. The major chapters treat: (1) the provisions and implementation of the Act and the accomplishments of grant programs, (2) allied health manpower supply and requirements in  the medical, dental, and environmental health areas, and (3) allied health manpower education and training needs. A general conclusion is the need to bring together the many skills essential to the maintenance of health in an effective manner, and the dependence of this effectiveness upon quality education and training. Particular attention is called to the development of a broad range of allied health occupations. The major recommendation is for a 1-year extension of the Act. (JK)",

        "description":"Visits to 35 industries and professional offices throughout California and interviews of 219 draftsmen and supervisors were conducted to determine: (1) the effects of automation on the needs of industry for draftsmen with general versus specialized training, and (2) the curricular revisions in vocational drafting programs in junior colleges to meet the needs of automation. A survey questionnaire was sent to 87 public junior colleges to identify: (1) the general nature of the programs, (2) which colleges were using computer assisted design and drafting for numerical control, and (3) which colleges had an established program in architecture, engineering and production. Visits were made to 20 of the most innovative colleges and 44 instructors were interviewed. The conclusions were:  (1) There is very little need for skills or knowledge regarding computer-aided drafting at present, (2) Automation is not greatly influencing the needs for draftsmen, (3) Numerical control machining operations had little effect on the draftsman's work, (4) More emphasis should be made on curriculum content, and (5) Teachers of drafting should relate job descriptions to their students.

        "description":"These two curriculum demonstration projects on bilingual readiness in the earliest school years contain many similarities. Both were formed on the thesis that young children can and will learn a second language readily and that the urban classroom mixture of Spanish-speaking, English-speaking, and Negro-dialect speaking children can be capitalized on to further bilingual and intercultural development of all groups. The objectives of the projects were to (1) foster bilingual development in children at a prime readiness age (4 to 8), (2) promote positive attitudes among native English speakers toward the language and culture of other groups, and (3) enhance the self-concept and pride in heritage of children speaking Spanish while teaching them English. In both studies a Bilingual  Specialist met with classes of Kindergarten and 1st grade children 15 to 20 minutes per day. Both English and Spanish were used during these periods. Much of curriculum activity involved listening to stories, story-telling, singing, dramatization, and game playing; however, Finocchiaro took a more group-oriented approach, whereas King's more individualized approach relied on the use of instrumentalization for repetitive reinforcement during the lesson and after the lesson as an aid to the teacher. The Reading Readiness program was also integrated into the King project. Both studies concurred in the conclusion that bilingual readiness can be developed at this age level. (BF)",

Dr. Wren points up the need to develop training programs adaptable to other cultural bases. Specifically discussed are: \"Counseling Services in Europe,\" by Edwin H. Olson; \"Counseling Services in Latin America,\" by Joseph D. Bentley; and \"Counseling Services in England,\" by Donald Blocher.

Following each chapter is an extensive list of references. In addition to these chapters, there are (1) a guide to tests and measuring instruments in reading which describes tests currently in print and lists publishers, (2) a glossary of terms, (3) an index to Buros'\"Reading Tests and Reviews\" and to the \"Mental Measurement Yearbooks\" and, (4) an index to \"Published Research Literature in Reading\" which provides a reference to research articles (in  the ERIC/CRIER system) that have reported use of the tests described in the guide to tests and measuring instruments in reading. The monograph presents a wide range of measurement problems in reading, and, in doing so, raises some critical issues concerning the reading process and instructional practices in reading. Particularly valuable are the guidelines for the classroom application of research. (CM)",

If children are to have attitudes and behavior different from the general culture, they will have to be reared in a subculture of equality at home. Children should see their parents acting towards Blacks as they see them acting towards Whites. A basic step is involvement of White parents in organizations dedicated to building equality of opportunity in our society, such as employment, education, housing, etc. thereby moving society away from racism. Administrators and teachers should see that textbooks and teaching materials reflect the reality of a multi-group world. The White-ghetto outlook should be eliminated and children aided in breaking out of the white cacoon and  into the world of real people. (LS)",

Research on the following is evaluated: (1) surveys of school retardation carried out at the turn of the century, (2) differences in retardation rates between children from English and non-English-speaking countries, (3) rank order of nationalities for high school and elementary school completion, (4) rank order of nationalities in IQ tests among elementary and high school children, (5) relation between ethnicity and high school selection, and (6) importance of ethnicity and class to educational achievement among immigrants. The evidence presented suggests that pupils from many immigrant groups were much more likely to  be retarded than their native white schoolmates, more likely to make low scores on IQ tests, and a good deal less likely to remain in high school. There was, however, a good deal of variability in immigrant children's educational attainment: some groups (Jewish) did as well or better than the average for native whites, and others (central and southern European non-Jewish, and to a lesser extent, Irish) much worse.

The remainder of the booklet presents an overview of microform activity, including comments on the history of secondary school microform utilization and an up-to-date listing of microform selection aids. The amount of information available on microform is increasing rapidly, but the unavailability of adequate portable viewers has slowed the growth of mocroform as an instructional tool. In general, the disadvantages of microforms appear to be small in relation to their recognized advantages. While microform technology is not a panacea to improving a school's ability to provide instructional materials, microforms are seen as a tested, modern, efficient, and economical  medium for the storage and retrieval of information. Dynamic, creative and imaginative leadership is needed if the full benefits of microform technology are to be realized in the secondary school. The future of microform use by secondary schools is difficult to predict, except to say that microforms in some form will likely provide one solution, perhaps the best solution, to providing sufficient instructional materials to the children in the classrooms of our nation.

It included team teaching, pre- and post-testing with the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) and the FIRO-B, individual counseling, inservice training for teachers, and evaluation. An evaluation made by LRA Learning Research Associates of Los Altos, California found the program successful. Despite adverse effects of the riots in the Watts section of Los Angeles, attendance averaged a little under 75%. Results from the WRAT indicated an increase of 1.7 in grade level. Little attitude change was observable from the FIRO-B but significant data were the interviews  with selected trainees. It appeared that the team teaching concept was valid but needed acceptance from students and members of the team. A wide range of materials were used but specific materials did not seem critical to success. Trainees were well motivated at the start but the &quot;rumor mill&quot; had a bad effect. The curriculum was oriented to life situations and counseling was generally effective. It was recommended that the program be continued through U.C.L.A. Extension. (eb)",

When the Mississippi State Department of Education was first authorized to conduct ABE programs under the Adult Education Act of 1966, first priority was given to adults functioning at 5th grade level or below. One of the severest deterrents to effective evaluation of the program, however, has been the failure to specify operational objectives. It is recommended that a coordinated effort between state and local ABE personnel be directed toward developing a set of behavioral objectives for the various levels of instruction. The  State coordinator asserts that the most serious problems confronting the program are lack of adult education courses available in the state, lack of modern teaching methods and equipment, need for more teacher training, lack of state funds to match federal funds, inadequate number of professionals on the state staff, and geographical areas within the state which are in non-compliance with the Civil Rights Act.

The ultimate goal of the program was that participants achieve more effective living in their social, civic, economic, and personal life. Clients were referred to REAP from PRC by instructors; counselors interviewed and tested clients with the California Achievement Test (used to determine eligibility for the program), the Social Vocabulary Index Test, and the Attitudes Inventory for Youth. Classes, based on participant interest, included consumer mathematics,  reading improvement, communications, government, psychology, sex education, and family living. The Curriculum Guide to Adult Basic Education was eventually used as a basis for the REAP curriculum. Clients generally felt that they profited from the program; many felt a significant change in their feeling of social approval and self acceptance. As a whole, those clients who attended REAP regularly demonstrated more positive improvement in their vocational program at PRC. (se)",

Interviewees, consisting of 2,313 Army veterans and 1,084 Navy veterans, were surveyed by questionnaire as to personal and socioeconomic background (including aptitude and education), military occupational specialities (MOSs), preservice and subsequent employment, patterns of job seeking, success or failure in finding training related employment, and barriers to the use of military experiences. Related civilian occupations were recorded for each MOS. These were among the major findings: (1) only 15.9% of Army veterans and 28% of Navy veterans used their military skills in civilian life; (2) the labor market did not effectively aid veterans interested in using  their service experience; (3) preservice employment dominated postservice occupational choice; (4) Navy veterans were more likely than Army veterans to return to school.

This category thus includes studies of non-standard English and the language of the &quot;disadvantaged.&quot; The third category is divided into two subcategories: Negro English of the continental United States and Negro English of the Caribbean. It was felt that any study of American Negro English would be incomplete without reference to the historical significance of the creoles and pidgins spoken in the Caribbean. The fourth  category, applications to teaching and learning, is concerned primarily with teaching standard English to speakers of non-standard dialects. However, as the cultural and socioeconomic aspects of the &quot;disadvantaged&quot; are significantly related to the linguistic aspects, some of the literature of the cultural and socioeconomic aspects of poverty and the urban ghetto has been included in so far as it relates to education.

It follows as a corollary of her opening statement that syntactic patterns have a meaning of their own, a meaning that is conditioned by, but not reducible to, the features of intercategorial relationships of the parts. The simplex &quot;The thought frightened John&quot; and its causative paraphrase &quot;The thought made John frightened&quot; are both simple in their deep structure because in each of the sentences each of the categorial  relationships occurs just once. (See AL 002 096.) These two sentences differ in configuration properties, or pattern-meaning. The author explains the differences in pattern-meaning and discusses the effects of verbal clitics on pattern-meaning in Spanish.

        "description":"There are two positions on the relationship of the speech of Blacks and whites, and they are quite opposed to one another. One position observes virtually no differences in the speech of Southern whites and Blacks and therefore assumes that the historical development can be traced to a British dialect. The other sees many significant differences and therefore assumes that Black dialect is derived from a creole-based system more like the Caribbean creoles than it is like a British dialect. In order to resolve some of the issues at the heart of this controversy, Wolfram, Shuy, and Fasold have begun extracting data from 50 lower socio-economic class children (Black and white) between the ages of six and eight. This specific age range was chosen to represent a period when the  children would be past the developmental stage but at an age when the awareness of the social consequences of speech would be minimal. The age is also crucial because both Stewart and Dillard maintain that only among children do certain creole-like features exist. Analysis of the third person singular, possessives, copula absence, invariant \"be,\" and word-final consonant clusters lead the author to conclude that there are definite Black/white speech differences that can not be dismissed as \"statistical skewing\": some are qualitative. However, the extent of these differences is not nearly as great as is sometimes claimed; they differ in surface rather than deep structure. (DO)",

The initial phase or Phase I was concerned with determining the effect of English as a Second Language (ESOL) on the achievement of first year elementary students. The follow-up study phase was designed to determine the extent of any residual effects on the achievement of second, third, and fourth grade students receiving the programmed ESOL instruction during the academic year just preceding the year considered by this report. Achievement areas involved were reading vocabulary, reading comprehension, total reading scores, mathematical reasoning, math fundamentals, and total  mathematics scores. The subjects were students from culturally disadvantaged Negro homes enrolled in the Laboratory School on the campus of the Mississippi Valley State College. It was found that no valid judgement could be rendered regarding the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of the programmed ESOL materials used. Due to the contamination of the control group, no true analysis was possible. More than one year of ESOL would be needed to determine the permanent effects, if any, on the achievement of the students. (DO)",

In this paper, the author takes issue with various views that currently enjoy popularity in a number of disciplines but which violate basic linguistic and sociolinguistic premises about the nature of language. These views are often communicated to and adopted by those in a position which directly affects the lives of many ghetto children. Furthermore, these views have a direct bearing on the attitude of both white and black middle class teachers toward Black English. The attitudinal problem towards this intricate and unique language system is probably the biggest problem faced. But there is also a practical reason for understanding some linguistic and  sociolinguistic premises about the nature of language with reference to nonstandard dialects. An understanding of systematic differences between nonstandard dialects and standard English must serve as a basis for the most effective teaching of standard English.

More specifically the aim of the study is (1) to identify and classify those English influences which have been introduced and accepted into Hawaiian Japanese (HJ) and (2) to indicate the extent to which these influences have altered the phonological structure of HJ. A corpus was established in which borrowings were classified according to their degree of assimilation; only those forms designated as partially assimilated (those forms found to be more like Japanese than English in their phonological constituency) were further analyzed and used as a basis for determining the established English phonological  influences. These English influences were classified into four major categories: new phonemes, new distributions, clusters, and combinations. In all, 30 influences were found, five in the phonemic inventory and 25 in the phonotactics. Particularly significant are the appearance of consonant clusters and new syllables. The author feels that the great influence of English on the phonology of HJ has resulted in a variety of Japanese which is different from any other, and which may therefore be considered a separate dialect.

        "description":"This article reports the results of research carried out in London using five-year-old children of working class and middle class backgrounds. Speech samples were collected and compared on the basis of grammatical categories. It was discovered that working class children used more pronouns than their middle class counterparts in third person nominal groups. The middle class children's greater use of nouns was considered significant because nouns, in contrast to pronouns, can be expanded by modifiers and qualifiers and because their reference is more specific and does not make so many demands on the listener or assume any knowledge on his part. The author relates these findings to Basil Bernstein's concept of restricted and elaborated codes, demonstrating that working class  children's speech has the characteristics of a restricted code (one used among small closely knit groups, where implicit knowledge of the speaker's intention is important for understanding), whereas middle class speech has the characteristics of an elaborated code, in which the speaker's intentions are made more explicit verbally without much reliance on other means of communication. The author believes that the working class child's reliance on a restricted code, traceable to his family and cultural environment, accounts for his verbal difficulties in school. (FWB)",

Regular pronunciation features and consistent patterns of sound replacement were observed, which seemed to be characteristic of, and contribute substantially to, the foreign accent of Thai speakers of English in New Zealand. By relating these features to the phonological system of Thai, it was found that interference in the form of differing phonetic representations of corresponding phonemes in English and Thai is a major source of pronunciation difficulty for Thai speakers of English. Equally significant are differences in distribution between phonemes in English  and Thai. Thai problems with English stress and intonation are also discussed. Tabular displays of English and Thai phonemes as well as diagrams indicating Thai allophonic replacements for English phonemes are given. (Author/FWB)",

        "description":"The social, academic, and personal experiences of students is the basic area explored in this study. Data was obtained from interviews and questionnaires of students and school personnel. James Coleman's work on the adolescent society and other research data was also used. Data was obtained on the influence the actions of teachers, administrators, librarians, and counselors have on students. The evidence collected suggests that teacher personality and the interaction between pupil and teacher are of major significance in school functioning. In addition to exposure to organized knowledge, there are apparently many important experiences for pupils at school. It is not the materials, facilities, teachers, and peers, but rather their worth to the student that is important, as well as  the student's worth or value to teachers and peers. Based on the above research, a theory of Preliminary Curriculum Assessments was developed. Two assumptions are made: (1) education is what pupils perceive is happening to them because they attend school, and (2) education is what teachers (school personnel) do that influences pupils.

Almost all students at some period of time are appropriately identified in the \"high risk\" category. A more effective method than those presently used (Head Start, Job Corps) in aiding these high risk students, may be approached by total community involvement and through the use of operational evaluation and instruction by computerized assistance. High risk students are faced primarily with the chore of gaining a required part of the desirable attributes related to more acceptable groups. Approaches to developing life styles are given. The ability to quantify any information is  highly desirable from a deterministic point of view. For the high risk student, knowing all the emotional forces that are involved in his life may be necessary for basic survival. This need can be met with computers. Simulation evaluation of alternative models would also be possible. The objectives and necessary activities are outlined and include: (1) collection of personal data, (2) identification of subgroups, and (3) identification of sources of funding. (Author/KJ)",

Greater gains appear to occur for the less reliable tests, but that is at least partly because the more reliable a test is to begin with, the more difficult it is to improve it. If confidence-testing allows us to weight heavily on well-settled knowledge, then the weighted score might be more valid. In the research cited, retention was the aspect to be measured. High school physics students were tested upon completion of four chapters in their text. Their scores were used to predict semester grades. Weighted scores had higher reliabilities and correlated significantly higher with semester grades. An inference is made that conventional scores become less  relevant to retention with the passage of time and confidence scores become more relevant. Unquestionably, personality has an effect on confidence-marking. However, the fairness of personal bias is summed up in stating that the bias for conventional scoring was equal or greater than that for weighted scores. Suggestions for research include more investigation of personality bias and a greater concern with validity. (Author/KJ)",

        "description":"Understanding the world of work is contingent upon the availability of good occupational information. Since the individual must interpret what he knows about himself in terms of his understanding of the characteristics of the world of work, it is important that the world of work be described to him in terms that make this interpretation easy. Jobs must be defined in terms that make this interpretation easy. Jobs must be defined in terms of worker characteristics. The Dictionary of Occupational Terms (1956) (DOT) was designed with this goal in mind. The Ohio Vocational Interest Survey (OVIS) has developed 24 interest scales, based on a cube model of the basic work dimensions; data, people, and things. The OVIS uses D.O.T. worker trait groups and recoded D.O.T. number levels. The  24 OVIS scales represent all of the 114 D.O.T. worker trait groups and therefore the world of work. The development, reliability, and validity, and the standardization of the OVIS is discussed. Although the OVIS scales do not yet have the benefit of long term reliability and validity studies, it does appear that they are sound and promising. OVIS is adaptable to a computerized system of vocational information based on the D.O.T., and can be readily used in a computer-assisted system designed to teach decision-making and facilitate vocational exploration.

The role of guidance in the career development of junior and senior high youth includes: (1) helping the student to see himself as worthy, (2) helping students experience success, (3) helping students to find ways that school can make sense to them, (4) helping students consider and make decisions regarding the values of a work oriented society, (5) helping students develop an understanding of their own talents, and (6) helping students make choices from a wide range of alternatives. One of the most important functions of guidance for students headed towards entry into the labor market is to  care about these students. Secondly, counselors need to seek these students out, and demonstrate their interest in them. Approaches to guidance for use with these students include: (1) the help and involvement of teachers, (2) the utilization of community resources, and (3) the offering of more relevant curricula.

Liberal arts and private universities in the East, West, and Central areas produced more organized protest. The issues varied from area to area. Protestors approximated between one and two percent of the student enrollment. The weight of the published evidence  clearly supports the proposition that activist students are mainly an intellectual elite who would be considered the most attractive students a school might recruit. Kenniston does not consider these activists alienated but merely going through a stage he calls the \"stage of youth\" after mastering the ego tasks of adolescence.

In differentiating between counselors and coordinators or between two levels of counselors, functions and roles must be considered. Psychological counselors do not necessarily work with all clients, only those needing psychological counseling. The coordinator works with all clients. A basic choice needs to be made; does a counselor want power and prestige, or does he want to help. Counselors at this point must derive power from their coordinating activities, but this has no place in a helping relationship. Counselors then who wish power and prestige should become coordinators, thus reducing the need for psychological counselors as coordinators would  handle clients who need only physical restoration services or placement. The counselors who are primarily interested in helping will then be able to devote more time to psychological counseling. Auxiliary personnel should be available to coordinators and counselors so both can function effectively on an equal basis. (KJ)",

Counselors are usually called guidance counselors, partly because of their many other activities besides counseling, and partly because many counselors do little or no counseling, but rather direct and control. If another term is needed, perhaps psychological counselor would be more valid. In vocational counseling, the counselor does not guide students into particular occupations or fields. The focus of counseling - vocational counseling - is upon the interests and abilities of the client and their implications for vocational development and choice. The client's exploration and thinking should be free of  constraints or restrictions on the opportunities and demands in society. Only in the final choice should these external \"reality\" factors enter in. Society and industry should not suffer from such an approach, since each individual would be enabled to do that for which he is best suited and in which he is most interested. The function of a counselor is to help the student find a vocation which utilizes his abilities and satisfies his interests and needs, not to guide him along paths determined by someone else. (KJ)",

These are further explained, and followed by a list of indications of the development of vocational interests. The current trends of interest measurement are listed and the features of the Ohio Vocational  Interest Survey are explained.

An open group differs from a closed group in the following ways: (1) no set size, (2) anyone can come, (3) participant behavior determines what is to be focused upon, when it will be focused on and how long the focus will remain there; and (4) time is practically limited to three to four hours, theoretically it should be unlimited. Varying group structure results in changing the dynamics of groups. Destructiveness or the tearing down of defenses  without providing for new replacement patterns is more likely in open groups. There is also a significant amount of experimentation as well as creativity observed in open groups. Training values include the opportunity to observe co-workers to see how they handle certain situations. In addition, counselors working with open groups are esentially \"forced\" to develop spontaneity and flexibility in style. (Author/KJ)",

This study attempts to determine if relationships exist between student personality types and the students' preferred college subcultures. It was hypothesized that no such relationships exist. The College Student Questionnaire (CSQ) parts One and Two, the Clark-Trow Typology, and Holland's Personality Types were utilized. Subjects were 993 college sophomores. Results are presented in terms of college subculture preferences, and personality type classifications, and show that relationships exist between  student characteristics and types of environment in college. It is therefore possible for students to consider their personal orientations and a college dominant subculture in determining their college choice. The colleges can also consider the personalities of students when planning programs to change characteristics of its environment. The use of the Clark-Trow typology helps to identify the relative predominance of its subcultures found on a campus at any one time. (Author/KJ)",

Conclusions and implications include that counseled students appeared, at least in teachers' eyes, to improve significantly. There were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups in their growth on the MAT or the CPT.

The data support the proposition that exposure to the video tape had a significant effect on the counselor's tendency to use CTRLS. With respect to the counselor's responses to the actual video tape, there were significantly more CTRL's during the post  instruction simulated situations than during the preinstruction simulated situations. The data further suggest that these learning effects generalize to actual counseling situations. More CTRL's occurred in post instruction counseling situations than in preinstructional counseling situations.

Preliminary investigation has led to tentative specification of 12 components comprising the guidance system, five involving indirect intervention on behalf of the students, and seven presenting guidance experiences directly through the instructional process. Basic objectives are to encourage problem solving behaviors among the students involved, and to create greater awareness of career information in order to enable students to make better decisions for their own futures. Programmatic research and development activities to assist individuals to acquire and  perform behaviors which will result in their solving real-life problems wisely is also currently underway. The ultimate training program must specify behaviors included in solving real-life problems wisely, and reliable criterion measures for assessing students' abilities to perform these behaviors must be developed. Hopefully, findings from this research will point the way toward discovering a superior problem-solving training approach, including the cost in time and money for such a program in a school setting.

        "description":"In August, 1967, a conference was held at the University of Oregon to identify, forecast, and discuss the evolving requirements of educational information systems. The general purpose of the conference was stated as follows: if chaos is to be avoided in educational systems by the mid 1970's, intensive research development efforts in the field of educational system requirements must be mounted. While much has been written about systems requirements, the educational community is in need of a summarizing statement regarding what has been done and what most needs to be done regarding educational information system requirements in the next one to two decades. The general purpose of the conference was to produce a statement, representing the thinking of a select group of educators and  information science specialists representing the several sectors of education. The papers in this volume constitute the beginnings of such a statement which has since served as a basis for further dialogue throughout the country and abroad. (Author/CJ)",

        "description":"University supported residence halls should make some significant contribution to the development of the individual resident. Programming in the halls ought to have three major objectives, three dimensions along which change should take place: (1) social-personal value systems; (2) receptivity and sensitivity to cultural experiences; and (3) general intellectual development. A two and one-half day training period was held to set the tone and emphasis desired for residence hall programming. The programming tactics are explained. Residence hall staff members were encouraged to assume an active role in planning and implementing programs for the halls. They no longer needed to depend on floor governments to initiate activities. Specific methods for resolving group tasks are described  as is the generation of ideas, and program selection. Groupings on residence floors should take advantage of the natural six-twelve man friendship groupings, planning mainly for these groups and encouraging heterosexual groupings for programs. \"Creative projects\" are believed to be useful in helping students and staff to become more innovative and to have a greater impact on their peers. Through encouraged confrontation with the outside, growth in the three areas above is more likely. (Author/KJ)",

An instrument was developed containing a list of behaviors that gave teenagers the feeling of having been understood and the feeling of having been misunderstood. This instrument was administered to three groups of 100 teenagers each. The groups were: (1) from a rural environment, (2) from a high socio-economic community, and (3) incarcerated youth in correctional schools. Results show that teenagers of differing demographic locations and social behaviors are very much alike in their evaluation of  behaviors that communicate understanding. The three most highly rated items were: (1) suggests ways I might solve my problems, (2) takes time to sit down with me, and (3) spends time with me discussing my problem. Verbal behavior is preferred to nonverbal behavior. Implications include a necessity to concentrate on the person with the problem, not other distractions, and on the person more than the problem.

Career choice is viewed as developmental. It is also believed that life histories cannot be predicted and that a career is something that gives purpose to life. Experiences are provided which give more attention to the elementary school child's perception of himself and the image of the person he would like to become. Aspects taken into consideration are: (1) attitudes and values toward work, (2) socio-economic level, (3) educational expectations, and (4) self-concept. ROOM TO GROW is conducted once a week for 7,000 fifth and sixth graders in Philadelphia. The program, supervised by three guidance  consultants, consists of 25-30 weekly sessions of 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Some sessions are teacher-led, some have guest speakers, some are tours, and others are guidance sessions. The objectives of the program are: (1) to improve self-confidence, (2) to provide a wide range of career experiences, and (3) to develop a desirable approach to the process of career choice.

The extent to which the project consultant is able to establish the same basic helping relationship with project staff members as he desires the staff to have with the clientele, will determine the degree of success of the project. Today the consultant is more of an expert on the process of change, of modifying attitudes and assisting in effective behavioral changes, than an expert on content. Information regarding content can be achieved by more effective means; textbooks, programmed instruction, and audio-visual media. If the consultant relegates his role to information dispensing, he will miss his opportunity to perform  his unique function. (KJ)",

        "description":"Increasingly in the last decade, adolescent patients have come to the attention of psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers. Characteristically, when a teenager comes for help, he is in a state of crisis. After dealing for two years with adolescents in crisis, the Outpatient Clinic at McLean Hospital has learned to subdivide the great number of adolescents in crisis into meaningful types and categories. The main finding on clinical adolescent crisis is that families are intimately involved in the crisis; that there is family reinforcement. An adolescent in crisis also has to be distinguished from the chronically disturbed adolescent where the crisis is merely the visible peak of larger disturbance which had been hitherto clinically submerged. A four weeks limit is set on  treatment of crisis situations. The use of a team approach and information gathering in three different settings is given by means of case examples. Treatment can be given in two ways, either by family treatment or individual treatment. Family therapy is more effective, since often the crisis is symptomatic of a larger family disturbance.

Problem solving designs include: (1) a fantasy model for estimating future conditions, (2)the exchange of tapes generated by role groups, and the discussion of these tapes; (3) a half day workshop involving faculty, students, and administration; and (4) a black-white microlab confrontation model.

These major dilemmas press those concerned with student personnel work in unfamiliar and uncomfortable directions. They demand that student personnel workers identify the appropriate people and form coalitions of students, faculty, and  administrative officers who can exercise educational influence on our campuses and that they strongly support and help to make more telling and sophisticated those efforts to evaluate courses and instructors.

The investment may, however, be worth the advantages that can be achieved by providing students with information that may help them formulate individual educational and vocational goals and make related decisions. Dangers to the use of the GATB do exist: (1) it could become a tool for screening and placement of students, and (2) it could be used on a &quot;crisis&quot; basis, just prior to the need for making choices. Test experiences should be planned well in advance of a decision point, allowing the student time to consider, evaluate, and assimilate new information learned about himself and the possible relevance this information has to his  goals and the choices open to him. Some of the ways a counselor could use the GATB are to: (1) help students develop greater self understanding, (2) help students to understand possible aptitude strengths, and (3) help students to relate test performance to educational and vocational information.

The factors which constitute a good or poor high school-college relations program include: (1) cooperation and support of administration and faculty, and (2) adequate planning, staffing, and financing. The best way to implement such a program is to know the people and  institution involved, and to know something about the high school, the community, and the parents of the students. Functions of the public relations office should include: (1) high school and college visitation, (2) preparation, printing, and distributing newsletters, (3) preparing press releases, and (4) organizing and conducting a senior day or counseling day for seniors.

The participants were screened by experienced  psychologists. An open-ended post experience questionnaire was used to find out about: (1) expectations of the experience, (2) likes and dislikes of the exercises, and (3) effects on behavior.

        "description":"Within the context of institutional educations' attempt to respond to compelling social problems, Antioch College developed a program designed to test the assumption that \"overlooked\" minority group students with the potential for academic success would benefit from attendance at Antioch and would also contribute positively to the college. Since 1965, 92 students, predominately male and black, were identified and recruited by committees set up in various metropolitan areas. They were accepted by relaxed admission standards, were provided educational, motivational and enrichment experiences before entrance, and given supportive counseling and financial assistance once on campus. In the beginning the students aspired to fit in, but as they became more aware of their blackness  strong feelings of black pride, black unity and black survival developed, and they worked earnestly on curriculum and housing reform to prevent manipulation by a white middle class institution. The major impact of the students on the college is that the program became a vehicle for education in race relations but there is a need for further analysis of its effects. The report raises many questions about the nature of education's contribution to the solution of problems posed by poverty and racial injustice.

Comparisons between interest inventories are difficult to make, and those responsible for making choices between inventories must be well-informed about the entire system. Therefore, the points are discussed in the order that a system is developed--from the item pool, through the scale building, to the supporting data, through the theory to the application and to the commercialization of the product. Items should be drawn from the relevant domain should be in good taste and the item format should be simple and direct but allow the respondent some latitude in his answer. The interest inventory scales should be valid, stable over time and numerous and specific enough to allow easy interpolation yet few and  broad enough to permit parsimonious generalizations. There should be an extensive body of published information on the inventory and the interest inventory should be tied into a theory. The results should be reported in an easily understandable manner and provide the individual with sufficient information about himself. Finally the interest inventory must be commercially viable, and the publishers should supply a wide array of ancillary services. (Author/RM)",

People are more and more desiring to further their education; out of their motives for education comes the emotional significance. There is an interesting relationship between personality problems and educational problems. The learning styles of individuals seems to be seriously affected by their personality. Types of educational counseling problems include: (1) the timid learner, (2) the fickle learner, and (3) the sporadic learner. Each of these types do not know how to learn and thus eventually fail at their educational task. The most common educational counseling problems encountered with adults are: (1) lack of  self confidence in one's ability to learn, (2) unrealistic expectations of progress, (3) conflicting values and attitudes, (4) theoretical or irrelevant learning tasks, (5) seeking help too late or in the wrong places, and (6) lack of efficient reading and study habits. Persistence in pursuing educational goals can, however, by itself and with counseling, help adults to reach their ultimate goal. (KJ)",

Kevin is a young man, able to get through high school without developing his talents and skills. At the end of his high school career, he had to make a decision about college. He made the decision on incomplete evidence and information about himself. Kevin and his counselor are the main sources of information along with records from high school and college. The case study has three major aspects: (1) it describes Kevin's feelings associated with his successes and failures, (2) it can be used at several levels of sophistication by counselors, and  (3) it is a realistic and recognizable situation. Pertinent questions are included at the end of each section. Commentaries on the case from the viewpoint of a counselor educator and the guidance director of a public school are presented. Exhibits of Kevin's records and test results, study questions, a bibliography, and a brief discussion of possible uses of the case study are given. (Author/KJ)",

The sample consisted of 11th grade students who participated in the Project Talent testing program and responded to follow-up questionnaires one year and five years after high school graduation. Data included the immediate post data of high school activities reported by subjects and scores on selected cognitive and noncognitive variables. Subjects were divided into three educational progress groups: (1) delayed college entrance, (2) normal progress, and (3) other education. Findings included the following: (1) a larger percentage of the delayed education group had married, had full time jobs or were in the military at the one year  follow-up and (2) scores on cognitive and noncognitive variables for the delayed progress group were generally intermediate when compared with classmates in the normal progress and other education groups. It is suggested that it is detrimental to withhold educational opportunity from those who have the ability and motivation to profit from it, but that the delay might prove functional to those lacking the motivation at the time of high school graduation.

These programs are elements in a three-year demonstration program sponsored by Project Upper Cumberland. A cultural art evaluation and a guidance school program evaluation are presented. Results of the guidance program were favorable as indicated by: (1) improved behavior of students; (2) greater capacity for creative thinking up to grades seven and eight, and (3) positive attitudes toward self, school, and community. The objectives of the cultural arts program were: (1) to provide a model program of instruction in music, art, and drama, and (2) to provide children and adults with opportunities for creative expression.  Results show a positive attitude toward the program by pupils, parents, and educators. However, actual changes in attitude while positive did not differ significantly from the attitudes of subjects in the control school. Both the guidance and cultural arts program appear to strengthen a school to a great degree. Hopefully, together they will provide a means for helping the underdeveloped pupil to overcome his cultural, social, and educational deficiencies.

The laboratory is in use at Georgia State College in Atlanta and is designed for boys seven through twelve years of age. The Monitored Playroom Laboratory consists of a control booth and two connected playrooms, one with aggressive toys and games, the other with constructive toys and materials. The control booth contains dials which indicate: (1) the time spent by each child in a room, and (2) the time spent with various toys and materials. The control booth also functions as an observation booth and contains the necessary equipment. The major stages which children in Monitored Play-Therapy seem to progress through  are: (1) exploratory, (2) aggressive, and (3) constructive. On the basis of these stages, it is possible to chart the process of Monitored Play-Therapy from session to session. These data can then be analyzed in many ways, including (1) number of shots fired from guns in aggressive room, and (2) change of conversation patterns. The next step will be to analyze therapists notes to determine the frequency of different types of activities from the shelf materials. (KJ)",

The main emphasis is on quantitative recording and analysis of the process and outcome of play therapy. However, because of its newness, monitored play therapy also has some weaknesses. The main strong point is the conceptual and physical separation of the stages of play into aggression and construction. The use of separate play rooms for aggression and construction eliminates many problems. However, some of the weaknesses found in this framework are: (1) the equality of stimulus properties of the two rooms, (2) differences in times required to complete games in the two rooms, (3) the importance of a skill factor in playing games, (4) little  opportunity to manipulate aggressive materials in the clients own way, (5) no opportunity for the destruction of objects, and (6) no creative outlet for aggression. The role and limits of playroom aggression are explained as being within the limits of social acceptability. Monitored versus traditional play therapy is discussed, primarily with respect to the conceptual framework, data, and value of play therapy over no therapy. (KJ)",

The behavioral criterion for identifying student activists which was confirmed in this study consists of: (1) the degree of involvement with sociopolitical issues, and (2) the degree of rejection of the traditional values and institutional authority of the society. The  inferences that can be drawn from this study are in accord with the formulations that characterize other literature. Differences on only three of the replicatory demographic variables reached acceptable levels of statistical significance; religion, major field of study, and prospective occupation.

Results of both surveys included the following about the student movement: (1) relatively small minorities of students are involved, (2) protests vary among institutions, (3) off campus issues are less frequent in the South, and (4) organized protest is more common at large universities. Other studies are mentioned, and scale descriptions, and correlations for the Institutional Functioning Inventory are given. The Special Committee on Campus Tensions has recently been  formed. The committee's areas of concentration include: (1) modern interpretations of the history and philosophy of dissent, (2) the study of the breakdown of authority in American life, (3) the dynamics of institutional change, (4) institutional government, and (5) effective communication in complex organizations. A plea for all information relevant to these areas is made. A second plea is made, to become involved in promoting nonviolent ways of dissent. (KJ)",

Three training groups of students were selected from Lake Erie College and the Community College for Adult Education. One of the groups consisted of seniors contemplating marriage, one consisted of young parents, and another of parents of adolescents. The hypothesis was justified that there would be identifiable recurrent problems or themes in all three groups. These were, as a matter of fact, uncovered by means of two-hour sessions with the students which were taped and analyzed, and these recurrent themes  constitute the content of the proposed course which will henceforth be a part of the college curriculum. All of the participating students felt a great need for such a course and recommended that it also be available to high school students as well as to students in adult education. (Author)",

However, the center was not able to serve the number of students who called for appointments. The next step was to investigate the effectiveness of group counseling procedures. Three groups were formed: (1) A-group counseling (N=22), (2) B-individual counseling (N=21), and (3) C-deferred counseling (N=28). The Mooney Problem Checklist (MPC) and the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS) were used for pre and post test indices. Results showed that Group A maintained a desire for change and added aggression as a result of their group experiences. They also reacted more aggressively by indicating a significantly higher number of problems in four areas of the MPC.  Group B showed no change on either scale. Group C added both change and aggression to their significant changes. (KJ)",

Data were collected on the social characteristics, values, and activities of the students while they were in high school. The present research provided a follow-up study to compare some of their present social characteristics, values, and activities with the high school data. Included in the five objectives of the research are: (1) comparison of high school students' educational values with the educational values of the same students five years after graduation, and (2) the analysis of possible background factors associated with the permanence of high school friendships. A mailed questionnaire was used to gather the follow-up data. A comparison of  the respondents with the nonrespondents indicates they were not significantly different. Results indicate: (1) radical shifts have taken place in the educational values of the students, and (2) high school social participation was significantly related to educational achievement or occupational status. Findings support the notion of a youth subculture that has both internal variability and external connections to the adult society. (KJ)",

The results of policy research on this issue should give policy makers a broad perspective on the issue and offer a wide variety of programs from which to select.

Under this system, each student would attend three continuous quarters and have the fourth quarter off. One fourth of the students would thus be on vacation each quarter, and one-fourth less teachers would be required. However, teacher salaries would rise to compensate for the 12-month contracts. The need for physical facilities would fall proportionately, providing an additional source of savings which would counteract the taxpayer rebellion that has manifested itself in reduced school revenues. These savings could be applied toward acquiring instructional materials for individualized instruction. Some social problems caused by inactive  youth would be reduced since fewer would be on vacation at one time. Economic efficiency would be enhanced if employers could depend on student labor year around. (LN)",

The middle school organization presents educators with an opportunity for improved educational processes uniquely suited to students of this age group. Transescents are in transition physically, mentally, and socially, each developing according to his own timetable. This diversity in maturation rates creates diversity in interests and attitudes, thus precipitating irregular social and emotional patterns. The purpose of this paper is to suggest programs for the transescent level. Attention should specifically be given to curriculum, grouping techniques, and guidance programs. The middle school can be a  dynamic program of education for transescents if educators understand the complexities of this age group and are willing to create programs suited to its unique characteristics.

From September 1, 1967 to August 31, 1968, 243,442 persons entered this job market with at least a bachelor's degree. Two estimates of national demand are provided: (1) The estimated number of new teachers needed to attaim minimum levels of quality staffing in 1968 (301,300 in elementary and 198,350 in secondary schools); (2) the number needed in 1968-69, as projected from trends in the improvement of staffing characteristics in recent years (109,300 in elementary and 107,900 in secondary schools). The critical shortage of beginning teachers is expected to continue in secondary school mathematics and sciences. Shortages are likely in special education, vocational-technical courses, women's  physical and health education, industrial arts, and elementary schools. Two special surveys of appropriate officials in State departments of education and in 79 of the nation's largest school systems show that shortages of qualified teachers are continuing in all of these assignments.

This assumption led to some instructional research at Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan, developing and testing a systems model for the classroom. A model building process labeled message storage and retrieval was developed in some detail. Using this retrieval model as a basic form, alternative models of cognitive behavior can be constructed. A simple model of message content is one such model that forms the basis for the actual research project. It emphasizes the scientific method in course structure as opposed to the present emphasis on discipline content in the form of drill and exercise. The comparative evidence supports the conclusion that learning is facilitated by this technique which  assumes that the educational goal is students who can understand and analyze. The policy implication is that the expenses incurred on current computer-assisted instruction and current pedagogical strategies must be ended in favor of more heuristic teaching methods. (LN)",

Two types of dissensus are examined: interposition or teacher-principal dissensus; and intraposition or teacher-teacher dissensus. The types of satisfaction are instrumental satisfaction with the organization (a school system), affective satisfaction with the organization, and affective satisfaction with the member's own unit. It was hypothesized that there would be an inverse relationship for each of three types of satisfaction and both intraposition and interposition role  dissensus; a second hypothesis was that school buildings characterized by high role dissensus would have less satisfied teachers than school buildings characterized by low dissensus. For teachers who valued other teachers as a reference group, agreement with other teachers was consistent with very high levels of satisfaction. (MF)",

Complaints were widely repeated that high school curriculum was not geared to the needs of the noncollege-bound student. Grievances were also expressed over the traditional character of classroom instruction that included exacting control over a student's behavior. Overt and subtle racism in secondary schools has also led to disruptive incidents. The schools' apparent disregard for other social problems including the draft, poverty, and political power inequities has also been attacked by students. It is advocated that teachers and administrators give immediate and constant attention to a reformation of the schools that  will alter these conditions. One solution proposes a student-faculty government to establish grievance procedures and to stimulate dialogue between the two groups. If this shared power concept avoids tokenism, the probability of open conflict will be reduced. Instrumental to this effort would be the hiring of competent instructors and the development of public accountability of school systems to the clients they serve.

After a year's operation under the Stanford School Scheduling System, an \"at home\" evaluation of the new program was made. Student grades on a cross-sectional basis did not suffer, but rather showed a slight improvement. Moderate improvement was also noted in class conduct and attendance. In the use of unstructured time, a positive change was also observed in students' attitudes toward study. Large/small group study was favorably accepted by students and teachers, but more attention to the small group design for indepth discussion and personal interaction is needed to provide even greater success. At the administrative level, general commitment to the program is widespread, yet  agreement on philosophies and educational assumptions of the program could increase. Generally there has been a movement toward more individualized instruction. The report recommends that particular emphasis for further improvement be placed on staff differentiation and use as well as on further development of the new teaching techniques offered by modular scheduling.

Some support was evident for four secondary hypotheses: (1) positive correlation between map-reading scores (MS) and map drawing catagories (MC); (2) a  significant increase in MS with grade level; (3) an increase in students' reasoning level as MC increased; and (4) an MS order of achievement for the three ethnic groups consistently occurring, (Chinese / white / black).

Methods used to attain these objectives during the project are described and briefly evaluated. The development of a research capability in these colleges affected the total academic process by increasing faculty competence in  both scholastic and instructional areas. Consequently, the report recommends extension of the program to other small developing colleges as a means of upgrading faculty quality and standards.

This was also the period of system-wide development of city school districts funded by favorable tax bases from industrial property and from a complete cross-section of social strata. The first consolidation of districts began within the cities and, at least as an ideal, an elitist concept governed the selection of persons for a place on relatively autonomous school boards. Population shifts, decentralization of industry, and demands for local control have each served to erode the position of city boards. It is currently possible to see a trend toward more representative boards, having greater citizen involvement. Decentralized, federated school systems are in sight  with the board free to become a more effective political force. Along with more force will come more responsibility because the board will be held increasingly accountable for the results of public education. (DE)",

Diversity in maturation rates creates diversity in interests and attitudes. These differences necessitate the development of programs for the middle school which differ from the elementary and high school approaches. Two fundamental areas are grouping and climate for instruction. Separate but related dimensions are involved in student grouping. One facet involves the rate of student growth mentally; the other involves the rate of student growth physically, socially, and emotionally. A flexible school climate can be encouraged by staff attitudes that permit considerable freedom of action to youngsters and also by flexible scheduling.

An evaluation of the program's success is made on the basis of the following five major objectives: (1) To develop competencies necessary to conduct educational research, (2) to develop favorable attitudes toward educational research, (3) to prepare prospective teachers for their roles as participants in and as consumers of educational research, (4) to interest talented undergraduates in graduate work and careers in educational research, and (5) to provide talented assistants for faculty researchers. The major activities of the program are also evaluated, including a weekly seminar on research methods, work with a faculty member as  a research assistant, and visits to various research settings. The appendix contains (1) the course outline for the seminar, (2) a bibliography of research products in which the trainees participated, (3) excerpts from program evaluations made by student and faculty participants, and (4) papers by two trainees describing their involvement in the research process.

        "description":"To test the hypothesis that the amount learned from a manipulative, nonverbal oriented unit on electricity would be better predicted by a learning potential assessment procedure than from an IQ based classification (educable mentally retarded status), an EMR group and a regular class non EMR group were both exposed to the unit; untaught EMRs served as controls. Students were assessed on pretests; students who were high scorers or gainers were considered to have strong learning potential. Results showed that both taught groups knew more about electricity after the unit than before, and that EMR gainers and highscorers learned more than nongainers. A second study showed no difference in amount learned between the unit and a lecture-demonstration unit. Conclusions were as follow:  certain EMR's are very capable when taught by nonverbal material; high scorers in the EMR range and low achieving regular class children may require novel presentations that will minimize effects of poor literacy skills; and EMR high scorers might do better in a regular class if curriculum changes were made to compensate for their reading deficits or if they were given extensive work in reading. The manipulative, nonverbal unit, a teacher's guide for the unit, and the lecture demonstration unit are available in EC 004 359.

        "description":"The parameters influencing the respiratory pattern at or near the threshold for hearing were studied in hearing impaired and normal hearing subjects. A semiautomatic system was designed to process the data. Results indicated that thresholds for pure tones could be estimated better on the inspiration phase of the breathing cycle and that duration of the cycle was more precise than amplitude. An ascending mode of presentation was as satisfactory as the random and better than the descending methods; a 250 millisecond tone was as effective as longer tones. Estimation of thresholds were not as successful with hearing impaired as with normal hearing children; however, an accurate estimate could be made if the breathing cycle approximated a sine wave. A method based on visually apparent  changes in the cycle as recorded on the strip chart was at least as accurate as the semiautomated system. A condition of visual distraction elevated auditory threshold; thresholds in the second stage of natural sleep or in sparine induced sleep were essentially similar to thresholds in the waking state.

        "description":"To determine factors influencing the permanency of a protrustional lisp and to incorporate them into predictive profiles, approximately 8,000 kindergarten children were screened for articulation and those appearing to have a protrusional lisp were tested individually. The 1,043 subjects exhibiting such a lisp were examined semiannually for 4 years with a battery of speech and other tests; their school records were assessed; no speech therapy was given. The data for the 475 subjects who remained, based on recovery and nonrecovery by the end of grade 3, were formulated into seven profiles, one for each testing period. The pattern indicated that no single test or subtest proved to be predictive at all periods. Results demonstrated a consistent increase in the number of subjects  recovering, with 56% recovering without therapy. Higher recovery rates were found among subjects with a protrusional lisp only or with less severe articulation problems initially and more rapid reduction of errors throughout. Also, subjects producing [t,d,n,l] with the tongue tip and not the blade had a better chance to recover without therapy. (Author/JD)",

Training procedures utilized information obtained from the basic psychological research on discrimination learning. One-half of the subjects worked with the parts of the training task brake as they came from the factory (Form only). The others worked with parts that were color coded (Color Form). Coding consisted of painting that surface of each part that is facing the subject when it is placed in the proper position for assembly. All groups worked with the parts of the transfer task brake as they came from the factory (Form only). Half of the subjects learned the tasks to a criterion of six correct out of eight consecutive  trials, the other half performed 20 trials beyond criterion on the training task brake (overlearning). The Color Form groups learned the training task brake significantly faster than the Form Only groups. No significant overlearning effect was found. (Author)",

Subjects were instructed to learn eight pairs of pictures which were presented by a slide projector. There were four groups in both the P and C condition. The treatment for these groups consisted of practice trials followed by two blocks of neutral trials, or two blocks of test trials, or one block of test trials, or no intervening material. Inclusion of interspersed test trials significantly improved performance in the C condition (p less than .05). This supports Izawa's (1968) findings that interspersed nonreinforced test trials significantly improved performance in the C condition. The results suggest that subtle  variations in the methods of task presentation might be producing some of the discrepancies reported in studies on P and C learning. (Author)",

Of 265 students referred by their parents, 34% had faulty vision, 5% had impaired hearing, and 10% had faulty auditory discrimination. Twenty one percent of 160 reading clinic students had visual problems, 4% had hearing impairments, and 15% had auditory discrimination defects. The high incidence of poor auditory discrimination among the reading clinic subjects was held to be an indication of the relationship between this problem and poor reading. Vision, hearing, and auditory discrimination problems did not seem to affect reading achievement or IQ scores on standardized tests. All  children screened were given two questionnaires for their parents to complete; 68% were returned. The home background of most children was judged to be middle class; of the parent referred group, over half of the families had members with vision, hearing, or speech problems; 29% of the referred and 24% of the non-referred school age children had repeated a grade, and only 39% of the referred group and 45% of the non-referred group behaved constructively in the face of a difficult task.

        "description":"The classroom environment is a working surround in which children, through participating in organized experiences, can grow and develop in an optimum manner. Classroom design requires organization of principles of environmental control in order to assure efficient and successful performance. This control cannot be left to chance. In considering the nature of the human organism, how it regulates and maintains its body temperature, as well as those changes which occur under various forms of activity, three factors are relevant to design and control of the thermal environment of classrooms--(1) the developing child differs from the adult and needs a different set of standards for controlling his thermal environment in the school, (2) thermally induced stresses can alter the growth,  development, and learning of children, and (3) the child's problem-solving capacity is affected by the effective temperature of his classroom. If we are to meet the needs of our growing children, then this understanding necessary for proper classroom design must include knowledge of the control of heat, air movement, and humidity along with that of light, sound, structural materials, teaching space, and the other areas that enter into making adequate classrooms in our schools.

Very little is known about the energy aspects of the thermal environment as it affects learning performance. Three basic points on this matter can be identified here--(1) the biochemical make-up of the developing child necessitates a different set of standards for controlling the thermal school environment from those used for adults, (2) because organic function is modified through stress, and action which is induced by any energy organization, the school  thermal environment requires more careful control (temperature, air movement, and humidity) to assure promotion of optimum learning, and (3) full rapport in problem-solving situations depends on shifts in internal body temperature and close maintenance of certain body temperature levels: this fact necessitates rigid control to assure optimum learning outcomes. Considerable work is needed to establish the norms of these temperature levels for children, together with their tolerance for variations while engaging in school activities. (KK)",

This school is planned to encourage the intermingling of liberal arts students with vocational-technical students since many of their courses coincide. Increased exposure to a wider range of subjects will benefit all students. The six-structure complex of Nicolet is planned to include a science center, campus center, learning resource center, art-tech center, business education center, and recreational center. Many instruction areas will be separated only by movable storage units rather than fixed walls, providing greater flexibility  in the utilization of space. This open concept offers side-by-side comparison of studies between liberal arts and vo-tech students. The six \"chalet\" style buildings located on the 280-acre wooded site will be constructed of fieldstone, rough-sawn cedar and weathered wood with wide areas of glass. (TC)",

We are at last emerging from the dark tunnel of the \"trade school\", away from the cold institutional look, the clamor of shop classrooms, echoing corridors, and the invisible tattoo of \"labor\" or \"dropout\" on each student's forehead. This change in attitude has found its realization in the design of new facilities as follows--(1) the community college concept, offering more prestige than is usually found in vocational-technical institutions, (2) the shopping center concept--each class having large glass doors opening onto an outdoor mall, allowing students to window shop and providing a wider range of vocational  experiences, and (3) the resort concept, a combined liberal arts and vocational-technical campus which is gaining in popularity and where, in an atmosphere similar to that of their chosen profession, students may learn skills in connection with forestry, boats, jeeps, snowmobiles, or motel management. These vast changes are in keeping with the responsibility we have to strengthen America by providing educational facilities which will actually motivate and encourage people to learn to be self-respecting and self-supporting citizens.

        "description":"The hypothesis that students will express no preference between carrels and open table type of accommodation in a language laboratory was tested in a four-week study. Two identical rooms, one containing carrels and the other containing open tables, were connected to a single control room and used by 1,080 university students (enrolled in language courses) who served as subjects. The students were observed in four week-long phases in which their behavior in selecting and using laboratory accommodation was observed; a verbal instrument designed to solicit factors in their selection of laboratory accommodation was administered; a questionnaire to determine each subject's normal choice of accommodation, whether he attended sessions alone or with a friend, and the effects of  restricting him to one or the other of the rooms was completed by each student. Another observation procedure which identified subject choices by sex and a short questionnaire designed to identify preference, isolation, social, and interference variables were completed. Findings were that while students verbally preferred carrels, they actually used tables, that students at carrels were more easily disturbed, and that female students were more decisive in their choice of open tables and were more likely to attend with friends.

Randomly selected groups of students were tested before and after to evaluate the program's effectiveness in terms of pre-program objectives. These including helping students to increase their liking for school, to retain information gained on the trips more easily, to indicate a more positive attitude toward other racial and ethnic groups, and to learn more about existing city services. Faculty evaluations of the program were also obtained. Faculty opinion was divided, but was generally favorable to continuation of the program if administrative details could be more carefully worked out. Subsequent testing on students revealed that  there was no significant increase in their liking for school and that absenteeism and lack of punctuality did not decrease. Also, no change was noted in attitudes towards other racial or ethnic groups. However, retention of information received on the trips was significant and students were able to identify slides of places visited. Few city service agencies were visited so that this objective could not be evaluated. Sample tests, interview schedules and evaluation forms are included in the appendix. (SH)",

Next, the planner must choose between a centralized-studio, decentralized-mobile, or combination philosophy of operation through analyzing cost effectiveness and ability to  meet functional requirements, and determine the size and number of systems (each of which consists of program origination, distribution, and reception components) needed. Once these decisions have been made, the television studio can be planned and equipped with the system (large, medium or small) which is best suited to the proposed instructional objectives, operational philosophy, and budget. Finally, the system should be staffed with an administrator, a coordinator of objectives and system capabilities, a non-technical operator, and a technician. (SP)",

He considered economic factors, availability of qualified personnel, space and physical plant, potential to provide the required service, and the degree of acceptance of individual institutions. He surveyed seven Utah universities and colleges, investigated the use of ITV activities at Brigham Young University and Hill Air Force Base, collected information about the use of ITV in higher education in other states, and conducted a review of research on the use of television as a tool in the teaching-learning process. In checking his information against the criteria, he found that only the national  outlook for qualified personnel and the degree of acceptance by individual institutions were unacceptable. The author feels that both these objections may be readily overcome: those who have used ITV are usually converted to its favor, and the recruitment of the few personnel necessary for a centralized facility in a metropolitan area would be easier than staffing many smaller facilities in rural areas. He concludes that a centralized ITV facility would be of great benefit to the state of Utah. A bibliography is appended. (JY)",

A total of 114 boxes on 16 topics, largely in the social sciences, were assembled. Each box contained enough real objects, filmstrips, pictures, games, and supplies for 30 students to investigate the topics for two to three weeks. A teacher's guide offered lesson plans and information about the materials with the purpose of helping the teacher to pattern a three-way  encounter between herself, the children, and the materials. The boxes were developed by teams of subject matter specialists, teachers, artists, and technicians over a period of four years. Three generations of boxes were evaluated. The teachers participating in the testing phase were asked to make a daily and an overall appraisal of the materials. Random visits by observers provided more information about the usefulness of the boxes. A second volume of the report contains analysis and evaluation of the project.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to set forth some criticisms of faculty senates, the most common type of representation system on US campuses. Faculty senates vary a great deal but are all, in theory and practice, a type of employee council. Historically, employee councils have failed to provide effective leadership and some of their deficiencies are shared by faculty senates: a lack of independent funds, a lack of expertise needed for effective representation, control of internal affairs by the administration (the employer), and lack of recourse to a national structure that could bring pressure to bear upon a recalcitrant administration. Why faculties support such an objectionable system may be explained by the academicians' belief in a distinction between the terms \"professional\"  and \"employee.\" Faculty members have generally confused the line between employment and professional problems--a confusion particularly prevalent in current thinking about entry to professorial positions. The public policy of faculty committees should also be considered. The function of faculty representation should not be faculty administration of an institution, but to ensure that administration is equitable and efficient. If the faculty itself is responsible for administrative action, faculty rights are practically without protection from administrative abuse. (JS)",

The prototype undergraduate curriculum is based on the concept that only students educated in the social sciences, humanities, arts and natural sciences will have the breadth of understanding and the professional discipline to use their skills and knowledge effectively. Various combinations of liberal arts, specialized science and technical courses plus clinical experience are suggested for the health sciences programs, 3 of which are  patient-oriented (Radiotherapeutic Technology, Communications Science and Physical Therapy), 1 community-oriented (Community Health Education), and 1 laboratory or research-oriented, with alternate professional specializations (Laboratory Science Technology, leading to Medical Technology or to research in biology). The curriculum for laboratory science technology is the most demanding one proposed. The teaching staff will comprise faculty of CUNY's senior and community colleges and of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Staff members from Mount Sinai Hospital and its affiliated hospitals' clinical research laboratories will serve as adjunct instructors. (WM)",

        "description":"In 1965, the legislature of the State of Missouri enacted a bill which provided for the establishment of upper-division programs at the Jasper County (Missouri Southern) and St. Joseph (Missouri Western) Junior Colleges. Under the same bill, the Board of Curators of Missouri University was charged with setting standards to determine the adequacy of a 4-year state college at either or both locations and the sufficiency of enrollment trends to justify its operation. The standards proposed in this report are (1) upper-division enrollments of at least 1,200 full-time students as part of a total student enrollment of 3,000, and (2) campuses --including land, buildings, and equipment-- costing at least $12 million. The justifications for these standards are discussed, based on  per-student costs and high-quality instruction; tuition charges and enrollment trends; what the curricula of 4-year colleges are expected to offer; construction costs as they relate to projected student costs, and long-range planning for higher education in Missouri. Since the level of student enrollments and available funds at Missouri Southern is closer to that set by the proposed standards, it is recommended that an upper-division program be established there when its lower-division full-time student enrollment reaches 1,800, or between 1967 and 1970. Expansion of the junior college program is proposed for Missouri Western and, when enrollments reach 1,800, a re-study of the need for upper-division programs. (WM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted of all undergraduate students who withdrew from courses at Hofstra University during the Fall 1966 semester. This report presents a descriptive analysis of the findings of this study. During the semester, 12% of the enrolled undergraduates withdrew from one or more courses. The highest rates of course withdrawals were associated with males, lower classmen, day students, those with relatively low GPAs, and those majoring in the natural sciences or business. Of those who cited reasons for withdrawal (69%), personal reasons were given most often by upperclassmen and evening students, and academic reasons most often by underclassmen and day students. In comparing early and late withdrawals during the semester, it was found that later withdrawals were associated  with males, day students, and those with GPAs under 3.00. Twenty percent of the withdrawals occurred during the last week of the semester. A comparison of Hofstra's withdrawal policies with other NYC area schools and Harvard University revealed that Hofstra's requirements appear to be less stringent in regard to when withdrawal is permitted and whose approval is necessary. It is concluded that although change in withdrawal policy should be considered in terms of its overall effect on student learning, it would be difficult to predict the effect of such change. (DS)",

The main goal of this institutional research is to acquire a bank of longitudinal data on each Beloit class in order to study change during the time the class is at Beloit. This report continues the descriptive work of the previous ones but it also includes a series of letters written by student drop-outs on the reasons for their withdrawal from Beloit and a statistical study analyzing information on Beloit drop-outs. The data used to study and discuss student backgrounds, goals and values, and the Beloit atmosphere were gathered from questionnaires published by the Educational Testing Service (the CUES and CSQ-I scales) and the American Council on Education. The  CUES and CSQ data were collected in such a way as to shed some light on the question of when changes occurred in students' attitudes, if they occurred during the students' first year in college. Throughout the text, tables compare differences among self-descriptions and descriptions of the college environment offered by the Classes of 1970, 1971 and 1972. The Beloit students were also compared with those of other colleges and universities. (JS)",

        "description":"This paper presents views on long-range financial planning for public and private higher education. Emphasis is placed on a mix of revenue sources for future support and on key budgetary considerations such as faculty and non-academic wages, the rising cost of graduate education, and the community and junior college movement. A triple crisis is seen in the current educational world: crises in educational opportunity, economics, and government, with the economic crisis accompanied by questions of management, accountability, and control. The escalation of higher education costs and the current crisis over control of the university seem to be eroding the solid public support --and increasing tax funds-- that could be depended on year after year. It is felt that states or regions  will not be able to finance the expansion of higher education in the next 10 years from the growth of existing state tax revenues. The key question for higher education support is the mix of tax revenues, depending upon public, federal, and state attitudes toward supporting colleges and universities. The extension of financial planning time periods from the typical biennium to a 5-year or a 10-year comprehensive scheme is recommended. A discussion of the financial status of higher education is presented with a forecast of some directions that its support may take in the future. (WM)",

Data collected during personal interviews and from analyses of selected documents at each of the 5 consortia were summarized, and planning areas and activities were extracted or developed for utilization as elements of a model. Specific elements were determined in terms of  their contribution to 1 or more of 19 proposed objectives. These objectives, along with 9 assumptions, served to guide the selection of the model's activity components and to provide a framework for time estimates and for a sequence of activities. The activities were arranged in a precedence diagram which was later converted to a 25-foot long PERT Network that graphically illustrates the 292-step model. The report contains 4 diagrams of the Network, and lists the 19 objectives, 9 assumptions, and 14 subsystems of activities that were developed for the attainment of network objectives. (WM)",

This document, consisting mainly of 203 tables, contains the results of this study, which examined students in the 14 four-year and 14 two-year state-controlled institutions. The study indicates that the freshman year performance of the Fall 1966 enrollees are markedly similar in most respects to the performance of the Fall 1967 enrollees, although the percentage of academic failures was slightly lower in 1967. The percentage of student withdrawals from the 2-year institutions decreased noticeably during the second  year, while the percentage of withdrawals from the 4-year institutions remained constant during the sophomore year. A combination of SAT scores and the secondary school record seems to be the best predictor of academic success in most of the institutions, although the secondary school record is the best single predictor. Student-initiated withdrawals, comprising almost 90% of all withdrawals, constitute a major concern, and future Council studies will continue to give special attention to this factor because of its relevance to the planning for higher education in Virginia.

A 2% standard, based on the fact that Virginia has 2.2% of the total national population, is used to measure the state's relationship to the US as a whole. In areas of taxation and financial support for schools and colleges, Virginia is significantly below the 2% standard. Its performance in education, which should approximate 2% of national performance, is much lower. The median number of school years completed by the average adult Virginian in 1960 was 9.9, compared to a national average of 10.6; variations among state counties range from 6.5 to 12.8 years of schooling. In 1964, institutions of  higher education in Virginia had only 1.54% of all students enrolled in the US. Degree production is low. The greatest deficiency is at the graduate level, where production is less than 1% of national totals, and the rate of increase is slow. Accredited colleges and universities are not well distributed geographically to serve the various local areas of the state. The programs and locations of these institutions are analyzed and the state-wide patterns for various kinds of higher education services are displayed in a series of 62 maps. A projection of enrollment trends suggests that by 1980, the college-age population in Virginia may more than double current totals. (WM)",

The interviews, designed to examine the processes of governance in different campus environments, revealed 4 aspects of presidential style which are discussed within and across institutional lines: how and with whom the president consults and how he delegates; the channels of information and decision-making through which he operates; the people on whom he becomes dependent, and why; and the matters which he makes public and those which he keeps confidential. A look at the range of presidential approaches to governance, through democratic, autocratic, hierarchical, or participative structures (or through a  combination of any 2 of these), leads to the conclusion that institutional structure is less important in explaining differences in the ability of presidents to energize the system than are the PEOPLE who comprise the system. Successful presidents are able to estimate what responsibilities the individuals comprising the system are willing to take on, and push organizational levers in such a way that people actually become involved. The author suggests a radical redefinition of governance, one that is based less on decision-making, systems analysis and task orientations and more on the quality of participation. (WM)",

Despite different means of measurement, there are some general similarities in the results that indicate that college environments may be characterized by their degree of intellectualism, humanism and estheticism, vocationalism or pragmatism, and sense of community. Analyses of studies suggest certain tentative conclusions. First, certain types of institutions--denominational, junior colleges, state universities, etc.--tend to have quite similar profiles. Secondly, many pieces of the college environment fit together in ways that do not correspond to common  organizational categories. For instance, the degree of success of independent study programs may depend upon the amount of responsibility that students are given in non-academic areas. Further studies of college environments need to explore additional dimensions and directions. There are different contents of inquiry and methods of approach for such studies. This type of inquiry may be labelled the study of \"climates\"--namely, the particular combination of causes associated with a specific result. (DS)",

        "description":"To determine whether there is a trend toward using the summer session as a fourth quarter, the enrollment patterns of 3 groups of students at the University of Minnesota were compared over a 5-year period covering the 1964 to 1968 summer sessions and the 1963-1964 to 1967-1968 academic years. The student groups comprised degree candidates who attended the university only during the academic years, others who studied only during the summers, and &quot;summer session only&quot; students who registered during 1 or several summers but were not degree candidates. No established year-to-year enrollment pattern was found over a 5-year span within summer sessions or academic years or between the 2 registration periods, but similar enrollment increases were revealed. The proportion of &quot;summer  session only&quot; students decreased by more than 5% between 1964 and 1968, and the proportion of academic-year students who attended summer sessions increased by more than 5%. These proportions reflect that the number of academic-year students within the summer sessions has increased at a faster rate than the number of &quot;summer session only&quot; students, but do not indicate a changing trend toward a four-quarter system. The most significant finding of the study is the stability of relationships of enrollment patterns revealed by the comparison between the summer sessions and the academic years. (WM)",

        "description":"In the spring of 1968, a research seminar was held at New York University's School of Law for the purpose of developing a basic rationale for university regulation of student conduct that would provide students with as much freedom as possible in the pursuit of their educational objectives. This document, prepared by 16 students and 4 faculty members, is a product of the seminar. Chapter 1 discusses the role of the university and student dissatisfactions which coalesced and erupted into activist demonstrations during the 1960's. Chapter 2 presents 3 commonly held theories on student discipline and offers a rationale for a more relevant disciplinary process. Chapter 3 examines the question of student rights and responsibilities in the modern university context. While pointing out  that academic freedom in the fullest sense of the expression is indispensable to the existence of the university, this chapter defines the range and scale of sanctions available to the disciplinary authority within a university, and outlines activities limited or forbidden to students, for violations of which a disciplinary sanction may be imposed. Chapter 4 presents recommendations for the establishment of rule-making authority and of judicial capacity in relation to matters of student conduct and discipline. A selected bibliography is appended. (WM)",

        "description":"This project was undertaken to encourage and aid developing predominantly Negro colleges in the South in adopting new approaches for improving curricula and instruction. The chief means for doing so was a conference on innovation in November 1967 attended by representatives of the administration, faculty, and students of 27 institutions. The Southern Regional Education Board planned the conference to encourage participants to consider innovative practices, identify hindrances, and develop plans for implementation. On the basis of participant interest, 5 areas were chosen for workshops. Lively discussions indicated the problems involved in change, including the \"generation gap.\" Although provision was made for assistance in carrying out plans formulated at the conference, only 2  schools requested such aid within the next 6 months. As a result of an interim survey taken in June 1968, the project deadline was extended to June 1969 and 4 promising programs were selected for special assistance. At the closing evaluation conference, participants reported over 90 innovations under way at their schools. They suggested continuation along with improvement of similar projects. Discussions indicated that while there is a deep interest in innovation at many developing colleges, inexperience, conservative factions, and lack of time and money hinder progress. (DS)",

The cited advantages of the interim session include: reduced course load during the regular semesters, opportunities for independent study and off-campus study programs, the inter-disciplinary emphasis of course work, and the &quot;change of pace.&quot; Disadvantages in this calendar arrangement include a loss of continuity in year-long courses, faculty load arrangement problems, poor student attendance, lack of  student initiative, and the additional work required in planning. Some of the schools cited no disadvantages. Smith College, however, adopted the 4-1-4 plan, but dropped it because of compressed and rapid courses, weak projects, and lack of student initiative. The comments of respondents at 9 colleges that had not yet adopted the plan, but were either planning to, or interested in doing so, are also included. The questionnaire is included in the appendix.

        "description":"The documents listed below are sets of instructional objectives for 39 courses taught at the junior college level. The specific objectives are typically arranged in terms of several major course goals. The major goals indicate what is generally to become of students taking the course by specifying actions to be taken, skills to be learned, abilities to be gained, or attitudes to be held or modified as a result of having taken the course. The objectives indicate specific, observable student actions or the product of such action, and to be properly utilized should also indicate the circumstances under which the action will be taken, and the degree of accuracy to which the student is to perform. The intent is not to standardize course offerings, but rather to provide prototype goals  and objectives for several course offerings in order that an instructor may choose for inclusion into his course those goals and objectives consistent with the skills, abilities, and attitudes he desires his students to acquire. It is hoped that these objectives will also serve as models for translating other units of instruction into specific, measurable terms as a first step toward an assessment of the actual impact of curriculum on the student. Included in this document is a list of the instructors from whose courses the objectives were drawn, and a list of other documents in the ERIC Clearinghouse for Junior Colleges' collection that are concerned with instructional objectives.

The survey team obtained data from interviews with staff of state agencies, visits to libraries throughout the state, and questionnaires sent to libraries, library boards and public school officials. Library conditions in the state were found to be far below the minimum required for effective service. As an over-all recommendation, the report suggests that &quot;Standards for Library Functions at the State Level&quot; be used as the basic guide in planning for  development of library services. Recommendations for public library service include cooperative federations, development of four regional resource centers, drafting necessary legislation, and separation of school and public library services. Recommendations were also made for the reorganization of the State Library Commission and for improvement of the North Dakota Historical Society Library. Appendixes include a discussion of school-public library relationships and the survey questionnaires. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (JB)",

W. Adorno, and others (New York, Harper, 1950). The hypothesis is that graduate library students who express approval of or display a tendency to agree with restrictive controls on intellectual freedom will also concur with many of the attitudes characteristic of the authoritarian syndrome. If the hypothesis is correct, those students whose opinions score high on a censorship scale will also score high on the authoritarianism scale (Fascism or F scale). The questionnaire, distributed to students in December, 1968, contained 27 statements about  intellectual freedom, book selection, and the role of the librarian interspersed with the 18 questions from the F scale test. The findings of the study support the hypothesis that library school students who show a tendency to agree with restrictive measures on intellectual freedom also agree with attitudes characteristic of the authoritarian syndrome. The study did not reveal that a large number of students agree with either censorship measures or with authoritarian attitudes. A copy of the questionnaire is appended. (Author/CC)",

The library systems provided data on existing programs for the disadvantaged. The purposes of the study were 1) to evaluate existing outreach programs for the disadvantaged; 2) to determine, portray and summarize the personality characteristics in cognitive style of the disadvantaged population that should be viewed in the planning of library or educational projects or programs; 3) to summarize and present demographic data on the unique characteristics of the depressed areas of each city included in the  study; and 4) to derive realistic recommendations that can be implemented. The report includes findings and recommendations, a philosophical position on community control of the library, characteristics of the disadvantaged group the library strives to reach, and separate discussions of the situations in Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse.

With the organization of the library systems and development of interlibrary loan services and other cooperative activities, the problem of extending resource sharing among member libraries and between library systems arose. Several library systems have initiated union catalogs and a primary consideration of this study has been the status and utility of those union catalogs. The study indicates that union catalogs for library systems will not be of much practical value in interlibrary loan services and that money and effort can be better expended in other directions. The direction with the greatest potential is automated centralized processing and cataloging. The  cataloging performed by the Library of Congress and available in its catalog cards and Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC) magnetic tapes is a means to avoid unnecessary cataloging duplication and provides a convenient tool for automated processing.

These agencies are the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Office of Economic Opportunity, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Labor, the Small Business Administration, and the Department of Agriculture. Several programs are listed for each agency. The publication summarizes each program under four headings: authorization, eligibility, funds, and review. Addresses for further information are also listed. The programs for which funds may be used include providing direct care of children in day care facilities, other day care services such as the training of personnel, research,  and demonstration projects relating to various aspects of day care. Grants are awarded either by matching formulas or by full funding. Though most of the programs award funds or loans to state or local public agencies, private organizations, and schools, a few programs grant funds to individuals. (JF)",

        "description":"The research of this author indicates that the development of high self-esteem (defined as the good-bad dimension of self-concept) is associated with (1) acceptance, (2) clearly defined limits and moderately high goals, and (3) respectful treatment. Such factors as status, income, and education are only related to high self-esteem if they are a part of an individual's personal definition of success. Since high self-esteem is correlated with need-achievement, which proves to be a self-fulfilling prophecy for success, and low self-esteem is correlated with fear of failure, which proves to be a self-fulfilling prophecy for failure, it is clear that our educational techniques should foster high self-esteem. Further, it has been shown that (1) self-motivation derives from seeing  oneself develop competency (through internal feedback, not social approval), (2), stringent but reasonable early challenges facilitate development, and (3) the school situation can either hurt a student's self-esteem or equip him with the mechanisms to maintain it at a high level. Our present educational system hinges on the anxiety-provoking, self-esteem lowering reliance of the student on the teacher's approval, grades, and attention. A preferable alternative would shift emphasis to self-motivation, based on high self-esteem. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (MH)",

        "description":"This report presents a description of the Structure-Process approach to cognition and literacy, suggests techniques for implementation of the model, and assesses the effects of the model on a specific population. The Structure-Process approach assumes that intelligence develops cumulatively. The model was used for curriculum development in four rural and urban early childhood centers enrolling 290 3- to 7-year-old disadvantaged Negro children. A checklist was filled out by the teacher three times during the year to assess each child's progress in communication, fine arts, and physical activities. Analysis of variance results showed significantly higher gains for girls compared to boys, perhaps reflecting maturational superiority and/or teacher favoritism. Pre- and  postadministration of the Preschool Attainment Record produced significant gains on measures of creativity, and physical, social, and intellectual development. According to pre- and posttest scores on the Slosson Intelligence Test, the program had maximum effect on younger children. Cross-test comparisons using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence and variations in administration of instruments indicate that pretest scores may have been inflated, thus reducing pretest-posttest differences.

The 39 middle class children were measured with the Lee-Clark Reading Readiness Test after 5 weeks of school and again after 90 days. Results indicated (1) that there was a positive relationship between reading readiness achievement and kindergarten training in  younger children, and (2) that without kindergarten training, maturation plays a large part in affecting children's reading readiness achievement. It was concluded that early exposure to formal school training is desirable for all children, and a reevaluation and revision of available reading readiness tests was suggested. (DR)",

        "description":"A 3-year study based on Piagetian theory considered this question: Do children who receive systematic instruction in the basic concepts of mathematics and science when they are in kindergarten think more logically when they reach second grade than do children who did not have such early instruction? The groups having prescribed lessons in kindergarten were also compared with groups whose prescribed lessons began only in the first grade. Kindergarteners were assessed in the fall of 1965, 1966, and 1967, and first graders in the fall of 1966 and 1967. The children were pre- and posttested on a series of tasks derived from Piaget's work. The results in logical thinking ability seem to pose a paradox. The second grade group who had no prescribed lessons in either kindergarten or  first grade performed about as well as the group who had prescribed lessons in kindergarten. But the latter group performed better than the group whose prescribed lessons began in the first grade. These ambiguous results suggest that the comparability of the groups of children, and the comparability of their school experience, apart from the prescribed programs, needs further examination.

The theoretical basis was that the ways to achieve the varied goals of education (knowledge of subject matter and development of all aspects of the individual) are compatible. The study had two phases. In the major phase, the causes of student progress were sought by relating such progress to measures of classroom process and to measures of a teacher's personality and behavior. In the minor phase, the effects of sensitivity training for teachers were measured in a classic control-experimental group procedure. The subjects were the teachers and students in 57  classrooms, grades 3 through 6, in four metropolitan elementary schools. Pretesting, posttesting, personality measures and observations of classroom process were extensive and detailed. Results of the minor phase are not clear, but tend to support previous findings that effectiveness of sensitivity training tends to correlate highly with the teacher's level of psychic resources. Results of the major phase in general support the theory of compatibility of the varied goals of education. Benefits of sensitivity training can be measured, although not everyone is benefited.

The lower a child's initial IQ was, the more likely he was to make large gains after nursery school experience indicating that the diversity of intellectual capacity was not as great as the original IQs showed. The children of low socioeconomic status who scored low on the initial IQ test made the most gains during the second year of the program. Language ability, however, remained below average even after the second year. Children in the higher SES made gains during the first year. (MH)",

The resultant test was called the Modified Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (M-PPVT). Two samples from the same lower class population were compared on the standard and modified test versions. The M-PPVT required the examiner to provide encouragement and approval, to follow a schedule of high reinforcement, and to give specific instructions before each stimulus word. A modified record sheet facilitated administration and recording of responses. In Study I both test forms were administered twice to 36 Negro children. There was slightly increased score stability under  the M-PPVT, but practice effects were not significant. Boys scored significantly higher than girls. In Study II, 19 black children took the PPVT and 19 took the M-PPVT. Results suggested that the M-PPVT offered a slight advantage to low-scoring subjects possibly due to examiner controls. Selection and evaluation of test instruments for disadvantaged preschoolers should consider psychometric properties, and the influences of examiner styles and test administration controls on performance.

In the present study, 89 children from the 18 and 24 month samples of the previous study were tested on the Stanford-Binet at 3 years of age, and their mothers were given the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. There were highly significant differences on the Stanford-Binet between groups based on different socioeconomic status. Correlations between child's score and mother's score tend to increase with the child's age. These findings match those previously reported for  white children. Interpretation of the data seems to indicate that social class influences on intellectual performance are operating but statistically insignificant at 18 and 24 months, finally becoming significant during the third year of life. Rather than being caused by either malnutrition or hereditary factors, social class differences in intellectual development may be due to differences in the acquisition of abstract knowledge, the pattern of verbal interaction between parents and child, and differences in symbolic thinking ability.

Twenty-three children had been cared for by their mothers from birth until 30 months of age, and 18 had been enrolled in a day care center for at least 1 year. Data sources were an intensive semistructured interview to rate mother-child interaction, a Home Stimulation Inventory scored on the basis of a home visit, and developmental testing using the Stanford-Binet or Cattell Infant Intelligence Scale. No significant differences in child-mother or mother-child attachment were found between children reared at home and day care children. In respect to child-mother attachment, better developed infants tended  to be more positively related to their mothers and came from homes where a high quantity and quality of stimulation was available. It was concluded that infant day care programs can contribute positively to the cognitive, social, and emotional development of the child without harming the child's emotional attachment to the mother.

The commands involved various English idioms used for conjunction (e.g. both black and round), disjunction (either black or round), and negation (not round). Analysis of the results indicated that socioeconomic status was the most telling factor, with disadvantaged children performing poorest. In addition, the older children performed better than the younger ones, but sex differences were not significant. The data further showed that disjunction was by far the most difficult operation for children and that the idiom in which the concept was expressed was a significant factor. A  predictive regression model was developed from the data. A second experiment was performed with 112 4- to 6-year-olds. This experiment was modeled after the first except that type of connective, type of idiom, and order of commands were varied. The type of connective had the greatest effect but negation was also an important variable. (MH)",

In Part One, 64 neuromuscular, perceptual, and cognitive measurements made on 36 educationally handicapped children with normal IQ's were subjected to Q-technique factor analysis. The two major patterns of deficits associated with low academic achievement were (1) auditory, language, and sequencing, and (2) postural and bilateral integration. Part Two sought syndromes of dysfunction from an R-technique factor analysis of perceptual-motor test scores. Q-analysis subjects and additional children with academic problems were tested. Emerging factors  represented types of statistical associations among behavioral parameters apt to be affected by neurodevelopmental disorders. Part Three hypothesized that educationally handicapped children in special classes receiving sensorimotor training show a greater change in perceptual-motor, language, and academic achievement scores than children receiving the equivalent amount of additional classroom instruction. Test scores failed to support this hypothesis. The major contribution of the entire project was the identification of postural and bilateral integration deficit which interfered with learning. (JF)",

The program works with the mother, who, as educators are discovering, has more influence on the child than anyone else. The program recruits parent educators from environments similar to those of mothers with whom they will work. The parent educators visit parents in their homes and provide them with specific tasks to work on with their children. The parent educator is also expected to be a part of the classroom instructional system so she and the teacher collaborate on home tasks to provide both school-relevant and home-relevant  behavior in the child. The program at this point appears to be moderately successful. Although, the only information available is subjective, it indicates that parent interest is increased, that parents are working more with children, and that there is more individual and small group instruction in the classroom than ever before.

The project was carried out in a rural Appalachian school with 122 children, 30 percent Negro and 70 percent white, and in an urban school with 350 children, 95 percent white and 5 percent nonwhite. Both schools were in low income areas. An emphasis on individualization and an ungraded teaching approach was used in the rural school for children in kindergarten through third grade. Teachers met with testing and curriculum consultants; parents attended group meetings; and future program plans were made by the local school district. The urban school program was  similar but had a more active and successful parent education program and better coordination of agencies. To evaluate the program, all children were pre- and posttested, using the Oral Language Scale, the Science and Math Study Group Individual Math Inventory, the Metropolitan Achievement Test, and the California Test of Mental Maturity. There were no control groups. Both groups of children showed significant cognitive gains and teachers in both schools improved in knowledge of education for the culturally deprived. (DR)",

Major psychological theories on maturation, child development, child behavior, personality formation, and affective and intellectual development are summarized and their effects on nursery school practices from the 1920's to the present are described. Three models of early childhood education are chosen to illustrate the diverse types of programs available for young children today. The key features of the Bank Street model, the Kansas model, and the Ypsilanti model are described, compared, and contrasted. Each program's theoretical conceptions of human nature are analyzed to illustrate the models' fundamental differences about the sources of human development. Conclusions  are that (1) teachers should be aware of philosophical assumptions and psychological theories in early childhood education models and (2) the absence of consensus on the &quot;right&quot; way to educate young children should lead to continued experimentation and receptivity to psychological theories and educational strategies.

This study hypothesized that reinforcement and reward techniques used to promote self-esteem should include activities relevant to both Mexican and American cultures. Specific predictions were that (1) the most effective treatment would be reinforcement of achievement behavior using rewards acceptable to the Mexican community, (2) the second most effective treatment would be reinforcement of socioemotional behavior using non-Mexican rewards, and (3) the least effective treatment would be reinforcement of socioemotional behavior using Mexican rewards and reinforcement of achievement behavior using non-Mexican rewards. Subjects were 56 low achieving Mexican-American children, grades 1  to 4. Children were randomly assigned to treatment groups that stressed simple academic tasks, and rewards for selected behaviors. Results from pre- and posttesting on a variety of tests did not confirm specific predictions, but did support the general hypothesis of a bicultural approach to improve Mexican-American children's self-esteem.

The card files of the Division of School Accreditation were examined to determine the number of schools which received either clear, advised, or warned recommendations. The search revealed that approximately 67% of all small twelve grade school districts received one or more accreditation visits during the period from September 1960 through May 1969. Statistical summaries and comparisons are presented. It was concluded that Small Schools Project members: have a slightly  more favorable accreditation status record; have not received an accreditation discontinuation or tentative discontinuation date after joining the project; and solve their problems more readily. It was also concluded that more valid conclusions might be reached if accreditation visits were made with greater regularity; the Texas Small Schools Project may not affect many of the factors producing accreditation deficiencies; and further study of Project school deficiencies might be warranted in order to discover possible new directions for Project efforts.

Data on family composition, place of residence of husband and wife during childhood, educational attainment, and current age and occupation of husband were obtained from a random sample of 2,178 households in Des Moines, Iowa. Four groups of data were studied in detail: (1) incidence of migrants from communities of different sizes and patterns of migration; (2) status achievement patterns;  (3) community relationships; and (4) family relationships. The conclusions of the study were that most differences between farm migrants and urban migrants and urban natives were accounted for by lower education levels among farm migrants.

Conclusions are that many of America's outdoor recreation sites are located at considerable distances from population concentrations and require substantial expense to visit. In the case of lower class families, these sites are located at proportionally greater distances than for the population in general. Consequently, lower class families must spend both proportionally and absolutely greater amounts of their income in order to utilize outdoor recreation opportunities. Furthermore, an examination of the Land and Water Conservation Fund distrubution formula reveals possible inequities in the  support of outdoor recreation by middle and lower class Americans.

It is the school's responsibility to educate citizens for the worthy use of leisure time and to use and enjoy natural resources, man-made resources, or combined resources. Properly conceived, outdoor education can contribute significantly to the quality of educational offering as well as improve teacher-pupil relationships. Some resources that can enrich the teaching-learning process are school grounds, buildings, telephone and flag poles, streets, gardens, farms, mines, and camp areas. Since it is a less formal approach to learning, pre-trip planning and preparation and post-trip follow-up are important. Specific objectives must  be carefully planned to meet the needs and interests of the pupils in the school and the community. The teacher must enjoy the out-of-doors and be willing to learn.

Talent Search committees have been organized in 4 counties to perform such services as furnishing leads, helping recruit, arranging interviews, and assisting with other programs. Statistics are presented on services performed by Talent Search counselors during the first 3 months of 1969 and on Indian enrollment in Arizona colleges over a  two-year period. (JH)",

Essentially the students are taught techniques of self-applied reward and punishment of their own choosing. The reinforcer is some stimulus which increases the probability of a certain behavior in the future. By ranking behaviors, the chance to engage in the higher probability behavior is used to increase the lower probability behavior. The effects of the psychology of public commitment are also utilized. The role of the teacher-counselor in this type of instrumented motivation is to function as an information disseminator and discussion leader.

A major objective was to provide Job Corps norms for the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, Survey E, forms 1M and 2M. Each center designated control and experimental groups. The experimental groups' 80 subjects received 40 class hours of reading instruction. The control group's 37 received no formalized reading instruction. The Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test was used for within groups data analyses; the Mann-Whitney U Test and the Moses Test of Extreme Reaction were used for between groups analyses. Significant differences were found between the experimental and the control groups and between  pretesting and post-testing on the comprehension subtest for those subjects rated at a fourth grade, ninth month and below reading level at time of entry into the program. This led to the conclusion that these remedial reading programs were best able to help the lower-level reader. The control group in Marquette showed significant gains on the vocabulary subtest. A strong relationship between formal education and reading achievement was noted. Data tables and charts are included. (Author/WB)",

The intersection of each area of study with a difficulty level was called a unit. Learner competence in each of these areas was determined by performance on four types of diagnostic instruments developed for the program: a placement test, a unit pretest, a curriculum-embedded test, and a unit post-test. Daily individual pupil  prescriptions based on pupil achievement and needs were written by the teacher. The prescription directed the child to staff-prepared worksheets, disc recordings and response sheets, adapted Sullivan Associates Programmed Reading materials, or other materials. Although the emphasis was on self-instruction, group instruction for particular purposes was done on a flexible basis.

Activities included information sharing and talking time, language and sensory-perceptual training units presented in small groups, eurhythmics, and a music and story hour. The sensory-perceptual training emphasized the development of concepts relative to size, color, number, form and  position, figure-ground discrimination, and auditory and visual skills.

Beginning in 1966, it showed substantial success in achieving its four goals: (1) the clinical diagnosis of pupils referred to it; (2) remediation of a select number of students; (3) inservice training of teachers, college students, and volunteer aides; and (4) development of an exemplary model for other clinical reading programs in the area. As a model and an innovative influence, the clinic proved a valuable experience in meeting and reacting to problems inherent in such a program. Staffing problems centered around a shortage of trained personnel and were met by part-time hiring of trained teachers and by training  volunteers. In its first 3 years, four clinicians, 37 professional staff members, 20 teachers, and 22 skilled volunteer aides were trained. Problems in research and reporting were partially met with data-processed summary profiles of the students; such data provided material for numerous reports that have had impact on remedial programs in some Nebraska schools. Dissemination of the types of information that would aid action was stressed. Funding complications taught the necessity of careful financial record keeping and of flexibility in planning. (BT)",

        "description":"When follow-through kindergarten and first-grade pupils in four school systems across the United States were encouraged to pick their own key vocabulary words as recommended by the Sylvia Ashton-Warner method and to apply the words to the language experience method of learning reading, the lists the children requested differed significantly from the vocabulary introduced in the basal readers being used in the schools. Located in Arkansas, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Washington state, the schools had adopted texts from different publishers. In three of the schools 50 percent or more of the subjects were black, and the children in the fourth location included mixed races from migrant workers' families. In only one school were the words chosen by the children significantly related to  the basal vocabulary; the pupil-selected vocabulary in one school correlated significantly to those in two other schools, and a significant correlation was found between vocabularies of all four of the basal texts. The use of the Ashton-Warner method resulted in enthusiastic reports from several teachers that their pupils \"were writing their own experience stories much earlier than children in previous years.\" References are cited.

A summary of the role of linguistics as it developed in the teaching of reading reviewed generally accepted principles about our language and its use. An eclectic approach to teaching reading was outlined, stressing that (1) letters should be learned before words and words before much exposure to large sentence patterns; (2) speech must come first, then writing and reading; (3) consistent words should  be taught before inconsistent words; and (4) basic words and patterns should be presented before uncommon words and patterns. Techniques such as expansion, coupling, cueing, mobility activities, slotting, additive activities, scrambling, skimming, and cloze exercises were recommended. An analysis of the vocabularies in beginning readers published by four companies showed that the sound symbols for which children develop skill in later years--such as r's, s's, and t's--were stressed in the texts' vocabularies.

A TV camera and monitor, together with a video-recorder, were used to measure the diameter of the pupil under a reading condition and under three control conditions. No evidence was obtained which would suggest that the pupil dilates while reading. The generality of these results was investigated by measuring the pupil size of 20 college students while listening to tape recordings of the reading passages. No evidence was obtained which suggested that the pupil dilates while listening. These results suggested that pupil size cannot be used as an objective indication of whether or not  an individual is, in fact, processing the information contained in connected discourse while he is supposedly engaged in reading or listening activities.

All of the subjects had scored 90 or above on a group IQ test and were designated as reading one grade below placement. The classes were divided for 8 months of training into three groups, each taught by different remedial methods: one visual, one kinesthetic, and one auditory-phonic approach. Pretest batteries to dermine skills in perceptual, perceptual-motor, and verbal areas and three reading tests were administered. The average of two reading tests was used as a post-test criterion. Prediction equations  in all three methods were applied to the post-test scores in order to compare simulated reactions to the two methods not used with a pupil to his actual reaction to the method used. More than half the total sample predictively would have achieved a tested reading level of from 7 months to 1 year higher had they been placed in methods other than the one to which they were assigned. This suggested that children's reactions to a remedial treatment can be predicted by their individual characteristics. Tables and references are included. (BT)",

Three questions were asked about whether flights could be made between certain islands. Answers to the questions were grouped into six different categories.

Results of the study indicate that intellectual development in abstract reasoning progresses gradually from grade 5 to grades 10 to 12, where little further progress is made and abstract reasoning reaches a plateau.

Where genera or species cannot be distinguished with the naked eye, only group descriptions are given. The plants are divided into twelve main groups on obvious structural characteristics; once the reader has decided to which of these groups a plant belongs, he should look at the illustrations of plants in the group and read their descriptions until he has a match. Each illustration and description is headed with a common name and scientific name; in general no attempt  is made to indicate the classification of the plant beyond the genus. Plants are indexed by both species name and common name. (EB)",

Post-tests were  administered to both groups in May, 1968. The Mann-Whitney U statistic was used as a test for differences between the two groups. The findings were: at all four grade levels there were no initial significant differences at the .05 level between the control and experimental groups.

Teachers were selected who used BSCS materials with inquiry methods, BSCS materials with traditional methods, traditional materials with inquiry methods, and traditional materials with traditional methods. Twelve students selected at random from the classes of each teacher chosen were pre-tested and post-tested using The Nelson Biology Test and The Processes of Science Test as a measure of achievement, then the same tests were administered after the summer vacation as a measure of retention. The data were analyzed by analysis of coveriance using the pretest scores as covariates in  analyzing the post-test scores, and the post-test scores as covariates in analyzing the retention scores. The results indicated that the BSCS students taught by inquiry methods showed the greatest achievement, all BSCS students showed greater retention, inquiry taught traditional students showed greater retention on the Processes of Science Test than traditionally taught traditional students, and tenth grade students out-performed ninth grade students. An unexpected finding was a positive relationship between class size and both achievement and retention. (EB)",

The highly organized large scale effort at implementation seemed to have considerable impact at first, but it is now hard to identify lasting effects. The organization of workshops and use of television for inservice teacher education is described, and data are given on the numbers of teachers reached in different areas of the school system over a three year period. A number of reasons for the observed decline in response are suggested, many of them stemming from a loss of interest and commitment on the part of administrators as well as teachers. It is suggested that the initiation of any project from a central office presents  problems, and that a central organization may make a more economical impact by providing support requested by schools or individuals. It is also argued that any effort at curriculum implementation requires careful evaluation as a basis for directing rational change. (EB)",

Cornerstone criteria are in the human relations and behavioral areas; content criteria in science, language arts, mathematics, aesthetics, social studies, foreign languages, and preschool education; supplementary criteria in evaluation, media, supervision, and technology. The model illustrates how teacher training may be viewed as a preservice-inservice continuum of experience; four basic elements of the  recognized educational setting are varying levels of responsibility, specific areas of specialization, careful initial and followup placement of all teacher candidates, and a system of strategies and systems to support the proposed program. Subsystems in the system conceptualization are (1) Control--to maintain day-to-day operation; (2) Administrative; (3) Information--to store data for decision-making; (4) Placement; (5) Educator--to generate instructional methods used by trainees; and (6) Analysis--to provide feedback regarding the quality, success, competency, acceptability, and competitiveness of system output.

This phenomenon becomes dangerous to learning only when the teacher's low expectations cause low achievement in a student whose past achievements and intelligence have not been correctly analyzed, when a teacher cannot adjust to a student classified as a low achiever who performs well, and when a teacher's mistakenly pessimistic judgment colors the student's own self-evaluation. This problem is especially prevalent when teachers deal with students from different cultural backgrounds (such as Mexican-Americans); the  information on which teachers base their prophesies is often misleading (as in the case of most intelligence tests which test knowledge of American culture and not learning ability), and the factors which motivate these students are not understood by most teachers. To break this cycle of low expectation-low achievement, teachers must become more sensitive to the needs of the disadvantaged student and to their own interactional verbal and nonverbal defense mechanisms which communicate harmful expectations to the student.

Lecture-discussion periods involved the use of political science systems analysis to study Negro politics since 1865. The methodology and media seminar on trends in teaching methods informed participants of the theory and rationale of the inquiry method and aided them in the preparation and presentation of teaching units. Audiovisual techniques used by the methodology instructional teams included game simulation, microteaching, a TV debate, and various  film and discussion techniques. Such mechanical aids as sound slides, microfilm reader-printers, and overhead projectors were demonstrated. Unique features included sensitivity sessions to break down personal barriers and fears and videotaping of teaching demonstrations to allow participants to view their own strengths and weaknesses. (Included are discussion of institute administration, analysis of participant evaluation questionnaires, curriculum content, outlines for the content and methodology components, lists of films used with brief content descriptions, and bibliography of materials used including lists of required and suggested readings.)

The essential aim of the proposed plan is &quot;to achieve by 1977 an average level of public-school performance in every state at least equal to a nationwide minimum standard of equalized excellence.&quot; The seven quantitatively defined goals (&quot;minimum standards of excellence&quot;) which the report identifies and analyzes are based on data compiled at the state and/or regional level. They relate to the areas of (1) per-pupil outlays; (2) student enrollment, (3) teacher-pupil ratio; (4) teachers' salaries; (5) nonteaching  instructional staff; (6) noninstructional current outlays; and (7) available supply of classrooms. The proposed 10-year plan is based on the principles of cost analysis and on a recommended formula for cost-sharing--a formula which recognizes and provides for the unequal distribution of economic and financial capabilities among regions and states. Underlying the presentation is the recognition that the first and most essential step is federal legislation which would reflect a reordering of national priorities and a commitment of the nation and people at large to achieving the goal of adequate education in the public schools.

McKeachie, in independently prepared statements made before a summer institute on effective teaching, emphasized that good learning is active rather than passive; stresses the learning of principles; exploits the advantages in newness: exploration of something new, a new practice, a principle learned in a new situation; requires the learner to set high but attainable standards of performance for himself; and is met, in sum, in guided discovery, problem-oriented instruction, or inquiry. Practical implications for college teaching are that (1) exposition and the transmission of fact be minimized, that lectures take the form of one-sided conferences in which the lecturer raises and analyzes problems and orders, augments, and examines  the facts acquired by the students through their own reading; (2) instructors not give direction to be followed in the laboratory but allow students to make the observations or do the experiments necessary to get the data required by the problem, that the laboratory be made experimental; (3) in group conferences the students discuss problems, identify the relevant facts and ideas, and fashion their own hypotheses or conclusions under faculty direction; and (4) examinations be used to help students discover how well they understand the subject under discussion and how well they use the methods required in reaching these understandings.

        "description":"A follow-up study was made of a 1966 summer retraining program designed to increase the range of teacher competencies in dealing with disadvantaged youth within the classroom and teacher understanding of the concerns of parents of disadvantaged youth as a major means of effecting educational change. The 4-week program involved about 150 teachers and supporting personnel in guidance, reading, and administration in a practicum in which four 2-member teams were assigned to each of 20 classes of 15-20 students. Each team planned units of work, observed other teams, taught, evaluated teaching, reviewed display materials and met with parents of children. The follow-up consisted of focused interviews in November 1966 and February 1967 with a representative sample of 72 participants.  Findings revealed that many if not all of the plans of the summer had been forgotten under the press of events and that few changes were carried over into the regular year by either teachers or nonclassroom personnel. The insularity of the school from the homes of disadvantaged youth was particularly noteworthy. Implications included these: School structure molds the outlook of school personnel with regard to teaching and learning and with regard to professional relationships--which are governed more by power of hierarchy than by focus on the teaching situation. Retraining should include the regular school program and involve all parties to be affected by proposed changes. (JS)",

        "description":"In developing a rationale for the reorganization of educational institutions, the author examines the fallacies inherent in current organizational practice and discusses the potential advantaged of differentiated staffing, particularly in terms of improved teacher morale, increased teacher effectiveness, and decreased teacher turnover. He presents and describes the Temple City Model (a plan based on a hierarchy of differentiated teaching responsibilities rather than on a hierarchy of learning) and stresses its adaptability to existing school systems. Among the areas of responsibility differentiated by the Temple City plan are instructional management, which features an advanced teacher as a learning engineer, curriculum construction, which adds to a teacher's responsibilities  emerging curricular theory and design by discipline structure; and advanced skills in the practical application of research for the improvement of instruction. Among the advantages the author sees in this type of differentiated staffing are the decentralization of decisionmaking, the creation of new and more autonomous teacher roles which produce organizational inequality and increased flexibility, and the establishment of new career patterns and incentives for teachers according to their individual talents and development.

He then presents and discusses the implications of seven hypotheses suggested by a preliminary analysis of the data (based on the seven categories of activity identified by the TCAP--i.e., management-nonlearning,  management-learning, presentation, recitation, discussion, logical thinking, and attention to the thinking process). The analysis includes specific suggestions as to the ways in which teaching roles can be more effectively assigned and training programs more appropriately designed. (JS)",

The classroom management characteristics of 36 teachers at Nova High School and two Nova elementary schools were studied through a systems analysis approach. The 36-teacher sample was a cross-section of classes ranging in teaching methods from quite conventional to very individualized approaches. An extensive observational instrument was developed to study the teachers' management behaviors and a companion instrument to study the student interaction and queueing  patterns. Additional data were collected with the Verbal Interaction Scale (Flanders), the Multidimensional Analysis of Classroom Interaction (Honigman), and through interviews with teachers and staff. Analysis focused primarily on the individualized classrooms with various comparisons being made. A report was also developed on considerations for a computer simulation of the role model to be developed in phase 2; also a prototype training unit was prepared (on external motivation management) so that an inservice training workshop could be implemented in phase 2 for testing. Data collected in phase 1 provides a good base on which the role model can be constructed. (SP 003 270 contains the appendixes.)

        "description":"Utilization of the systems approach to design of teacher education programs should result in greater program effectiveness through provision of frequent opportunity to practice application of knowledge in realistic situations. Development of an instructional system might include (1) development of a human factors systems analysis model, (2) development of job models, (3) specification of knowledges and skills required, (4) determination of instructional objectives, (5) construction of the training program, (6) development of a proficiency test, and (7) evaluation of the training program. Application of the approach to teacher education design would require analysis of the teacher's job in terms of such systems. Research literature on teacher effectiveness and the use of new  observational systems for studying teacher-pupil interactions can provide a base for the development of system-job models. The trend anticipated is toward greater involvement of the teacher in dealing with motivational and social influence processes in more complex interpersonal interactions with pupils. Curriculum development for teacher education must include the creation of instructional objectives relevant to these new roles, and curriculum design must provide practice integrated with theory from behavioral science and subject matter content. Such developments as minicourses, microteaching, interaction analysis, and situation simulation can facilitate the integration process. (JS)",

In the fall 1968, teachers were placed in four instructional groups on the basis of pretest assessments, with those in one group serving as a control group. At the end of the academic year 1968-69, attitude and achievement tests were administered to the approximately 300 elementary teachers and a random selection of their students along with a random selection of matched students of teachers from outside the program. Analysis of the  posttest data permits acceptance of the hypothesis that the IN-STEP approach is an effective and efficient method of conducting inservice training (at least in AAAS Science). Conclusions were based on gain in group mean scores due to the instructional program; generally favorable teacher attitudes; cost effectiveness comparison between IN-STEP approach and a traditional approach; indirect measure of proficiency of IN-STEP students; and moderately favorable indications of a difference in the attitudes toward science of IN-STEP and non-IN-STEP children.

The teacher becomes a questioner rather than a teller, encouraging rather than stopping the thinking process; a stage-setter making judgments about the types and varieties of experiences needed to challenge children to think as capably as their development allows; a scene-shifter making decisions about the auspicious time to change the children's source of experience. Each facet implies skillful diagnostic procedures grounded not only in maturation and development and personality theory but also in development of thinking in children. The focus in the teaching process changes from covering material to making discoveries.  Cues for content are given by the children with the sensitive teacher catching and using them. Emphasis on right and wrong answers must give way to choices, or alternatives, that can be tested by their consequences. The teacher must learn to plan with children so that they have opportunities to set their own goals for trying out. Such a discovery, trying-out process can help to stimulate creativity which the teacher fosters by treating school as a here-and-now process, not a period of preparation or waiting for. Such principles are difficult to apply because they require the teacher to be tolerant of ambiguity, of a certain amount of disorder, and of dissimilar products that cannot be compared to one another.

An evaluation program involved analysis of aides' and teachers' use of time in terms of specific instructional and non-instructional duties, analysis of  teacher aide questionnaires, and summary of teachers' and administrators' comments at the termination of the program. Conclusions were that college education majors are well qualified to fill teacher aide positions; that they gain valuable on-the-job experience as such; and that the working relationship between colleges of education and local school systems can serve to strengthen the education curriculum on the college level. (Included are recommendations based on the program; background information on Lincoln Parish; description of planning and administrative procedures; and complete results of the program evaluation including aide job descriptions and tables of duties and responsibilities.)

        "description":"The system-wide curriculum development and instructional improvement (ESEA Title III) project concerned itself in the first phase with mathematics; emphasis in the 18-month second phase will be in social studies. In spring 1968, committees were formed representing the primary, middle, junior high and high school levels, and college consultants and specialists were selected to assist them in preparation of inventories (for identification of basic problems in mathematics) and of attitude surveys and diagnostic tests (for use in preparing and conducting inservice classes). All committees followed the approach presented in a 3-day July workshop on Systems Analysis Application to Curriculum Development. Four inservice classes were held during the spring of 1969 with 145 teachers  participating; results of pre-and posttests indicated a gain in knowledge of mathematics processes and concepts at all levels. Students in grades 5-8 were pretested and will be posttested and compared to control groups. During the summer continuous progress flow charts are being developed for grades 1-8, curriculum materials reviewed and selected (or designed and developed), and curriculum guides prepared. Basically the same procedures are proposed for curriculum planning, inservice training, and materials and media development in the social studies field during the coming year.

        "description":"A project investigated a way in which early intervention into the lives of babies might break the poverty cycle. Major objectives were to find out whether the use of disadvantaged paraprofessional women as Parent Educators of indigent mothers of infants and young children enhanced the development of the children and increased the mother's competence and sense of self-worth. Parent Educators each assigned to a graduate student supervisor, received five weeks of intensive preservice training and one day of inservice training weekly. The major treatment variable was instruction of the mother by the Parent Educator in stimulation exercises once a week, in the home, on a regular basis. (Exercises consisted of a systematic series of perceptual-motor-auditory-tactile-kinesthetic inputs  based upon a review of the theory and research on cognitive and affective development in the earliest years.) At the end of the first year, children whose mothers had been involved in the project were superior to control children on both the Griffiths Mental Development Scales and on the series material designed as teaching materials for the project. At the end of the second year children whose mothers had been in the project from the beginning or whose mothers entered the program when their child was one year of age were superior on the series material to control children. The second objective was partially achieved. (Implications are discussed.) (JS)",

In the 1967-68 pilot test 18 teachers (eight experimental and 10 control) systematically varied several parameters of reinforcement in classroom situations to determine their effects on the attainment of specified behavioral objectives. Use of teacher's conventional verbal praise was compared to use of a point system in which accumulation of a specified total resulted in a tangible reward. Results were assessed subjectively and statistically: teachers successfully applied learning principles to the classroom situation; children's classroom behavior improved (as compared to teachers' previous classes and to the control classes which  took the same achievement tests); and motivation increased. Statistical results on the effects on cognitive and affective gain are not yet available for the larger 1968-69 field testing by 45 teachers in four states, but reactions continued to be positive. To use structured reinforcement the teacher should examine the entering behavior of his students; specify to himself the behavior he would like the class to demonstrate; specify to his class the behavior it is to exhibit; make a reward contingent upon its behavior; reward the desired behavior.

Bad translations, as exemplified in the condensation and simplification of masterpieces to attract a wider audience, destroy the integrity of the work of art, but good translations, such as Shakespeare's translation of Plautus in \"The Comedy of Errors,\" create an integrity of their own. Paraphrasing, reordering, and summarizing have some uses in classroom translation, but they are nonliterary methods of teaching literature and violate the integrity of the work. Juxtaposition--the placing of two works  side by side with as few preconceptions as possible about what the results will be--frequently gives insight into both works. Comparing imitations and parodies with the works that inspired them can also be enlightening. Other proven translation methods are comparing different plays on the same subject, comparing plays to films based on them, and comparing poems and paintings. (LH)",

Teachers who will strike for pay, better working conditions, and extra benefits will remain silent about racist textbooks. Supervisors instruct teachers to remain aloof and formal in all contact with the black community. Also responsible are the teachers' colleges and schools of education which fail to psychologically and intellectually prepare the majority of  teachers for the reality of ghetto schools. Many idealistic young people active in the Peace Corps, Civil Rights Movement, and Freedom Schools are not allowed to teach in inner city schools because they lack the required education courses.

Two analytic instruments were applied to 114 minority characters selected from 42 children's books about American Indians, Chinese, Japanese, Negroes, and Spanish Americans currently living in the United States. In this sampling, virtually no negative stereotypes of minority Americans were found; the differences in race, creed, and customs of minority citizens were found to be dignified far more than in either adult magazine fiction or textbooks; and similarities in behavior, attitudes, and values between majority and minority Americans were emphasized rather than their differences.  (Recommendations for action to be taken on the basis of the results, proposals for further experimental study, and a table ranking the verbal stereotypes of the 114 minority American characters are included.)

An instrument of 44 one-syllable simulated words and a measurement to ascertain consonant phoneme knowledge were used to study 90 second-grade pupils, approximately equal in general characteristics. The children were asked to recall a known word visually similar to an unknown word, except for an initial or final consonant, and to pronounce the unknown word by association with the known one. Significant relationships were found in the following cases: (1) between the student's abilities to recall a known word visually similar to the simulated word and to correctly identify the simulated word by means of single consonant  substitution, (2) between the abilities to substitute initial consonants and to substitute final consonants, and (3) between reading achievement and ability to employ consonant substitution to identify simulated words. It was concluded that second-grade children can effectively employ single consonant substitution to identify unknown one-syllable words. (LH)",

        "description":"To study the local newspaper reading habits of teenagers from six schools in Florida as compared with those of teenagers from six schools in other states, a four-page questionnaire was administered to a total of 887 students in English and journalism classes. Among reading categories listed on the questionnaire were domestic news items, world news, non-news content (feature articles, comics, editorials, syndicated columns) and advertisements. Tentative conclusions suggested that (1) teenagers read the daily newspaper almost as much as do adults, (2) the difference in newspaper reading habits between Florida and non-Florida students and between journalism and non-journalism students is insignificant, (3) there is little evidence that schools are stimulating students to become  discerning and discriminating users of newspapers, and (4) the recognition of the importance of mass media and the development of teachers better trained in media instruction are necessary.

A majority of the students felt that the hometown newspaper (1) provided the most detailed coverage and the highest number of local  news stories, (2) ranked next to television as the best all-around medium, (3) kept the public well-informed about state and local government, (4) did not present both sides of a story, (5) did not have the community's best interests at heart, (6) did not boost the spirits of its readers, and (7) was the most obnoxious news medium.

Two basic designs for operating the simulation exercise are presented with a discussion of the format alternatives, facilities, materials, and administrative techniques required for each design. The first design, a 1- or 2-day concentrated game, supplements regular classroom procedures; the second substitutes the PME format for normal classroom activity during a major portion of the course. The possible impact of the game on students, a student evaluation of the two methods, and recommendations for research into the effectiveness of the  PME as a teaching device are also discussed. Appendices provide examples of documents necessary for operating both designs of the PME; student newspaper accounts and a student history of the Middle Eastern exercises; a PME evaluation questionnaire for students; and a bibliography on games and simulation techniques, on international law, and on contemporary problems in international relations and national security.

High school students, their parents, working youth, young adults, and teachers were interviewed by Arab interviewers using an open-closed type of questionnaire. In addition, an analysis of the official curricula in history, literature, language, religious studies, and citizenship was carried out. Major findings were (1) that secondary education has not moderated the antagonistic  attitudes of Israeli Arabs toward Israel, though it has reduced their social distance from Jews, and (2) that among the factors contributing to the lack of educational success are official Israeli educational aims that prevent Arab participation and identification, and problems related to the role, recruitment, and status of teachers.

The Kyme Test of Aesthetic Judgments in Music was administered before and after  the 9 weeks of instruction. Analysis of Covariance was made of the data. Results indicated that (1) knowledge gained through the study of contemporary music was not transferred to music of the past, and (2) the 20th-century art music program had greatest success in inner-city \"deprived\" schools.

These supportive services are an Early Identification Program, Junior Guidance classes, Special Guidance classes, and Career Guidance classes. Assessment focused on implementation of the Board of Education's plan to augment special services in these programs, and on behavior, achievement, and attitudes of the students. Information about each of these special programs is reported separately. The conclusions and recommendations indicate that, even with augmented personnel, the services are inadequate for the demand, there is a scarcity of trained professionals, and also a lack of clarity about admission and organizational policies. The Junior Guidance and Special Guidance classes should have effective  overall supervision, and the Career Guidance Program needs clarification of basic goals, admission policies, and curriculum development.

After a week of intensive achievement-motivation training, nine experimental teachers and a research team cooperatively designed a program to develop in their students the realization that their behavior in relation to goal attainment is internal to, and controllable by, themselves. Four training units were designed and implemented in the classroom: 1) My Real Self; 2) Stories of Achievement; 3) The Spelling Game, and 4) The Origin-Manual. The training produced highly significant increases in: the use of achievement-words, need for achievement, verbal expressiveness, goal realism, and academic achievement.

Class size was reduced to 15 pupils for kindergarten and first grade, and to 20 for the second grade. The five special primary schools served a total of 2,336 children, 99 percent of whom were Negro, and one percent Puerto Rican. No systematic quantitative differences were found between performance in these schools and the several baseline comparison schools. However, the improved  qualitative benefits resulting from reduced class size suggest definite advantages potentially accruing to the facilities of the Special Primary Program.

The evaluation of the institute, described in this report, is based on extensive observations of the teacher-training workshop into districts in order to achieve an objective view of the program. The findings covered (1) the institute planning and structure, encompassing  supervision and support, coordination at district level, program planning, and the schedule of the institutes, (2) the staff, (3) the trainees, and (4) program implementation. That the institutes were not uniformly successful in achieving the program objectives is principally adduced to the incomplete decentralization process the program underwent during its operational period.

What degree of control do moonlighters have over competitive moonlighting? Arbitrators have sustained discharges and disciplinary actions by some employers, but upheld employee grievances in other cases.

Two separate courses were developed for each subject matter area. One reflected an inductive instructional approach and the other a deductive method. Each of the four courses was administered to between 55 and 60 Navy enlisted men, and 28 measures of aptitude, interest, and personality variables were obtained on each subject. The most significant finding was the significant second order interaction among all three independent variables. The results of this study strongly support the existence of learning  styles and suggests that multi-track instruction based on learning styles might be a cost-effective way of enhancing learning. In the supplementary report preliminary plans were formulated for a study to demonstrate that significant effectiveness gains can be achieved through designing training and to match specific learner characteristics.

Questionnaires were used to survey the 78 commercial research or testing laboratories, 21 telephone companies, 59 commercial broadcasting stations, and 15 manufacturers of electronic equipment who did not maintain testing laboratories, while questionnaires and personal interviews were used to gather data from the 19 junior colleges who participated. A chi-square test of significance of independence of  two variables was applied to each of the instructional units listed in the questionnaire. Conclusions were: (1) School and industrial representatives were not in total agreement as to the teaching emphasis, (2) They closely agreed on the future importance of the units and types of equipment a technician should be able to operate well, and (3) Junior colleges have not been a principal supplier of electronic technicians.

It is recommended that the Academy  develop guidelines for the training of: (1) pediatric nurse associates--colleague practitioners for sharing in the personal care of patients, (2) pediatric office assistants--persons who would carry out the delegated tasks involving skills in which they have been trained and are certified, and (3) pediatric aides--persons having little or no formal training who, under supervision, would carry out defined routine tasks of a nonskilled nature.

Occupations are classified at the major group level, minor group level, and unit level. The basic principle of classification is the type of work performed and represents broad fields of work rather than specific types of work. The minor groups and unit groups provide summary classifications suitable for organization and presentation of statistical data, such as those derived from manpower inquiries and population censuses.  The more detailed classification, which has been developed by the International Labour Office, subdivides the unit groups into occupations or occupational categories bearing five-digit code numbers and is intended to serve such purposes as the organization of employment placement office records.

An academic core of English, citizenship, and mathematics was blended with classes in one of the following areas: (1) business education and office skills, (2) home economics and food trades, (3) prevocational-industrial education, and (4) distributive education. Depending on their age, interests, and aptitudes, students also worked in private employment or some unit of the school system related to the occupational courses they were studying. In addition, each student attended weekly group counseling sessions and individual sessions as needed. There were no dropouts from the  experimental group, compared to a 25 percent rate in the control group. While academic growth was limited, there was significant growth of employer satisfaction with gains in the areas of motivation and attitudes toward self, peers, and society. School attendance and in-school behavior improved. Implications for educating other youths with special needs are suggested. (JK)",

        "description":"A 40-item selective bibliography organized under the headings of The Need for Programs, Descriptions of Programs, The Development and Operation of Programs, Reports of Evaluations of Programs, and Information Sources was developed to assist school districts in planning and implementing exemplary programs of work experience for broadening and improving occupational offerings. The review and analysis summarizes the major strengths of cooperative work-study programs as: (1) a favorable cost-benefit ratio, (2) flexibility of scheduling and operation, (3) a broadening of occupational offerings, (4) job-oriented training programs, (5) reduction of unemployment of those completing programs, (6) development of a work reputation in students, (7) improvement in student motivation, and (8)  improvement in school-industry cooperation. Some factors limiting program success include: (1) relative improvement of work attitudes and behavior, (2) lack of congruence of jobs with student interests and aptitudes, (3) little employer concern for student educational development, (4) discrimination by employers, and (5) a lack of awareness of the purposes and objectives of the program. Ordering information is provided for each document cited. (Author)",

Finally, three seminars were held for businessmen, educators, and other community leaders in Knoxville, Denver and New York City to test the seminar as a method of disseminating the material compiled by the study and to stimulate interest in further cooperative efforts. It is believed that the experience gained in the three trial seminars has provided a set of guidelines that could be helpful to others who might wish to hold such a seminar in other communities.

The subject areas for each seminar were drawn from what was considered to be the most pressing issues in early childhood education research. There were (1) motivation, (2) the teacher and classroom management, (3) Head Start populations, (4) health and nutrition in early childhood, (5) intervention in family life, and (6) the teacher in intervention programs. The people who participated in and prepared papers for these seminars were selected by members of the Head Start Advisory Council and other eminent professionals, and were considered to be &quot;expert authorities&quot; in the individual subject areas. The emphasis of the seminars was, as evidenced  by the subject areas settled on, improvement of educational opportunity for the disadvantaged child. The seminar on motivation, for example, stressed such poverty problems as learned helplessness, cooperation, and delay of gratification. The papers in this volume represent the final drafts after they had been exposed to careful criticisms and suggestions by those who heard them. A brief summary of the thrust of the seminars is included in the introduction. Seminar 1 on motivation is available as ED 024 464.

An analysis is made of the extent to which Negro and Puerto Rican student populations are isolated in the New York schools. Selected studies were examined to define differences in educational, intellectual and psychological development associated with ethnic group membership. A critical examination was made of the contributions of school and non-school factors to educational development in majority and minority student populations. Integration techniques initiated in urban areas where de facto segregation was in existence were evaluated. Compensatory education programs from preschool through the college level  were assessed for effectiveness in affecting the educational development of disadvantaged children. Findings of this report suggest new guidelines for school desegregation, as well as other ways in which conditions might be manipulated to enhance the chances that all disadvantaged children may experience improved and equal educational opportunity.

The teachers' guide describes the pictures, clothing, and artifacts the box contains and provides detailed instructions for use of its films, records, games, and stories. The full unit requires two weeks of daily classes and can be divided into four sections: descriptive introduction--village life and environment; material culture--clothing, nokake, arrow-making, and trapping; spirit help--trapping, Petabenu's spirit helper, and the Benevolent Trout; and social life--in the wigwam of Petabenu and Petabenu's brothers.

It is the story of a small wooden canoe carved by a Canadian Indian Boy and launched by him on its way to the Atlantic Ocean. In tracing Paddle's journey the children see films and filmstrips, make collages and large geographical models, and handle Indian implements, fishing and mining tools, and samples of mine ores. While doing this they learn about the waterways of  Northeastern America, and about the cities, industries and ethnic groups which live on or near them. The economics of bartering are realized through role-playing Chippewa, Huron, and French transactions. The children have an opportunity to discuss dreams and Indians, logging camps and belief systems, and, at the end of the unit, are given the opportunity to make their own &quot;voyageur&quot; and launch it on its way to the sea.

In order to role-play assigned family members the children learn about the family structure, religion, ancestor worship, the changing economic structure, household furnishings, and  some contemporary Japanese history.

Improvement was recommended in the following areas: data collection, record keeping, job assignment, and cost accounting. (author/nl)",

        "description":"This study evaluated the effectiveness of a teacher education program for mature women cooperatively planned and conducted by Sarah Lawrence College and New York University. Program goals as identified by the two institutions, participating students, and society served as criterion measures. Necessary data were collected by interview, questionnaire, examination of records, and observation. The program was a model for a number of teacher education programs in other institutions, and produced a small group of teachers rated as superior by their instructors and employers. It reached a previously untapped supply of highly qualified potential teachers. Participants rated the program as valuable and appropriate for mature women with reduced child rearing and homemaking demands.  Although innovative in various ways (mainly by its course in the analytical study of teaching), it did not completely fulfill the original aim of radical experimentation. The underlying philosophy proved a worthwhile means of developing superior elementary school teachers, and recommendations for continuation and expansion were made. (author/ly)",

They would next create an information and guidance section, then would invite colleges and other community organizations to cooperate with them in offering opportunities for liberal education, public affairs and community education, professional and vocational studies, recreational and nature education, and upgrading of secondary schooling. Information retrieval by telephone,  a residential center, provincial coordination of administrative functions, varied audiovisual resources, and oncampus day and evening lecture classes would be among the features and services of the Centre.

The survey revealed a generally negative attitude toward vocational school efforts in imparting training in specific company jobs because vocational school education is seen as being too generalized, rather than offering adequate preparation in particular skills. It is suggested that there should be a separation of function of vocational school and company training, with the responsibility for training and practice opportunities being left to the company's on the job training, and the vocational school providing the general know-how  common to most skilled work. It is also suggested that vocational school should accompany, rather than precede, employment in a firm offering on the job training.

Questionnaire interviews were held with two managers and four trainees from one chain, and with two managers and two trainees from the other. Ten hypotheses concerning the acceptance and the realization of certain objectives were tested. These were among the conclusions reached: (1) although, as indicated by managers, training programs stressed the need for a broad view of the company and better understanding of human relations and interaction, trainees felt that such objectives were not being realized, at least initially; (2) managers and trainees need a closer interrelationship to achieve  overall program objectives; (3) as far as the managers are concerned, the programs have met most of their objectives; (4) programs have given trainees a knowledge of organizational functions, helped them toward better decision making, apparently have given them self-confidence for advancing to positions of increased responsibility, and seemingly have enabled trainees to adapt their thinking to new environmental situations.

Data were gathered by questionnaire (about a 50% response) on community size, residence, age, sex, educational level, occupations, group size, and number of communities represented in each group. Members (52.5% men and 47.5% women) were largely farmers, housewives, or professionals, aged 25-65, high school graduates or beyond, and residents of population centers and of urban or transitional counties. Single community representation was dominant (60%), especially  in rural areas (63%). Most groups were relatively heterogeneous, but on a consistent basis. Those with eight to eleven members more often stayed the same size than larger or smaller groups. Ages under 35, postgraduate education, and professional, technical, or related employment were related to group survival; ages 36-55 were positively related. Farm residence negatively affected attitudes toward community economic growth. Education, residence, and occupation affected perceived dependence on the future of one's community. (ly)",

The Project described here, carried out in English classes in Gothenburg, Sweden, attempted to test this hypothesis and to find out whether the same method would work equally well at different age and intelligence levels. Three methods were used: one &quot;Implicit,&quot; in which the pupils practiced the &quot;do&quot; verb construction in oral and written drills without explanations or theoretical comment; and two &quot;Explicit,&quot; one in which explanations are given in English, and one in  which explanations were given in Swedish. Apart from the explanations, the lessons in all three groups were identical. Pupils were also grouped according to IQ; in the low intelligence groups, the &quot;Implicit&quot; method was considered the &quot;best.&quot; Among the more intelligent pupils, no significant differences were found. It was felt, however, that if explanations were given, they should be in Swedish. Also, one reason for the low &quot;Explicit&quot; scores may be that explanations were of a transformational kind.

A basic assumption underlying the study was that teaching materials have a direct influence on learning and that some root causes of inefficiency in the teaching-learning process could be identified by rigorous and detailed analysis of the teaching materials. The most basic guideline of the study was intelligibility by those involved in teaching English and training teachers in Japan. The set of teaching materials examined was the  three-volume junior high school English language textbook &quot;New Horizon.&quot; The first part of the study concentrated mainly on the overall plan for the selection, sequencing and textual presentation of a set of teaching points. Pattern analysis was made on the basis of the verb &quot;be&quot; and four sentence patterns. The utterances were examined in terms of their grammatical usage and distribution, and verb structures. This method of analysis was then applied to another set of materials and the results were compared. The second project analyzed the structural content of the practice exercises in the first set of materials. (AMM)",

        "description":"In most languages encountered by linguists, the numerals, considered as a paradigmatic set, constitute a morpho-syntactic problem of only moderate complexity. The Indo-Aryan language family of North India, however, presents a curious contrast. The relatively regular numeral system of Sanskrit, as it has developed historically into the modern languages of this group, has undergone striking phonological alteration. Morphemes which had relatively uniform shapes and clear boundaries in the parent language have become fused and difficult to identify. The result is that anyone who learns to count in one of these languages must make a greater learning effort than is usually required for the counting process. The present paper raises some questions concerning these numeral systems, with  specific reference to Hindi. Is memorization the only factor involved in the learning and production of the paradigm up to 100? If so, should a grammar simply list these hundred forms with no attempt to state general rules governing their phonological shapes? Or, are the Indo-Aryan numerals in fact governed by rules which are used by the native speaker and may be stated by the linguist? In exploring these questions, a complete set of numerals and a morphological analysis of their paradigm are presented and discussed.

It is instructive to consider how this problem is dealt with in modern foreign language teaching, English being a case in point. It is &quot;inconceivable&quot; to teach English without specific reference to the spoken forms actually used either in the United States or in the United Kingdom. The dialect form chosen should be an educated form of speech and have &quot;significant applicability.&quot; The foreign learner should find Cultivated Cairene Arabic an especially useful dialect with which to start learning  Arabic. It provides a relatively smooth transition from the spoken to the literary language, particularly as used by mass media writers. It is the form of language spoken by a socially acceptable group representative of modern Arab culture as a whole. (Any other cultivated dialect of the important Arab Centers, however, may also accomplish the goals of teaching beginning Arabic.) The major categories of Arabic are defined as (1) Classical or Koranic, (2) Literary or Contemporary Literary, and (3) Colloquial or Spoken.

The Foreign Language Institute, a separate department within the University, plays an important role in training the students. Language teaching differs with each major field. Students of foreign trade, communications, and international relations must attend classes in two foreign languages for four years: Russian, and one Western European language. There are no beginning language courses for the  students--they must demonstrate their competence before admission to the University. Thus the instructors need not teach fundamentals and can concentrate on helping the students attain near-native command of the foreign language. Separate programs--oral-aural exercises, compositions, readings, and language laboratory material--have been developed by the Institute for each major and each language. Materials used in teaching English, criteria for proficiency in two languages, specialized vocabulary materials, the language laboratory, and the Institute staff are briefly described. (AMM)",

She points out that school personnel of many districts which she has observed purport to have ESL programs but actually are unaware that the teaching of ESL requires special training. Inservice training is only one aspect of a teacher-training program; preservice course work should be part of the college curriculum of every undergraduate with plans to teach children who do not speak English or a standard dialect of English. Not all teachers are suited for ESL, but all should have a foundation in language in order to reinforce the work of the specialist. To teach ESL efficiently and effectively requires an understanding  of (1) the English language, (2) how to teach it, and (3) the pupil learning it. It also requires understanding how language learning is different from learning a skill such as addition or subtraction. Problems concerning the practical application of bilingual education, the difference between English as a second language and English as language arts for the reading teacher, and setting up an ESL program in a community are also highlighted.

The 1960 census for Texas revealed the Mexican-Americans to have the highest dropout rate and the fewest number of persons 14 or over completing school. Nearly one fourth of the Mexican-Americans in Texas 25  years old or over had not completed one year of education; close to 40 percent of the adults were functional illiterates (fourth grade completed or less). Mexican-American student demands in Los Angeles are similar to those voiced in Chicago and San Antonio. The author balances his description of some of the difficulties met with by educators and students with mention of some instances of progress. A listing of hearings and conference reports is appended. (AMM)",

        "description":"This paper describes the conceptual framework of a research methodology developed by the Region II Rehabilitation Research Institute, designed to permit the study of an important set of problems confronting sheltered workshops. The main problem is centered in the issues of work as work and of work as mode of behavior change. It has become apparent in the operation of sheltered workshops that there were at least two subsystems of activity which could be abstracted from the concrete systems of behavior in any workshop. These are the production subsystems, similar to industry, and the rehabilitation subsystem which is new. The orientation of the rehabilitation subsystem is to rehabilitate through channeling and controlling behavior. The paper discusses basic concepts and variables  of work behavior such as behavior potential, behavioral activity, and technology. Research is reviewed and research applications are discussed. These applications include possibilities for improved selective placement of clients. After more research, industrial therapy of the type available in sheltered workshops may prove to be the most effective and least costly of the therapeutic techniques used to prepare individuals for reintegration into the fabric of modern industrial life.

        "description":"An enlargement of the understanding of the career for the individual is necessary in order to put the imperative need of work for everyone more into perspective. First, secondary education in 1980 needs to be taken, not as a high school education but rather as an educational process reserved for those in need of an interdependent, not completely independent, learning experience in order to progress in the expansion of their intelligence and career according to their own purposes. It is proposed that this secondary education take place in a Learning Resource Center (LRC) with the basic instructional aid being an Educational Machine. Counselors at the LRC would help the individual to convert his learning into real life experiences. The education machine would provide the series of\"dress rehearsals\" which a person needs in career in order to achieve realization of self processes in the choice processes of career. The ultimate goal for this program includes the integration of community resources for the common good, individualization of instruction, and education for individuality (including therapy or education for the mentally ill) leading to the fostering of identification, the fundament of identity.

        "description":"Assimilation through acculturation is a central aim of education within all societies. If the society is over-assimilated, and if education fails to preserve individual creative powers, it will perish. The school, the institutionalized educational process, is assigned two central tasks: (1) the assimilation by acculturation of the neophytes within the society, and (2) the preservation of the autonomy of the individual in a mode reflective of the ideal of individualism. Two forms of alienation can thus occur: (1) alienation resulting from the failure of assimilation or sociological alienation, and (2) alienation resulting from the loss of an individual's autonomy or psychological alienation. Sociological alienation may be found in immigrants, the American Indians, the American  Negroes, the poor, and possibly those physically or emotionally handicapped; artists, and intellectuals. Sociological and psychological alienation cannot always be separated. Among those who might be psychologically alienated is the worker, due to possible fragmentation of self and a search for stability. For some of the psychologically alienated, the schools attempt special programs to work with these maladjustments. (KJ)",

Included in this last point are the congruence of supervision in practice now and the ideal, and the articulation between supervision in counseling preparation and on-the-job counseling. While much has been written on supervision, there is little agreement on function and technique. Various research studies are cited. Instruments were developed by a Committee on Counselor Effectiveness and sent to 2,000 members of the Association of Counselor Education  and Supervision. Of the 2,000 sent, 613 were returned. After analyzing the data, six recommendations were presented, including: (1) the qualifications of supervision competencies be made more explicit, and (2) that supervisors be required to have training in supervision.

        "description":"Most counselor trainees do not know how to help clients elaborate their own unique meanings in life. To provide experiences to overcome this, the author has attempted to do the following in the practicum: (1) provide a simulated client experience for the trainee by having each individual in the group react to an emotional simulation sequence and then to explore his feelings to this stimulus; and (2) help the members of the practicum group explore the feelings of other group members in a constructive way, so that each \"plays\" counselor for the other. The model used involves the use of video play-back. One person in the group at a time per film reacts to the sequence and the group members and the instructor explore the reactions that the individuals experience. Following the  sequence the video which shows the person viewing the simulation film and the sound of the film is played back. The process of discussion is also filmed and can be replayed. The effects of this procedure are: (1) the T.V. gives a visual playback, and (2) the group process is captured and can be played back. The major assumption of this method is that the way a person feels in anxiety producing situations is a measure of the effectiveness that a person will have in a counseling situation. (Author/KJ)",

The questions to be answered were: (1) in what order of frequency do counselors report their major role activities and, (2) do counselors of differing educational, experiential, and situational backgrounds report performing their roles differently. A total of 356 counselors were mailed an informational questionnaire and the School Counselor Performance Index (SCPI), which is included in this report. The results included: (1) counselors highest priority was working with individual students, and (2) counselors second priority was establishing and maintaining staff  relationships. Due to major changes in the SCPI, however, the data is not conclusive. Nevertheless, there are promising signs that the SCPI used in this study can quantitatively help to differentiate among and between subgroups of persons trained as counselors. This may help counseling students to understand the various functions they need to perform. (Author/KJ)",

Although these individuals who are usually poor, culturally deprived and have grossly disordered life styles are unsuitable candidates for traditional therapy, they demonstrate a high need for assistance in changing their circumstances. The current procedure of determining the eligibility of persons for rehabilitation entails the substantiation of a medically demonstrable disability that constitutes a handicap to employment often prevents the behaviorally disordered from obtaining needed help. It is suggested that  the definition of disability be broadened to include those handicapped in translating their potential into fulfilling economic and social roles because of developmental deficits. A number of innovative programs have been initiated by governmental agencies which suggest more effective ways of working with this population. Non-professional personnel have been used to meet manpower shortages in vocational rehabilitation, and the outreach concept, whereby professional personnel are out-stationed in poverty areas, has been implemented.

Contrary to initial expectations, it was found that the association between neighborhood and school socio-economic contexts and college entrance tended to disappear when controlled on indices of ability and aspiration. In other words, these data indicate that with equal manifest ability and aspiration indications, rates of college entry tend to be more or less equal among those from differing socio-economic contexts. However, these data  also indicate that differing socio-economic contexts are associated with differing distributions on ability manifestations and college aspirations, which in turn is associated with differing rates of college entry.

To meet the needs of prospective vocational education students, a guidance system must help them in educational and vocational planning; interest them in the exploration of training opportunities, and motivate them to seek information and pursue enrollment at the appropriate institutions. Since there are many negative attitudes (parents' and students') toward vocational education, it is recommended that parents become involved in the processes which are part of a vocational guidance system. Twelve possible components of a comprehensive vocational guidance system are outlined. It is stressed that in order to be comprehensive the system must complement the other activities of the  educational program so that the total program attempts to meet all the needs of all the students. Examples which illustrate how the findings of Project TALENT can contribute to the improvement and development of a guidance system are also included. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This study was designed to determine if the Cooperative School and College Ability Test (SCAT) can predict future college academic success of Negro college students with the same degree of accuracy as it does for white college students and to discover if the sex factor need be considered in making predictions. The sample consisted of 180 Negroes matched with whites on the basis of sex, college, and year in school. A correlation coefficient was computed between the SCAT total score and cumulative grade point average (GPA) and between the high school rank and GPA. The Negro means were significantly lower than the white means for each variable except high school rank. In the Negro female group coefficients were generated that are normally expected with college GPA. No correlation  was evidenced in the Negro male group. It is hypothesized that sex is an important consideration when making academic predictions for college students. It is concluded that the SCAT Total does exhibit \"cultural bias\" and that it is inappropriate to make academic decisions concerning the Negro male student on the basis of his SCAT Total score.

Subjects were 10 Head Start children, 10 culturally advantaged children, and the mothers of both groups. Communications were assessed according to the interpersonal dimensions of status, affection, and involvement. In general, Head Start mothers provided less social reinforcement for their children's activities, and many of their involvements were highly authoritative interventions. Head Start children took and solicited leadership more often, and they displayed both more hostility and more warmth than the advantaged group. Thus, Head Start mother-child dyads had  fewer affection-based interactions and more status-based interactions. There were equal amounts of conversational interchange in the two groups. Significant differences between the two samples were found in the frequencies with which certain communication patterns occurred, and the contexts in which they occurred. However, when the same patterns did occur, the consequences were likely to be the same for both population samples. (DR)",

Subjects were four girls and three boys, 4 years of age, all from middle class urban families. The classroom's free play space was divided into four equal areas. Toys were divided into four groups: art materials, blocks, dramatic toys, and manipulative toys and books. Each day the toy groups were randomly assigned to the four areas, with each free play session being videotaped simultaneously from two directions. Observer recordings of each child's movements and the toys he used were summarized, coded, and analyzed. Significant differences were found in the time spent by children in specific physical locations. These  differences were related to the nature of the area and the proximity of the play materials to the teacher. Children tended to choose play materials that could be moved to another area of the room. Differences in the nature of independent and group play were related to materials and location. (DR)",

Subjects were 60 Detroit 5-year-olds, half of whom were disadvantaged. Sex and race were also controlled in the sample. Results showed few, if any, nutritional deficiencies. Negro children appeared slightly taller and heavier as a group when compared to the norms of Caucasian children measured over 3 decades ago. With the exception of a marked positive correlation between height and psychological  performance test scores in boys, no relationship between physical measures and intelligence test scores was found. It was felt that if a nutritional deficiency existed in the children, it was at a level that permitted physiological adaptation by the child so that growth was not appreciably affected. Re-examination of the data is suggested, since results imply that other factors exert a more profound influence on mental development in the children studied than do nutritional and physical growth variables, per se.

In a unique approach to effective planning and development activities, practically all of Georgia's local governments pooled financial and technical resources to examine the region closely in terms of significant conditions, trends of the time, and outstanding problems and potentials. It was found , for example, that the most far-reaching population trend in the mountains area was its continuing loss of young people, who tended to leave home in search of better economic and social opportunities.  Problems also existed in upgrading educational levels for future generations, and emphasis was placed on providing adult education and technical vocational training.

Some 228 Mexican American children aged from 4 to 8 years, enrolled in special summer migrant classes, were given the (1) Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), (2) Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT), and (3) Sequin Form Board (SFB) from the Arthur Point Scale. The purpose was to identify performance levels in specific learning skills (vocabulary, reading, arithmetic, spelling, and motor performance), to establish whether those levels were low, and to suggest implications for future educational programs. The classes were located in Hollandale, Hector, and Moorhead, Minnesota and in Casselton, North Dakota. The results  indicated (1) below average scores on the PPVT and WRAT, (2) average scores on the SFB, (3) no significant sex differences, and (4) differences in age which correlated with the time the youngsters were taken out of a Spanish-speaking environment and placed in an English-speaking, structured, educational environment. Performance deficiencies were due primarily to a lack of English language skills. (BD)",

In planning the curriculum, it was recommended that there be a flexible educational program which would allow a wide array of possible emphases but which would center on a resources-oriented base with emphasis on management, administration, and maintenance. Recommendations for administrative consideration included establishment of (1) an interdisciplinary academic unit to house the outdoor recreation management program, (2) an advisory council to give direction to the program, and (3) services to meet the needs of the students. Two curricula were  suggested: a technical curriculum designed to educate associate professionals for employment and a transfer curriculum designed to provide the first 2 years of a B. A. degree program in recreation studies. Philosophies, objectives, descriptions, structures, components, outlines, and course descriptions of both curricula were formulated. Lists of needed physical facilities, instructional aids, and equipment were developed. References and a summary of potential texts are included.

These towns are both affected by the migration of Alaskan natives from smaller to larger villages because of better wages, opportunities for more social interaction, and availability of amenities such as the medical and educational services in the larger villages. It is concluded that Barrow, while it is a boom-bust town economically, has enough social services and job opportunities to attract large numbers of migrants; however, neither the job opportunities nor the services are sufficient to meet the needs of the growing population. The problems of Kotzebue are reportedly more severe than those found in Barrow. The in-migration is of such  magnitude that housing and sources of employment are quite inadequate, and the swelling of population is a strain on the economy. (DB)",

Natives of the county, characterized by traditional patterns of behavior, and in-migrants, characterized by rational patterns, were compared regarding educational values and attitudes. The basic hypothesis of this study was that the in-migrants carried with them different educational values and norms from those of the older, established population. Attitude and participation scales and a 2-part schedule were used in data collection. Systematically, each of the hypotheses for samples of both the total population and parents of school pupils was tested statistically. The basic hypothesis that the in-migrants carried into the county different educational values and norms was  partially upheld. Evidence indicated that migration is a factor in the differences only at the lower socioeconomic levels. A sub-hypothesis that a conflict of values resulted and that in-migrants have sought to implement their values through greater participation in school affairs was also partially upheld. The document contains tables on factors such as demography, age, sex, education, income, and residence. (SW)",

The sample studied consisted of 93 high school juniors and seniors (16, 17, and 18 years of age), or about 44% of all persons in those age groups in the county. Data collected by a questionnaire suggested that most students expected to leave the county. The largest group who expected to remain were from farm families and planned to farm; however, they were faced with the problem of decreasing number of farms and increasing cost of land and necessary farm  equipment. The majority of students who desired further education and occupational mobility were planning to leave the county. The crucial point in the students' responses seemed to be the lack of occupational opportunity they perceived in Sedgwick County. Due to a positive evaluation toward the county in general by these students, it would seem that emigration of the students might well be reduced if their perception of job opportunities, or the opportunities themselves, could be changed.

Analysis of the questionnaire indicated that level-of-living was the main factor influencing educational plans for both students and their parents. The Hieronymus Scale indicated that girls, non-members of rural youth organizations, and students from the 2  upper level-of-living groups value education more highly than do boys, members of youth organizations, and students from the low level-of-living group.

It was noted that a student's success in obtaining meaning depends on (1) his competency in determining word meaning, (2) his understanding of word function and phrase-structure relationships, (3) his set awareness, (4) his mastery of reading skills, and (5) his teacher's attitude and competency. It was contended, after considering the factor-statistical analysis and the logical analysis approaches to determining reading comprehension skills, that a lack of consensus results necessitates the use of the simplified eclectic approach. Literal comprehension would include  recalling fact and detail and determining the main idea of a passage; nonliteral comprehension would involve making decisions and judgments based on reading and relating reading experience to previously acquired knowledge and to other content. Determining cause and effect, making inferences, evaluating and criticizing, and determining authors' intents were given as nonliteral comprehension activities. Sample literal and nonliteral questions used in teaching and references are included. (BT)",

The latter group was further divided into those in private kindergartens and those in public school. CSS is a simplified and accelerated readiness and beginning reading program designed to take the child from reading readiness to the 2.7 grade level. Four hundred and five kindergarten pupils took part in the study for which the major hypothesis stated that the introduction of a formalized and highly structured individualized  reading readiness and beginning reading program on the kindergarten level would be more effective in developing basic prereading and early reading skills than a less formal routine kindergarten program for all groups tested at all ability levels. Control and experimental groups were used, with both receiving pretests and post-tests. The hypothesis proved to be valid for all groups tested.

The group examined scientific papers and worked to analyze the dimensions and directions of existing programs in the field. Attention was paid primarily to the problems manifested by those individuals who, in spite of apparently adequate intelligence and emotional stability, exhibit difficulties in learning to read within a teaching program that proves effective for most children. Fifteen percent of the total school population today are considered members of this group. The committee decided that they could not arrive at a definition of dyslexia which would receive general  acceptance, so they addressed themselves to the general problem of reading disorders. The group reviewed the magnitude and impact of this problem, the nature of the disorders, and remedial programs and procedures which now exist. They also proposed certain steps toward the development of a national program whose ultimate objective would be to assure that every child in this country who has the ability will learn to read.

This author has taken some steps toward identifying and understanding the emotional concomitants of reading. He investigated the perceptions of emotional concomitants which exist among a sizable and geographically diversified group of subjects presumed to be sensitive to phenomena of human development and learning, and/or verbal behavior. The subjects were 414 men and women enrolled in 11 colleges and universities in nine states. A constructed checklist asked each subject to indicate as \"never,\"\"rarely,\"\"sometimes,\" or \"often\" his perception of the commonness of occurrence of certain emotional responses during reading. The checklist was divided into four sections: subjective  experiences of emotion, involuntary physiological responses, overt action, and incentive reduction. It was concluded that the subjects did perceive a variety of emotional responses occurring in relation to their reading and that their perceptions differed according to sex, age, and major field of study. It was suggested that the checklist be further refined. Tables and references are included. (NH)",

The Metropolitan Achievement Test was administered to the children in September and April of 2 school years, 1965-1966 and 1966-1967. The schools involved were divided into six analysis subsets according to racial and economic composition. Statistics on reading achievement showed a gap of up to 2.7 years between ghetto schools and relatively rich schools between the second and sixth grades. For word knowledge there was a 2.8-year gap by the end of the sixth grade for the same type schools. The statistics showed that half or more of the differentials in reading and word knowledge achievement were  associated with the months the children were out of school.

The initial program was designed to improve mathematics instruction through the use of a non-graded multi-media approach utilizing laboratory team teaching. Achievement test summaries indicate that K-5 students instructed in mathematics through this program have achieved at or above grade level on standardized tests. The author concluded that the students became truly involved with this approach to learning mathematics, but the teacher had to have assistance in the lab, time for planning and inservice training, and a sincere commitment with the program.

The study was also concerned with determining whether or not curriculum-related materials can be developed to make the electronic calculator a valuable tool for students, and if there are applications which will assist in the teaching of areas related to mathematics. The experimental and control groups were selected from students at two New York state high schools. Mathematics achievement was based on the results of the pretest and posttest scores of the Sequential Tests of Educational Progress (STEP). When a new unit of instruction was begun the students in the experimental  section were taken to a lab where they used electronic calculators to solve problems related to classroom work and homework assignments. There was no significant difference between the two groups on the STEP pretest. On the posttest, a t-test indicated a significant difference between experimental and control groups at the .01 level. The authors conclude that the results of the experiment indicate that the use of the electronic calculator can facilitate mathematics instruction in 11th and 12th grade classes.

An attempt was made to evaluate the curriculum which was developed by comparing gains from pretest to posttest in several measures of mathematical knowledge and understanding for classes that had been trained for twenty minutes per day with the new curriculum versus classes which received no training. Tasks presented to the children in the experimental groups related to number and counting, geometry, dimension, prearithmetic operations, and symbols. The Geometric Design, Arithmetic, and  Block Design subtests of the WPPSI; an experimental form of the Head Start Arithmetic Test; and two Piagetian conservation tasks were administered to the children in three experimental classes and two comparison classes. Using an analysis of covariance, results on the Geometric Design (p=.001) and Block Design (p=.05) subtests were found to be significantly in favor of the experimental group when the total experimental group was compared to the total comparison group. The amount of change between pre- and posttesting with the Head Start Arithmetic Test was found to be significantly greater (p=.02) for the experimental than for the comparison group. (FL)",

Two teaching strategies identified by factor analysis were Inductive-Indirect Teaching and Lecture Method. Eighteen other factors were included in path analyses used to postulate and test the fit of models for the causal effect of the other factors on the two teaching strategies. Factors identified as causally related to teaching strategies were Instructional Load, Educational Level (of students), Teacher Morale, Academic Preparation of Teacher, School Size, Student Attitude, Budget, and Age of Curriculum.  Educational level of students had a negative effect on both strategies, suggesting that teachers in the upper grades provide students with more written materials so that the amount of teacher talk is not necessarily a valid indicator of the degree to which a teacher uses an inductive-indirect strategy. Teacher Morale had a positive effect on inductive-indirect strategy and a negative effect on Lecture Method. (EB)",

The teacher-leader would serve as a peer-staff member who is of immediate continuing support to fellow teachers. In conjunction with the introduction of a teacher-leader into the schools used in the study, a survey was taken of the expectations for the teacher-leader role as held by various professionals involved in this project. These included four groupings: pilot school teachers, teacher-leader trainees, science consultants, and  program coordinators. A questionnaire, which briefly described 15 probable tasks for the teacher-leader role, was administered to representative samplings of the five groups involved. The respondents were asked to rank the 15 tasks from most important to least important in the teacher-leader role. Findings show clearly that the four respondent groups hold differing judgments as to the relative importance of proposed teacher-leader tasks. (BR)",

Pupils in one of the groups were given, individually, a two-lesson instructional sequence using the audio-tutorial mode. Pupils in a second group were given the same two-lesson sequence in the teacher-directed, group mode. Pupils in the third group were given the first lesson of the sequence individually, in the audio-tutorial mode, and the second lesson as a teacher-directed group. Lessons were adapted from the SCIS Interaction unit. Data from this study show that: (1) Pupils instructed in the individual, audio-tutorial mode were distracted overtly for a small proportion of instructional time than pupils who were instructed in the teacher-directed  group mode: (2) Pupils who were instructed by a combination of the modes defined interaction on the posttest more frequently than pupils who were taught by either mode alone; (3) Pupils who were instructed individually were better able to generalize across several exemplars of interaction than pupils who received instruction in groups; (4) Pupils who received part or all of their instruction from a teacher identified interacting diads more frequently than pupils who receive instruction individually.

Inconsistency probably has a greater impact on the student when he first enters school, turning a significant percentage of students away from the process of schooling. Teachers have been observed to communicate consciously their expectations and then when making spontaneous decisions &quot;under fire&quot; to reveal contradictory expectations. Observations in a first grade  classroom over a 3-week period produced several anecdotes to illustrate such inconsistency. The concept might be further examined in terms of a teacher's inappropriate or appropriate diagnosis of a situation and his subsequent dealing logically or illogically with the situation. Further exploration should produce a more operational definition and a typology for identifying and classifying teacher behavior which may contribute to uncertainty. Suggested questions: What teacher behaviors facilitate the acquisition of uncertainty? What are its effects on cognitive, affective, and social behavior? What personality characteristics describe a teacher who generates it? What ecological conditions foster it? (JS)",

The model focuses on the internal cognitive events of teaching and learning in human beings generally, rather than on the specific roles of instructor and student. Teacher-learner communication is described in terms of mathemagenic behaviors (teaching and learning skills) which intervene between nominal stimuli (e.g., a printed page or a teacher's behavior) and the representation of these stimuli in the learner or teacher (effective stimuli). The model depicts a dual control system in which teacher and learner operate in tandem through a continuous process of feedback and regulation (the regulatory behaviors constituting teaching and learning styles  or aptitudes). Levels of mathemagenic behavior appear to exist in hierarchical relation to each other within an individual with distinctions made between perceptual and higher level cognitive processing, etc. It appears possible to infer the levels of processing involved in a given interaction from analyses of such data as learner, observer, and teacher perceptions and teacher and learner skills. Experimental studies already performed suggest that mathemagenic behaviors characterized by probing, higher order questioning, and translation development can be identified in and acquired by teachers. Further research needs to investigate parallel learner behaviors. (JS)",

Among the conclusions suggested by this comparative study are that classroom observation systems (of which the affective ones have been most widely used) can be used profitably in conjunction with microteaching, role playing, and other preservice laboratory teaching experiences; that, through their emphasis on teaching behaviors and indirect teacher influence, they have contributed to a greater emphasis on laboratory experience in teacher preparation and to an increasing \"humanization\" of teaching.

        "description":"A study has been designed to investigate the success of graduates in elementary education at California State College at Long Beach over a 12-year period. The population to date is 1,037 graduates who began their employment in September of each year from 1960-1963. Data was obtained from college files, teacher placement, etc., and from teacher rating scale evaluations obtained from the employing school districts at the end of each teacher's first and third (tenure) year of teaching. Major findings: School districts employing officials rate the teachers consistently in these percentile groups: 16% in 90th, 34% in 80th, 23% in 70th, 13% in 60th, 8% in 50th, and 6% in 40th (unsuccessful). There is a marked to very high correlation between the six evaluators of the teacher from the  time of taking student teaching to the third year in the profession. Of the 1,037 teachers, 49% are still employed in the beginning school district; of the 528 not employed reasons given are 35% married and moved, 26% maternity, 23% personal. There is no evidence to support the ideas that: (1) a married or unmarried teacher will be more successful than the other, (2) married teachers who have had children will be more successful in the classroom, (3) a relationship exists between success and extracurricular activities with children prior to teaching. Major causes of unsuccessful teachers are lack of classroom organization, lack of pupil response and responsibility. (JS)",

Eight trainees selected from 24 registered for counseling  practicum participated in the project at the Poland Springs Job Corps Center, a residential facility for 1,100 women, ages 16-21. Each trainee worked with at least two Job Corps trainees on the day he was at the center and participated in the traveling seminar held during the 4-hour round trip between the campus and center. A series of inservice seminars was also instituted for the 22 resident counselors of the Job Corps center. Analysis of logs, counselor trainee reports, and Job Corps staff member reports indicates that the valuable experience of working with disadvantaged youths gave trainees knowledge and practice not readily available in didactic course presentations.

        "description":"Two of teacher education's most acute problems seem largely beyond its control. The biggest lies in the so-called liberal arts sector, in the preparation the prospective teacher gets in his own teaching fields and in general education. Professional education and the subject matter preparation of a teacher simply cannot be acceptably done in near total isolation from one another. If we cannot persuade the arts faculty to contribute proportionately to the candidate's fitness to be a teacher, we may have to move for control of the background preparation of teachers. The second major problem is in the use of public schools, chiefly for student teaching, but more generally for experience and contact with reality. We need a new partnership which provides a genuine problem-solving,  self-exploratory approach in place of mere \"practice.\" One aspect of the needed program is a curriculum of field experiences starting at the very beginning of the professional sequence and proceeding with it simultaneously. Two other suggested program elements are (1) a continuing seminar, running the whole length of the professional period, led by a team representing such components as psychology, the social foundations, philosophy, and curriculum, and constituting the major guiding influence in the student's personal/professional development, and (2) an instructional laboratory, richly equipped and manned by a variety of specialists, a skills center to build specific proficiencies.

Subjects were 100 elementary teachers (K-8) who had participated in curriculum planning activities in 27 schools in nine school districts in suburban Chicago. Data on 22 variables (identified through a research review) and the extent of implementation were obtained by administering four instruments: Bowers Teacher Opinion Inventory (BTOI), Johansen Participation Inventory and Implementation Inventory, and a data sheet/questionnaire. Correlation and step-wise multiple correlation procedures were utilized. Findings: Degree of participation is positively correlated with greater number of years  of experience, greater number of years in present system, fewer children in family, higher salary, and greater participation in inservice education. A significant correlation exists between the degree of participation and implementation. Teachers most likely to implement the school system's curriculum would be primarily those in self-contained classrooms, holding some hours beyond the B.A. degree, who have small families, prefer the role in curriculum activities as grade consultant and curriculum writers, understand their curriculum responsibilities, receive professional growth points for participation, prefer a combination of school personnel leading curriculum activities, and score high on the BTOI and the Participation Inventory.

Throughout the year six videotapes were collected on each of 20 teachers; they were coded and interpreted and teachers provided with feedback. Statistical tests were conducted at the end of the year to determine if any significant changes took place in the following data: (1) I/D ratios using data from Flanders' system; (2) percent of time spent in categories 1, 2, and 3 of Flanders' system, in encouraging verbal and nonverbal categories of  Roberson's system, in closed method of teaching as opposed to open method of teaching in Roberson's system; (3) student and teacher attitude test scores; and (4) pre-post scores on reading tests, on a semantic differential scale, and on Edwards' Personal Preference Scales. Implications of the findings are that (1) such a program increases the reading achievement of disadvantaged children; (2) writing behavioral objectives at all cognitive and affective levels seems to bring about more change in teacher methods than does training in classroom observation systems; and (3) a teacher's attitude toward the organizational climate of a school may be affected by whether or not he understands the feedback he receives concerning teaching.

Identical numbers of TL and non-TL Ss (N-43) participated in four 2-hour class sessions. The TL treatment, using specifically prepared TL manual, evaluation forms, and listening guide), consisted of presentation of questioning strategy concepts and participation in a microteaching cycle: Ss taught a lesson, evaluated and discussed it, and retaught it. The non-TL treatment consisted of presentation of the questioning strategy concepts  and of Bloom's &quot;Taxonomy&quot;; an educational game called &quot;Questionize&quot;; and teaching a microteaching lesson. Audio tapes of microteaching lessons of all Ss on the final day constituted the data source. The 24-category Questioning Strategies Observation System (QSOS) was used to code and analyze tapes. Multiple linear regression procedures were employed. Findings indicate that the TL treatment was more effective than the non-TL in influencing candidates (1) to ask more questions of a cognitive rather than affective or procedural nature and (2) to react to pupils' responses to questions in a more positive (accepting, supporting) manner.

The course consists of five lessons on different sets of tutoring skills: (1) prompting questions and verbal praise, (2) diagnostic questions, (3) demonstration techniques (estimation, the number line, expanded notation, manipulative materials, diagrams and pictures, and number sentences), (4) evaluation and practice examples, and (5) organizing the classroom for increased tutoring time. In the main field test of the course 49 teachers (volunteers) were  videotaped during two tutoring sessions (one for a student having difficulty with number operations, one with verbal reasoning problems) before and after the course. Each tape was scored by two trained raters on six variables. A replication study was also conducted using 17 inservice teachers. Results demonstrate that the course accomplishes its objective. Major gains were in use of demonstration techniques, diagnostic questioning, and verbal praise. An operational field test with 290 teachers is under way to determine whether course materials contain all the information needed by school districts to use the course independent of supervision.

Attitudes were more favorable as a result of each of the lecture methods, less favorable as a result of the MT. The best treatment for both good teaching skills and positive attitude appears to be a combination of one MT experience with DL.

The course consists of seven instructional sequences taking approximately 15-16 days. Instructional materials include closely integrated handbook and videotape materials for use in developing coding procedures and model clips illustrating  teacher strategies for use in presenting rationale for behavioral change. After preliminary field testing, the main field test was conducted using 24 teachers (volunteers) from whom videotaped discussion lessons were collected before and after the course. Findings: (1) Coding accuracy was 60-70 percent at a 5-second pace. (2) The second objective was achieved, the change appearing to be more a result of instructional lessons than microteaching. (3) Teachers were inadequate in interpreting matrices. Minicourse 4 will be revised to allow more time for coding more training clips and more training in matrix analysis.

The course is organized into five sequences in which a set of 14 teaching behaviors are described and demonstrated; specific skills pertain to five areas of language development: extending phrases to complete sentences and refining meanings; establishing and using new language patterns; using language to describe position, to describe and classify objects, and to identify and describe action. The main field test involved 47 kindergarten teachers, and children were from black, migrant white, and Mexican-American communities. The course evaluation involved analysis by trained evaluators of videotaped  samples of each teacher's behavior (four 10-minute lessons--each taught to five different pupils--before and after the course). The Wilcoxon T was used in determining the statistical significance of behavior changes. Findings indicated significant positive change in most of the 14 skills. Teachers indicated that the instructional tapes were the most important feature of the course and agreed that the model lessons and Teachers Handbook were useful for the specific suggestions for use in the microteaching lessons. The course underwent operational field testing in 1969 and is expected to be ready for commercial distribution by mid-1970. (Course outline and specific finding are included.) (JS)",

        "description":"The objective of the Stanford evaluation team was to identify philosophical and conceptual, as well as technical, considerations which might guide the evaluation of the proposals made by the nine USOE-funded elementary teacher training models. The nine models were studied intensively by sub-teams, discussed and criticized by the entire team over a period of three months, and further explored in consultation with representatives of each of the models in a two-day conference. This report is organized to present (1) general comments involving perceived strengths and weaknesses of all of the programs and (2) analyses of each of the nine models in relation to certain persistent questions. Major issues treated are individualized instruction for prospective teachers, modeling behavior,  systems analysis and computer technology, behavioral objectives, coalitions, and innovations and change. Although the overall evaluation of the models is positive, the emphasis of the report is on restating and responding to eight questions which make explicit certain normative issues which have fundamental practical consequences for program design and implementation. It is the continuing examination of these questions (e.g., \"Does it make a difference whether a program takes its departure from a holistic orientation or an atomistic one?\") which the evaluators believe ought to be the first concern of the educators of teachers in their evaluation and/or use of the teacher education models.

        "description":"A study examined the educational process to identify teacher role in education and school efficiency in hiring teachers. The implicit educational model used by administrators is known: that a teacher's productivity is a function of experience and educational level. A conceptual model of the educational process was developed which states that education output, itself a multi-dimensional factor, is a function of the cumulative background influences of the individual's family, the cumulative background influences of his peers, his innate abilities, and the cumulative school inputs. Two separate analyses of elementary school processes, based on the model, were undertaken, one relying on data from the Northeast and Great Lakes of the \"Equality of Educational Opportunity\" survey (713  schools) and one using a sample drawn from a California school district in 1969 (2445) students). Educational output was measured only by achievement tests. Black, white, and Mexican-American students were considered separately for part of the study. Major conclusions were that (1) teachers do generally count in education; (2) schools operate quite inefficiently by hiring teacher attributes which lead to little or no achievement gains; and (3) there appears to be considerable latitude for public policy to improve our educational system. Teacher verbal ability, recentness of education, and specific socioeconomic class experience are the best measures of teacher quality contained in the data. (JS)",

The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive review and analysis of 19 school effectiveness studies. The four-section paper (1) attempts to place contemporary assessment efforts in historical perspective; (2) discusses the nature and limitations of such studies; (3) presents a study-by-study review of recent efforts to examine systematically the impact of school variables upon student performance; and (4) summarizes the school service components which were consistently found to be  significantly associated with one or more measures of pupil performance (i.e., the number and quality of professional staff, particularly teachers; contact frequency with professional staff; adequacy and extent of physical facilities for instruction; and expenditures per pupil and teacher). The amount and consistency of evidence supporting the effectiveness of school services in influencing academic performance lead to the conclusion that although there is a need for more precise information about which components are most effective and in what mix or proportion they can be made more effective, there can be little doubt that schools do make a difference.

A large number of variables were reduced into a fewer number of indices for use in regression analysis. A technique for the partition of multiple correlation showed that for achievement, very little of the influence of the schools can be separated from the social background of their students, and vice versa. Those aspects of the schools most involved in student achievement pertained to the teaching staff's verbal skills, racial-ethnic composition, salary level, special staff and services, and their view of their teaching conditions. The existence of a dominant color-caste system in the  preparation of teachers was discovered. Although schools play an important role in promoting achievement for all students, students from the higher socioeconomic status, mostly white, were found to benefit more from their schooling than those from the lower socioeconomic strata, many non-white. Innovations must be tried that would break these social background barriers. (Steps employed in reducing variables into indices and the utilization of indices in regression analysis are described. Appendixes contain lists of the student, teacher, principal, and school indices, give definition of sets of variables, and describe the development of measures of commonality for three sets of variables.)

Are different characteristics of teaching style associated with white teachers' ability-to-relate to student groups of differing ethnic background? Black and white high school students, 50 each, viewed and rated videotapes of 50 white intern teachers presenting a 5- to 7-minute lesson on \"Black Power.\" Each intern was rated on ability-to-relate and on seven characteristics of teaching style. Findings: White students, on the average, rated teachers higher on ability-to-relate than did black ones, although 13 of the 50 were rated more favorably by black students. Ratings of teachers by students in the two  groups were not similar. On ability-to-relate and on three teaching style characteristics the correlations of ratings between racial groups were negative. The same teacher was viewed quite differently, relative to the other teachers, in the two groups. Seven of the 14 correlations between scores on ability-to-relate and the teaching style characteristics were statistically significant. Conclusions: The ability of teachers to relate to students is likely to vary substantially as a function of the ethnic background of the student group. Characteristics of teaching style contribute to ability-to-relate differentially in student groups of differing ethnic background. (JS)",

Simulation groups used Program II of &quot;Mr. Land's Sixth Grade&quot; in which students respond to 20 simulated classroom situations (on 16mm film) as if they were the teacher in the actual classroom. Data consisted of four measures of student teaching performance, pre-post  seminar scores on the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory (MTAI), and pre-post seminar data on response to simulated classroom situations. Analyses of variance and Pearson product moment correlation were used in analyzing data. Findings: There were no significant differences between the three groups in post-seminar response to simulated classroom situations, in performance in student teaching, or in post-seminar attitude toward teaching. There were no significant relationships between post-seminar attitude toward teaching and student teaching performance and none between pre-seminar response to simulated classroom situations and student teaching performance.

The major time investment (nearly 2 days) was scheduled for active involvement with the materials in the simulation laboratory, during which participants played the role of students and the director demonstrated how he would handle the material and participants in an ordinary  class or institute setting. Among the materials requiring or illustrating task-oriented responses were in-basket correspondence, telephone calls, and filmed or videotaped open-ended conferences. The major part of the last day was devoted to a combined brainstorming-discovery approach, in which participants reacted to the methodology and materials and sought ways of developing and/or adapting them. The report includes many illustrations of its conclusion that the primary relevance of a \"training-in-use\" requirement for the purchase of simulation materials lies not so much in getting to know a particular piece of instructional gear, but rather in the discovery process in which one engages while working in a group with almost any prototype package.

Data was gathered in a public high school near Detroit in 1969. Using the basic 10-category Flanders interaction analysis system, systematic observations of controversial issues discussions were made in the social studies classrooms of 14 teachers during 28 different discussion sessions (averaging 70 minutes per teacher). Student talk/teacher talk ratios (as indices of the extent to which students rather than teachers talk during the discussions) and student-initiated/teacher-initiated talk ratios (as indices of the tendency of students to offer their own ideas without being induced to do so by the teacher) were derived from the data. The  teachers were questioned by means of a paper and pencil questionnaire about students' freedom to express their opinions during these discussions, and a sample of their students responded to a similar questionnaire. An analysis of the consistency of these sources of data was then made, using product moment correlations as indicators of between-source agreement. Apparent distortions in the teacher-reported data seem to be related to the importance which teachers assign to student opinion expression as a teaching goal. The teacher data were found to disagree with the other two sources, and were judged to be an unsatisfactory source of data for this classroom phenomenon. (Author/JES)",

The second section discusses some of the research methods and tools being developed by the Center in relation to its task (the Delphi Method, Cross-Impact Matrix, Simulation-Gaming, etc.). The third section illustrates the Center's approach to future-oriented research by describing and analyzing the possible implications of two of many research efforts currently under way (one dealing with Federal policy for the support of post-secondary education, the other aimed at developing alternative futures for elementary and secondary institutions and for policies directed toward changes in their governance, goals, and methods and content of instruction).

The field studies which provided the basis for the report were conducted in three phases: (1) the preliminary staff inquiry, (2) field study by the members of a special committee, and (3) visits to selected school districts and interviews with local association officers in East Texas. In its four-chapter report, the committee (1) describes and relates to the problems under study the geographic, historical, and current socioeconomic environment in which these problems have developed; (2) summarizes its findings, which fully substantiated the allegations that  school desegregation, as it is being implemented in many parts of East Texas, is resulting in the arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of black students and teachers; (3) analyzes the environment of school districts and communities that stifles and blocks resolution of the grievances of those who are being victimized by the misapplication of, or noncompliance with, desegregation laws and guidelines; (4) suggests a course of organized action by which teachers can help to remedy the serious situation that now exists.

        "description":"The purpose of this document is to describe two process-oriented classroom observation scales and to report a research study which offers further support for the validity of these instruments. The two observation scales, developed by Harvey, et al., are (1) Teaching Rating Scale, devised specifically as a measure of classroom atmosphere, and (2) Student Rating Scale, constructed to assess certain effects of different teacher behaviors and classroom climates upon the students. The instrument used as the criterion against which the replicability of the apparent validity of both scales were tested was the \"This I Believe\" (TIB) Test, a measure of concreteness-abstractness which enables respondents to be classified into one of four principal belief systems (ranging from the most  concrete mode of construing the world to the most abstract). The research study involved preliminary administration of the TIB and repeated usage of both observation scales as part of an evaluation of a teacher re-training program in a large suburban school district. Results of the study reconfirm the earlier findings of Harvey, et al., that the concreteness-abstractness of teachers' beliefs affects their behavior in the classroom and that this differential behavior in turn influences the performance of their students. Procedures and findings are presented in both tabular and discussion form, along with recommendations for appropriate utilization and/or adaptations of the two scales. (Author/JES)",

As a senior level course for teachers-in-training it has been offered three times with encouraging results. Goals are to help the student become a more acute observer, to assist him become more skilled in handling interpersonal problems, and to provide him with information and experience relevant to interpersonal relationships within schools. Upon entering the course each student is asked to prepare an outline of topics and individual goals for the course; the papers are analyzed to provide a more specific course outline. Formal lectures are minimized. The generalized class  structure includes selective readings assigned by the instructor, six to seven short class assignments, term papers if desired, group presentations, exams, and a major term project which takes the student into actual school settings over a period of time to observe and report on a dyadic or small group interaction. Small student groups elect one of their number to a steering committee and prepare a group project for presentation to the whole class. The steering committee provides feedback for the instructor and a chance for students to modify the course. Examinations are of the open-book, take-home type. Each student chooses percentage weights for his final course grade. (Reading list and other materials given to students on the first day are included.) (JS)",

The ICL was administered to a sample consisting of five groups: 121 graduate counselor trainees, 307 senior teachers-in-training, 25 priests, 67 high school students, and 64 army officer cadets. T tests were used to determine whether significant differences existed between discrepancy scores of males and females within groups. To determine whether overall differences between groups were significant, a one-way analysis of variance was used. The priest group obtained highest mean S-I  discrepancy scores and therefore were least congruent. Counselor trainees and army officers were most congruent, differing significantly from priests. Counselor trainees were significantly more congruent then teacher trainees and high school students. Group S-I discrepancies on the 16 individual dimensions (interpersonal variables) were also calculated. Findings support the idea that there are conceptual similarities between vocational interest and personality and that vocational choice is the implementation of self concept and self-regard.

A sample of 10 classes was selected for observation by two observers during a regularly scheduled lesson on blending (word attack) outcomes. Observers were trained in the use of two observation scales developed for the study: one for stimulus-response analysis of instructional transactions between teacher and pupils and one to measure the patterning and dispersion of pupil responses and the extent to which pupils are presented stimuli appropriate to the program outcomes. Results were used to revise training objectives and  develop corresponding materials for the 1969-70 installation. The effectiveness of the new training program was then measured, and based on results and instruments, new procedures and revised classroom monitoring instruments will be developed for use by program supervisors in the 1970-71 tryout. Comparison of trained and untrained teachers shows the program effective for pupil response rate, relevance of instructional stimuli to lesson outcomes, pupil praise, and use of prompts. Behavioral analysis of instruction appears to be useful in identifying training requirements and evaluating program effectiveness.

This document reports its use and adaptation in comparing various groupings within the set of PLAN classes--groupings based on grade-level, teacher experience in writing PLAN curriculum materials, and instructional organization (team vs. self-contained). The 20 categories of student behavior included in PLAN-SOS are clustered into seven groups which correspond to major emphases of the  teacher training program, thus enabling the instrument to provide feedback directly relevant to the training and development of PLAN teachers. According to a systematic procedure of observation and analysis, paired and carefully trained observers (one focusing on students, the other on teachers) collected data in each of the classrooms under study. Results revealed no significant differences between PLAN groups in terms of the variety and kinds of activities engaged in and considered essential characteristics of the process of individualized instruction.

The program consisted of a preservice conference and inservice consultant services designed to encourage specific teaching behaviors. The 17-category Teacher Observation Scale (TOS) was developed for use in measuring behavior changes. It includes five behaviors on which PLAN teachers are expected to spend more time (diagnostic and didactic inquiry, decision facilitation, leading small group discussion, tutoring, giving positive verbal and nonverbal messages) and five on which they are expected to spend less time (solution giving, providing content, giving a negative verbal or nonverbal message, managing records  and computer materials, managing learning material and equipment). Materials developed for the 1968-69 training program included modules on use of the computer, classroom organization, and individualization of instruction and video tape models of tutoring and group discussion behavior. Analysis of teacher behavior using TOS with PLAN teachers and a control group led to changes in the second year's training program to place more emphasis on teacher planning, classroom organization, and use of positive reinforcement. Fall 1969 TOS data showed that teacher behavior was moving in the direction of desired change; further examination and modification will be made after analysis of spring 1970 data. (JS)",

A questionnaire was administered to a randomly stratified sample of the community and to the total professional teaching population in a city school district (population 35,000) in upstate New York. Respondents were asked who they presently perceived had the decisionmaking power and who they thought schould have final control over a series of economic, administrative, and educational issues. Conclusions: There is a potential for sharp conflict between environmental community groups and the internal professional staff concerning the ideal distribution of authority, the largest differences concerning economic issues.  The community desires greater control for itself and its elected representative, the school board, and less by the professional teacher than is desired by teachers. On both educational and economic matters both community and teachers desire some change from what they perceive is present practice. Both desire more control by teachers of the educational process. Community perceptions do not accurately reflect current decisionmaking practices. Such current ignorance while serving to avoid overt conflict also sows the seed for future conflict. Collective bargaining, for instance, may increase the potential for conflict by increasing the visibility of internal operations, by making more salient the relative power of teacher groups, etc. (JS)",

Attitudes were measured by a semantic differential scale, and commitment by a questionnaire regarding inducements necessary for the teacher to leave the profession or the district. Major findings: Organizational and professional commitments are significantly related to positive evaluations of professional activities and negative evaluations of militant activities. There is  a much stronger relationship between demographic background factors and favorable evaluations of militant activities than between these factors and favorable evaluations of professional activities. The relationship between high organizational or professional commitment and unfavorable evaluation of militant activities was statistically significant only for females, while a significant relationship between high commitment and favorable evaluation of professional activities existed only for the under 29 age group.

Relevant questionnaire data was solicited from teachers in two western New York school districts, one rural and one urban, with responses from 60 percent and 75 percent  respectively.

Teachers from the inner-city college are placed in middle-class white suburban schools, Brockport seniors in inner-city schools of primarily black population. The benefits of the exchange, in terms of intercultural and interracial understanding as well as knowledge of education and teaching,  have led to its continuation and expansion during the past two years. In addition to discussing the reactions of students to new conditions and communities, the paper describes the ways in which administrative problems involved in harmonizing different college programs were responded to (curriculum requirements, non-resident tuition, etc.).

Written records (e.g., check lists, matrices, observation systems) and audio tapes may be designated as protocol materials but videotape recordings will likely become the predominant medium. In teacher education the \"protocol materials process\" is seen as a means of bringing theory and reality together in the theoretical, training, and field components of preparation programs. Information (teacher relevant theory)  is presented (by such means as books, lectures, or tape-slide presentations) as a hypothesis or hypothetical construct. Protocol materials are presented for analysis followed by discussion which focuses on the question of whether or not they tend to confirm or deny the hypothesis. Protocol materials would usually be made in the training complex in which they are used, often by the students themselves, because of the need for relevance and immediacy. Such a process has implications for broader aims: to individualize instruction, personalize a student's philosophy of education, and provide him with tools necessary for continued self-evaluation and appraisal of his role and situation.

Psychologists have information, ways of thinking, and ways of attacking problems that will improve teaching, but that information has to be learned to be used by the teacher. Understanding how people learn to think psychologically is and should be one of the major tasks of a psychologist. This task assumes even greater importance when the people are teachers whose work has numerous and significant psychological components. Research on this problem has both great theoretical and practical value. Theoretical order must be brought to the field so that we can do the kinds of experiments that will enable us to  describe teaching behavior and its effects more precisely. The complex problems include study of the verbal discourse of the teacher, the emotive characteristics of teacher-student interactions, how teachers choose their profession, how this choice and its consequences relate to their personal development, and how complex teaching strategies are conceived and carried out. A twofold sequence is required: (1) conceptualizing how a psychological principle might be applied in teaching behavior and (2) devising the training method by which the application will become part of the teacher's behavior.

The recommendations are presented in two major sections, one concerned with standards for basic teacher education programs (programs for the initial preparation of teachers through the fifth-year level, including M.A.T. programs) and one concerned with advanced programs (post-baccalaureate programs for the advanced preparation of teachers and the preparation of other professional school personnel). Standards relevant to each of these two program levels are further classified according to the following categories: (1) curriculums, (2)  faculty, (3) students, (4) resources and facilities, and (5) evaluation, program review, and planning. Each standard is defined in a one-sentence statement which is accompanied by a general explanation and by specific questions intended to aid interpretation and application of the standards. The introduction to the booklet presents background information related to NCATE and to the purposes and process of accreditation. Emphasis is placed on the attempt which has been made to maintain flexibility and \"to develop standards which encourage individuality, imagination, and innovation in institutional planning.\" (JES)",

A distinct characteristic of the project, developed in response to the increasing national concern for the preparation of teachers for disadvantaged youth, was its utilization of a non-public school setting as a site for part of the regular student teaching experience. Six institutions and 135 student teachers participated directly in the project which involved the cooperative efforts of college supervisors, college faculty, colleges, Job Corps centers, public school systems, public school cooperating teachers, and student teachers. Among the findings of the evaluative study are: (1) The Job Corps student teaching project was most relevant in aiding the student teacher to examine his own  self-image. (2) Student teachers repeatedly stressed the benefits derived from interaction with a differing culture and value system. (3) The opportunity to participate in a learning situation where students were volunteers provided new insights regarding classroom discipline. (4) The flexibility of the Job Corps program allows--indeed forces--the student teacher to be creative. (5) In many ways the supervisors were required to go beyond the boundaries of traditional supervision. (6) The majority of participants felt that a number of instructional materials could be beneficially utilized in the public school to facilitate individual instruction. Also included are 11 recommendations for future planning and a concise description of each of the six programs. (Author/JES)",

The gifted writer takes all experience to himself and imaginatively transforms the real world into his own private world. His only ethic is to be true to his own intense perspective of reality and to the artistic demands of each work's particular form. Because subject, form, and expression inextricably affect each other, the writer must have a conceptual sense of the whole as he writes, with provision for his characters to develop freely. Then, when the work is complete, he must become a rigorous self critic. His only enduring reward  will be that, as he deals candidly with the joys, triumphs, and hurts of life, he will exorcise old ghosts and open up new creative vistas for himself. (JB)",

In teaching literature, they should encourage students to read quickly as many novels as possible and, then, through general discussions and close study of passages, to consider in detail the more interesting ones. In poetry study,  the writing of student poems, group readings of poems, and the teacher's oral reading to evoke immediate student responses can be productive.

It was proposed that words of the same form class constitute \"verbal habit families\" on the basis of either a common grammatical meaning response, a common affix, or a common label (e.g., \"verb\"). One implication of this model was that sentences may be regarded as sequences of grammatical habit families. Three experiments tested two derivations from the model. Experiments one and two indicated that, under certain circumstances, words classified as verbs do indeed constitute a word response class. Experiment three tested the hypothesis that a novel word will gain verb properties by being paired with other verbs. The results of this  experiment indicated that the greater the number of times a nonsense syllable was paired with verbs, the less often it was used as a verb in a sentence completion task. This result, contradictory to the hypothesis, did not appear incompatible with the model developed, but further research is needed for an adequate evaluation. (Author/LH)",

Organization of a humanities curriculum may be by arts and genres, by aesthetic categories, by topics, or by chronology and culture; but if only one course can be offered, historical organization insures the most coherent study of cultures. One method of humanities instruction is team teaching, in which a group of specialists word together to reinforce and learn from each other. The teachers should  have received some formal humanities instruction themselves--preferably at least one full-year college humanities course plus a couple of in-depth studies of different cultural periods.

Using this method, an instructor may plan and evaluate any new course (e.g., ones in film study, in the analysis of ideas, or in Black literature).

Avoiding traditional discussions of errors, the program achieves a positive approach by examining sentences and paragraphs chosen from the work of almost 100 professional writers (e.g., Bellow, Churchill, Hemingway).

Educational institutions and English teachers too often resist any consideration of a new visual or electric literacy. For example, critics of television fail to appreciate it as a new technology which demands different sensory responses.

This problem was observed at Iran Girls' College during an American literature short story class conducted for advanced seniors, none of whom had been in America but whose English proficiency and motivation were high. When the students attempted to interpret John Steinbeck's \"How Mr. Hogan Robbed A Bank\" and Ernest Hemingway's \"Soldier's Home,\" they were unable to grasp the central ideas of the stories. Even after background information on satire, American cultural characteristics, and symbolism were supplied, the students were able to interpret Steinbeck's story only on a level of detail; on a level of general  ideas, they merely repeated the teacher's explanation. In studying \"Soldier's Home,\" the students were confused even more through their ignorance of the basic American family relationships and tensions. To overcome this lack of familiarity with Western culture, an extensive course in the background of Western literature would be extremely valuable for students from other countries. (JM)",

Test scores from measures of language/thinking proficiency, such as problem solving, listening, abstract quality of thinking, and reading achievement (15 variables in all), were collected from 312 fifth-grade students randomly placed in experimental and control groups, who had completed all pretests and post-tests, and from 153 sixth-grade students who had completed retention tests. Experimental-group children had received instruction in problem solving, listening, and abstract  thinking. The major method of statistical analysis consisted of principal-axis factor analysis of the 15 variables, with varimax and oblique rotation. Results showed that three factors could be extracted and interpreted--reading achievement, verbal abstract thinking, and problem solving.

The first experiment investigated the effect of a listener's expectations upon his understanding of a sentence. Sometimes the \"most probable\" answer was not congruent with the \"correct\" answer, suggesting that the listener's expectation of what was probable influenced the manner in which he interpreted the experimental sentence. The second experiment investigated the effects of varying the delay interval from .02 to 2.0 seconds between the sentence's presentation and the memory test. Subjects either responded to questions or repeated, from memory, the word following a specified word in a sentence. Results indicated that delay caused the listener to  reconstruct the wording of a sentence from a deeper interpretation of it. The results of both experiments suggested that a listener formulates hypotheses about the underlying meaning of a sentence through an initial analysis of the sentence and his own expectations of what is likely to be said, and then tests the hypotheses against syntactic cues within the sentence. Because of the effect of his own expectations and the rapid loss of essential information about the sentence, the listener may misinterpret a completely plausible sentence. (LH)",

A computerized electric typewriter, the Edison Responsive Environment Talking Typewriter, was used to allow the children to move to more complex materials programmed and presented to them after initial familiarization with the keyboard and alphabet at random. The major  thrust of the research evaluation was to determine whether this training could positively influence the children's knowledge and skill with respect to verbal fluency, reading ability, and language development. From the evaluation emerged the chief finding that very young children from poor families can be helped before they enter a formal school experience; in a remarkably short period of exposure, the Talking Typewriter training prepared a group of prekindergarten youngsters for first grade work. Detailed tables of test scores and a bibliography are appended. (RJ)",

This effort involved the implementation of sampling procedures at both the secondary school and elementary school levels, the obtaining of baseline variables for the entire sampled groups, and the administration of achievement pre-tests to all students in the samples. Two sampling strategies were employed. At the elementary level, five public schools and two non-public schools were selected randomly; at the secondary level, each program was sampled by randomly selecting half of the schools in which in each of the programs was operating. Questionnaires and survey  instruments were administered to students, parents, and staff members. The principal findings was that the evaluation questions were left unanswered resulting from the lack of adequate control groups. Reportedly, the lack of control groups also greatly increased the uncertainty of interpretation regarding individual program effectiveness. (RJ)",

Net costs of the average five-month Job Corps experience is estimated at $3500 and this figure includes an allowance for the overhead expenses of Job Corps and for the earnings foregone by the Corpsmen during their training. Appraised value of work projects is subtracted from costs and, finally, the value of  transfer payments made to Corpsmen is deducted. Analysis is supported by a technical discussion of source materials and procedures used to manipulate data. (KG)",

Two hundred and ten second graders, mostly Negro, were transferred from an adjacent inner-city school to five other peripheral schools. A comparison was made of the pre- and post-transfer scores on the Paragraph Meaning and Word Meaning sections of the Stanford Achievement Test obtained from a sample of 54 transfer students and 60 students not transferred and therefore still in an inner-city school. Pupils who were transferred from the inner-city school to peripheral schools show significantly greater gains when they are compared with pupils who remained in inner-city schools. Further, teacher  evaluation of achievement and adjustment to school and classroom procedures on the part of all pupils, grades one through six, who were bussed from the inner-city, show significant positive change.

Such a test both provides a racial context and makes psychological withdrawal difficult. Ten personal and social situations with some relevance to a racial response were created. For each situation ten bipolar Semantic Differential scales were written. Two forms were written, differing only in that the word &quot;black&quot; was inserted into each situation in one form. The validity of the S.A.S. was determined by the mean difference between forms of responses by 405 white University of Maryland students. Strong evidence that the insertion of the word &quot;black&quot; into each situation caused subjects to respond differently from what they would have  had the word not been inserted was generated. This finding has implications for future studies of and method in racial attitudes measurement. (JM)",

Although the educational situation in the big cities is grim, a decade of study and experimentation should ready us for massive positive action. The educational system of the big cities is basically viable. An effective improvement program calls for: (1) developing appropriate systems of rewards for school achievement by children of various sub-cultures; (2) building a coherent, rational school program and curriculum that is understood and accepted by the pupil; (3) maintaining a pre-school program for disadvantaged children followed by a primary school program built upon it; (4) establishing a system of local community participation in school affairs in disadvantaged local communities; and, (5)  developing a central school administration which relates the school system to other school and governmental systems in the metropolitan area. The alternative is to try to replace the present establishment in education with a chaos of small innovative enterprises of extremely uneven quality.

One main reason is the failure to take into account the diverse backgrounds of the students. In particular, schools have been structured in a manner that discriminates against children whose parents are poor. If the school system is to survive, it must be sensitive to change and capable not only of making appropriate responses but of anticipating problem situations and coping with them prior to a confrontation. In California, the approach to this has been compensatory education--education geared to the individual needs and potential of each student. Concentration of educational resources on schools with a  high percentage of economically disadvantaged children has resulted in improved achievement, attitudes, and motivation. The lack of societal commitment has resulted in the limiting of the number of participants in order to have some effective program. The role of the teacher is crucial to the success of such programs.

Major substantive findings of the study were as follows: variations in elementary school context make a substantial and significant difference in subsequent academic success at higher grade levels;  socio-economic and racial characteristics of students' age-mates have no effect independently on academic achievement of students attending similar schools; social class composition of a school affects the academic development of both Negro and white students in racially segregated or integrated situations; and, given similar social class compositions, racial balance of a school has slight bearing on the academic performance of students.

Wolf and Stein's (1966)  follow-up research project on the effects of Head Start programs for Puerto-Rican, black, and non-Puerto-Rican white children in New York City is presented as a study which raises important issues in research methodology. Reviews of studies of cognitive development are presented, which support the theory that the degree of progress made by Head Start graduates and children without preschool experience can invariably be related to a child's base level of function.

Antipoverty programs should attack the total environment of the poor: housing, education, family stability, employment, and neighborhoods. Increased efforts must be made to reach the hidden and silent poor such as the American Indian and the Southern tenant. Passive and indifferent institutions must be made responsive. At the Federal level, the Presidential staff functions of the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) should include reporting directly to the Assistant to the President for Urban Affairs. OEO should remain as an agency outside the Executive Office, should administer and evaluate a larger number of  community action programs, and should also develop and test experimental pilot programs. Programs of proven value developed by OEO should be delegated to other departments so that the Director of OEO can concentrate on employing newly found methods and techniques. OEO should adopt unresponsive poverty related programs operated in other departments. The Urban Affairs Council should make an effort to improve management and coordination of human resources programs and the Director of OEO should participate in its work.

Major recommendations are as follows: (1) Office of Education (OE) should make a special effort to disseminate examples of demonstrably successful compensatory education programs, such as the selection of 21 successful projects described in a special supplement in this report; (2) OE should designate a single visibly placed official to monitor all aspects of Title I participation by nonpublic school children; (3) OE should show state and local personnel the full range of  possibilities in using Title I funds for health services; (4) ESEA Title I should be continued substantially as now written; (5) principle of concentrating funds where most needed should be adhered to; (6) the new Administration is urged to offer imaginative leadership in school desegregation and to refuse to back down on this commitment; and, (7) the Executive and Legislative branches should move quickly to close the gap between the Title I appropriation and the authorization of a sum of $2.7 billion. Appended are community case studies of nonpublic school children and Title I. (RJ)",

Sixty-six vocational directors were surveyed. Replies were received from 86 percent of the educational institutions including 54 area vocational-technical schools and three comprehensive high schools. By and large, all criteria except the one relating to  employability of graduates were satisfied. It was therefore recommended that the initiation of the program be delayed 1 year pending clarification of employability status and investigation of the possibility of recruiting into the program persons already employed as instructional specialists. In the interim, efforts were to be expended on program development. The initial chapter presents a program prospectus. (JK)",

The information in this publication has been inflated and adjusted to agree with the published industry total. Data on 22 medical occupations and 27 other jobs found in medical facilities are presented along with information on total employment in the health area and an overall view of national trends. Medical employers predicted an 11.1 percent increase in employment by June 1969 over the same month of 1967. This  considerably exceeded the 7.7 percent growth forecast for total wage and salary employment statewide. The medical gain by 1969 would provide 6,400 new jobs and raise the number of medical wage and salary workers to 63,800. By 1972, the 20.7 percent employment growth expected would raise the medical job count to 69,300 and provide 11,900 new positions. Extensive data are presented in tabular form. (JK)",

General session presentations on teacher education by Martin W. Essex, Virgil S. Lagomarceno, and William G. Loomis are included. The six studies reported involved the use of micro-teaching and audio- and videotaping for feedback purposes in preservice and inservice teacher education as well as in a workshop for teacher educators. Some other factors considered in the various studies were: (1) teaching high school students versus teaching peers, (2) the length of lessons taught by student teachers, (3) use of the telephone and the mail in remote  supervision of teachers, (4) the use of instruction models, and (5) the relative effectiveness of critique by self, student taught, fellow teachers, and teacher educators. The report of each study is followed by discussion of its implications. The report of the sub-seminar on teaching the disadvantaged is available as VT 010 163. (JK)",

Upon a student's enrollment in a vocationally oriented course of instruction, the school records information on an &quot;entry card&quot; which is transmitted to the Research Coordinating Unit (RCU) where the data is encoded and transferred to magnetic tape storage for subsequent computer use. Any change in information is submitted to the RCU by completion of a &quot;change card.&quot; Upon exit of  a student, pertinent information is recorded as an &quot;exit card&quot; and transmitted to the RCU. &quot;Follow-up cards&quot; are transmitted to ex-students 6 months, 2 years, and 4 years after their dates of exit and, on return, are transmitted to the RCU. Each 6 months a computer output report is sent to each participating school. An annual report summarizing all general information is compiled and published after the conclusion of each school year.

A review of the literature indicated that several schools were granting credit for occupational experience but few had developed standard procedures.

Relevant materials were identified and, in some cases, purchased for use in the future development of the project. However, institutions which had developed tests were reluctant to provide copies and some stated their tests needed revision. It was therefore concluded that tests had to be developed and that impartial methods for granting credit had to be  devised. The following steps were followed in the development of a model plan: (1) Establish occupational areas to be included, (2) Subdivide into specialized areas, (3) Analyze content of specialized areas for knowledge and skills needed by the instructor, (4) List competencies and evaluate listing, (5) Review evaluated list and formulate a final list, (6) Develop a system by which an applicant would receive fair evaluation and justifiable credit for occupational experience.

During the first year (April 1967-June 1968), the RCU concentrated on establishing an information system and announcing its existance. One third of the staff time was devoted to helping the Schaffer-Kaufman Study. Research projects the second year (August 1968-October 1969) focused on: (1) disadvantaged youth in urban vocational school settings, (2) developing of a system for a state-wide evaluation of vocational-technical education, (3) Massachusetts information feedback system for vocational education, (4) an evaluation of vocational-technical school facilities, (5) prototype of a program for girls in  vocational-technical education, and (6) attitudes of junior high school staff members toward vocational education in the high school. Conclusions and recommendations are included. (GR)",

The project staff created curriculum materials which were reviewed by outside authorities and put into workable lesson plans by a group of educational consultants. The result was a six-volume set of instructional materials covering 496 student-contact hours or 21 credit hours which could be used to implement 2-year concrete technology courses in post-secondary schools throughout the nation. Pilot programs were established in six junior colleges in the U.S. and Canada to test course content. Recommendations were for continued testing and eventual finalizing of the curriculum in Phase II, the adaptation of the curriculum to other  educational endeavors in Phase III, and the creation of recruiting materials. The curriculum materials are available as VT 010 139-VT 010 141 and VT 010 150-VT 010 152. Outlines of these courses make up the bulk of this manuscript. (CD)",

One of the most effective ways of providing cooperation is through the vocational education advisory committee. At present, there are about 20,000 such groups. These committees are unique in their ability to provide occupational information and aid in establishing vocational education programs. Their organization, name, and function can be altered to fit specific needs and situations. Their only limitation is that the advisory committees can assume neither legislative nor administrative responsibility. The school can benefit from the experience of the advisory committee and use their  recommendations to help build and maintain a successful program. (BC)",

Data from analysis of the test scores and critical incidents, made possible the development of instructional materials. Finally, a test was made of the simulated materials at a workshop. Findings include: (1) Principals felt more obligated than superintendents toward initiating, developing, and maintaining occupational education, (2) Administrators from  schools with enrollments of from 200-499 students indicated a stronger obligation toward initiation of occupational education programs than did administrators from larger or smaller schools, (3) Those educators who attended the workshop made significant gains on the cognitive tests and expressed more favorable feelings about vocational education, and (4) Simulation, or the in-basket technique of instruction provides high motivation and seems to reach the affective domain where traditional methods often fail.

Some major findings are: a) the estimated relationships are consistent with the conceptual model developed in  this report; b) teacher quality appears to be an important determinant of scholastic success; and c) the production functions explain a very small percentage of the variance of scholastic achievement, even using the full range of social class and school input variables.

The reviewer points out the lack of research into some of these aspects. Instead, most research has been directed at (1) comparing student outcomes from the CHEM Study course and those from some other chemistry course, (2) investigating cognitive processes of students in CHEM Study  classes, and (3) investigating the effect of CHEM Study content on students without using a pre-post test design. The areas which the reviewer suggests need research include that of determining (1) how the CHEM Study materials may best enhance student outcomes, (2) how closely the objectives of the course are actually achieved in the classroom, (3) which students, and teachers are best suited to the CHEM Study program.

This study proposes to identify common cost patterns as a guideline in determining approach to full utilization of resources. This research will assist government policy makers to identify institutional educational resource requirements in order that they may promote and affect legislation to assist public and private institutions of higher education. The study concentrates on 362 institutions in the Northeast United States for the Fiscal Year 1964, supplemented by data from 1962 and 1967. For analysis, the institutions are stratified by type, control and the selectivity level of student. Variations in educational operating expenses are reviewed in light of  changes in the enrollment mix, staffing and physical plant. Certain implications for higher education institutions have evolved from the study. Two of the more important are: 1. The productivity of the individual faculty member needs to be increased without increasing class size and capital cost. 2. There appears to be sufficient evidence to indicate that no institution should enroll less than 1000 students. Implications for government are: 1. Aid to post-secondary institutions needs to consider the variations in educational operating costs and yearly plant costs. 2. Given plant space additional students could be accommodated in private institutions at less cost. (ON)",

The population selected had a sixth grade modal reading level and a modal age between 22 and 29, and achieved the fifth grade level in arithmetic. It was 9/10th Negro and 6/7ths female. More than half the subjects failed to make more than two patterns, two or less patterns being the criteria of five experienced counselors for determining the usefulness of the GATB results. The range of scores on the WAIS demonstrated the enormous variance of abilities of the clients tested. On the other hand, because over half of the subjects failed to meet the criteria the GATB was found  to lack variability. The primary weakness of the WAIS was that the subtests were not factored for vocational and occupational areas. In this respect, the GATB would be useful if the scores were more readily available. The shortcomings of the GATB seem to outweigh its usefulness for evaluation of a population such as the one used in this study. (Author/NL)",

The program has three distinctive features: (1) any useful combination of liberal arts and professional courses is acceptable; (2) the able student can earn academic amnesty to offset potentially crippling qualitative disabilities acquired as an alienated youth; (3) liberal provision is made for translating into college degree credit the general knowledge acquired by adults through informal educational experiences. While originally developed for adult part-time students of the great Omaha area, the degree program has attracted military personnel who now account for the great bulk of  the degrees conferred each year. One of the major attractions of the program has been the opportunity to decrease the time required to obtain a degree through the use of credit earned by examination.

Such indicators as population growth, income growth, rising level of education, rising levels of taxation, the rapidity of technological advance, shifts in social pattern, all pointed to a rapidly growing demand on universities for direct services by an adult public. The modern university must be seen as a place of lifetime learning. Adults require and will demand full access (in a sense, ownership) to institutions which their tax dollars support. Deliberate involvement of the public is an issue which invites thoughtful consideration. A variety of adjustments to the typical university organization has the potential to provide encouragement and  opportunities for formal and informal learning to the community.

In these communities, 381 functionally illiterate persons were given the pre- and  post-tests, and 180 subjects served as the experimental group and 45 as a control group. Participants showed positive changes in levels of anomia and self-concept; data relating to internal-external control and to level of achievement were considered to be too inconsistent for hypotheses testing. An important point supported in this study was that differences between communities are a major source of variation. (Author/MF)",

This institution aims at education and training of present or future adult educators and youth leaders. Course participants, who are between 18 and 26 years of age, are instructed by seven trained artists. Evaluation was attempted through a series of measures of attitude change, to determine the effect of three short courses and one semester-length course in introducing a positive approach towards a progressive type of art education. A Thurstone- and Likert-type rating scale were used, as well as a 20 item multiple choice  test.

        "description":"Although motives vary, most VISTA Volunteers bring with them a service orientation and a genuine desire to work with people. But few enter with any prior experience in the social welfare field or any clear picture of the particular nature of the helping role. The majority of Volunteers are at a turning point in their development as they leave the student culture and move out into the adult world of work. It is not surprising therefore that the VISTA experience should have profound effects on them personally and on their career aspirations. This research project studies a group of VISTA Volunteers who worked among the urban poor from 1966 to 1968, analyzing aspects of their adjustment to agency, job, and life in the neighborhood with the poor. This report discusses the impact of  VISTA service on career choices. The findings indicate that one year of VISTA service acts to clarify goals, narrow vocational choices, and transform a generalized interest in service into specific commitment to the human service professions, particularly social work and education.

The volunteers were found to be individuals committed to the democratic process and liberal in their economic and political thinking. At the end of training, they were still committed to the democratic process and even more liberal, but they had begun to raise questions about the potency of the group and particularly of the individual in social action. They remained highly connected with society, but had some doubts about the operation of its political and economic systems; and their ability to accept persons different from themselves was enhanced. There was no reversal in attitudes after four months on the job,  although they were slightly less optimistic about group potency in social action. Comparisons were noted with the attitudes of &quot;deselected&quot; volunteers (those dropped during the training program). (For other reports, see AC 002 352, AC 006 639, and AC 006 641.) (MF)",

Normal social services were offered, together with such special services as prevocational evaluation and adjustment facility and intensive casework. Results showed that successful employment is obtained in about 50% of the cases (well above the national average) in the San Antonio Center, and that all clients have benefited to some extent. The research phase sought reasons for this success, including human factors indicative of rehabilitation success  or failure. Assessments were made of over 50 variables and 250 work attitude items for each client. Significant predictive factors were found, and several models were set forth. Through cooperation between the Texas Department of Welfare and the State Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, the program was eventually extended to Amarillo, Dallas, and El Paso.

Dropouts also tended to have fewer children, to be high school graduates, and to have been employed in unskilled jobs or unemployed before joining the program. Illness, family or legal problems,  unmet needs in the work or educational situation, and problems of recruitment and placement were among the chief reasons expressed for dropping out.

With little awareness of the employment actually available and scant experience with established procedures for finding a job, many of these young people  may remain outside the work-force.

        "description":"This study sought to formulate a foundation for a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) adult education program in \"Black Identity.\" Adult educators may play a unique role in the program, serving as a bridge between the black community and the larger American society. The Danish folk schools and the Opportunities Industrialization Center in Philadelphia were reviewed, as was much literature on black people. In essence, it was revealed that the effects of life in the United States have taken their toll on blacks, their families, and their institutions. Black people cannot depend on the educational system for guidance because it is inferior and trains them to be white. Blacks have coped with their environment by becoming either acculturated or superficially adapted. Accordingly, CORE  has designed a program rooted in the concept of Black Power, with content on policies, economics, self-image, leadership, Federal law enforcement, and consumer education. It was suggested that educators make a careful survey of the school, learners, and the community, and that a workshop be organized for teacher preparation.

The sample consisted of ten average young graduates in training conscious firms in several fields, and eight senior officers of similar (but not the same) firms. A loosely structured, distant dialogue was encouraged between the two groups by means of a slightly delayed mutual feedback of views and comments. With the aim of improving the match between higher education and the working world, numerous implications were developed for counseling  of graduates (especially the importance of interpersonal skills), for the role of colleges of advanced education, and for training and development within companies. Suggestions for further study were also offered. (The document includes a list of cooperating organizations, and guidelines for selecting middle managers.) (LY)",

The surface and deep structures are related by a sequence of syntactic rules; the author maintains that some constituencies have to be deleted from the deep structure in order to derive the surface structure in Mandarin. These deletions are the subject of the paper, and are also relevant to the general theory of language development. Here, a sector of Mandarin Chinese grammar is examined in order to determine what  kinds of relationships exist between the deep and surface structures and how these relationships relate to language universals. The discussion is substantiated with extensive examples. (FB)",

The responses of native speakers were analyzed both in the production and in the recognition of 68 pairs of potentially ambiguous sentences. Special care was taken to duplicate spontaneous language behavior by providing contextual clues for the identification of the constructions by the recording as well as by the listening informants. The statistical analysis of the performance of the speakers and the listeners showed varying degrees of positive correlation between syntactic type and prosodic feature pattern, depending on the syntactic constructions involved. A closer examination of the phonetic,  grammatical, and semantic nature of the tasks which the informants faced as well as the differences between the performance of speakers and listeners in the several categories suggested that some prosodic features have a demarcative function inherently, while others only incidentally, the latter being the manifestations of rules whose domains coincide with certain syntactic boundaries.

Most data collection must still be left in the hands of human readers, though editing of the data may be carried on with the use of on-line devices in which man interacts with machine. The use of the computer in the final stages of producing a dictionary, however, may yield important results in speeding production and in making available a reservoir of data for other purposes.

Because the term \"scientific concept\" is ambiguous, the author suggests five distinct definitions--four groups of \"generalizing concepts\" and one group of \"scientific concepts.\" While the generalizing concepts form part of the general education of most young people who reach the secondary level, the scientific concepts are specific and peculiar to various branches of science. It is important that the complexity of concepts presented at each stage not go beyond the capacity of the individual student. The same is true for language study; the  problem is that many languages do not contain equivalents of the verbalizations of scientific concepts, so when scientific concepts are being learned, there could exist a certain \"conceptual distance\" between the two languages. The author suggests that language teaching emphasize detailed observation rather than subjective response. (FB)",

Most studies of textual problems, he points out, either have failed to use full mathematical models or have been reckless with the inherent limits of these techniques. Enumeration of linguistic traits is very common to literary analysis, and discussions of genre and text style based on linguistic data can be very informative. There are, however, serious dangers to be considered in the choice and size of text samples, and oversimplification of qualitative features should be avoided. He suggests that the most successful studies of this type involve a consideration of syllable and word structure rather than frequency of a literary device.  In the text of this paper, the author examines various treatises on language usage in literary works, and comments on their value. His discussion of the applicability of mathematical formulas to literary analysis is quite technical. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (FB)",

The author considers the process of language acquisition (&quot;the central business of growing up and of becoming a useful member of society&quot;) and the role that both formal and informal education play in it. The author finds the area at which language and education intersect very important, because it is at this point that the child learns special uses of English such as reading and writing and the use of the &quot;standard&quot; forms of his language. This area is especially important for those students whose native language is not English, but it was only with the passing of the Bilingual Education Act that the special needs of such students were recognized. The  TESOL organization, although instrumental in getting teachers involved in dealing with the problems of non-native speakers, does not really reach enough people. Local affiliates of TESOL could, however, perform the necessary function of &quot;getting experts, teachers, and community...together to talk about and work out strategies to handle their problems.&quot; The programs of the New Mexico Association for TESOL and Bilingual Education, of which the author is president, are discussed in order to illustrate the role which local affiliates can play in making bilingual education programs more effective.

For each test there are four levels of participation; zero, limited, extended, and complete. The test designer should create a situation which will encourage the subject to give maximum expression, because his language in the test is a representative sample of what he can produce in a real situation. This also enables the corrector to give a more accurate evaluation of the student's language ability. The most effective oral test includes an interview and a discussion section to permit the most extensive use of the language.

        "description":"This paper presents evidence from Philippine languages which suggests a number of modifications in the theory of case grammar. Philippine languages and adjacent related languages mark the case relationship between the verb and one noun phrase in the sentence by a particle on the noun phrase and an affix on the verb, a phenomenon which in recent studies has been called &quot;focus.&quot; In &quot;The Case for Case&quot; (ED 019 631) Fillmore, working with Maranao, a Philippine language, incorporates focusing into his general theory of case grammar. The purpose of the present paper is to examine the Philippine situation more closely, since the author considers that what has been written on it from the case grammar point of view usually considers only part of the evidence. Examples used here are drawn  largely from Tagalog, Bikol and Waray. In the first sets of examples, Fillmore's underlying case preposition is intuitively clear with some modification, and it is easy to go from there to the correct surface focus. After examining these examples, the author considers a class which suggests that the grammar should account for another underlying case: the associative. (Author/FWB)",

The author maintains that despite prodigious evidence to the contrary, \"there are still too many teachers who either do not listen or cannot listen to and accommodate in their schemes even objective straightforward information about language.\" The investigator recorded four 4th grade boys reading a 40-word passage with a difficulty range on a third grade level. The boys represented four different levels of reading ability, two different levels of socioeconomic background, and two different ethnic groups. After the tapes were made, 36 teachers in a first level graduate reading course were asked to rate the reading performance of \"some 4th grade boys.\" Scrambled and  inaccurate information about the socioeconomic or ethnic background of the boys was given to the subjects, to check the influence of labeling. Results indicated that the labeling had little or no effect, because the ratings of the 36 subjects were highly consistent and reasonably accurate about the reading ability of the boys. Full details of the study and sample rating sheets are included. (FB)",

He explains briefly the linguistic structure of the Creole dialects or Pidgin English that the children speak, and the relationship of it to British English. He points out that it would be better for teachers  of English to avoid trying to suppress the \"bad talk\" of the children (that is, the Creole vernacular), and to emphasize instead the positive values of learning a socially dominant language.

It is the center of attention, not as an object of interest to the specialist in language, but as the central feature in the complex sociolinguistic and psycholinguistic system that makes the deaf person part of general American culture and at the same time part of a special group. To see sign language in this way the author first examines the ways language may be presented to the eye instead of to the ear and points out the contrasts and parallels between speech and sign language. He then considers the relation of sign language to the education of the deaf in the light of bilingualism. Finally, he looks at steps that concerned teachers can take to apply research of their own of the most practical  kind. The author states that sign language cannot be learned as a living, working language from these pages but hopes that teachers and educators reading them may find a new understanding of what this language is like, of how it relates to English, and of its importance in the intellectual development of the deaf child.

The paper focuses on errors in learning English which do not derive from transfers from another language, and which cannot be predicted from contrastive analysis. These are intralingual and developmental errors; they reflect the learner's competence at a particular stage and illustrate some of the general characteristics of language acquisition. To best investigate and distinguish among interlanguage, intralingual, and developmental errors, the author studied speakers of varied languages; the diverse cross-section reduced greatly the possibility of mistaking intralingual errors for language interference. He concludes  that an analysis of errors should lead to an examination of teaching materials and the underlying language learning assumptions.

They are: (1) the mechanisms by which the speakers of various dialects of a single language--dialects which were often mutually unintelligible in Europe--make themselves understood in the new situation; (2) the compilation of glossaries recording the lexical &quot;adjustments&quot; brought about by a socio-physical environment ranging from somewhat different to much different from that of Europe; and (3) idiolectal versus communal effects of wholesale bilingualism over large areas. The author maintains that a process similar to the creolization of a pidgin or contact language  takes place in interdialectal situations involving the immigrant generation as opposed to succeeding generations. He discusses the use of theory oriented (rather than data oriented) elicitation procedures and questionnaires for both phonology and syntax in the light of recent theories of rule reordering and rule additions in areal linguistics.

Among the quantitative aspects is included an estimate of the size of the community. As most of the user community belongs to at least one professional society which has language science or some subfield thereof as its primary focus, the memberships of such societies is used as one indicator of the approximate size of the whole community. A preliminary list of these societies, however, is not equal to the number of  individuals who belong to the societies, for many belong to more than one society. To determine the extent of the overlap among such societies, membership lists of seven societies were compared, five by computer and two visually. The overlap, much smaller than expected, was 10% to 23%. On the basis of the study the size of the language sciences community was revised from 175,000 to 200,000. An appendix by Carl M.

        "description":"The augmented transition network described in this report was developed in the course of work in semantic interpretation in the context of a computer system which answers English questions. In order to provide mechanical input for the semantic interpreter, a parsing program based on the notion of a \"recursive transition network grammar\" was developed. The form of presentation of rules made possible by this grammar is called a \"recursive transition network,\" the augmented version of which is presented here. The parsing system has proved to be an extremely powerful system capable of performing the equivalent of transformational analysis in little more time than that customarily required for context free analysis alone. The system is also convenient for the designer of the grammar  and facilitates experiments with various types of structural representations and various parsing strategies. This report, the first of several, presents a discussion of the augmented transition network as a grammar model, including a number of theoretical results concerning the efficiency of the model for parsing.

Positing an interlinguistic substratum of semantic particles of several different types (e.g. substantive, attributive, developmental, relational), a method is illustrated which makes it possible to map the meaning of activity words in context; the resulting mappings, on the one hand, incorporate much of what, hitherto, has been considered \"pragmatics,\" and on the other, they furnish an exact definition of the semantic \"deep structure\" underlying the grammatical surface structure of a phrase or sentence. The mappings are here used to demonstrate semantic similarities and discrepancies between an English  verb and the German verbs which are required for its translation in various contexts.

        "description":"Interpersonal dynamics play a very important role when two people get together to discuss one's problems. The relationship which is established is influenced just as much by the intrapsychic workings of the counselor as by those of the student. The latter comes for help; the former tries to provide it. This is a laudable ambition, but also one which is laden with many potential pitfalls, such as feeling oracular or omniscient, or knowing all the answers. It is also easy to withdraw when working with resistant students. Much of this can apply to the classroom teacher who must deal with many sets of personality dynamics at one time. For this reason, one can think of the teacher as a \"learning therapist\". In an optimal situation, the learning therapist educates the child in a  psychological environment that is most conducive to developing the maximum potentialities inherent in the child. Ultimately, the counselor or learning therapist must recognize his own limitations and shortcomings. If he remains alerted to his own dynamics in relationship to those of the student, they will not impair his working with the student, but rather represent a potentially significant influence on what is achieved in the counseling or teaching situation.

Rather than banish the old clinical model, a new model \"Clinical Restorative\" model is proposed. This model takes advantage of the knowledge and desirable features of the old model but also incorporates new knowledge and direction. This model would allow the psychologist in the schools to work with those students not reached through classroom consultation or through school wide or community wide intervention programs. The psychologist would act as a direct agent of behavior change rather than a consultant. An emphasis is placed on restoration implying treatment and/or  remediation and in any event a change in behavior. A single treatment method or theoretical orientation is not presumed.

Several points are made concerning misuse: 1) The Occupational Outlook Handbook needs to be read and interpreted rather than just handed out; 2) too much material is outdated; 3) many materials are biased and need to be replaced; 4) counselors should read all material before passing it out; 5) career conference days need revision so students can attend more meetings; 6) use alumni and students for current job information; 7) the two-week unit on occupations taught by a disinterested person is a great source of misinformation; and 8) a course in occupations taught by a counselor can be made very worthwhile. Some activities which can achieve positive results are to: 1) make an annual follow-up study of  dropouts and graduates to evaluate previous guidance, and 2) arrange plant tours where alumni work. An outline of a minimum program of occupational information for a high school or college is included. (KJ)",

The first section describes the methodological research and the most recent version of the attitude toward mental illness scale. A total of six new types of attitude items were generated from Guttman facet-design principles and were hypothesized to have specific ordered relationships with six types of items from which simplex approximations had already been generated. Kaiser's recently proposed index was used to evaluate simplex approximations generated from randomly phrased and randomly ordered attitude items within a new hypothesized system. An original systematic extension and evaluation of Guttman facet-design principles  indicated the usefulness of those principles and suggested a theory underlying the observed relationship among varying perceptions of self, of others, of values, of feelings, and of acts. The scale of the Attitude Behavior Scale-Emotionally Disturbed Persons was revised and is in experimental form. The second section of the paper briefly summarizes research in three areas: 1) attitudes toward mental retardation; 2) attitudes toward racial interaction; and 3) attitudes toward mental illness and/or emotional disturbance.

Subjects were provided with various experiences and the effects of these procedures on concept learning were observed. Lower and middle class children were compared under a variety of experimental conditions. Results indicate that compared to middle class children, lower class children are deficient in both discrimination learning and concept identification. Results also indicate that lower class children are responsive to a variety of procedures. Apparently, certain conceptual deficits of lower class children can be  eliminated through the provision of training in discrimination learning. Thus the deficit is not a basic deficit in the capacity to learn or abstract. With preliminary training, the child can solve these problems with the same degree of efficiency as characterized the original performance of his middle class counterpart. (KJ)",

This objective can be approached by teaching the student how to become aware of himself as a \"human system\" in terms of \"system logic\". For the Bartlesville System (Total Guidance Information Support System) is proposed that game models be constructed to teach systems logic and concepts. By providing the student with a chance to experience concepts of importance in the economic world, the student has an opportunity to experience how his own personality might react. The  gaming approach emphasizes the responsibility of the individual in constructing his personal value and moral system in relationship to his environment. The game development process is discussed.

This model of treatment is based on the premise that the disturbed adolescent is the symptom bearer for both marital and family pathology. Another important theory underlying the treatment modality is that every family plays out a theme and subthemes that characterize its style of operation. Each family member's role is an enactment of an aspect of the major and minor themes. Focus on the adolescent's behavior and idiosyncracies by the family serves to hide the marital and family pathology. Only when the family has made some strides in defocusing their attention from the adolescent and is able to begin dealing with the hitherto denied  pathology in the family is the recommendation of group therapy for the adolescent made. The fact that the family's therapist is one or the other of the two group co-therapists facilitates the defocusing process. This also assures a continuity of approach. (Author/KJ)",

This paper attempts to present a level of analysis which is sufficiently generic so as to discern basic trends and issues but at the same time descriptively specific, so as to be useful in facing practical issues and consequences. Some of the primary causes are: 1) dissatisfaction with the \"system\"; 2) the quest for identity. Among the dissenters are: 1) the frustrated advantaged youth who have been given too much; and 2) middle-class students who hope to improve things and have become frustrated in their attempts. The Informed counselors have begun to prepare their schools and students for a world of unease by: 1) listening carefully, 2) communicating  the real issues; 3) being a sounding board, and 4) maintaining contact with students. When over demonstration seems imminent, a counselor can: 1) establish trust on both sides; 2) define the problem or need; and 3) cause each side to sharpen their definition of goals and objectives. Those schools which develop an internal base of security and competence so as to maintain a quality of empathy and openness to the real needs of students will probably remain open. (KJ)",

The first facet consisted of the organization of a series of activities to reduce the social distance between patients and members of the community, and the development of a foster home program. The second facet was the establishment of a resocialization and remotivation program to ready patients for community placement. Continuing medical, psychiatric, and social services were provided to insure the maintenance of community cooperation and maintenance of the patient at the appropriate level of functioning. The town of New Haven,  Missouri, was developed into a foster community and presently seventeen patients are in the program. Results thus far demonstrate that: (1) a community can be induced to sponsor such a program, (2) enlightened community attitudes follow from direct exposure to patients, (3) families offer homes and support independent living arrangements in the town, and (4) a patient's condition improves further with a planned resocialization and remotivation program.

The development of this approach to psychotherapy represents a gradual evolution in clinical practices from a one-to-one interaction to a multi-person, multi-relational interaction. It also represents the development of a human psychology that has moved from individualistic to social psychology. The techniques of social system psychotherapy are cast in a new model termed the \"open\" model of treatment in contrast to the \"closed\" conventional treatment model. In the one-to-one \"closed\" model the assumption is that psychotherapy will effect changes in the individual to enable him to behave differently in his social fields and social networks. The open model assumes that human is significantly determined by  characteristics of the social field and therapy is thus achieved via change in the social system. The two models are not competitive however, but complementary. The development of a social system psychotherapy provides a theoretical and technical base for application to many areas of mental health intervention. (Author/RSM)",

Although group methods are being used in each of the ten defined areas of CMHC they are not a generalized modality of treatment. The farther one moves from the traditional mental health definition of patient populations and professional roles, the less group methods are used. The most important implication of this discussion for AGPA is to suggest the broadening scope of the mental health therapeutic systems. The group  psychotherapy movement and AGPA grew out of a larger social and therapeutic movement. Thus to focus exclusively on group psychotherapy per the AGPA definition may unnecessarily constrict the contributions AGPA can make to both the therapeutic and community mental health fields.

The therapist assumes responsibility for prescribing the treatment and implementing it effectively and safely.

The third paper is a goal-oriented treatment model which  outlines a framework of procedures and participation modes. The treatment process is divided into three sessions. The initial sessions are used to vent feelings, structure treatment, and form a cohesive group. The tactics employed during the central sessions are: (1) to have each patient give an account of himself, and a description of his activities of the previous week, and (2) to have the group closely examine one patient. The final sessions are geared toward synthesis and termination. Also included is a discussion of the treatment model.

        "description":"The study was conducted to analyze the role of the elementary school guidance counselor and explore counselors', teachers', and principals' expectations of this role. Involved were 35 schools where the counselor, principal and two randomly selected teachers responded to a Role Expectation Questionnaire and individual interviews. The findings include areas of agreement and disagreement in regard to the counselor's role. A short review of the literature is given. Several implications for personnel in the field are presented. The elementary school principal must realize that conflicting opinions regarding the functions of the counselor exist and that an examination of the principal's expectation of the guidance program, an explanation of the counselor's role to the staff and the use  of a role expectation questionnaire to evaluate the existing guidance program are helpful. The suggestions for the elementary school counselor are the elimination of: conflicting expectations of their functions, analysis of specific functions, review of a role expectation questionnaire and discussion of the questionnaire and the setting up of workshops in sensitivity training for counselors. Also indicated is the need on the part of the elementary school teacher to understand and accept the functions of the counselor. (Author/MC)",

Students' legitimate demands need to be responded to. This calls for a searching look at what the school's job is and the development of a positive course of action to give leadership to the new student voice. A total of three suggestions are given. First, there is a need for a better student information system for monitoring student life and incorporating student information in school decisions. Secondly, there is a need for student development emphasis within the schools. This could be achieved through: (1) student centers, (2) teacher resources, (3) student resources, (4) counselor resources, and (5)  black-white relations. Lastly, there is a need for massive reform in the curriculum. Changes should include: (1) learning resource centers, (2) more and different offerings, particularly in vocational areas and work study programs, and (3) forums on contemporary issues. (KJ)",

The purpose of this paper is to point out to counselors some of the job opportunities available in the fields of conservation and recreation. The variety of programs directed to improving the condition of man, offer many opportunities to those who wish to become involved professionally in a direct manner. Advantages of careers in conservation and outdoor recreation include: (1) helping to solve challenging natural resource problems, (2) enjoyment of ones work in a profession where dedication is standard equipment, (3) working with people, and (4) seeing some accomplishment in making the world a better place to live. Disadvantages include: (1) lower pay, (2) necessity of passing the civil service  examination, and (3) the need for some specialized education. The need for people as resource or conservation aides is great. Possibilities for advancement are good. A list of field work for aides is included. Similarly there is a need for outdoor recreation aides. Much study and effort is being made to incorporate subprofessionals into these fields as the need for them is growing quickly. (KJ)",

The test has been given to 1,607 children in the United States and 668 children in grades one, two, and four in Hawaii. Item difficulty indices and item test correlation coefficients have been studied, and data for each group and for various combinations of groups have been factor analyzed. Results of the first attempts to teach motivation to preschool children are regarded as  sufficiently promising to warrant intensive efforts. Plans for extending this work to children both younger and older than preschoolers are being pursued. Follow-up of the groups involved in the study is also projected. (author/KJ)",

The same data was collected from 12,345 male two-year college freshmen at 66 institutions in 1968. From the correlation matrix of the six VPI scale scores given in Holland, a principal components analysis was performed. Through occupational configuration, a two dimensional map was set up showing the relationship of occupations to each other on the basis of VPI. Holland's classification differs from configural analysis because of the latter use of standardized scores. Several concepts can be operationalized through the use of configuration, such as: (1) job similarity, (2) congruence of an individual and occupation, (3) stability of  occupational choice and (4) differentiation of interests. Other potential uses of spatial configuration are discussed in relation to research questions. (KJ)",

Included among the perceptions were: reason for school, role as a rule obeyer, role as a teacher pleaser and role as an achiever. The results indicate that students generally like their school, believe the rules of their class room are just about right, are willing to obey them, and believe they are doing about as well as other students in their classroom. The report concludes that students believe their classmates would rather play than work, that school is important to their future, and that school is teaching them to prepare for a job or teaching them things they need to know when they grow up. The students perceive themselves primarily as  rule obeyers and teacher pleasers. Also suggested is the fact that about a third of the students are dissatisfied with school, would prefer not to attend school, are not aware of their teacher's evaluation of their school work, and feel that their achievement is less than satisfactory. The data also reveals great differences in student perceptions from school to school. (author/MC)",

Three groups, each consisting of 16 three-year-old children, were involved in a nine month program. The first group of children, enrolled in a daily three hour bilingual preschool program, were exposed to sequenced instructional activities. Five training areas were stressed: (1) visual skills, (2) auditory skills, (3) motor skills, (4) English language skills, and (5) problem solving and reasoning skills. The parents of children enrolled in the second group met regularly with staff members to focus on health, nutrition and education of the children. The goal was to raise the intellectual performance of the children through an indirect approach designed to affect the behavior  of the parents. The third session of children attended classes for ten hours per day at a day care center where they could develop at their own rate. The programs were evaluated by: (1) a non-verbal I.Q. test, and (2) a measure of the child's receptive language functioning. Findings reveal that children who score below national middle class norms when tested on standardized instruments requiring language, test at about national norms on standardized instruments which do not require the use of language. Children enrolled in the first group program showed significant gains in I.Q., over the comparison groups. (Author/MC)",

A scale (Pictorial Self-Concept Scale), was constructed from children's statements about themselves. This scale was administered to kindergarten through fourth grade subjects. Each child separated 50 cartoon picture cards into three piles depending on whether the specific child in the cartoon is like him, not like him, or sometimes like him. Scoring was based on placement of the card and the weighted card value. A panel of psychologists and human development specialists ranked the cards according to importance to a child's self-concept on a continuum from positive to negative. Two validity hypothesis were tested: (1) a significant relationship exists between  scores on the pictorial self-concept scale and the Piers and Harris self-concept measure, and (2) scores for subjects judged by principals and teachers as having positive self-concepts will be different from those judged by principals and teachers as having negative self-concepts. The constructed scale has been successfully used in five other research projects. (author/MC)",

An instrument was developed to measure teachers' perception of achieved status of the principal. 27 schools which had principals designated as having high, moderate and low achieved status,  participated in the study. Each school had an experimental group consisting of the principal and three randomly selected teachers. These 27 groups were each allotted 40 minutes to work on a problem and group productivity was measured in both analytical and synthesis phases of problem solving.

The subjects in the control group learned three lists of three stimulus response pairs. The stimuli consisted of eight cards, five of which were black outlined drawings of either a car, boat, tree, dog or cat, and three had either blue, yellow, or red squares. Two of the pairs were mediated, the third was non-mediated. The experimental group learned the first two lists, then prior to learning the third list, they repeated the B term continually for 30 seconds. A  two by three analysis of variation performed on the number of errors to criterion on list three, revealed a significant interaction of the between groups factor (experimental or control) and the within stimulus factor. No other terms reached significance. (author/MC)",

Subjects were 131 (66 boys and 65 girls) white fourth grade students from a suburban middle class school. The Piers-Harris self-concept measure was administered to all students. The Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Questionnaire and the Minnesota Tests of Creative Thinking were each given to half the students. Students were asked to rank order nine statements on a continuum of \"good to say to myself while doing schoolwork\". A spelling test was administered in conjunction with value statements chosen specifically for the analysis. The procedures provided the following scores: self-concept, locus of control,  verbal fluency, statements chosen as good to say to oneself and statements chosen after task. The results show positive relationships between (1) self-concept and children's belief that they are responsible for their academic success, (2) self-concept and verbal fluency, (3) self-concept and positiveness of designated as \"good to say to myself while doing schoolwork\", and (4) self-concept and positiveness of self-divided statements chosed to say after completion of an academic task.

The second function of DAP results is to provide detailed profiles of those abilities which a student must cultivate in order to reasonably expect attainment of a particular goal. If the student decides to continue pursuit of the goal based on his knowledge in these two areas, an individualized Program of Studies (POS) is generated for him to monitor the educational experiences which he will receive during the school year. The content and extent of this POS are  determined in part by empirically obtained relationships between certain instructional elements and improved ability to perform on components important to the student's goal. Ability testing in Project Plan should enable the student to evaluate himself in light of well recognized goals and goal requirements and to recommend to him a Program of Studies most likely to facilitate attainment of the goals he selects.

The basic question then becomes, what can this candidate do, at a given time, under given circumstances. Given the definition of the circumstances, and the candidate's performance, the necessary evaluation of competence can be made. The University of Illinois College of Medicine has developed the \"Minimum Passing Level\" (MPL), which is a score point which reflects the minimum level of performance a student must achieve to progress at the normal rate or to be certified as eligible for the degree Doctor of Medicine. Both multiple choice examinations and simulated problems in patient management are used. A performance level  must be established by examiners for each item seperately. The options are weighted on each item and given a weight from high negative to high positive. After the essential positive options and the not allowable negative options have been identified, the option scores are summed to determine the minimum required passing level. Disadvantages include: (1) subjective judgements, and (2) confusion regarding results and methods. (author/KJ)",

Comparison of several groups in terms of mean differences or average gains, tells little about change in individual performance. Experimental-longitudinal projects that involve a small number, several time extended treatments that focus on continuously monitoring the performance of each subject on a variety of criterion variables are desirable since they increase the likelihood of answering aptitude x-treatment interaction questions. A greater variety of research strategies must be utilized to create and  empirically evaluate specific treatments for particular clients-especially those which combine the rigor of the experiment, the relevance of the intra-individual replication study, and the richness of the longitudinal project.

The second file has the person's name and address and the same arbitrary number. The former file is accessible to members of the research staff, the latter is locked in a vault. The \"Link\" system elaborates on the above scheme by removing identification numbers from the name and  address file and substituting another unrelated number. A third file was then created, which contained only the two numbers. This file then links the subjects identity with his answers to questions. The link file is then deposited at a computer facility located in a foreign country. This file is released to no one. Follow-up data is then collected again from the same students, with the person's number used for identification. This information is then sent to the foreign center, where the second number is replaced by the first. The data is then merged with previous data for longitudinal research. (KJ)",

Teachers in these schools responded to 14 questions about their students. Schools were divided into two groups-above and below the mean on the score of the 14 items. Two way analyses of variance (Teacher Attitudes by School Characteristics) were then carried out on each of seven dependent measures of the Stanford Achievement Tests. The main effect of teacher attitudes was not significant for each of the dependent measures. There was some significant difference, however, in poor black schools depending on teacher attitudes. The second objective of the study was to determine the relationship between teachers'  attitudes toward students and students' attitudes toward school. The main effect of teacher attitude was significant for only one dimension of student attitudes, that of community support of and parental involvement in the schools. Teacher attitude and interaction effects observed seem not to be due to teacher attitudes, but to socioeconomic differences between the schools. (KJ)",

Subjects were 180 first grade pupils presented with nonsense shapes serving as the stimuli. The RW condition yielded significantly better performance than the other feedback conditions, and in addition, NW resulted in a faster rate of learning than RN. The findings have implications for programmed learning regarding the merits of right and wrong feedback signals.

It summarizes what is known about classroom anxiety and how teachers can reduce this anxiety and its detrimental effects. This is a nontechnical literature review designed to give advice to practitioners. The paper describes kinds of anxiety and outlines three different methods of coping with it: (1) altering the situation, (2) altering the students' emotional responses to anxiety provoking situations, and (3) strengthening the cognitive processes that are adversely affected by anxiety. Methods of diagnosing anxiety and applying treatments are specified. (Author)",

Each problem was characterized according to its logical structure and language which corresponded to a pictorial presentation, its ordinary verbal language, and its abstract symbols. Each structure was presented in each of the three languages. Evaluation of subject performance was made using problem solving tactics. Results were treated by profile analysis. Subjects were classified by age, I.Q. levels and grade point averages. Contrasts examined on the basis of these classifications indicate that there is a differentiation between structures that increases with age. A general conclusion is that it is risky to rely exclusively on the final answer to a problem in appraising  thinking ability, and that the differentiation between logical structures and languages is basic.

They represented all geographical areas--inner-city, suburban, and rural--and were located in communities with populations from under 2,000 to more than a million. The first three chapters of this report identify the project team's beliefs concerning contemporary educational challenges, goals for civic education, and methods for approaching these goals. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 include descriptions of school practices, arbitrarily grouped  according to the citizenship goals they most strongly exemplify. Chapters 7 through 11 discuss administrative arrangements and other factors that facilitate civic education. Finally, chapter 12 presents a restatement of civic education ideals in the light of the practices observed in the schools. (MF)",

Group size, facilities, and teaching roles are considered in the overall picture of flexible-modular scheduling. Large group instruction can conserve space, teachers, and repetitious presentations of important concepts. The role of the teacher in this teaching mode is directive. In small group instruction where discussion and task orientations prevail, a teacher becomes more participatory than directive. Laboratory instruction allows further individualization because the student is permitted to work independently. Time configurations can be planned to correspond to the instructional modes used in  attaining the course objectives. Complexity in the scheduling process occurs when many time patterns are used, but this can be alleviated with less structured time in the curriculum. Flexible-modular scheduling is recommended to continuously improve curriculum and instruction and to optimize learning opportunities for students in the total educational system. (LN)",

The local property tax, which is the primary underwriter of the local school system, of local general government, and of half the nation's $10 billion public welfare bill, is outmoded. State aid for local fiscal needs has not kept pace with the growth in local expenditures. It is recommended that the Federal Government assume full financial responsibility for the public assistance function. States, in turn, should become the prime financial source for elementary and secondary education costs. In health and hospital services, States should base distribution of funds on the ability of localities to provide standardized  services. Funds for highways, mass transit, and urban development should be distributed to achieve a more equitable balance between highway and mass transit expenditures. These and other recommendations will provide a more equitable tax base to provide the quality public services for all States. [Tables may be of poor quality when reproduced due to fine print.] (LN)",

Background material is presented covering the history of pressure groups in the U.S., the social structure in which pressure groups must operate, and the role of pressure groups in the decision-making process. The literature pertinent to group effectiveness is reviewed and eight variables that may have a bearing on effectiveness are discussed and presented as hypotheses. A questionnaire interview schedule was developed and completed interviews were obtained from 56 pressure group leaders (84% of the sample) and 42 educational personnel (91% of the sample). Four variables pertinent to pressure group effectiveness showed significant  results: 1) the critical situation, 2) prestige, 3) channels of communication, and 4) strategy. The most significant variable was the groups' strategy since there was a strong relationship between the strategy a pressure group employed and its ability to influence educational policy.

After six conferences, a cooperative program was drawn up outlining some ideas for further study by a proposed research consortium from the six institutions. Some of the major ideas that merited further study by this consortium included developing a computer network, sharing faculty resources, designing a remedial program to allow for a consistent group of college-bound students, upgrading the preparation of high school teachers, and improving the articulation between 2- and 4-year colleges.  Unfortunately, the cancellation of funds for sustaining some of the proposed programs has seriously hampered further development. (LN)",

Both these emphases put evaluation and the evaluator in the role of reformer. In recent years a more neutral scientific emphasis has been emerging. An analysis of different evaluation models indicates that the standard experimental design model is usally applicable if the unit to be evaluated is small in size, limited in scope, and short in time. When the unit to be  evaluated is large, complex, and of long duration, a different model is necessary--one that considers a broad range of social and educational consequences, is not limited to an appraisal of program objectives, considers a variety of contextual variables, and requires complex multivariate methods of data analysis. For these larger problems, the evaluator's role is that of a neutral social scientist, and the intended result of evaluation is the provision of more complex bases for informed judgment.

Research was conducted through extended personal interviews and a series of seminars on topics relevant to secondary education. Individually, the principals emerged as embattled administrators. Collectively, principals appeared to be holding the line against encroachments on their authority within the schools and defending the system, their careers, and themselves from outer attack. The study concludes that education might be best served by separating the principals' role into two components--that of administrator of the school as a business-like organization and that of head teacher of the school as an educational enterprise.  Qualifications for the latter would stress training in experimental educational techniques and in the political and empathetic skills needed to actively promote the schools' interests politically through working directly with parents and other interested groups.

Organizational development, not personal change, was the study's goal. Although the emotional reactions of faculty members were considered in the design, the intervention concentrated on organizational roles and norms and their interrelationships. The researchers questioned whether a faculty could improve its organizational functioning--using group training in communication and problem solving--while conducting the normal business of the school. Data from the study indicate that organizational changes occurred in verbally expressed attitudes about the principal and staff meetings, in the kinds of innovations reported, and in the changing  norms of the faculty.

The purpose of this monograph is to allow the researcher to judge the utility of STGPROC and its value for his specific research needs. In the general presentation, no knowledge of computing procedures is assumed. The monograph provides the researcher with a general idea of how STGPROC operates and how it differs from existing programs in the social sciences. The STGPROC system of transcribing data is detailed and ways to utilize the program are explained. The researcher with no programing experience should be  able to explain to a programmer any additional operations that he needs. For those with some programing experience, the main STGPROC program and its existing subroutines are reproduced, along with comment cards, in an appendix. (DE)",

The RPS consisted of 17 subtests of visual motor and auditory motor functions, general motor skills, self awareness, and integrative function; the RRPS, intended for teacher or paraprofessional use, included the same items except optometric ones and ones requiring special equipment. Validation was conducted with 50 regular, 50 educable mentally handicapped, and 50 emotionally disturbed and socially maladjusted elementary school students; cross validation was accomplished with more children from each group. External validity was determined by a behavior rating scale based on correlates of learning disabilities. Variance between scores made  by the regular and the other students was significant (p less than .005). Further findings were as follows: RPS items intercorrelated (for 28 of its 30 items p less than .005); the RPS and RRPS correlated for all three groups (p less than .005); the RPS and the behavior rating scale correlated (p less than .001). Appendixes provide the behavior rating scale and manuals and supplementary data analysis for the RPS and RRPS. (JD)",

Each phone, headset, or modification is described through words and by photographs; advantages and disadvantages are noted. Several factors influencing the choice of telephone equipment (answering in time, access, and family use) are  considered. Evaluation of the patient and the equipment is discussed in regard to the amount of physical function present and the testing and matching of equipment for various disabilities. Choice of telephone, assistive devices, special services for summoning aid, use of the phone for home business, and coin phones for wheelchair users are also mentioned. (RJ)",

        "description":"A study of delinquency, underachievement, and dropout in six school districts considered extent and contributing factors within the school setting. The Nye-Short Self Reporting Delinquency Scale indicated exceptionally high rates for one of seven elementary schools (grades 5 and 6), normal rates for only one of five junior high schools, and normal rates for one or possibly two of the five high schools. Underachievers were identified by classification by grade and sex into IQ groups and grade point averages; approximately one-third of the students were thus rated underachievers. Dropout rates were low at 2 and 3% for two schools, high at 8 and 9% for two more. The Hall-Waldo Inventory of attitudes toward law and toward school and teachers was administered to 6700 students; the  Teachers Situation Reaction Inventory to 76% of the 654 eligible teachers. As a result of the data, one district planned a Title III project to provide personal and group identity and to meet the needs of underachievers. Inventories and forms used are appended; an addendum, with corrected and reprogramed data, is planned. (JD)",

Twelve children in an experimental group compromised a self contained class and were given deficit centered training. The six in the control group were placed with 12 children without problems and given the traditional curriculum without deficit centered training. In the deficit centered program emphasis was placed on sensory stimulation in a carefully planned environment. The experimental group did significantly better on many, but not all of the intellectual, perceptual, and language tests; but data on academic achievement failed to show significant differences. Two factors are noted which might have  contributed to the results: children who develop unevenly may have a distinctive learning pattern and process information differently, and neurological impairment could have a negative effect on academic performance regardless of WISC IQ.

Also the higher the grade level the faster the behavior, and the correlations between academic rates and achievement scores, non-academic rates, and intelligence test scores are all beyond the .005 level of significance.

Detailed questionnaires and visitations were used to obtain the information. The major findings were that learning programs in Minnesota State Institutions are operating at minimum levels in terms of daily support and in numbers of residents served, and that there exists a basic inability to give meaningful learning experiences to most institutionalized persons. Recommendations include broader and more flexible funding, closer involvement of the State Department of Education and local school districts, and the establishment of closer ties between institutional programs and the local educational  agency in administration, supervision, and funding. Descriptions of the existing programs, extensive recommendations for the future, and appendixes presenting findings of data are provided. (JM)",
