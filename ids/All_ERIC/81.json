        "description":"A discussion is presented on the problems and conflicts that arise over the question of admitting children with Human Immunodefiency Virus (HIV) to the school classroom. Legal, educational, and ethical questions are involved, including the applicability of federal statutes regarding the handicapped, the right to confidentiality, public safety, and health education. These issues are addressed through an examination of the literature on education, bioethics, and law. While common law guarantees the right to an education, the state may impose certain restrictions to protect public health. However, federal statutes regarding the handicapped provide HIV-infected children with access to regular classrooms, and privacy and confidentiality are safeguarded by federal statute. Drawing from  commentary from 1981 to the persent, a sound structural basis for curriculum development for education on HIV and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is considered. This includes suggestions for content, program evaluation and an ethical framework for balancing parental rights with public health rights. (JD)",

        "description":"Leaders in mathematics education are calling for a reorganization of the mathematics curriculum around concept development and problem solving. For many elementary teachers, the limitations of their knowledge about mathematics and teaching mathematics constrains their ability to teach conceptually. If prospective elementary teachers are to overcome these limitations, they must have opportunities in their teacher preparation programs to deepen their knowledge about the nature of mathematics, children's mathematics learning, and instructional practices that promote conceptual understanding. This study examines the piloting of a sequence of innovative mathematics courses for undergraduate education majors. These courses emphasize the conceptual foundations of mathematics and  actively engage prospective elementary teachers in making sense of mathematical situations. The main question informing the study is, What is the nature and extent of changes in the knowledge about mathematics, mathematics learning, and mathematics teaching among students as a result of these courses? Results from this study suggest that change in two important areas occurred in student thinking about mathematics as a consequence of this intervention: a change in students' conception of what mathematics is and a change in their perception of what a mathematics class is like and in their knowledge of how mathematics is learned.

A five-factor model of school effectiveness is discussed, which gives the following characteristics: (1) academic goal consensus; (2) safe and orderly climate; (3) strong instructional leadership; (4) high expectations for student achievement; and (5) frequent evaluation of student progress. This model is mainly based on research from the United States. An examination of the Dutch school system and review of studies of school effectiveness in the Netherlands do not support this five-factor model. There was no relation between the characteristics of effectiveness in Anglo-American schools and  student dropout rates. The evaluative potential of a school is one characteristic that appears valid across contexts. It is evident that contextual effects must be taken into account in conducting and analyzing research in school effectiveness. A multiple level of school effectiveness should be the conceptual background of individual studies. One figure illustrates the secondary educational system in the Netherlands, and six tables present data descriptive of Dutch school effectiveness. (SLD)",

This study used simulated data to compare these two statistics, and is based on mixtures of latent binomial distributions, using data generated from five dichotomous manifest variables. Data were generated for a two-class unconstrained model and a three-class constrained model. Data were also generated under three independent variables--sample size and two parameters that define latent class models (conditional response probability and latent class proportion). Parameters were estimated for the generation models and a series of subsumed and subsuming models. Maximum likelihood and Pearson chi-square statistics were derived  for each estimation. Distributions of fit statistics were produced by 1,000 replications. For each distribution of statistics, the overall fit to the appropriate chi-square distribution was assessed. In addition, the mean, variance, and tail weights were examined. The distributions of the statistics varied according to the parameter values of the models and the type of models estimated. When the estimated model accurately reflected the data, the Pearson statistic was generally distributed as a chi-square for both large and small samples, while the maximum likelihood statistic was distributed as a chi-square only at the large sample size. Fourteen tables of supporting statistics are included. (Author/TJH)",

Study subjects included 248 low-track and 582 high-track students in grades 11 and 12 enrolled in two suburban high schools in suburban Ottawa (Canada). Assumptions of invariant SC measurements and structure were tested prior to the analysis of latent mean structures. Twelve self-report SC instruments were used in the study. Findings reveal significant differences in academic, English, and mathematics  SCs only. Inconsistencies in measurement and structure of SC across track were also found. Findings illustrate the possible interplay of compensatory factors in the formation of SC, and indicate that low-ability students place more importance on their social and/or physical competencies, rather than on their academic competencies.

In all, 37 administrators, vice principals, and parents were interviewed. In general, the use of performance appraisal data was low to moderate. The positive nature of communication of appraisal results and the congruence of these results with principals' expectations had moderate positive influences on the use of data in decision making. Also important were decision context variables corresponding  to principals' experiences and knowledge, and the significance of the decision. Motivation for professional growth and attitude toward the appraisal were the most influential factors on learning about performance improvement. Appraisal systems for principals who are expert problem solvers might concentrate on improving aspects of the appraisal itself. Systems for moderately effective principals might be better concerned with decision setting variables that negatively influence use. (SLD)",

Internal construct validity evidence about the nature of writing skills measured by the test was provided. Data used were scores assigned by about 100 trained professional raters on a state-wide competency-based test of writing skills. A total of 3,430 students responded to all four prompts of the writing tests. A sequential hypothesis testing strategy was followed for a one-factor model, a two-factor mode-specific model, and a two-factor occasion-specific model. These were compared to a null model specifying no common factors. Results from these analyses provided evidence about the usefulness of the construct-based  hypotheses for explaining the variability in data from this test. A one-factor model provided a more plausible and parsimonious representation of the data than did the two-factor hypotheses. Evidence in support of a unidimensional interpretation of the scores suggests there may be little practical distinction between narrative and explanatory scores.

The process provides for the flow of information and recommendations from the faculty through administrative ranks to the Chancellor of the District. The EICCD is comprised of three colleges and serves 24 kindergarten-through-grade 12 school districts. The program evaluation process, developed through cooperative effort, consists of two phases. Phase 1 is an annual review, consisting of the annual collection, analysis, and review of discrete program data on 10 elements that are compared year-to-year over a three-year period. These data elements concern enrollment, contact hours, graduation and withdrawal rates, costs, class  size, and success of program leavers and graduates. In Phase 2, all vocational-technical programs are evaluated on a three-year cycle with a sequence determined by the District Instructional Council. Five major components of Phase 2 are: (1) surveys of six target groups; (2) local labor market assessment; (3) faculty self-study; (4) Internal Review Team visit and report; and (5) faculty response. All documents compiled in the evaluation process are made available to college and district administration. All programs have been modified based on evaluation information; a few have been terminated. The decision-making process and use of evaluation results are considered. Examples of program evaluation surveys, labor market assessments, and the faculty self-study report are appended.  (SLD)",

The British Columbia Learning Assessment Program--introduced in 1975 as a way of providing educators, the public, and government with information about student performance--has concentrated on language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. Results reported to each school and district are useful in curriculum evaluation. End-of-course grade 12  examinations were reintroduced in 1983 after an absence of 10 years. Determining the impact of such examinations and assessments is a major question facing the BCME. A second major challenge is how to assess students' higher-order critical thinking skills. The issue of educational standards is closely related to the increased emphasis on monitoring students and system performance. Other issues include the design of tests and assessments and finding better ways to report test results. A true test will be whether the assessment and examination programs will be able to change quickly enough to address the issues that need to be faced. (SLD)",

        "description":"The Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale: Fourth Edition is a conceptually new version of this traditional intelligence scale. The new scale has a solid basis in theory, but there is little evidence that the Binet matches its intended theory. This study was designed to determine whether the Binet corresponds to the theory that guided its construction. First- and higher-order confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using the entire standardization sample (N=3,354) and three age groups from the standardization sample--12-23 years (n=910), 7-11 years (n=960), and 2-6 years (n=1,484)--to determine the extent to which the Binet measures verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, abstract/visual reasoning, short-term memory, crystallized versus fluid intelligence, and general  intelligence. The results generally support the four first-order factors as reflecting the underlying structure of the new Binet. The biggest deviation from the theoretical structure occurred for ages 2-6 years; for this age group, it was difficult to separate memory from reasoning. The hierarchical analyses support the test authors' contention that there is a strong &quot;g&quot; component underlying the Binet, but did not support the second level of the Binet theory (which combines the first-order factors into crystallized versus fluid intelligence). Five tables present sample data, and six figures diagram theoretical relationships among factors. (Author/SLD)",

Both are undesirable properties of a test. Stereotyping and inadequate representation are discussed as they apply to tests. Bias may involve: (1) sex, cultural, ethnic, class, and religious factors; (2) content; (3) language; (4) item structure and format; and (5) test time limits. The sample bias review form was designed to assist in the identification of items that may reflect bias against  designated subgroups of interest.

Training, designed to improve spatial skills, strategic test-taking skills, and analogy solution skills, consisted of seven hour-long sessions, all but one of which were individualized, and included practice tests, task practice, and a computerized spatial game. Experimental and control groups did not differ in scores on pretests. No differences were found for the experimental group on the figural analogy posttest but a significant  effect of training was found for the surface development test, generally considered more difficult.

A series of recommendations focuses on the need to depoliticize OERI and on its leadership  role in bringing together agencies pertaining to education research.

A methodological analysis finds the following problems with these measures: (1) they fail to characterize meaningfully the actual composition of sub-areas; (2) a particular exposure value can describe a wide variety of racial distributions. Hence, large changes in residential distributions need not be reflected in changes in exposure values; and (3) the strong correlation between exposure measures and overall racial composition means that changes in racial composition, in the absence of residential redistribution, necessarily produce changes in the exposure measures. Because of these three problems, the sociological concepts of interracial exposure and  potential for interaction are poorly served by the current exposure measures.

The following factors have contributed to this: (1) decrease in fertility; (2) increase in divorce; (3) increased propensity for women with children to establish independent households; (4) increase in remarriage; and (5) increase in nonmarital births. This paper uses United States Census data to analyze the impact of these major demographic components on the growth in female-headed families from 1950 to 1980. The findings indicate that for white women, the major source of growth has been the increase in the number of formerly married mothers, which results from higher divorce rates and, more recently, lower rates of remarriage. For black women, much of the early  growth in female-headed households was caused by an increase in formerly married mothers, but recent growth has come from declines in marriage and increases in births to never-married women.

        "description":"This paper describes and analyzes the demographic characteristics of the Pre-Mariel Cuban American population living in the United States as presented in the 1980 U.S. Census of the Population. Information is not provided for the Mariel entrants, who began arriving from Cuba on April 21, 1980, because the data were derived from a one-in-a-thousand sample of the total U.S. population as determined on April 1, 1980. The analysis is separated into two divisions. In the first section, the United States is considered as a whole. The nation's residents of Cuban descent (803,226) are compared to those of Mexican (8,740,439), Puerto Rican (2,013,945), and &quot;Other Spanish&quot; (3,051,063) origin, as well as to non-Hispanics. Factors examined include the following: (1) numbers and place of  residence; (2) physiological characteristics; (3) spatial mobility and citizenship; (4) language abilities; (5) labor force characteristics; (6) income patterns; (7) social attributes; and (8) socioeconomic rank. These comparisons provide an understanding of the demographic context in which Cubans are living in the United States. In the second section, the Pre-Mariel Cuban American population is classified and compared according to the following areas of residence: (1) Florida; (2) the combined areas of New Jersey and New York; and (3) the rest of the United States. Statistical data are included on 26 tables and six graphs. A list of 66 endnotes are also included. The appendix includes a discussion of the methodology used in the ranking system. (FMW)",

To cope with the inability to achieve complete freedom, and with the oppressive state created by a lack of liberty, they developed ways to express their feelings about the elusiveness of freedom. The African American vision of liberty was born in the experiences of capture, the &quot;Middle Passage&quot; across the Atlantic, and slavery in the Americas. The creation of the black church was one of the most important efforts to achieve a semblance of freedom and independence. The members of the African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion (A.M.E.Z.) Church have a tradition of taking  leadership roles in the black community that goes back to the African priest-warriors. Preaching and oratory also compensated for proscriptions against teaching slaves to read and write. The many written, sung, and instrumental forms through which African Americans expressed their feelings about liberty include the following: (1) the slave autobiography; (2) oratory on nationhood; (3) the spiritual; (4) the ringshout; and (5) jazz.

The recommendations build on the current system and on reforms already underway. Although the recommendations are fairly comprehensive, they do not cover some areas that need major reform, such as financing public education, the construction of new school facilities, collective bargaining, business-education partnerships, or social services outside the educational system. The proposals are based on a combination of ideas from effective schools now in operation, and from interviews with educators, political leaders, legislative members and staff, community leaders, and concerned  citizens. Summary recommendations, presented to stimulate discussion, include the following: (1) expand and focus schooling; (2) establish accountability based on performance and choice; (3) establish school autonomy, and empower parents, teachers, and principals; (4) modernize instruction; (5) strengthen the teaching profession; and (6) capitalize on diversity.

        "description":"In the period since the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act Blacks have continued to experience severe disadvantages relative to Whites in such areas as family stability, unemployment rates, average income, poverty rates, and dependence on government transfer payment programs. From the diverse statistical indicators of relative status two sharply conflicting interpretations have emerged. One stresses relative improvements and convergence towards a position of parity with Whites. The second stresses the lack of overall progress. This paper reviews national data that summarize recent trends in the labor market performance of Blacks and Hispanic Americans. The following three economic indicators are examined: (1) relative earnings; (2) unemployment rates; and (3) labor force  participation rates. Using data from the Current Population Survey, Black unemployment rates are analyzed in five large metropolitan areas. This analysis explores the effects of regional unemployment developments and tests for upward trend in the Black unemployment rate relative to the rate for Whites. National and regional data on employment trends since 1948 are examined. The following major theories that purport to explain the disparities in the labor market performance of Blacks and Whites are discussed: (1) supply theories; (2) demand theories; and (3) spatial mismatch theories. Areas for future research are identified. Data are presented in 10 tables and figures. A list of references is included. (BJV)",

CSIP was designed to encourage cooperative planning among teachers, principals, parents, and other school staff to foster school-based decision-making. Schools were mandated to participate in this project if they were designated on the State's Comprehensive Assessment Report list of schools needing substantial improvement in third and sixth grade reading and math scores, as well as attendance.

        "description":"One of the major activities of the Urban Literacy Network (ULN) is a grants program aimed at supporting cooperative, collaborative approaches to developing resources and support systems for literacy in urban areas. Eleven grants were awarded in 1987-1988 in the following urban areas: Boston; Chicago; Denver; El Paso; Houston; Nashville; Oklahoma City; St. Louis; San Diego; Tucson; and Washington, D.C. The ULN grants program offered an important opportunity to contribute to the knowledge base about the nature of the urban literacy context, particularly with regard to the value of cooperative and collaborative approaches to developing resources and sustaining support over time. The delivery system of programs and services addressing the need of nonliterate adults was found to be  particularly diverse and fractionalized in urban areas. The funders of these programs were similarly diverse. They included many public agencies at all levels of government, corporations, philanthropic organizations, and individuals with widely ranging motives. Illiteracy was found to be an invisible handicap affecting adults of all classes, ethnic groups, and ages. Literacy was discovered to be a complex political issue, with many of its aspects being hotly debated at certain times and carefully sidestepped at others. (Half of this report is devoted to summaries of ULN grant projects in the 11 cities that received grants in 1987-1988.) (MN)",

        "description":"An evaluation was made of the vocational assessment processes for special populations (disadvantaged and handicapped) in the secondary schools in Ohio. A survey instrument was developed and mailed to the 77 vocational evaluators in Ohio, with a 65 percent return. In addition, each of the 125 vocational special needs coordinators in Ohio was asked to submit five randomly selected vocational assessment reports and their corresponding individualized Education Programs (IEPs). The information gathered from these two groups, after evaluation by a focus group, was used to determine training needs for vocational evaluators. The following are some of the recommendations made as a result of the project: (1) provide inservice training to evaluators on assessment practices; (2) provide a  systematic approach for informing evaluators about minimum competencies and specific abilities needed for vocational programs; (3) provide inservice training to promote increased use of various types of evaluation methods; (4) provide inservice support for improved reporting; (5) provide inservice to help special educators use assessment report information in writing IEPs; (6) develop a systematic approach to informing students about vocational education opportunities and requirements; and (7) offer inservice support to all school personnel in the area of transition from school to work. Appendixes include the survey instrument, the Assessment Report/IEP Analysis Coding Form, a list of definitions, and a list of consultant panel members. (KC)",

The model program for students in grades 7 through 12 that is described in this report is based on the research that was conducted during the project. The plan is based on the principle that it is no longer adequate to view vocational-technical education as an alternative to skill development in other areas. It thus revolves around a skill pyramid, according to which students proceed from mastering basic skills to mastering employability, occupational, and job-specific skills. The proposed curriculum is a developmental and sequential one that is designed to begin in the 7th and 8th grades (where the  focus would be on basic and employability skills) and would continue through the high school years (where the focus would gradually evolve from employability skills through the more general occupational skills and eventually culminate in job- and employer-specific skills). The model outline presented in this report includes listing of the skills and specific courses to be taught at each grade level along with specific recommendations concerning appropriate school-industry relationships and guidelines for using the concept of magnet schools.

Designated an Area Vocational School (AVS) in 1969, the college has successfully operated 10 programs for secondary students. The students enrolled in these programs learn in the same facilities and share equipment with their postsecondary counterparts. The secondary AVS enrolls approximately 200 high school juniors and seniors each semester. The students attend half-day classes at the college and spend the other half day at their respective high schools. Articulation agreements ensure that the student who successfully completes classes in the AVS may receive college credit for those classes upon completion of the next postsecondary course in the  sequence required in the major field. The college also offers two programs for articulation with the high school. Business education, drafting, and welding offer the student the opportunity to receive college credit for classes taught at the high school. Articulation agreements have been developed to spell out the details of the programs. (The articulation agreements and course descriptions of the articulated programs are included in this report.)

Research conducted by vocational education specialists will likely result in a new scope and sequence of vocational instruction. New theories of vocational education will be developed, as will new instructional methods based on these theories. As vocational education becomes an increasing integral part of society, its objectives will reflect the needs of society's work force and learning activities will become more varied than ever before. Better means of diagnosing student learning difficulties and improved procedures for appraising vocational education students' progress will be in evidence. Instructors will likely complete master's degrees requirements in order to  teach vocational education. In regard to inservice teacher education, the following are needed: instructor-conducted research, particularly on ways of improving course content; independent study projects for instructors; videotape training materials for teachers; regional planning meetings; and ample opportunities for discussions with others in their professions, including team planning sessions; paid sabbaticals; and libraries geared specifically to the needs of vocational education teachers.

The surveys asked about job training, availability of properly trained employees, inservice training, college training, vocational school training, employee evaluation, tourism attractions, advertising and promotion needs, and educational needs. The surveys found  that there are gaps between the number of trained employees available and the number needed and that there is a need for educators and the hospitality/tourism industry to bridge a communication gap so that educational institutions can provide the training needed for the industry. Ways must also be found to reduce employee turnover. More promotional and development activities are also recommended. (KC)",

        "description":"With fewer recent high school graduates available to attend college, colleges need to increase their efforts to attract adults. If colleges want to attract more adult students, they must develop a comprehensive marketing plan. The marketing process entails a thorough marketing study that includes a detailed institutional analysis, an analysis of competing colleges, and an analysis of the potential adult students. The results of this marketing analysis may suggest changes that should be made to serve the needs of the potential adult students. Because adults must be aware of the college and its programs in order to participate, colleges must also consider the various promotional methods that may be used to inform potential adult students of the attributes of the college that may be  appealing to adults and of the programs available at the institution. The various forms of mass media and specialized media will require an advertising budget as a part of the marketing plan. However, other forms of promotion may be used at little or no cost to the institution, including publicity provided by the public relations department, community involvement of faculty and administrators, personal selling by faculty and staff, and free samples of instruction to prospective students.

        "description":"The Project on Adult Literacy was an independent, nonpartisan research effort that examined the role that the federal government has played in promoting adult literacy and the role that it should play. The project began operation in July 1988 and issued its final report in January 1989. It was discovered that the literacy problem in the United States has two dimensions: the difficulties experienced by all of those with limited basic skills and the difficulties experienced by those with limited proficiency in English. The literacy problems experienced by immigrants and Hispanics are especially pressing. Another important problem identified was the lack of literacy programs in the workplace. The measures required to come to grips with the problem of adult literacy in the near term  are neither very expensive nor very difficult. The federal government must address the adult literacy problem from its executive and legislative branches. The President should establish adult literacy (and work force literacy in particular) as a major priority of his administration and should establish a cabinet council on adult literacy. Congress should introduce the Adult Basic Skills Act of 1989, which would build a stronger intellectual base for adult literacy, promote innovation in training and technology, and reinforce federalism.

        "description":"Recent national concern about the levels of adults' literacy skills has resulted in a demand for expanded and more efficient basic skills programs. In turn, governmental agencies at all levels, politicians, and community organizations are seeking continually increasing amounts of information about a variety of topics pertaining to literacy education. A national information base is clearly becoming increasingly necessary. The creation of a knowledge base to guide literacy and basic skills instruction and program implementation has been hampered not only by the limited resources spent by the federal government and by private foundations on these topics, but also by the structure of funding for research. Most studies funded are short-term. Another problem has been the lack of bona  fide research studies. There is a critical need for comprehensive research on adult learning (particularly native and second language learning), instructional methods, assessment and accountability systems, and the organization and delivery of services. The creation of a comprehensive research and development base for supporting a coordinated adult basic skills education system will require the establishment of a new institutional structure and an additional federal investment, including the creation of a national center for adult literacy.

        "description":"Estimates of the true extent of illiteracy among the United States's adult population vary widely. The Department of Education has estimated that there are 23 million illiterate Americans and an additional 46 million American who function only marginally in an increasingly technological society. Federal support for adult literacy began in 1965 when funds for adult basic education (ABE) began filtering to state education departments under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. During ABE's first decade there was some success in establishing broadly available programs giving adults greater access to literacy and basic education assistance. Nevertheless, as of 1975, literacy programs were only reaching a small fraction of those who needed them. Since 1975, significant developments  have occurred and funding has increased substantially. Beginning in 1983, the literacy initiative, while not providing any additional fiscal support, attempted to extend literacy services through awareness campaigns, the use of volunteer tutors, and privately funded support. Although substantial progress has been made, many problems remain. Adult literacy has often been supported as a means of achieving other economic and social development policies. Although this is both appropriate and commendable, policymakers must not lose sight of adult literacy and learning as ends in themselves. (MN)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to test the proposition that intensive formation of human capital on the job is the basic reason for the strong degree of worker attachment to the firm in Japan. The greater emphasis on training and retraining, much of it specific to the firm, results also in steeper wage trajectories, because of growth of skills in the firm, according to this hypothesis. The study measured wage profiles and turnover in age groups, and it tested the inverse relation between the two on industry sectors in Japan and the United States. Numerical estimates of this relation led to the conclusion that as much as two-thirds of the differential in turnover between the two countries is explainable by the differences in the steepness of the profiles. The study determined that the  emphasis on human capital formation on the job is so much greater in Japan than in the United States because such emphasis is conditioned by rapid economic growth. Using productivity growth indexes for industries in the United States and Japan confirms the hypothesis that rapid technical change that induces greater and continuous training is in part responsible for steeper profiles and for less turnover. The study concluded that differences in productivity growth between the United States and Japan account for up to 80 percent of the differences in the steepness of wage profiles, and indirectly for the differences in turnover. The hypothesis also holds up for Japanese plants in the United States, where the steeper tenure-wage slopes and lower turnover are much closer to Japan than to the  United States. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Most recent research on the impact of the new computer technology on skills has been focused on developing arguments that either support or contradict the \"deskilling\" thesis put forth by some economists and sociologists in the mid- and late 1970s. Although this research remains inconclusive, some generalizations can be suggested. The research shows that at least in the large core firms in both manufacturing and services, microelectronics is eliminating rather than increasing the lowest skilled jobs. An example from banking also supports findings that microelectronics enables the broadening of skill requirements for middle-level jobs, while the introduction of computer-based technology leads to greater specialization of upper-level and managerial personnel. Surprisingly, however,  the large body of research on employment and technology has little to say about the impact of microelectronic technology on the process of skill formation. Evidence from a study of banking indicates, however, that in this industry at least, the processes of skill formation are undergoing a major transformation, suggesting both an increasing role for outside educational preparation and more firm-based training for highly specific objectives. In order to allow for further research, a framework can be suggested emphasizing the relationship between the development and diffusion of the new technology and the availability of skilled labor, the uncertainty in labor supply and the firm's markets, and the institutional and social factors that shape the firm's response.

Chapter 2 discusses technological innovations in textiles. Chapter 3 describes innovations in the organization of production and in the  training and management of the work force. Chapter 4 summarizes the implications of the technological and organizational changes on the skill demands of the industry. Chapter 5 describes how the changes in technology, organization, and skills have affected the system for training and educating production-level textile workers.

        "description":"Technological literacy may be defined as a knowledge of and competence in a technical method of achieving a practical purpose. This definition thus contains two components: technical (scientific) methods and practical purposes. Historically, industrial education has concentrated on the second component. The practical uses of technology should continue to be the central focus for curriculum development in industrial education; however, more effort should be placed on helping students develop a larger understanding of our technological society. One way for industrial teachers to accomplish this is to use the technological literacy approach (as opposed to the traditionally used project and occupational skills approaches) when designing their industrial education program. The  technological literacy approach contains the following eight steps: determining the industrial occupations or occupational sector the course is to cover; developing or selecting a conceptualization of the key dimensions of the industrial area; identifying applicable technologies and available equipment; selecting sample projects to give students hands-on experiences; identifying other means of acquainting students with alternative technologies and applications; beginning the course with a presentation of the conceptualization of the industrial area; and relating all projects and other learning resources and activities to the conceptualization and key dimensions.

        "description":"Multipurpose academic units are academic units that are headed or chaired by one individual who, along with his or her faculty, is responsible for more than one degree or for more than one program under a degree. One example of a multipurpose academic unit would be a department that combines teacher education and industrial technology programs and that would thus offer degrees in teacher education, engineering, and industrial technology. These types of multipurpose units are frequently faced with a variety of challenges in balancing the conflicting interests of the different curricula that they offer. These issues include resource allocation, accreditation, conflicting goals, and future directions. A study examined the attitudes of administrators of multipurpose academic units at  11 institutions located throughout the United States. In many situations, the degree requirements and programs to prepare individuals with advanced educational competencies are being accomplished under degree designations other than Master of Education. Most of the respondents, although they were leaders of multipurpose departments, had strong roots and loyalties to teacher education. In the multipurpose departments studied, industrial education appeared to be a lower priority than industrial technology and engineering technology, and the view was expressed that it will likely enjoy an even lower priority in such units in the future.

Interviews were conducted with 32 native-born U.S. citizens (native speakers of English) who had enrolled in a literacy program for the first time and had been reading somewhere up to the 4.9 grade level at the time they entered their literacy program. Nine (eight females and one male) first heard about their literacy program through a radio or television advertisement. Five each heard about literacy programming from friends, family, and other agencies. Seventeen of the 32 people interviewed reported that they had to wait before beginning their programs, with 3 persons waiting between 4 and 6 months. The top five reasons/goals given for attending a literacy  program (in order of decreasing frequency) were to pass the General Educational Development Tests, obtain job training, undergo self-improvement, achieve independence, receive social support, and end embarrassment. The major factors that positively affected attendance were family support, perceived progress, heightened self-esteem, and good teachers. All of the respondents had dropped out of school; 27 had at least one parent from a southern state; and 23 were currently unemployed.

Working conditions, worker attitudes, and economic outcomes at a group of employee-owned stores and a group that had adopted QWL strategies were compared at three points in time (summer 1982, summer 1983, and fall 1984). Overall, the worker buyouts were successful at saving some jobs. The worker-owned stores, which had been among the poorest-performing stores originally, had significantly lower unit labor costs in 1983 than either the QWL or non-QWL stores examined, despite the fact that they employed a larger proportion of full-time, highly paid workers. Productivity was also significantly higher at the  employee-owned stores. In those stores where QWL had been fully implemented, workers acquired some involvement in decisions through departmental, store, and regional meetings, but their involvement was constrained and limited to short-term decisions. The worker-owners worked more hours per week on average than did their QWL store counterparts.

Perkins Vocational Education Act since its passage in 1984 and to determine how it could be improved. After examining the past and present role of the Federal Government in vocational-technical education (VTE) in the context of current and future needs for VTE, the task force concluded that the dual federal goals of quality and access (which largely shaped the provisions of the Perkins Act) are still valid. The task force therefore recommended that the reauthorization of the Perkins Act promote improvements in the quality of programs, especially for those with special needs who do not now have access to high-quality programs. The task force further concluded that the integration of vocational and  academic curricula should be supported and encouraged, that changes in VTE should be tied to major education reform efforts, and that the impact of VTE in addressing social and economic issues through collaborative interagency programs should be expanded. This five-part report presents 5 major objectives of the federal role in vocational-technical education and 11 specific recommendations for a reauthorized vocational-technical education act, discusses the context of the recommendations, discusses federal statutes related to the Perkins Act, and describes the procedures followed in formulating the recommendations.

The GAO reviewed 27 estimates of the number of homeless persons that were published between 1975 and 1987 and that presented information about the estimation methods used. Three reports were national, 4 were state, and 20 were local. Nine reports had information on mental illness among the homeless. Only 10 reports were considered technically sound. Nine of these were survey- or census-based; one was utilization-based. The results of the review revealed  no sound national estimates of the number of homeless persons who are chronically mentally ill or of trends over time. Some local estimates, however, contained relatively sound estimates on both homeless persons and those who were chronically mentally ill. Rates of homelessness were affected by the type of method used and the technical quality of the study. Estimates of prevalence of mental illness among the homeless were affected by method choice. GAO identified several options for obtaining better assessments. This report describes the GAO study in detail and includes 12 appendices, a glossary of terms, bibliography, 12 tables, and 3 figures.

GAO identified lessons learned from previous public-health research and determined how such lessons could be applied to the education of populations at risk for AIDS. GAO reviewed studies of the effects of health education on people's knowledge and behavior regarding, for example, drug use, smoking, and sexually transmitted diseases, as well as AIDS. GAO interviewed experts in public health, mass communication, and marketing to discuss the implications of previous  research for education to prevent AIDS. To learn about current AIDS campaigns, GAO interviewed AIDS coordinators in five U.S. cities with the highest current incidence of AIDS cases and visited 12 exemplary AIDS campaigns to review each one's rationale and operation. Data were used to develop a seven-step model of health education, consisting of these steps: (1) specifying the target group; (2) identifying characteristics placing the group at risk; (3) selecting the media likely to reach that group; (4) determining the information to be covered; (5) developing risk-reduction skills; (6) providing motivators for risk reduction; and (7) specifying the intended outcomes of the message. Field investigations indicated that this model could be applied to AIDS education. (NB)",

Issues such as the quality of the  custodial parent-child relationship, discipline strategies, negative divorce events, contact with the noncustodial parent, and contact with nonparental adults are discussed, and the depression, anxiety, and aggression that can result from problems in these areas are considered. Intervention techniques for each of these issues are identified. (NB)",

        "description":"Theories of school learning consistently point to variables such as ability, time (e.g., homework), quality of instruction, motivation, and academic coursework as important influences on learning. In this study, path analysis was used to test the direct and indirect effects of these variables on high school learning, with learning measured by both achievement test scores and high school grades. Relevant background characteristics were controlled and a longitudinal sample was used. The sample consisted of 25,875 high school students selected from the base year (1980) and the first follow-up (1982) of the Department of Education's High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study. Subjects were in 10th grade in 1980 and in 12th grade in 1982. The results suggest that ability, academic  coursework, and homework all have important direct effects on achievement test scores, whereas the effects of quality of instruction and motivation were primarily indirect, chiefly through coursework and homework. When grades were used as the criterion, each of the potentially manipulable variables of interest, with the exception of homework, had a stronger effect relative to that of intellectual ability. Homework, however, had only inconsistent effects. The results offer support for these variables as important influences on school learning, and also support their inclusion in theories of school learning. (Author/NB)",

Subjects, 105 students enrolled in a career planning course for science and engineering majors, were administered two measures of self-efficacy designed to assess expectations of personal efficacy for completing science and engineering majors (ERS) and for academic skills (AMS). The results of three separate analyses consistently revealed that AMS was a strong independent predictor of academic performance and persistence, and that the ERS, but not AMS, moderated the relationships between scholastic aptitude and academic performance and persistence. The direction of the moderator  effect suggested that the academic performance and persistence of low aptitude students was facilitated by high self-efficacy beliefs, but that the performance and persistence of high aptitude students was unaffected by their self-efficacy beliefs. These findings have implications for future research on career self-efficacy, and for career and academic counseling. (Author/NB)",

Two studies were conducted to explore lay responses to AIDS from the perspective of recent research on how lay people process illness information. The research examines the cognitive organization of disease information and the understanding which people have for specific categories of disease. The results of these two studies indicated that the primary dimensions used to categorize diseases were the extent to which the diseases were perceived to be contagious and serious/life-threatening. Further, the extent to which subjects were willing to interact with persons with specified diseases was a direct function of the extent to which the disease was  contagious. The second study examined people's understanding of the concept of contagious disease. The results indicated that subjects tended to have a relatively simple and straightforward understanding of contagion. Subjects perceived flu, cold, and chicken pox to be the most typical of their concept of contagious disease. These findings have implications for understanding AIDS hysteria. (Author/NB)",

This research examined two of these components, cause and consequences, through the use of multidimensional scaling. Undergraduate students (N=132) completed questionnaires by rating 18 different diseases as to their similarity and on 18 different characteristics. Subjects were assigned to different conditions and were asked to rate the diseases as to how similar they were in general terms or in terms of what causes them, how one gets them, or in terms of their consequences. The results point to dimensions in use by  people when thinking about these aspects of disease and also contribute to an understanding of lay responses to different diseases.

The results revealed that 93% of the principals surveyed considered teenage suicide to be a matter of serious concern. Approximately 20% of respondents were personally acquainted with a student who had committed suicide. Only 6% of principals knew of cases where students had tried unsuccessfully to commit suicide. Ninety percent of principals  reported that an ongoing prevention program was needed in the public schools. While 28% of respondents thought that they would handle the situation well should a student commit suicide, 90% stated that all educators should receive special training in working with students showing suicidal characteristics. Ninety percent indicated that parents should be notified when students showed problem symptoms.

It seeks to develop a comprehensive understanding of human nature which also takes into account the dynamic role of motivation and the human spirit in the equation of excellence, well-being, and dynamic living. Transpersonal psychology seeks to understand how imagination, inspiration, intuition, creativity, and insight operate. These human resources provide what are called higher states of awareness because they help people view their lives from a higher  point of view; clarify their values; strengthen, regenerate and renew themselves at the deepest levels; touch and empower the human spirit; and help them experience a sense of the unity which underlies all creation.

First the limits of AIDS education are discussed, noting that increasing amounts of education will not necessarily reduce the spread of the virus, since information and education do not control behavior. Research showing that physicians are ill-equipped to diagnose AIDS or to counsel patients regarding their sexual practices is described. The lack of perception of personal vulnerability to AIDS by teenagers is discussed, noting that adolescents may not identify themselves as \"gay\" or \"addicts,\" and thus not perceive themselves at risk. Lifetime behavior changes are discussed which may be necessary, but information alone will not produce such  long-term behavioral change. The report notes that behavioral consequences are likely to be more important than antecedents such as reinforcers and information. It is also noted that long-term benefits of \"safer sex\" (such as not contracting the human immuno-deficiency (HIV) virus) may be outweighed by the short-term benefits of \"unsafe sex\" such as spontaneity. The report concludes that AIDS prevention will depend less on knowledge about HIV and more on an understanding of human behavior. (Author/ABL)",

Female college students (N=40) completed the Rod and Frame test, a questionnaire to define subjects' dominant coping behavior, and the short form of the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI). The results revealed no significant relationships between coping styles and sex-role self-concepts or field dependency. There was a significant relationship between sex-role self-concept and field dependency if masculine and androgynous subjects were compared to feminine or undifferentiated subjects. This finding suggests that the BSRI responses regarding sex-role self-concept may be more  socially influenced than was previously thought. Also, field independent women may use their sense of autonomy to resist social pressure to conform to expected sex-role self-concepts. The field dependent women, in contrast, may use their reliance on external cues in forming sex-role self-concepts considered at present to be more socially desirable. (Author/NB)",

However psychologists, like most other health care professionals prefer the amenities of more metropolitan settings, and rural dwellers have traditionally had less access to psychological services than metropolitan citizens in many parts of the country. Professionals desiring to work in rural settings must obtain realistic expectations about rural life if they are to find satisfaction from their work there. Regrettably, only a handful of programs at any level have expressed interest in preparing psychologists who will be committed to rural  settings. Training for work in rural settings must prepare students to become community-oriented generalists, fulfilling four basic roles: (1) individual and interpersonal assessment; (2) community problem assessment; (3) individual and group behavior change; and (4) community change. The status of master's level psychology graduates is currently under assault from within the profession and by legislation and policy that favor doctoral-level psychologists. The profession may be following short-term financial interests rather than asking if rural and other less advantaged clients may be better served by a multilevel profession that assures wide access to psychological services.

        "description":"There is research support of the hypothesis that engaging in multiple roles yields better health and greater life satisfaction, and there is support of the hypothesis that multiple role involvement leads to symptoms of role strain. No study has employed a comprehensive model to address the impact of multiple roles or attempted to identify potential mediating factors which could account for both beneficial and negative outcomes. This study examined role and life satisfaction and stress in men and women involved in multiple life roles and explored the mediating effects of coping strategies, hardiness, social support, and gender on these levels of stress and satisfaction. A sample of 102 male and 111 female university faculty, research scientists, and administrators involved in  multiple role lifestyles completed questionnaires assessing these variables. Participants reported relatively low levels of stress and moderately high levels of satisfaction with their roles. Men and women differed significantly on several of the variables (p&lt;.05). Regressions analyses revealed that the various forms of satisfaction were significantly predicted by hardiness, social support, and coping strategies (p&lt;.05). Stress was significantly related to lack of hardiness and use of avoidance coping strategies for men and women (p&lt;.001). These findings have implications for counseling multiple role men and women. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Screening and evaluating law enforcement candidates for employment as police officers is a complex task. It has been recommended that a clinical interview and comprehensive battery of psychological tests may aid in evaluation. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) is often used for this type of psychological screening. Peer assessment may also be a potentially useful method of evaluating law enforcement candidates. This study examined the association of MMPI data to peer assessment data in law enforcement candidates. Law enforcement trainees (N=45) completed the MMPI, the Shipley Institute of Living Scale, and demographic information. Trainees evaluated their peers on three scales measuring likelihood to succeed as a law enforcement officer, interpersonal  responsivity, and technical ability. Two instructors completed the same ranking and rating procedure. The results revealed that peer assessment measures correlated significantly with mean instructor evaluations and the candidate's final examination scores. The peer assessment measures appeared to be internally consistent in distinguishing who was predicted as most likely to be a successful police officer. Certain MMPI scales accounted for 18% of the variance in overall peer rankings. These findings suggest that peer assessment methods can assist in selection, screening, promotion, and other evaluative procedures with law enforcement personnel. (Author/NB)",

The results revealed significant differences in the direction and types of blame the women experienced as children and as adults. In addition, numerous significant correlations were obtained between self-blame and adjustment. Self-blame was associated with poorer adjustment, whereas externalization of blame was associated  with healthier adjustment. Significant relationships between self-blame and characteristics of the victims' sexual abuse history were also found. These findings have several implications for therapists working with adult victims of child sexual abuse. (Author)",

This study examined the relative effects of psychological and social characteristics on well-being in spousal caregivers of older adults with chronic dementia. Fifty-one spouses completed questionnaires assessing dementia severity, distress in appraisal of dementia symptoms, perceived support from family and peers, reliance on specific coping strategies, and psychological well-being. The results of the path analysis showed that gender, appraisal of dementia symptoms, perceived peer support, and three types of coping  strategies (problem-solving, positive focus, and wishful thinking) were significant predictors of well-being. Overall, the predictor variables accounted for 60.3 percent of the variance in psychological well-being. The findings document the salience of these characteristics in further study of caregiver functioning. More generally, results provide support for multi-dimensional models of stress, coping, and adaptation. The findings have implications for clinical intervention. (Author/NB)",

Both a quantitative approach and a qualitative approach were used to examine whether or not different measures reflected different domains of meaning and purpose. Subjects were 215 men and women, were classified in five developmental groupings: young adulthood (N=35), adulthood (N=47), middle adulthood (N=38), older middle adulthood (N=43), and older to &quot;old-old&quot; adults (N=50). The youngest subjects were from a community college and several of the oldest subjects were institutionalized in a nursing home, with the effects separated out. Subjects completed an interview schedule consisting of demographic data items and an open-ended questionnaire of reporting the most meaningful events in  one's life with the age of occurrence. Subjects also completed a modified version of the Purpose-in-Life Test. The results revealed that the amount of meaning in a person's life did not seem to vary with age or gender. Similarly, what was meaningful to a person did not seem to alter with time. Work and love themes evolved as the most salient sources of meaning followed by births of children, miscellaneous quests, accidents/illness/deaths, separation/divorce, and to a lesser extent, major purchases.

School psychologists (N=322) provided current demographic information and information on their desired and actual activities. Responses from the present administration of the NSPQ were compared to responses from the 1982 administration. The results revealed that time devoted to assessment decreased since 1982 (52% versus 54%) and time devoted to intervention increased (26% versus 23%), while time in consultation (18%) and research (<1%) remained constant. Consistent with the 1982 results, a decrease in assessment was desired along with increases in intervention,  consultation, and research.

Studies of relapse have typically defined the problem as a return to the specific substance for which the individual was originally treated. Because multiple substance appears to be common, this study examined relapse using a broader definition of relapse--the abuse of any substances after previous treatment. It investigated determinants of relapse and antecedents of recent use for 30 substance abusers re-entering in-patient treatment. A structured interview assessment revealed that the patients relapsed within 2 months following previous treatment, yet waited 2.7 years before re-entering treatment. Alcohol was often the initial substance used  after previous treatment. More than one-half of the subjects indicated that intrapersonal negative emotional states, such as loneliness or depression, led to the relapse. An even greater percentage of respondents indicated that such determinants were antecedents to recent use. Implications for treatment are presented. (Author/NB)",

Much of this research, however, suffers from the methodological flaws of mixing together people who were divorced with people who were never married and of questioning only the custodial parents. This study surveyed a sample of 378 divorcing families and obtained matched data from both custodial and noncustodial parents. Respondents were interviewed immediately after their divorce and again one year later. In addition, decrees of divorce were examined and payment records were analyzed through the clerk of the court. The results revealed that only 80% of the decrees contained the provision that child support be paid through the clerk. Regardless of what  the decree ordered, most parents paid directly to the custodial parent. This finding suggests that to rely on clerk records exclusively yields a highly misleading underestimate of child support payments. The payment record reported by custodial parents was very similar to Census data; divorced mothers reported receiving nearly 75% of what they were owed. According to noncustodial fathers, however, only 4% reported paying nothing, and fathers reported paying better than 90% of what was owed. (NB)",

Social scientists must be concerned with the long-term effects on consenting adults and children and adolescents of exposure to pornography and human mutilation. An experiment in which a treatment group is exposed to pornography and a control group is exposed only to sexual messages cannot be undertaken. However, there has been psychological, sociological, and forensic research which links pornography to pathology, deviance, and crime. Murder, imprisonment, sexually transmitted diseases, masochistic self-harm, prostitution, and other difficulties have been linked to pornography. The amount and degree of emotional difficulty and distress experienced by those exposed either directly or  tangentially to pornography is large, including suicidal behavior, nightmares, and inability to experience sexual pleasure. Although periodically pornographic in nature, &quot;slasher&quot; films rely heavily on physical attacks of a perverted nature to shock the viewer. The key result is desensitization so that people exposed to X- and R-rated movies tend to moderate their attitudes towards women and violence. The measurement of variables and the effects of either treatment or negative exposure is critical. Increasing availability of pornographic materials should be of concern to parents, teachers, and the community. Counselors and therapists will be dealing with a greater number of people experiencing sexual difficulties. (ABL)",

Typically clients who see counselors are dissatisfied with aspects of their personal lives. Along with their perceptions of their present states are their desires to alter or change their states. Discussions focus on how they might reduce the factors which negatively contribute to their lives, while increasing the factors which enhance their lives. The counseling partnership produces goals. Goals are expressions of what clients perceive as end-products of their taking action. Goal Attainment Scaling is a possible vehicle for use with groups who are seeking resolutions to career and other lifespan issues. A  Goal Attainment Scale represents a clear statement of each of the client-goals and a five-point outcome scale, from worst to best possible expected outcome for each of the goals. Counselor-educators can teach their clients or students, either individually or in groups, how to construct such a scale. Goals can be personalized and possible outcomes can be established. Support groups can then be formed through which the participants can monitor their progress, rework their goals and outcomes, and receive group feedback concerning their goals. (ABL)",

The model has the advantage of offering a developmental, holistic approach which not only facilitates the students' career planning, but also has the potential to facilitate the personal, social, and academic development of the students. Career counselors do not have to be working within a LDP model to become effective with LD students.

One intervention that has demonstrated success in a self-control context with normally intelligent people is Cognitive Stress Inoculation Training (CSIT). In CSIT clients are taught to recognize current self-talk patterns that contribute to their stressful reactions and to change that self-talk so that it promotes more tranquil affect and more facilitative behavior. This study explored the viability of using CSIT with mentally handicapped people. A field study was conducted using subjects (N=10) who were residents in an urban residential treatment facility for mentally handicapped people. All subjects had at least one sensory impairment. The  program was an adaptation of Stress Inoculation Training Program, presented within an instructional counseling context. In the first 3 weeks subjects were educated regarding the role of physiological arousal and self-talk in anger outbursts and generally prepared for the skill training that followed. Weeks 4 to 6 focused on acquiring skills for controlling anger. The last two sessions focused on switching to using anger control skills in the residential and work settings. Results suggest that CSIT was a useful strategy for teaching mentally handicapped people to control their anger outbursts and that the effects tended to persist after training was finished. (ABL)",

        "description":"In many classrooms, the textbook becomes the main source used to determine objectives, procedures, opinions, questions, thoughts, and other items used in teaching U.S. history. This study was done to determine how the Reconstruction Era was presented in a selected group of junior high school U.S. history textbooks. The books were classified according to the manner in which each book answers a common set of questions. Seven textbooks were analyzed on the basis of five questions designed to determine the quality of the presentation of the Reconstruction period. Data were analyzed by counting the number of lines devoted to 26 aspects of Reconstruction. Findings were: (1) textbooks tended to be similar and present similar material; (2) textbooks used a large number of illustrations;  (3) textbooks were highly factual, offering few interpretations; (4) textbooks tended to be accurate in their presentation of facts; and (5) the selected texts tended to be void of descriptive adjectives, thus avoiding bias. This research supported the findings of Project SPAN which found textbooks to be accurate and fair in presenting minorities. (SM)",

One involves the search for an appropriate social studies core and is spearheaded by state governments and scholarly organizations. The second reform movement flows toward a social studies curriculum based on urgent domestic issues and the realities of global interdependence. The cross-purposes of these two reform currents seem to contribute to the continuing confusion about what should be taught, how, and for what reason. A revised social studies core that stresses preparation for citizenship through history, civics, and geography has emerged from the push for a revised core curriculum. On the other hand, the issues-oriented reform movement has tended toward a balkanization of the social studies program, with thousands of  minicourses and study units being developed. From the many proposed curriculum reforms, common themes have emerged, including: (1) a clear commitment to democratic values; (2) knowledge of local and national heritage; (3) understanding the form and function of government and the economy; (4) a need to engage in more active civic participation; (5) a strong emphasis on active learning; and (6) an appreciation of other cultures and value systems. These broad areas of consensus lead to a cautious optimism that social studies reform will come of age. (SM)",

The Citizenship Development Framework (CDF), a product of the Citizenship Development Study Project, was designed as a research theory that can serve as a guide for planning scientific inquiry into the socio/cultural influences that contribute to the development of an individual's citizenship behaviors. According to this theory, there are six stages of citizenship development in which social relationships contribute to the formation of the individual's perspective of his overall relationship with community and society. The six  stages of development are: (1) birth to 3 years--infant dependency and maternal shaping; (2) 4 to 5 years--family citizenship and expanding kinship influences; (3) 5 to 9 years--the initiation of nonbiological dependencies; (4) 10 to 12 years--the development of social categories and group membership behaviors; (5) 13 to 15 years--horizontal social relationships within and between groups; (6) 16 years to adulthood--a search for accommodation and adult identity. Each of the stages is examined from the perspectives of: (1) primary characteristics; (2) critical relationships; (3) the nature of citizenship formation; (4) the extent of influence; (5) citizenship development; and (6) investigatory questions.

In order to test this analysis, 94 children between the ages of 4 and 6 used maps to locate the route to a goal through a network of paths with blind alleys. Two tasks were used as predictors of skill in map use. Laurendeau and Pinard's test of the localization of topological positions (LOTOP) supplied measures of memory encoding, correspondence, and rotation. The child copied an examiner's placements on a board when the boards were aligned or one was rotated 180 degrees. Placements were near landmarks or in an open field. The landmarks were then removed and the  child had to recall their location (encoding). On the mental rotation test (MR), the child chose a rotated letter-like form to match a standard. Younger children's map errors were predicted by mental rotation skill (MR and LOTOP rotated board scores) and landmark placements. Older children's map errors were predicted by recall of landmark positions (memory encoding). (SM)",

The approach called &quot;geographic gameboard,&quot; consists of three components: (1) an imaginary, graphically depicted community (Abbotsville, Oklahoma); (2) a census map that corresponds to the census geography of Abbotsville; and (3) blank pages for listing addresses. Abbotsville is an imaginary rural community that was purposely created to reflect a wide range of living arrangements and geographic features. Employees learn to perform their job and use census maps by canvassing and listing the mailing addresses of residences in Abbotsville. As they do this, they correct and update census geography shown on an accompanying map of Abbotsville. An important feature of the learning  experience requires the enumerators to go into the field and apply what they have learned. The training program's effectiveness was evaluated by a test and a comparison was made of addresses listed by the enumerator with an &quot;advance&quot; listing. The high average scores obtained on the test indicate that the &quot;gameboard&quot; training approach was very effective in teaching important procedural knowledge. Reports from people who observed the training indicated that it achieved its goal of keeping the trainees actively involved in the learning process.

This crisis has proven to be a more serious threat to the world economy than had been anticipated and has resulted in an intractable constraint on international trade and development. In coping with repayment difficulties, developing countries reduced domestic expenditures, thereby reducing investment in industries that could have produced export merchandise. Developing countries also reduced imports, thus diminishing export markets for developed countries. This situation  caused incomes in developed countries to stagnate, further depressing demand for imported goods and services of developing countries. Thus, the world marketplace shrank. United States agriculture has been particularly hurt by the debt crisis. The rescheduling of payments only superficially improved the situation. Developed countries and their lending institutions may find that the benefits of forgiving some portion of the debts outweigh the costs that will result.

To do this, educators should confront students with cases in history and current events involving fundamental paradoxes of U.S. constitutional government. Students should be taught to seek a balance among contending ideas. As students mature, they need greater opportunities to analyze and apply constitutional issues. They need to know the civic values and constitutional issues that flow from the interactions of power and liberty. This knowledge is a prerequisite to coping effectively with perennial constitutional issues. Students also need to understand the concept of majority rule with minority rights. As  citizens, they must decide at what point and under what circumstances rule by the majority begins to violate the legitimate rights of minorities. Another consideration is when and how advancement of minority rights violates or undermines the will of the majority. A primary responsibility of citizenship under the United States Constitution is an ongoing resolution of issues about how to blend and balance the competing claims of majority rule and minority rights.

The United States most directly and fully exemplifies the civic and scientific ideas which have developed as a result of the Age of Enlightenment. The free practice of modern science is guaranteed only in free societies; and only in those societies are the full benefits and power of modern science likely to be experienced. Educators in the sciences and social studies have been proposing an emphasis on science/technology/society in the core curriculum of secondary schools. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and other studies of student achievement  reveal generally low levels of student knowledge about society and values related to scientific inquiry in a free society. Inadequate treatment of science and free government in the curriculum and the classroom is likely to impede education for citizenship in a free society. Educators should expand coverage of science in both United States history and world history and portray science and democracy as the most revolutionary pair of ideas in modern history.

        "description":"This report reviews the results of a survey of teacher training programs in technology among 28 urban school systems in order to ascertain the current state of school computer use and teacher retraining. Results indicate that preparing students for the future presents particular problems for urban schools. With technology restructuring jobs and creating new types of work, the only clear prospect is that students will have to learn generalizable skills that allow them to adapt to the changing workplace. In urban settings, limited resources, large populations, and special non-educational needs create educational experiences for students that are different from those of their suburban counterparts. Inequities of resources threaten to repeat themselves in the area of technology  education. Teachers need preparation for being learners in this changing field. Technology affects the curriculum, classroom arrangements, measurement of student performance, and the teaching role. \"Top-down\" approaches to training seem to prevail, with teachers providing little input in deciding what type of training they need. Several recommendations are made for improvement of teacher training in this area, addressing the specific needs of urban schools. (CB)",

Overall satisfaction has been reported by persons involved in the Entry Year Assistance Program. Teacher consultants were perceived by entry level teachers as providing the most guidance in terms of human relations, classroom management, teaching and assessment, and professionalism. Teacher consultants, however, frequently indicated that they  were constrained by being unable to find time to meet with entry level teachers. Some problems were perceived in such areas as work socialization and translation of knowledge to practice. While the studies revealed a lack of role function guidelines for committee members, moderate agreement on the needs of the entry level teacher was noted. (CB)",

Critical learning that fosters active student participation, goal setting, and probing into concerns through dialogue with other students and the teacher is particularly needed to help students learn to analyze problems, deal with ethical considerations, see the broad picture, and still work within the confines of a specific task. Educators must strive to develop self-learning skills of every student, whether it be reading, speaking, writing, or listening. This paper presents a proposed model for teacher education or pattern which creatively integrates cultural/liberal arts study, specific, technical content knowledge, and professional  education preparation. Teaching and learning should deal with problem solving so that relationships and issues can be analyzed to illuminate reality. With such understanding, students can enter into life with the confidence and skills necessary for them to become participative and citizens. (CB)",

The paradigm shift is based on four major assumptions: (1) colleges and universities have served and will continue to serve as the locus for a substantial and very significant portion of teacher preparation; (2) the study of education constitutes a discipline in its own right; (3) teacher education reform and teaching profession restructuring are two very different types of educational reform; and (4) the current era is quite challenging  in that a value breakup has occurred regarding teacher preparation, resulting in the possibility of constructing a new, improved paradigm for teacher preparation.

It is called &quot;James Madison High School&quot; in honor of President James Madison and his strong views that the people, in order to govern properly, must arm themselves with knowledge. The theoretical curriculum consists of four years of English, and three years each of social studies, mathematics, and science, two years each of foreign language and physical education, and a half-year each of art and music. A brief discussion is offered on the desirability of a curriculum that makes available a shared body of knowledge and skills, a common language of ideas, and a common moral and intellectual discipline. A chart describing the four-year plan of the program shows the  number of years required for each core subject and the names of the courses that fulfill them. To demonstrate the flexibility of the program, sample schedules for three students pursuing different goals are outlined. Profiles of seven exemplary high school programs provide an insight into what is currently being accomplished with rigorous core curriculums. The profiled schools, each serving students of diverse backgrounds, are: (1) A. Philip Randolph Campus High School (New York); (2) CAL High School (Iowa); (3) James A. Garfield High School (California); (4) Shawnee Mission South High School (Kansas); (5) Portland High School (Maine); (6) Xavier Prep School (Louisiana); and (7) Wayland High School (Massachusetts).

Test administration was the only non-psychometric criterion ranked as high as any psychometric criterion. In general, it  was found that school districts tended to place heaviest emphasis on psychometric criteria in evaluating tests, though certain non-psychometric criteria involving directions given to students and examiners were also weighted highly. The relative importance of psychometric and non-psychometric criteria in test selection did not appear to vary with district size or other characteristics, although the level of importance assigned to either type of criteria appeared to correlate with the level of importance assigned to the other.

Three research/evaluation questions were considered: (1) what services were being delivered? (2) what impact these services have at individual teacher, school, and district/system-wide levels? and (3) what factors accounted for these impacts and changes? Evaluation proceeded along two general lines. The first was a running documentation system used to track the delivery of teacher center services. The second included two qualitative approaches used by specialists and researchers--vignettes and pre-structured case studies. Pre-structured cases originate with a conceptual framework, specific research questions, and a  set of focused instruments. Teacher Centers and teacher specialists in three different schools were the subjects of case studies. Two themes emerged from the completed case studies--the unique role of the teacher specialists and the symbolic nature of the Teacher Center. Pre-structured case studies proved to be efficient in use of time and focus. They may preclude exploring unanticipated opportunities that may arise. The qualitative approaches encouraged collaboration, shared responsibility, and improved opportunities to study complex situations. (MDE)",

Out-of-school programs are defined as involving several dimensions not found in schools: (1) goals and objectives; (2) nature of activities--experiential, educational, recreational, or unstructured; (3) structure or schedule of meetings--camps, daily, weekly, or monthly; (4) leaders--volunteer parents or coaches; and (5) range of ages, and other characteristics of youth clientele. Discussion of the out-of-school groups is limited to such groups as 4-H, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Campfire, Boys' Clubs, and YMCA programs. Three elements in  the design of in- and out-of-school projects are compared: unit of analysis (group versus individual); generalizability of the study; and potential for treatment contamination. The on-going case study, Project 4-Health, is described, as are the project's three phases: assessing the use of smokeless tobacco in 4-H youth in California; developing and field testing programs about tobacco and smokeless tobacco; and follow-up.

        "description":"Use of the vignette as a tool in qualitative educational research is relatively new. Vignettes were used to capture the nuances of the work of teacher specialists in the New York City (New York) Teacher Centers. The teacher specialists had shared with evaluators their belief that despite a deserved reputation for effective work, they had a sense of doubt about actual impact. Qualitative instruments to keep track of activity and case studies enabled evaluators to understand the dynamics of the teacher specialists' work. In addition, vignettes were created as tools for revealing subtleties not apparent to an outside evaluator. The vignettes contained a series of topics designed to get at the way the specialist actually worked. Each vignette was six to ten pages in length. The  outline covered eight mutually determined questions. Examples of two vignettes are in the text of the paper. A total of 16 vignettes were written. They revealed the quality of the specialists' work and provided a viable source of data on the impact of their work. The two vignettes included describe: (1) an intervention to assist a beginning teacher; and (2) successful efforts to involve an experienced teacher in supporting learning centers. It was concluded that the vignette appears to hold real promise as a tool for collecting qualitative data. (MDE)",

        "description":"The Florida Beginning Teacher Program was evaluated in 1985-86 to determine its impact on teacher performance and to study problem areas identified in the 1984-85 evaluation. A sample of 43 beginning teachers and their support team members (a peer teacher, a building-level administrator, and one or more professional educators) completed surveys. Data on teacher performance were obtained from the Teacher Assessment and Development System (TADS) Classroom Assessment Instrument Post-Observation Report and by interviewing program staff and examining the School Registration/Updating Forms and Profile Sheets. Results showed improvement in issues raised in the 1984-85 evaluation. Most beginning teachers improved in the assessment areas, with the largest improvement reported in: (1)  preparation and planning; (2) classroom management; (3) techniques of instruction; and (4) assessment techniques. Results also indicated, however, that beginning teachers in special subject areas (e.g., guidance) felt the training was not relevant to them. Numerous respondents indicated the orientation and training materials were out of date. Appendices include the list of the program's 34 generic teaching competencies with TADS referents, and the survey forms for beginning teachers, peer teachers, building-level administrators, and other professional educators.

        "description":"This paper evaluates the logic underlying various criticisms of statistical significance testing and makes specific recommendations for scientific and editorial practice that might better increase the knowledge base. Reliance on the traditional hypothesis testing model has led to a major bias against nonsignificant results and to misinterpretation of significant results. A finding of statistical significance does not mean that the null hypothesis is false, since there are many factors affecting statistical significance such as sample size and the measurement reliability of the data. Furthermore, statistical significance alone does not permit evaluation of the importance of a finding. An effect size statistic, such as eta-squared, is more appropriate for this purpose, and editors  of scholarly publications should encourage routine reporting of effect sizes. Greater reporting of nonsignificant results should also be encouraged, accompanied by power analyses to estimate Type II error. Nonsignificant results can be meaningful if the study's power to detect an effect was high. Finally, the paper emphasizes the crucial role of replication in separating true effects from Type I errors. The paper integrates analyses and criticisms of statistical practice from a variety of sources--77 references are included. (LPG)",

This research evaluates logistic test models and computer simulation methods for providing a frame of reference for interpreting item bias statistics. Specifically, the intent was to produce simulated sampling distributions of item bias statistics under the no-bias hypothesis, for use in determining cut-off points to provide guidelines for interpreting item bias statistics obtained with actual test data. In this case, potential sex bias was studied in the item responses of 937 Cleveland ninth graders to 75 items from the 1985 Cleveland Reading Competency Test. Results supported the basic data simulation approach used in the study. Real and simulated  distributions for three item bias statistics (area between characteristic curves, root mean squared differences between curves, and the Mantel-Haenszel statistic) when bias was not present were very similar. The minor differences found between the distributions had little effect on the interpretation of item bias statistics obtained with actual data. Seven steps for applying the method of computer-simulated baseline statistics in test development settings were outlined. (Author/LPG)",

        "description":"Collaborative scholarly writing published in education journals was studied. Two basic investigative approaches were used. The first was to directly examine 26 major education journals published from 1984-86. This yielded information about the incidence of multiple authorship, the type of journal articles published (practical, research, or theoretical), and sex of authors. By using a subset of 16 journals, the composition of collaborative writing teams was also analyzed. More males were published authors, both singly and collaboratively. They were also the senior authors of collaborative writing teams more often than females. A survey about collaborative scholarly writing was the second strategy in this study. The survey contained items pertaining to the particular published  article used to identify the author, as well as items about collaborative writing in general. Of 1,027 surveys mailed, 547 usable surveys were returned. Responses to the questionnaire resulted in useful information about: (1) the reasons for collaboration; (2) criteria for selecting co-authors; (3) ways that authors determine tasks, generate a first draft, and allocate credit for authorship; and (4) deterrents to multiple authorship and other ethical issues. A hypothetical model for the collaborative writing process was designed, based upon subjects' written responses to the 18 open-ended survey items.

Among the disadvantages are impersonal feelings, possible low rate of response, inability to interact with respondents, and lack of assurance as to the actual respondent. Strategies for increasing response rate are identified. Personalized correspondence, pre-contact letters, special delivery mailing, and emphasis on benefit to the respondent tend to increase response  rates. Design of the questionnaire, clarity of instructions, simplicity of response, and quality of cover letter are considered to be important.

Bandura's emphasis on domain-specific assessment is useful for understanding student learning and fits well with current research on instructional processes. A self-efficacy model of student learning is presented, comprising entry characteristics, self-efficacy for learning, task engagement variables, and efficacy cues. At the outset of learning tasks, students vary in their self-efficacy for learning. As they work on tasks, they derive cues from task engagement variables that signal how well they are learning; they use these cues to assess efficacy for continued learning. Research is summarized on the effects of some task engagement variables associated with the instructional and social  context of learning. Empirical evidence supports the idea that self-efficacy is a useful predictor of student motivation and learning. The article concludes with a discussion of substantive issues involved in applying self-efficacy theory to learning settings, e.g., performance, motivation, and outcomes. A figure illustrating the self-efficacy model and an extensive six-page bibliography are appended. (Author/MAC)",

The model allows for complete assessment of ongoing program implementation and outcome. Three questions are used to organize evaluation activities: (1) Did staff (We) do what we said we were going to do? (2) Did participants (They) do what they were supposed to do? and (3) If everyone did what they were supposed to do, how would we know if it did any good? These questions allow for evaluation of program activities and outcomes for both formative and summative purposes. It focuses on staff activities, client activities, and the outcome of these activities. The Model allows for relating of outcomes to program goal  activities. It is useful for establishment of objectives, identification of specific treatment activities, and establishment of assessment methodology. Key aspects of the Model are a focus on evaluation of treatment integrity, and a simple reporting method that service staff can use with minimal disruption of activities. Use of the model is illustrated in the evaluation of the University of Nebraska's Educational Center for Disabled students. Computer technology was used as an intervention to train disabled college students. Objectives included improvement in attitudes and in academic performance. (MAC)",

Rates were similar to rates for the 1986 sophomores, but were higher than rates for juniors in the 1978-1983 period. The 1987 passing rate in mathematics was lower than for 1984-1986, but higher than in the 1978-1983 period. Extensive comparative tabulations revealed that academically gifted students consistently had higher passing rates. For the non-exceptional students, 96.5%, 92.9%, 91.5% and 92.6% passed the reading, mathematics, writing objectives, and writing tests, respectively. Most dramatic improvements were in reading and mathematics scores among Black and American Indian students. Reading rate  improvement of over 13 percentage points was observed for Black students during the 1978-1987 period. Although higher than from 1978-1983, the percentage of American Indian students passing reading and mathematics were lower in 1987 than in the three previous test administrations. With the second administration of the writing test, 88.7% of the group passed the writing objective test and 91.0% passed the writing essay test, both at rates higher than in 1986. Students with handicapping conditions scored lower on average than the non-handicapped students. (Author/RR)",

        "description":"College seniors--129 who were 25 years of age or older, and 734 younger students were administered the objective portion of the American College Testing (ACT) College Outcomes Measures Project (COMP) test. The total COMP scores and subscores were compared for the two groups, as well as their entering ACT scores and grade-point averages using analyses of variance. The relationship between total COMP scores, incoming ACT scores, and grade-point averages were also determined using a Pearson correlation method. Data were also obtained on sex, race, and marital status. Results showed that older students scored higher than their younger counterparts on the Total COMP scores and on the subscores obtained in the three content and three process areas. In addition, there was a significant  relationship between COMP Total score and grade-point average. No significant relationships were found as a result of the analysis of the effects of sex, race, and marital status, and COMP Total score. It was concluded that the ACT COMP may not be the most accurate measure for use with older students since their life and work experiences give them greater competency in analysis, synthesis, and evaluation skills. Furthermore, the assessment of students' competencies cannot be an exact science dependent upon one specific standardized instrument. (KSA)",

Originally, the Performance Rating (PR) System was used to evaluate the clinical performance of nursing students, medical students, and residents, as well as faculty teaching performance. It was also used for processing reviews of proposals for Sigma Theta Tau's International Research Congress in 1987. In general, the capabilities of the PR System which make it useful for processing the peer review of abstracts include: (1) the ease and speed with which a new inventory may be implemented; (2) the low cost and  speed of data collection; (3) processing and reporting arising from the use of optically scanned rating sheets; and (4) the appropriateness of its reports. Improvements in the peer review process can be obtained through the use of specialized data management and analysis systems. As these systems become more generally available, there may be a concomitant improvement in the reliability and validity of the formal, technical peer review process. (KSA)",

        "description":"A total of 1,071 rating sheets were completed by individual reviewers evaluating abstracts submitted to Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society for the International Research Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland. Only 972 sheets contained usable data. Reviewers indicated a total of 12 ratings with possible comments for each abstract on machine scannable rating sheets specifically prepared for this use. Application of Cason and Cason's simplified model of their deterministic theory to reviews of abstracts resulted in good fit of the model to the data, and detection of significant inter-reviewer differences in individual reviewer's stringency. The availability of calibrated ratings, i.e. those from which these reviewer differences had been removed, greatly eased the task of the  Abstract Selection Committee. The Committee no longer needed to deal with ratings which were confounded with variation in reviewer standards. Abstract selection was based on ratings that more accurately reflected the true quality of the abstract without regard to who happened to have reviewed it. When the Abstract Selection Committee used these calibrated ratings in making selection decisions, there were great improvements in both the reliability (from .579 to .810) and validity (from .485 to .742) of the peer review process.

        "description":"A total of 1,487 eleventh grade students from the Hamburg (West Germany) school system were asked to complete four writing assignments used in an International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) study of writing assessment. In analyzing the writing samples, the study focused on: (1) between-rater effects; (2) within-rater effects; (3) between-assignment effects; and (4) within-student effects. Two independent sets of scores on a 5-point scale were awarded to each essay in accordance with the international scoring guides. Since a study of the above four factors involves a complex array of statistical analyses, researchers did not rely on parametric test models alone. They included more intuitive statistics such as percentage of perfect agreement  between two independent ratings and percentage of loose agreement defined as the percentage of differences between two ratings not greater than one percentage point. Results showed that there was not a single or simple answer to the reliability of measuring general writing achievement across the tasks used. Instead, the solution depended on the kind of assumptions about the tasks that one is prepared to make. Statistically, the answer was a function of whether within-student variation was considered as true variance or error. It was also concluded that 13 writing tasks would have been needed to obtain satisfactory generalizability. (KSA)",

Also, compared to 1981-82, a higher percentage of seniors has demonstrated competency at or above the 9.0 grade equivalent every year. Starting in 1986-87, AISD minimum competency requirements will be replaced by the Exit-level TEAMS. Students may be denied a diploma as a result of not passing Exit-level TEAMS. (Author/MDE)",

Half-day instructional time was 60% of that provided in full-day sessions, and with teaching staff increases, three times as many children (1,516) were served as in 1985-86 (494), including more bilingual and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. Pretest-posttest gains on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised evaluated half-day and full-day program effectiveness, measured against national average gains. Results showed that: (1) half-day program gains in English  vocabulary were generally two-thirds those of the full-day program; (2) the greater gains of full-day LEP students occurred at all achievement levels, but the difference appeared to be associated more with teacher experience than with amount of instructional time; (3) for non-LEP students, the difference was greatest for lower achieving students and tended to disappear for students scoring greater than about 80 at pretest; (4) there was little if any difference in the achievement gains of students in morning or afternoon classes; and (5) half-day classes may lead to somewhat lower attendance rates.

The eight dimensions rated were: (1) significance of the research; (2) clarity and reasonableness of the objectives; (3) appropriateness of the methodology; (4) adequacy and clarity of the budget; (5) potential for future extramural support; (6) applicant's experience; (7) review of the related literature; and (8) consistency of proposed research with the applicant's educational background and experience. Reliability coefficients across application periods, raters, and dimensions were obtained. The results of this study showed that evaluators of proposals submitted for  funding within a university were not likely to agree on their ratings within and across application periods. Brief suggestions regarding the future training of evaluators were made. (MDE)",

        "description":"This assessment of the climate of racial and ethnic attitudes in Howard Beach (New York) was conducted at John Adams High School, the public school attended by the greatest number of high school children in the Howard Beach community. The survey of 1,217 students was administered in December, 1986, several weeks before the incident in which a number of Blacks were beaten and one died in Howard Beach. Results of the survey revealed a significant amount of racial and ethnic tolerance as well as tensions. Large majorities of all White groups reported that neither they nor their parents discouraged contacts with non-Whites. While students report a high perception of tolerance in their home environment, in school many students perceived the existence of racial and ethnic problems. The  schools' three largest minority groups--Italians, Blacks, and Hispanics--elicited the highest rates of negative stereotyping. Findings demonstrated the complexity of prejudice. There was no consistent pattern of racial cleavage. (PS)",

These papers, consisting of a fact sheet, questions and answers, a prologue, and executive summary, describe the background of the CIE, its programs, and its support services network. The Scholarship-in-Escrow and School-to-Work Transition programs are described in detail. The Scholarship-in-Escrow Program is intended to encourage Cleveland Public School students to consider post-secondary  education. The program combines financial incentive, based on grades in prescribed academic subjects, with a comprehensive array of support services, both internal and external to the school district. The School-to-Work Transition Program is a partnership between the Cleveland Public Schools and the business community, designed to ease students' transition from school to the world of work, to focus the various employment programs that currently exist for students, and to meet the needs of businesses.

Thus, as a group, blacks have been written off as obsolete and useless. Most at risk for joining the underclass is the black male. Because of the way Western males are socialized to be strong and macho, and because of discrimination which does not allow black males to achieve the preferred male image, black men are dehumanized. An orderly process of socializing black youth is needed. They must be prepared for adulthood in a way that increases their self-esteem. The model for their training must be an Afrocentric one in which the elders of the community teach the youth to become responsible adults, and in which social  institutions provide life sustaining support.

Black youth are characterized as alienated, poor, poorly educated, and lacking safe housing. Government responses to the needs of these children are fraught with social barriers and bureaucracy. As in all institutional structures, social programs usually lose sight of their true mission. The contradictions that social institutions engender create a &quot;catch 22&quot; for blacks. Gains of the 1960s and 1970s have not eliminated injustices and inequalities. They have, however, weakened the black family. Solutions to these problems should include the following: (1) a redefined social agenda for blacks based on unity and self-determination; (2) the development  of a socially supportive environment for nurturing black children; (3) a cultural revolution which establishes a black identity and value system.

        "description":"This report reviews studies on social interactions in desegregated schools and synthesizes reports on differences in the experience of schooling of black females as compared to schooling of white females. The literature on the subject, though sparse, indicates that in the early grades both white and black females have a lot in common, despite some cultural differences in behavioral style. Teachers reinforce the academic behavior of white females and the social behavior of black females. Self-perceptions and evaluations of other pupils are affected by the teachers' differential treatment. By middle school, perceived similarity becomes an increasingly important criteria in friendship selection, so cross-racial friendships are inhibited. Females interact with a smaller number of  classmates than do males, further restricting cross-racial friendships. Teachers fail to teach bi-racial friendship strategies. On the whole, however, teachers are probably unaware of this differential treatment. The following recommendations for change are made: (1) teachers should be made aware of their behavior; (2) teachers should learn about the cultural and behavioral differences among children; and (3) future studies should determine whether differences between white and black females are a result of racial, social, class, or ethnic variables. A list of references is included. (PS)",

While the actual number of school children has declined, the proportion of minority students, poor students, and students from one parent families has grown steadily. Education must be reformed to address these populations with equity. Strategies which have been adopted, such as more student testing and more teacher evaluation, are not solutions which will help low-achieving students. Concern for female students has waned since the passage of Title IX, but girls and young women are still victims of sex stereotyping, which negatively affects their academic achievement. Recommendations for equity reforms are the following; (1) pass state laws which protect the rights of minorities and guarantee equal opportunities in education; (2)  bring community social service agencies, health centers, and recreational programs into the schools; (3) provide on-site day care for parenting students; (4) develop a school-to-work transition for low income-students; (5) create flexible learning opportunities such as part-time and night schools; (6) provide in-service and pre-service training to teachers in methods to overcome racism and sexism; (7) free all tests of bias; (8) improve the quality of instruction before raising requirements; (9) provide preschool enrichment programs; (10) encourage parental involvement; (11) improve school climate; (12) implement affirmative action; (13) provide technical assistance; and (14) make all school programs truly accessible.

        "description":"This report contains information on the participation of nonpublic school students in Chapter 1 programs. Regulations for Chapter 1 services require that all students have equitable access to them. In some school districts the nonpublic school population is not served because officials or parents of these schools do not want to participate. Since 1984-85, the number of districts providing Chapter 1 services to nonpublic school students has remained fairly constant, but the number of nonpublic school students participating in these services has decreased from 180,700 to 130,600. A Supreme Court decision in 1985 made many districts alter the location of Chapter 1 services, so that from 1984-85 to 1986-87, the proportion of districts that provided Chapter 1 instruction to nonpublic  school students inside the students' own nonpublic school decreased from 76 percent to 10 percent. Some of these students now receive Chapter 1 instruction in mobile vans or at another site because Chapter 1 teachers and aides can no longer give services inside schools affiliated with religious organizations. Another method of providing services is through technical means such as computer-based instruction. Twelve tables present the statistical data for Chapter 1 services. (VM)",

        "description":"It is traditional among some peoples of the world to celebrate an individual's coming-of-age with ritual. Through these ceremonies, and the tests which sometimes accompany them, a society socializes its youth and transforms them inwardly by molding their moral and mental disposition. Without such ritualization there is a breakdown in the continuity of culture. Since schools do not fulfill this function in American society it is necessary for families and communities to provide ceremonies which will mark the passage of children into adulthood. For black males this means that their community and family must teach the Afro-centric social philosophy which is a part of their cultural past. Memories of this past are fading as black communities deteriorate. This a crucial time to begin  incorporating traditional principles into the lives of black children. A process for doing this is the rite called Simba Wachanga. A network of organizations in the black community are practicing and promoting this ritual for black males. Simba Wachanga functions as a guidance system incorporating the following principles: (1) unity; (2) self-determination; (3) collective work and responsibility; (4) cooperative economics; (5) purpose; (6) creativity; and (7) faith.

Nine of these schools were included, also, in the earlier 1981-82 project; this publication, therefore, contains descriptions of only the 15 new achieving compensatory education-funded schools. Overall findings and conclusions, however, are based on all 24 schools. The goal of this study was to recognize successful Chapter 1 schools so that they can serve as models for other schools. All of these schools rated high on the following criteria: (1) strong academic emphasis; (2) ongoing monitoring of student needs; (3) instructional effectiveness for students and in-service training for teachers; and (4)  facilitating a classroom environment conducive to achievement. Fifteen case studies of effective Chapter 1 schools are presented. Descriptions of some of the schools' programs are provided. There are also discussions of particularly effective aspects of the programs at all the schools. Three appendices contain research instruments. Nine tables present data on the responses obtained on questionnaires and in interviews. A bibliography is included. (VM)",

Many of the requirements and criteria of Title 1 were relaxed in 1981 when Chapter 1 began. Districts are now required to submit written plans of their new Chapter 1 organization assuring the comparability of services between Chapter 1 and non-Chapter 1 schools. A majority of the states have now adopted less restrictive means of measuring comparability than allowed under Title 1. Variances between Chapter 1 and non-Chapter 1 schools in the same district have increased. Rules for the retention of comparability documentation have been relaxed, and the widely varying definitions of &quot;instructional staff&quot; among states is causing an imbalance of teachers between  Chapter 1 and non-Chapter 1 schools. This document, addressed to the U.S. Secretary of Education, recommends provisions at the federal level to require: (1) the retention of comparability documentation which demonstrates compliance, and (2) the defining of &quot;instructional staff,&quot; for use in demonstrating comparability in ratio of pupils to staff.

        "description":"The Single Parent/Displaced Homemaker Program at Gulf Coast Community College (Panama City, Florida) targeted a population of women who generally had a high school diploma and needed moral support, direction, and financial assistance in returning to college to pursue higher-level vocational programs. (Because citizens in the rural panhandle area served by the college are highly conservative, it is difficult to encourage women to go into nontraditional occupations, and almost impossible without assistance.) The project received approximately $37,000 to attempt to recruit 60-80 potential students and to place 70 percent of them in programs or courses that would eventually lead to employment for at least 29. The project far exceeded expectations in that 384 women were recruited. Of  those, 158 enrolled in a \"Returning Woman\" course or a vocational college program. Only 13 women received financial assistance. Since all programs are one-year certificate or two-year degree, no students had completed a training program for job placement at the time this report was written. Close linkages were developed with offices on campus such as student development, financial aid, Job Training Partnership Act, public relations, and lifelong learning. Networking with community agencies resulted in referrals and recruitment of advisory committee members. During the next year, emphasis will be placed on coordination of individual and group counseling with student development and community agencies, coordination of noncredit classes with the office of lifelong learning, and coordination  of financial assistance with the Job Training Partnership Act. (Attachments to the 14-page project report include project publicity, brochures, the module \"Math for Returning Women,\" correspondence, and forms.) (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine what distinguishes the practice of competent educators from that of untrained persons or colleagues who are less skilled. The population for the study was cooperative extension educators. Five individuals identified by district and state leaders as being exemplary in their practice were followed for three days each, during which observations were recorded and formal and informal interviews conducted. In most cases, it was possible to observe all the individuals involved in teaching, program planning, staff meetings, and intra-agency activities. The five educators were chosen from a larger group suggested by one or more of the leaders to represent a variety of roles, full- and part-time positions, geographic areas, and years of service. The tapes  and notes were transcribed and studied, revealing some common traits evident in these professional educators. The study found four primary themes that seemed to fit the educators: (1) an acute sense of context, (2) thoughtful loyalty to goals, (3) careful consideration of alternative means, and (4) reflective judgments based on balance. These themes did not exist in isolation, but were dynamically interwoven in the educators' personalities and teaching approaches. The study concluded that such reflective educational practices should be encouraged, and educators should be helped to remember the context of their work and to see themselves as facilitators. The appendix provides an example of one strategy toward educating a more reflective practitioner. (KC)",

The first section of the paper outlines the context of these communities, most of which are cooperatives. Before the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, most of the communities flourished. The next section explains what happened to these communities after the establishment of the State and the formation of more communities, some without ethnic or ideological continuity. The paper then focuses on some attempts made to rehabilitate the rural communities in distress, focusing on the social-communal sphere and using adult education as the major vehicle for rehabilitation. Five aspects of the effort to facilitate the  quick absorption of nonfarmers into the established mainstream of the farming cooperative community are listed; these mainly revolve around the amalgamation of different ethnic groups and the imposition of new models. Finally, attempts at rehabilitation are explained, with the caution that no attempt in the past seven years brought about a total recovery of the struggling communities. This section describes attempts to restore &quot;normal functioning&quot; to the communities through education and the role of the facilitators. It is pointed out that the facilitator's role is a very difficult one, suggesting that none of the attempts could be completely successful under present conditions. (KC)",

        "description":"The new information age society demands a new set of new survival skills. Instead of memorizing facts, students should learn how to gather useful information about work and leisure opportunities. The information-gathering skill can be creatively taught around any specific content area. Two areas that can effectively embody this type of instruction include work and leisure search education. Two new curricula emphasize this information search method: Pathways to Leisure and Pathways to Work. Portland State University has implemented a curriculum that integrates work and leisure searches in five area high schools. Graduate students support the high school teacher who chooses the specific transition curriculum. The leisure search introduces the student to self-assessment, surveying  opinions, gathering leads, networking, decision making, goal setting, and detailed planning. All of these self-directed hunting skills are taught in three major steps: self-assessment (identification of the target), research (refining and locating the target with the help of local advisors), and connecting to one's target (setting goals and making plans to achieve them). Self-directed behavior is a major program goal, since students are taught how to find information in a systematic and persistent fashion. In an information age, the major survival skill is not getting information, but getting to the right information or knowing the best way to collect information. (YLB)",

        "description":"Since teams perform a majority of mission-critical Navy tasks, a significant applied research problem is how to compose maximally effective task teams. Two problems have traditionally hindered the attainment of this goal: how to compose teams on bases other than ability or technical skill and how to classify team tasks, so that predictions can be made regarding performance in specific task environments. Recent research regarding the structure of personality suggests the possibility of composing groups in a more systematic way. Factor analytic studies of the trait vocabulary suggest some consensus that personality can be classified in terms of six broad dimensions: intellectance, adjustment, prudence, ambition, sociability, and likability. A means of classifying team tasks is also  necessary to evaluate the relationship between personality and team performance. This is critical because the relationship of personality and team effectiveness depends substantially on the properties of the team task being performed. A task typology has been developed that is compatible with this model of personality. Putting this system for classifying task environments together with the new perspective on personality structure allows specific predictions to be made regarding team composition and team performance. Those predicted relations provide clear guidelines for selecting and training Navy team members. (YLB)",

The report examines the nature and history of technological change, its impact on large and small firms and their workers, and its policy implications. The paper stresses that individuals, schools, firms, and public agencies must recognize the importance of basic skills in adapting to change. It urges parents to monitor the schools and help them provide their children with the reading, writing, and problem-solving skills needed to enter and remain in the economic mainstream. The report notes that firms consistently offer to provide specific training to motivated new workers with basic skills. In addition, federal programs such as the Job  Training Partnership Act and Trade Adjustment Assistance are needed to assist displaced workers. However, it was found that major programs providing incentives for companies specifically to retrain their workers in new technologies have yet to be developed at the federal level (although several states have initiated such programs). The report concludes that government at all levels should aid industries and individuals adjusting to new technologies; however, those assisted must use available resources conscientiously to help themselves.

After presenting six basic elements of Judaism, the paper raises the question of whether there exists a continuity from the Jewish conception of lifelong education to its actual shape in modern Israel. An analysis is made of the adult/lifelong education provided by the Kibbutz and Moshav movements, the Israel Defence Forces, and women's voluntary organizations. A discussion of the contradictory faces of the Israeli person reveals some of the inconsistencies in the planning and provision of adult/lifelong education. The last section of the paper deals with three dilemmas: first, the rather unauthentic meaning of the concept of lifelong education in Israel  today; second, the issue of the Text and the Rabbi; and third, the limits of change.

        "description":"The Memphis-Project Literacy U.S. (M-PLUS) coalition tried the reading immersion concept with a defined target audience in the workplace. Fifty-six employees of the Defense Depot and the City of Memphis (Tennessee) were admitted to the program based on test scores of between 2.0 and 7.0 grade levels on the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test. The program was conducted onsite in the workplace by trained teachers. Instruction was conducted about 6.5 hours per day for two weeks, in small groups based on reading grade level. The program used a diagnostic-prescriptive approach to reading instruction. Group sessions were conducted using job- and community-related materials such as maps, forms, charts, and graphs. Instructional methods consisted of assisted reading, silent reading, oral  reading, phonics, small group reading, and completion of practice exercises. Standardized instruments were used to evaluate the program and its participants. As a result of the program, mean reading scores for the participants increased, and participants indicated a positive attitude toward education. Some of the lessons learned about teaching in the workplace were the following: (1) initiation of programs must begin at the top; (2) motivation to learn was increased when family and friends were involved in the program; (3) literacy consciousness often transferred from classroom to home and workplace; (4) adult learners must feel some input to the content/methods of their learning; (5) neither testing nor years of formal schooling are a good indicator of reading skill; and (6) the  immersion reading program stimulated many to continue their learning. Finally, the study cautioned that educators must be wary of labeling students as illiterate or aliterate. (KC)",

        "description":"In 1983, Congress established the Veterans' Job Training Act (VJTA) Program to provide stable and permanent employment for Korean Conflict and Vietnam era veterans who have been unemployed for long periods of time. About 99 percent of VJTA participants are male, 81 percent are white, 90 percent are at least high school graduates, and over 80 percent served in the Vietnam era. The average age for participants was 40, and those veterans who have had higher rates of unemployment since separation from military service or who have had longer periods of civilian labor force experience appear less likely to participate in the program. About 66 percent of participants enter occupations in the machine trades, structural work occupations, or professional/technical/managerial positions. The  average hourly wage received by participants during training is $6.32, with completers averaging about $6.60 during training. About 40 percent of nondisabled participants complete training. The average cost per participant in $3,000 ($5,000 per completer). About one year after having completed the program, veterans average an 11 percent increase in their employment rate and a $45 weekly gain in earnings (for a total of $280). About 50 percent of the completers were still employed 16 months after completing the program.

Existing programs were reviewed and private sector input was sought in developing the curriculum and identifying needed equipment and facilities. The curriculum developed by the task force is included in this document, presented in three sections. The first section covers general business/industry trends; the laser technician; the laser/electro-optics technology program; program competencies; course competencies; special laboratory equipment; articulation; and a proposed second-year course listing. The second section lists the educational  specifications for laser/electro-optics technology, and the final section specifies equipment needed for the program. Appendixes to the report list the task force members, describe the literature search, and provide a task listing with manufacturers' ratings of their relative importance.

Information for the guide was obtained by asking teachers from every postsecondary vocational school in Kentucky to respond to a questionnaire listing mathematics competencies for their specialty by marking each competency as &quot;needed&quot; or &quot;not needed.&quot; The guide is organized in four sections. The first section provides a background for understanding and using the handbook information. The &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; of what was done are explained in this section. The second section deals with the mathematics competencies for the four programs. Listed are common competencies, competencies specific to programs, and information on using the  competency information. Since it may be difficult to visualize a mathematics competency, the third section gives two examples for each mathematics competency selected by the instructors. The fourth section contains resource information provided by the vocational educators.

Materials are designed specifically to address the need for training volunteers in the subtleties of working with host country bureaucracies and counterparts. Although intended for inservice training, the materials can be incorporated into preservice training. A trainer reference for bureaucratic effectiveness and working with counterparts is designed to help the trainer become familiar with the manual. It also offers guidelines on how to prepare oneself for the role. Sections cover methodology, structure, responsibilities of the trainer, suggestions for the trainer, training techniques, assessment, and glossary of training terms. The two  modules--bureaucratic effectiveness and working with counterparts--are each divided into sessions. Each session is divided into rationale for training session, goals, trainer preparation for session, materials needed, prepared newsprint/blackboard, handouts, and procedures. Any required handouts are provided. Topics of bureaucratic effectiveness are introduction, dominant features of the bureaucracy, and strategies for bureaucratic effectiveness. The module on working with counterparts includes theories of motivation, action strategies for increasing effectiveness of counterpart relationships, and counterpart management and feedback. (YLB)",

The manual describes and discusses simple, low-cost, local resources that may be available to the community. When applied through a home garden, these resources can help ensure a continuous supply of food and therefore improved health. The information presented attempts to reflect the realities of a typical rural situation in the humid tropics in which a trainee will most probably work. The manual is organized in three sections. The first section provides a listing of the tasks that need to be done in order to conduct a workshop. Also included is a complete bibliography for all  reference materials needed and samples of invitation letters, evaluations, and other items. The second section contains the schedule and an outline for each session in the training program. Written in the form of lesson plans, the session outlines suggest topics and activities and some problem-solving assignments. The final section is designed to provide the trainee with a general outline for producing crops in a mixed garden system. An appendix contains numerous references for additional study. (KC)",

A list of performance objectives by skill group is included, and information is also provided on staffing and the training farm. Part II includes the overall training schedule, which lists session by session, week by week, the titles, the times, and the place of each training session. It also includes notes about contingencies, livestock care, and revisions in the schedule. The training program calendar lists tasks that must be accomplished by the week. Part III is divided into weeks. Each week includes the schedule and the session designs for that week. Part IV includes the program specific training sessions for the TEFL/Crossover program (as Appendix A), an alternate schedule, job descriptions, an alternate staffing pattern, evaluation forms and tests, a glossary of  technical vocabulary in Thai and English, and a section on language sessions, cross-cultural sessions, role in development sessions, home-stay, and a list of resources.

These two phenomena cause serious social problems, including high levels of unemployment, downward occupational mobility, and a significant increase in earnings inequality. To combat deindustrialization and economic dualism, government at the federal and state levels will need to intervene more directly in the private market. Three types of policies are required: an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, an industrial policy that includes various forms of short-run \"protectionism,\" and a restructuring of the lower mode of the labor market. Sole reliance on the demand side of the market is not enough. To eliminate  structural unemployment, reorganizing the job distribution and retraining the labor force must be pursued simultaneously. To accommodate the trend toward frequent occupational changes during a worker's lifetime, education and training must take on the dimension of lifelong learning. The government must find new sources of revenue for this expanded education and training effort. One proposed plan would make the government an \"equity investor\" in human capital. This investment might take the form of education and training in state accredited vocational or higher education programs, and the recipients would repay the government through a surcharge on the regular federal income tax.

Findings of interviews with 48 administrators indicated they held different meanings for the phrase. About three-fourths expressed a concept of equality (educational programs guided by notions of sameness, likeness, proportionateness). The remainder voiced a meaning of equity (distribution of resources in relation to educationally relevant characteristics of students). Administrators identified a wide variety of personal and professional experiences as factors that contributed to their interpretation; reported that equity entered into decisions relating to personnel, students, and curriculum; and suggested  processes to use to indicate the status of equity in vocational education. They identified five categories of factors that facilitate the provision of equity in vocational education and seven categories of factors that serve as barriers to the provision. Administrators felt progress had been made in equity-related policies and practices in vocational education and placed responsibility for equity in vocational education with people in a variety of positions. Their meanings of equity were correlated significantly with their location. (The instrument and 12 data tables are appended.) (YLB)",

Three substudies had their own research methodologies, data gathering, and conclusions. The first substudy identified categories, called determinants, of societal changes that might affect future postsecondary vocational education and assumptions regarding those determinants. It provided an assumed context within which postsecondary vocational education will operate. The second substudy identified categories of curriculum characteristics that could be used to define specifically a desired curriculum and about which decision makers must make choices. The third substudy gathered data from key decision-making groups regarding their  perceptions of curriculum characteristics that would be desirable for Minnesota's area vocational-technical institutes in 2000 and described differences among the perceptions of those groups. The study developed (1) assumptions about the future social context of postsecondary vocational education, (2) a list of characteristics that can be manipulated to adapt curriculum, and (3) a scenario for the future based on those assumptions and characteristics.

Emphasis was on smaller rural school districts that may not otherwise be able to support a total full-time program. Nine factors listed by Thomas and Peterson (1984) were examined. A survey instrument was distributed to superintendents, high school principals, and school board chairpersons in Area Education Agency 7 in Northeast Iowa. Survey findings supported very strongly six of the nine factors of perceived cost-benefit relationship for offering jointly administered vocational programs: low risks, substantial proportion of students served, efficiency of scale and smaller financial burdens, no  duplication of services, perceived important, and representation and cost assessment. Three areas appeared several times to show less agreement: low costs, financial arrangements based on exchange, and cost distribution based on equality. Conclusions were that low costs were of less concern to school board presidents than offering high quality vocational programs. Data strongly supported the belief that vocational programs in high schools were important. (Study correspondence and the instrument are appended.) (YLB)",

The report first assesses costs and returns on a per-unit basis, such as one acre or one animal, under three sections of a budget: cash receipts, cash expenses, and economic costs. The budgets are based on national weighted-average estimates of all costs associated with the particular enterprise. The 1986 summary is followed by an explanation of account structure, the procedures and methodology used, how to use the data, and the budgets themselves. Some of the highlights of the report are the following: (1) production costs and the costs of investing in machinery and buildings declined in 1986; (2) these reductions combined with higher government payments  to moderate declines in the value of commodities at the marketplace; (3) cash receipts per acre fell for all crops except peanuts, sugar beets, and sugar cane; (4) declining feed costs and higher hog prices helped many hog producers' returns exceed expenses; (5) sheep ranchers saw strengthened returns mainly because of reduced expenses; (6) the drop in feed costs helped beef producers improve net cash returns despite their lowest receipts since 1978; (7) U.S. farmers planted about 5.6 million fewer acres; total crop production declined: feed grain output fell 8 percent, oilseed output dropped 6 percent, and food grain output fell 13 percent.

The project attempted to bring inservice vocational teacher certification programs in the state in close approximation with school-based &quot;induction&quot; and &quot;continuing professional development&quot; programs. During the project, a process was developed and built into the present certification program to facilitate a formative approach and serve as a bridge between level I and level II certification. Instructional materials (modules) were developed for use in Temple's existing vocational teacher certification  program and vocational teacher educator staff development program. Temple teacher education faculty and staff were trained in the process, which was pilot tested at selected field sites in eastern Pennsylvania. The modules developed in this project make up a large portion of this document. The modules focus on (1) developing a lesson plan to guide group instruction, and (2) facilitating a Council of Educators' review.

All of these programs had placement rates higher than those of Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA)-funded demonstrations, and only two of the programs for  which a wage replacement ratio could be calculated had ratios below that of the CETA demonstrations. Persons in technical occupations appeared to have the least trouble finding new jobs or regaining their old jobs and thus needed such programs less than did persons in nontechnical jobs. It was also found that many eligible workers from given plants never take advantage of dislocated worker programs. The recruitment efforts of programs that were either plant or industry specific tended to rely on management or union involvement, whereas those that were not specific to one plant or industry tended to revolve around the print and television media. None of the programs studied had any educational, attitudinal, or motivational screening procedures. Although the services offered varied widely  from program to program, no program offered only a single service, and all the programs offered flexibility and freedom of choice to workers availing themselves of program services.

The curriculum outlined is based on prewriting, writing, and rewriting and on using sample entry-level resumes to illustrate basic resume do's and don'ts. The first section outlines the importance of good resumes and the pitfalls of having vocational students use either standardized, fill-in-the-blank type resumes or the customized resumes that are often produced by writing services or through resume workshops. The resume-writing process proposed entails (1) a prewriting stage, in which students must develop vocabulary to describe their abilities and attitudes; (2) a proof stage, in which students identify indicators proving their claims of possessing a certain skill; (3) a writing  stage, in which students draft a resume describing the skills they have identified by using clusters of pertinent verbs, names of tools and specific skills, names of pieces of special equipment, and words describing various special skills; (4) a reading stage, in which students read sample resumes to identify more vocabulary, alternative ways of highlighting different types of skills, and weaknesses and strengths of different types of resumes; and (5) a writing and editing stage, in which students are told to write at least three drafts of their resume. Two alternatives to full-blown resumes, the work strengths summary and job wanted cards, are also discussed as alternatives for use with special education students or in vocational programs that do not lend themselves to having students  develop complete resumes.

        "description":"Sexual harassment is one concern of women graduate students in community psychology programs. When a sexual relationship exists between male faculty and female students, the distribution of power reflects the subordinate status of women and the dominant position of men. Many studies have documented the negative consequences of sexual contact between faculty and students. Walker, Erickson, and Woolsey (1985) suggest three sets of ethical issues raised by such contact: (1) unwanted sexual advances limit the victim's ability to choose when and with whom she will have a sexual relationship; (2) sexualization of a professional relationship interferes with mentoring; and (3) the mentor abuses his power to obtain personal gratification. Sexual harassment within academia may be  understood within a framework which suggests that competing moralities are likely to perpetuate such behaviors. A lack of understanding between men and women about what a common set of behaviors means and a difference in perspectives on the role of relationships in the work environment may result in conflict. Community psychology programs can create an environment compatible with the needs of women students by recognizing faculty responsibility to provide equal opportunity to female graduate students in a climate free from sexual intimidation and by calling on universities to foster an empowering climate for these students.

        "description":"Bulman and Wortman's (1977) study of severe accident victims showed that victims who blamed themselves as the cause of the accident were more likely to receive higher coping ratings from a nurse or social worker, while victims who blamed others for the accident or who saw the accident as avoidable were more likely to be rated as having coped poorly. The present study attempted to replicate this self-blame-coping relationship. Interviews were conducted with 31 spinal cord injured patients within 18 months of the injury. Nurses, occupational therapists, and physical therapists who worked with the patients completed questionnaires. Questionnaires included the Bulman and Wortman items, the Profile of Mood States, and the Causal Dimension Scale. Subjects reported a moderate amount of  self-blame, and behavioral self-blame was most common. Alcohol use prior to the accident was the best predictor of self-blame. The results found no support for the functionality of self-blame for effective coping. Patients were judged to be coping effectively when they were happy, did not blame others, did not blame chance, were alone at the time of the accident, and attributed blame to circumstances for the accidental event. Blaming another was related to poorer coping. Alternative explanations that mood, control, and perceived avoidability mediate the relationship between self-blaming attributions and coping were not supported. (NB)",

Twenty-four subjects each interacted individually with four other subjects for a total of 96 pairs. The interactions consisted of an interview, an assembly task in which the boss instructed the employee, and a decision-making task. Subjects completed four questionnaires at the end of each task on which they rated their feelings about themselves during the task, their feelings about the other person, how they thought the other person felt about  them, and how they thought the other persons felt about themselves. The results showed that subordinates were more sensitive to how their leaders felt about them (the subordinates), and leaders were more sensitive to how their subordinates felt about themselves. These differences are discussed in relation to the role requirements of leader and subordinate. (Author/NB)",

Participants were 36 pediatric cancer patients and their families under active treatment at Roswell Park Memorial Institute, a comprehensive cancer research and treatment center in Buffalo, New York. The Coping Inventory, Ways of Coping Scale, Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Inventory, and a Medical Index were used to assess patient's coping competence and medical experience as well as each parent's coping strategies and marital satisfaction ratings. The results revealed that coping competence was positively related to age among males while coping among females appeared to be independent of age. Self-coping among patients appeared to be  strongly and negatively affected primarily by treatment side effects. The quality of the parents' marital relationship was significantly related to the child's coping competence, while parental coping strategies appeared to have much less influence. The findings raise questions about the potential benefits of intervening solely at the level of parental coping, at least when the intent is to improve the child's adjustment to illness. The results suggest that family health interventions need to be specific with regard to target outcomes at the individual, family sub-unit, and overall family levels. (NB)",

Role conflict, stress, and burnout indices were most strongly and positively associated with the WC scales of Confrontive Coping, Distancing, Accepting Responsibility, and Escape-Avoidance scales, and negatively associated with the Planful Problem-Solving scale. Type of coping response was differentially related to the level of reported stress and burnout.

For girls, popularity with peers assumes high priority, while for boys popularity seems to be secondary to other values established in childhood. A study was conducted to examine the relationship between popularity and adjustment, as measured by self-image, for adolescent boys and girls. Data were obtained on 106 suburban adolescents who participated in a larger longitudinal study of adolescent adjustment and development. Subjects rated self-perceptions of peer group acceptance during the spring of seventh grade. In the fall of eighth grade, subjects completed the Self-Image Questionnaire for Young Adolescents. The results showed that popularity was more consistently related to adjustment (self-image) for  girls than for boys. Gender differences were observed with regard to four aspects of self-image: emotional tone, body image, coping and mastery, and (less) psychopathology. Popularity was significantly related to these aspects of self-image for girls, but not for boys. The analyses showed that perceptions of low popularity were related to low self-image on these four scales for girls, but not for boys. (Six figures of data are included.) (Author/NB)",

Fusion in relationships is defined as two incomplete people coming together in an attempt to make one more complete whole, the merging of two ego boundaries. The six phases discussed include ecstacy, getting married, the routine, depression/withdrawal, pulling apart/conflict, and ecstacy, again. Attention is focused on clinical considerations and therapeutic interventions. There is discussion of norms within the lesbian subculture that reinforce unhealthy patterns, diagnostic concerns, special treatment concerns when working with gay clients' and innovative treatment strategies. Clinical case examples highlighting both the dysfunctional aspects of these relationships as well as the potential  for healthy outcomes for the women and/or the relationship are discussed. The paper contends that approaching the treatment with certain assumptions of health and potential for growth may allow many couples to have the opportunity to flourish individually while remaining with their lover. It concludes that, regardless of how long a couple remains in treatment, the therapist has an important opportunity to educate the women about their potential for mental health. (ABL)",

This study focused on the role of affect in mediating the effects of externally communicated expectancies on intrinsic motivation. College students (N=84) were given positive, neutral, or negative mood inductions prior to an expectancy manipulation. Expectancy subjects were given a performance prediction; No Expectancy subjects were not. All subjects worked on two sets of puzzles separated by a midgame questionnaire. Intrinsic motivation was measured during a free choice period. The results showed  that arousal emerged as the critical mediator of task interest. Both happy and sad manipulations significantly altered arousal, and arousal appeared to have eliminated typical expectancy effects among both high and low achievers. These findings support a model of intrinsic motivation in which the arousal component of affect is a critical process variable. (NB)",

The results revealed a significant main effect for  smoking status on internal attributions. Ex-smokers made higher internal attributions for success than did smokers for failure to quit. The interaction of the motivational orientation with status was significant in that smokers in the intrinsic conditions made higher internal attributions for their failure than did smokers in the extrinsic group. Patients' success or failure in quitting influenced their attributions independently of treatment condition.

Subjects (N=137) had been assigned to one of three experimental conditions: (1) nicotine gum and a self-help manual with an intrinsic motivational orientation; (2) self-help manual with an intrinsic motivational orientation only; and (3) nicotine gum and a self-help manual with an extrinsic motivational orientation. Fifty patients quit smoking and returned for follow-up interviews. At each interview subjects rated how much their non-smoking or their return to smoking was  influenced by their own efforts, their abilities, an unexpected event, or their doctor. Abstainers made more internal attributions and lower attributions to chance than did relapsers. Abstainers also gave credit to their physicians for success. Relapsers blamed unexpected events for their failure but did not fault their doctor. Treatment manipulation influenced attributions in that extrinsic gum abstainers attributed their success to chance more than did intrinsic abstainers. These findings suggest that relapsers given an intrinsic self-help manual may be best prepared to try quitting again since they blamed neither themselves nor their doctor, but attributed their failure to chance.

Findings reported cover the high school classes of 1975 through 1986 and come from the national project, Monitoring the Future: A Continuing Study of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth. Findings on the prevalence of, and trends in, drug use and related factors are reported separately for high school seniors and for two subsamples of young adults who had participated in the study as high school seniors: young adults post-high school and college students. Trend data are presented for varying time intervals. For high school seniors, drug use by grade level, degree and duration of drug highs, attitudes and beliefs about drugs, and the social milieu are also  examined. A section entitled &quot;Other Findings From the Study&quot; explores the use of nonprescription stimulants, daily use of marijuana, medically supervised use of psychotherapeutic drugs, correlates of cigarette smoking, and other data on correlates and trends. Eleven separate classes of drugs are discussed: (1) marijuana (including hashish); (2) inhalants; (3) hallucinogens; (4) cocaine (including crack); (5) heroin; (6) other natural and synthetic opiates; (7) stimulants; (8) sedatives; (9) tranquilizers; (10) alcohol; and (11) cigarettes. Separate statistics are presented for several subclasses of drugs. Estimates adjusted for absentees and dropouts are appended. Forty data tables and 65 figures are included. (NB)",

In addition to annual surveys of high school seniors, the project includes follow-up surveys extending to 10 years after graduation. This paper provides the first reporting of Monitoring the Future follow-up data on important lifestyle experiences, values, and aspirations during the 6 years following high school graduation. Among the variables covered are marital and parental status, residence and living arrangements, educational plans and experiences, employment status and experience, earnings and sources of income, political and religious  orientations, and patterns of recreational behavior. A brief section on methods provides an overview of the study design; further detail is provided in Appendix A. A section entitled &quot;Analysis Strategy&quot; specifies the sets of respondents included in the analyses and the variables used to define subgroups of special interest. This section should be reviewed before using the material in Appendix B. Appendix B contains the most extensive and detailed data, consisting of frequency distributions and means for a wide range of questions asked of follow-up respondents.

        "description":"The Monitoring the Future project was created to assess the changing lifestyles, values, and preferences of American youth on a continuing basis. Trends in marijuana use and related attitudes were investigated, and alternative hypotheses about the linkage between attitudes and behaviors were examined. Data were obtained using questionnaires administered to nationwide samples of approximately 17,000 high school seniors annually from 1976 through 1985. Trend data showed that perceived risks and personal disapproval increased steadily from 1978 onward, whereas actual use of marijuana reached peak levels in 1978-79 and then declined during the early 1980s. Subgroup trend analyses revealed that when attitudes were held constant there was no decline in rate of marijuana use, supporting  the hypothesis that the overall decline found in the total samples was attributable to changes in perceived risk and disapproval. Reversing the subgroup trend analysis procedure, by holding constant the levels of use, provided no support for the alternative hypothesis that changes in use caused the trends in attitudes. The findings are useful theoretically because they indicate that in this area attitudes seem to shape behaviors, rather than the reverse. For those involved in prevention efforts, the findings suggest that realistic information about risks and consequences can play an important role in reducing the demand for drugs. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"To explore costs and benefits of part-time work for high school students, survey responses of high school seniors from the classes of 1980 through 1984 were examined, distinguishing between those working many hours, those working fewer hours, and those not employed. Because hours of work differed by sex and by college plans, most analyses controlled for those factors. Work intensity, or number of hours worked, was positively related to perceptions of stress and interference with social life, but also to perceptions of increased contact with those of other ages and social backgrounds, as well as with the acquisition and use of skills. Most high school seniors saw little or no connection between their present work and their long-range aspirations. Substantial portions of earnings  were spent on discretionary items. There was weak evidence supporting the view that working interfered with school. There were no relationships between work intensity and psychological variables such as self-esteem. Work intensity was positively correlated with aggressive and delinquent behaviors; victimization; and use of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Although the evidence is mixed, it appears likely that some undesirable consequences are caused rather directly by working long hours in part-time jobs while still in high school. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"During the past decade there have been several important trends in drug use. Cigarette use peaked in 1976 and 1977 and declined thereafter. Marijuana use rose through 1978 and 1979 and then began to decline. Cocaine use rose until 1981 and has remained constant since. This study examined findings from 12 nationwide surveys representing the high school graduating classes of 1975 through 1986 to consider whether the shifts in drug use could be attributed to overall upward and downward trends in correlates of drug use and/or to changes in the patterns of correlations. The results showed drug use to be above average among subjects who had trouble adjusting to the educational environment, spent many evenings out for recreation, had heavy time commitments to a job, and had relatively  high incomes. Drug use continued to be below average among those with strong religious commitments and those with conservative political views. Some shifts were found in the strength of certain variables' correlations with drug use. Both political conservatism and religious commitment have become less closely linked to drug use, particularly to marijuana use. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Regardless of their marital status earlier in life, most women can expect to be single for some of their old age. In addition, older single women often have reduced resources. Many women now face situations unlike their expectations when they chose their life courses. Such a situation is shared by a unique community of Catholic sisters. Changes in the church since 1965 and societal changes resulting in fewer women entering religious life could not have been anticipated by older church members. Members (N=431) of one Catholic congregation of sisters completed questionnaires on change; attitudes toward work, aging, and retirement; life events; and resources. Personal interviews were conducted with 30 of the sisters. The results indicated that the respondents dealt with issues  facing many older women today and affecting more women in the future. All sisters had had a continuous work history prior to retirement. While some respondents had held professional positions, others held nonprofessional jobs. Wages had been low and subjects were financially ill-prepared for retirement. With decreasing numbers of new members to provide security to old members, the expected care may not be available when needed. The findings suggest that experience with change through the life cycle facilitates retirement and aging adjustment. Far from being at the mercy of institutional and societal change, these women instead provide a model of successful aging. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Research examining alcohol consumption by using Rotter's Internal-External Locus of Control Scale has reported conflicting results, possibly related to comparisons of clinical groups of alcoholics with nonclinical light drinkers or to an overuse of correlational statistics and a lack of appropriate controls. This study sampled a wide range of ages within a homogeneous population of nonclinical drinkers to assess the relationship between internal-external control, reasons for drinking, and alcohol consumption. Male (N=72) and female (N=105) college students from California State University at Chico completed Rotter's Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, the Questionnaire of Habitual Alcohol Use, and a Reasons For Drinking checklist. The results revealed that younger males  drank significantly more and were significantly more external than were older males, suggesting that earlier studies of males in which age was not controlled may have reported spurious correlations. Young female heavy drinkers were more external than their light drinking peers. The Internal-External scale was found to be an ineffective predictor of alcohol consumption. The Reasons For Drinking scale was found to discriminate between young light and heavy drinkers, suggesting that it may be useful as a predictor of alcohol consumption. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Pomeroy House, a long-term residential treatment program in San Francisco, California, was created to help recovering alcoholic mothers and their children. Eight to 10 families stay at Pomeroy House for a minimum period of 6 months with extensions of up to 9 or 12 months, and the alcoholic mothers care for their children while recovering from alcoholism. If a mother decides to stay the later three to six months, she must be involved in school, employment, or volunteer work. Mothers and children receive group counseling, alcohol education, individual counseling, family therapy, mother-child interaction group counseling, and family and parenting classes. Alcoholic mothers and their children face many problems: (1) newly recovering mothers are often overwhelmed by guilt concerning  abuse or neglect of their children while drinking; (2) alcoholism affects the health of mothers and children; (3) the recovery of mothers and children is often affected by the trauma of family violence; (4) many alcoholic women are polydrug abusers; (5) two generations of children of alcoholic parents often comprise the clients at Pomeroy House; and (6) the impoverishment of women and children is a serious problem. Abstinence alone does not guarantee happiness. Mothers who are overprotective, withdrawn and depressed, narcissistic, or aggressive and controlling need to change destructive patterns of communicating and relating to their children. The children, in turn, may have trouble relating to and trusting others, including their mother. Pomeroy House helps mothers and children learn  positive interactions and experience a healthy relationship. (NB)",

The structure of the West German Ministry for Youth, Family and Health is explained and responsibilities of the Ministry's five departments are discussed. The Youth Welfare Act is reviewed briefly and outstanding characteristics of youth work in the Federal Republic of Germany are identified. The German definition of youth, broader and more specific than the United States definition, is explained and age categories from babies to young adults are listed. Rights of individuals at  different ages are described. Involvement of the church and trade unions with youth through residential youth facilities is discussed. The importance of the family is emphasized, differences between family life in the United States and Germany are explored, and marriage and family law in Germany is discussed. The report concludes that the quantitative and qualitative social services differences between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States are significant and that the existing system in the United States is inefficient compared to that of Germany.

        "description":"This study examined the effectiveness of the addition of a cognitive intervention based on individualized assessment to a behavioral intervention for obesity. Overweight subjects (N=63) were randomly assigned to either a behavioral intervention or a behavioral intervention combined with a cognitive intervention which focused on changing specific maladaptive self-statements related to weight loss. Physiological, behavioral, and cognitive measures were used to assess change between pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up. The hypothesis that behavioral and cognitive intervention would result in greater weight loss and reduction in body fat than the behavioral intervention alone was not supported at posttest or at follow-up. The hypothesis that both treatments would show  significant differences between time points on behavioral measures was supported. Two hypotheses examined the construct validity of the cognitive intervention and the generalizability of the cognitive intervention. Both conditions showed changes over time on cognitive measures, but differences between the treatments were not significant. Future research on the effectiveness of cognitive interventions in the area of weight loss should include measures other than those that are weight-related, longer follow-ups, and sufficient amounts of cognitive therapy to allow clients to fully integrate the cognitive dialogues into their everyday lives.

The Kaschak-Sharratt Sex-Role Inventory (KSSRI) was developed as a Spanish-language instrument appropriate for use in a Latin American culture. This study investigated situational demands or context and their effect upon gender roles by administering the KSSRI to 50 male and 50 female Costa Rican university students from three universities. Subjects completed the KSSRI three times, imagining themselves in a social situation with a male friend, a female friend, or one male and one female friend. While overall scores for females were consistently androgynous and achieved by high scores in both masculinity and femininity, females did  score higher in femininity in the situation involving the presence of a male and in-between in situations with both sexes present, supporting the notion that for women, the presence of a male results not in lowered masculine behaviors, but in increased feminine behaviors. Males scored significantly higher in masculinity in the situation involving a male friend than in one involving a female friend. The findings suggest that the presence of a male calls forth gender role stereotyped behavior in both females and males and that the presence of males alone or in a mixed situation limits feminine attributions for men.

Both behavior therapy and pharmacotherapy can be effective in reducing the intensity of agoraphobic symptoms. There are promising new developments, however, from a family systems perspective. Researchers are finding that an agoraphobic's marriage and family relationships are profoundly relevant to understanding this disorder and the long-term results of treatment. Four empirically supported propositional statements are relevant to the role of family interactional factors in agoraphobia: (1) agoraphobia occurs in highly complementary relationships, particularly marriages organized according to traditional sex-roles; (2) close relatives of agoraphobics, particularly their spouses, often are  reported to have equally serious problems; (3) agoraphobic symptoms arise in response to real or anticipated changes in vital relationships and function to preserve former patterns; and (4) symptomatic improvement may have negative repercussions in the family system. Two interactional systems models which most readily accommodate these findings are the functional/structural view and the accidental/sequential model. Therapists must address the question of which levels of system-individual, couple patient-family, or patient-family-helpers, have priority for intervention under what circumstances. Implicit in the interactional systems view is the idea that broader levels of context are most relevant. (NB)",

        "description":"In March of 1985, the Massachusetts Department of Correction opened Longwood Treatment Center, the state's first minimum security prison designed exclusively to detain and provide alcoholism education and treatment to multiple drunken driving offenders. A process evaluation of the program revealed that the program was implemented as planned and served the intended target population. Preliminary outcome measures revealed that 6% of program participants were returned to prison within one year of release, compared to a department wide recidivism rate of 25% and to a rate of 19% for other low security institutions similar to Longwood. Issues raised from the evaluation resulted in recommendations that aftercare services be strengthened, counseling and correction staffs be  restructured, and operating costs be reevaluated. The findings suggest that the program was effective in reducing recidivism among multiple drunk drivers and in impacting on offenders' alcoholic behaviors. This evaluation report of the Longwood Program includes an overview of the program and sections on research methodology, historical developments, the program philosophy, the population served, a description of the program in operation, outcome measures of program effectiveness, a program cost analysis, and conclusions and recommendations.

This study investigated factors that might influence the career aspirations of children across a broad age spectrum. Students (N=150) from grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 completed questionnaires which assessed their job aspirations, their reasons for wanting a particular job, and their expectations for achieving their career goal. Subjects also completed the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. Parents of the students completed questionnaires on their aspirations and expectations for their child's career goals and provided information on their own occupation, income level, and education level. Regression analyses were  employed to correlate variables with one another. Analyses revealed four variables as significant predictors of the subjects' job aspirations: sex of the student, parent's job aspiration for the student, family income level, and mother's occupation. Student self-concept did not significantly predict job aspirations for all subjects. Analyses of each age and sex separately indicated varied and interesting patterns of results. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Economic analysis of alcohol and drug treatment services usually focuses on understanding the private, profit-oriented, hospital-based setting. Professional publications of the alcoholism treatment field, as well as popular press and electronic media exposure, also focus heavily on the private system. Low cost, quality treatment services, however, are funded by all levels of government and are widely available. These public programs constitute a major national asset that parallels the private sector in scope and importance. The private and public sectors must work cooperatively to consolidate current gains in alcohol and drug treatment as groundwork for a permanent, integrated network of services. The network of community-based programs which comprise the public sector includes  an eclectic array of providers that rely on the less costly, non-medical, social model approach to recovery. While the private sector focuses on treatment, the public sector targets significant resources at school-based and community prevention services. Such preventive activities can have a major impact on containing the progression of alcohol- and drug-related damages and, therefore, the costs to the health care system and society. The public treatment sector has provided substantial benefits to the public welfare. Careful planning and an appropriate commitment of funds are needed to continue the efforts of the public sector in alcohol and drug treatment. (NB)",

Moods were induced and then subjects worked on a commons dilemma problem. Subjects were given 18 trials in which to figure out by trial and error how many tons of fish could be taken from a pool while still maintaining the maximum propagation rate. The propagation rate was defined by a continual curvilinear function. Whether the subject discerned the rule was inferred from his or her predictions. The results concerning the subjects' ability to learn the function underlying the task revealed that subjects in the neutral condition were better able to decipher the correct function than were subjects in the happy, sad, or angry  conditions. The results concerning actual performance on the task revealed that subjects in neutral and happy moods performed better on measures of subjects' outcomes on the task than did subjects in either the sad or angry conditions. These findings confirm the predictions that happy, angry, and sad moods would all interfere with learning of a function underlying a commons dilemma problem, and that negative moods would likely be detrimental to effective performance on such a task.

A study was conducted to determine whether tacit knowledge, as measured by the Tacit Knowledge Questionnaire (TKQ), is related to social insight and/or to certain personality characteristics. The TKQ yields three scores: tacit knowledge for managing one's self in the present job, managing others, and managing one's career. The TKQ, the Chapin Social Insight Scale, and the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) were administered to 20 undergraduate business students. Subscale inter-correlations from the study data replicated Wagner and Sternberg's  original finding that tacit business knowledge for managing one's career, managing one's self, and managing others tended to be relatively independent qualities. This finding was reinforced by the tendency for the three subscales to correlate differentially with personality scales defining different factors of the CPI. These findings suggest that tacit business knowledge within the three areas is associated with a unique personality style. (Author/NB)",

Questions remain concerning the robustness of the effect reported in these studies and whether general traitedness or traitedness within specific dimensions will moderate correlations other than self- and peer-ratings. A study was conducted to examine self-peer rating correlations, moderating effects on the correlation between adjective self-ratings and scores on scales from the California Psychological Inventory (CPI), and moderating effects on the correlation between adjective peer ratings and CPI scale scores. College students (N=81) provided self-reports and peer-ratings on seven scales built from adjectives sampling the  trait-descriptive universe and scores on the same seven dimensions from the CPI. The results did not support the robustness of either general traitedness or traitedness for specific dimension in moderating the correspondence between self- and peer-ratings, self-ratings and inventory scores, or peer-ratings and inventory scores. Subjects scoring below the median of inter-item variance did not show greater correspondence among self-ratings, peer-ratings, and CPI scores, casting doubt on the pervasiveness of the moderating effect of intraindividual variance in item responding.

The program served 571 children, with 18 teachers providing daily instruction for two groups of students in 18 Chapter 1 eligible elementary schools. Groups were limited to 15 pupils, and instruction time was 13.3 hours weekly. The All Day Kindergarten Program functioned during the 1986-1987 school year for 130 hours of instruction, with emphasis on activities that would increase language and reading development and enhance those skills needed; for success in  first grade. For program evaluation purposes, pretests and posttests were administered to 396 students (who met the 80% attendance requirement; 379 students were present for both tests.

Teachers involved in the program were assigned an aide to supervise for half a day every day during the 1986-1987 school year.

Results indicated that all the program objectives for kindergarten students were achieved, and that all objectives but one were achieved for the first grade students. The Normal Curve Equivalent (NCE) objective called for an average gain of 1.0 for each month, but the total average gain was 2.3 NCEs for the seven-month period.

Subjects, 80 sixth grade students from two Canadian urban centers were divided into two groups: 40 high-proficiency readers and 40 low-proficiency readers. Equal numbers of students were randomly assigned to read either three familiar or three unfamiliar passages and to verbalize their thinking as they constructed interpretations. Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that young readers' inference strategies appeared to be a decomposition of those used by adults as reported in the study by A. Collins and others. While some of the subjects' inference strategies overlapped  those of adults, the students appeared to use more strategies that adults subsume into one or two strategies. The results suggest that reading proficiency may compensate in instances where there is insufficient background knowledge; however, whether one has sufficient background knowledge or not makes little difference in overall performance when the level of reading proficiency is low. Moreover, particular inference strategies seem to be a manifestation of an ability to effectively use background knowledge in reading comprehension. Because adult readers come to a written work with years of reading and life experience, it is unknown whether adult inference strategies would be useful as models for young readers.

Literacy standards adopted by the public progressed from oral literacy (speaking fluently), through signature literacy (signing one's name), recitation literacy (reciting familiar materials), and sign literacy (reading simple words), to comprehension literacy (reading unannounced passages from stories). Each of these previous standards met a specific national need during a particular historical period and each required a different teaching style. The new literacy standard for inferential literacy requires that citizens be able to go beyond literal word meanings to interpret textual  meanings and that students as workers be able to solve problems to adapt to new technologies and participate in decision making. A new group of interactionist teaching practices for inferential literacy instruction emphasizes developmental changes in the mind's structure and social interaction as a key to intellectual development. To organize classrooms, the typical class load must be reduced, classroom interruptions must be stopped, more money must be spent on reading materials with content, and methods of assessing achievement must be changed--judgments of answers must be anchored in a discipline. Teachers must run their own staff development programs and be allotted time for professional interaction. The present literacy crisis is based on a record of unprecedented school success  requiring an increasing standard of literacy. To achieve the new standard the public must be willing to continue to guarantee educational services. (NKA)",

        "description":"Recognizing a word in a meaningful text involves processes that combine information from many different sources, and both bottom-up processes (such as feature extraction and letter recognition) and top-down processes (contextual information) are thought to interact when skilled readers recognize words. Two similar experiments investigated word recognition latencies of adult readers who read single words that were manipulated by repetition and/or degradation, and the effects of context were observed. Subjects for the first experiment were 40 introductory psychology students, while those for the second experiment were 60 different students. Findings indicated that repeated words were recognized faster than nonrepeated words, but were not any less affected by semantic context. The  two degradation manipulations (inserting asterisks between a word's letters and masking a word) slowed word recognition as compared to a clear presentation. However, only the masking manipulation produced contextual inhibition, and the magnitude of context effects did not always vary monotonically with the word recognition latencies in the neutral condition. A version of the interactive-compensatory model of skilled reading is the most compatible explanation of the results of these experiments, because that model contends that slowed word recognition is not always accompanied by contextual compensation and that adult readers depend on their decoding processes when the processes are slowed, unless the data are inadequate for such analysis.

Strategies for immersing students in a subject can include, for example, holding an authentic style Roman feast for a Latin class, letting students hold their own &quot;town meeting&quot; and discuss current issues to learn about town meetings of past years, or writing on the computer to learn about word processing. Students will also become more enthusiastic about learning if they are offered a choice of what they can study. For instance, they can choose among 50 states to report on, or select their own topic to write about, or choose to be a particular townsperson in the American Revolution and report their feelings as that character. The use of stimulating textbooks  and materials, rather than the &quot;dumbed down&quot; textbooks currently offered by the publishing industry will motivate students and foster better thinking. Such strategies will ensure that information &quot;comes alive&quot; in students' heads, and will make learning personally meaningful, self-generated, social, and stimulating. (JC)",

The guide suggests a learning sequence--core, integrated, and across the curriculum--and delineates concepts, skills, and activities appropriate for learners in kindergarten through grade 3, grades 3 through 6, and grades 6 through 8. In keeping with a process approach philosophy, the content and model lessons of the guide are structured to help teachers lead discussions, frame questions, and design activities that contain multiple levels of learning. Twenty-two guidelines are presented, each followed by representative enabling activities with suggested texts for the three grade groups. General  guidelines emphasize the study of significant literary works, basing instruction on students' experiences, and developing an interrelated program that is integrated across the curriculum. A summary of the 22 guidelines concludes the guide. (JG)",

Chapter 1 discusses the value of teaching literature for promoting aesthetic and intellectual growth, and a sense of rootedness, citizenship and ethical responsibility. Chapter 2 provides a profile of an effective literature program, covering topic and textbook selection criteria, depth of content, language use, and teaching suggestions of four grade span levels. Chapter 3 discusses the teacher's role in the program, including the  teacher's responsibility to show students how to read a literary work with sensitivity and confidence, and not to provide &quot;here's-what-it-meant&quot; lectures. Chapter 4 identifies aids to an effective literature program, such as parental support, in-service teacher education, and school libraries and media centers. The handbook concludes with a checklist for assessing a school's literature program along the lines of the previous chapters and a nine-page list of selected references. (JG)",

Chapter 1 describes the curriculum goals of preparing students to become informed citizens, effective workers and fulfilled individuals, and compares features in effective and ineffective language arts programs. Chapter 2 provides the rationale for basing the integrated instruction program in literature, using particular literary works, motivating reading through a variety of  literatures, teaching composition skills through process writing experiences, and using various oral language activities to teach language skills. Chapter 3 discusses teaching methods and materials, including modeling, questioning, direct teaching, media and computer-assisted instruction, and multimodal approaches. Chapter 4 presents examples of integrated arts programs and lessons for grades kindergarten through three, three through six, six through nine, and nine through twelve. Chapter 5 describes and advocates over 20 alternative methods of student and program assessment. Chapter 6 identifies the roles of teachers, community, staff, and administration in revising this curriculum.

        "description":"Since &quot;New York Times Co. versus Sullivan,&quot; the amount of money spent on libel suits brought against the media, and the amount of money awarded to litigants, has skyrocketed. Most people who file such suits against the media are not seeking monetary damages, but only vindication for damage to their name and reputation. However, they may spend millions on legal fees, only to have a favorable decision overturned during appeals. In response, many juries award huge sums to some litigants to make up for others who receive nothing. Insurance against libel has become prohibitively expensive as well. Part of the problem of winning such cases is the stipulation that litigants must prove malice on the part of the media, which is nearly impossible, but nonetheless forces lawyers and juries  to spend hours looking over journalists' papers and notes. A reasonable alternative can be found in the Bible, which suggests, in many places, that the goal in punishment for libel is &quot;to make whole&quot; rather than award vindictively high monetary sums. Plaintiffs would no longer have to prove malice, leaving punishment for such evil intentions to God; rather, the courts would only have to determine that libel had been committed and speedily award reasonable damages to those defamed. Finally, the media would be more careful in checking sources, since falsehood would always be swiftly punished. (Thirty end notes are provided.) (JC)",

Educators must determine whether the problems are mere inconveniences or potential barriers to the successful implementation of computers as writing tools. Among the difficulties and related observations are the following: (1) computer instruction at the high school level tends to be about the computers themselves rather than using computers to teach content area subjects; (2) teachers and administrators need to collaborate concerning pedagogical applications of computers; (3) teachers also need to collaborate with students about their  needs in computer-based writing classes; (4) teachers require opportunities and incentives to acquire the skills it takes to understand and teach with computers; (5) teachers must decide the role of the computer in their classroom (i.e., drill and practice or composing tool); (6) students and teachers both must adjust to the interactive nature of computer learning; (7) teachers should consider whether to use other writing software in addition to word processing, such as outlining, spelling, and style software; (8) administrators need to create ongoing inservice programs designed to be responsive to computer-using English teachers; and (9) educators can choose to view change caused by using computers as liberating rather than threatening.

        "description":"Research indicates that students need to improve their critical thinking skills, but many students miss the opportunity to do so by not reading and analyzing their textbooks closely enough. Often, students believe that textbooks are objective materials full of &quot;facts&quot; that must be memorized, understood, and given back to the instructor, rather than subjective materials based on particular points of view. To combat this problem, a professor at a midwestern university developed a method for increasing critical thinking skills among basic writers by using textbook journals. Students were required to note ideas in the margins of their books as they read, and then write journal entries from the marginalia. A content analysis of their remarks over the course of a semester indicated  that paying greater attention to details of what the author said made students more aware of what they disagreed with, did not understand, liked, or disliked about what they read. Some made insightful comments about the slim difference between argumentative and informative essays, or how material in the textbook was presented. Almost all said they felt their critical thinking skills had improved and that they could better defend their own ideas as a result. Textbook journals appear to be a promising strategy, and may be suitable for a writing across the curriculum program. (Samples of student comments are included.) (JC)",

        "description":"Although teacher education programs spend very little time on the development of listening skills, the importance of listening to communicative effectiveness can hardly be exaggerated. As good listeners, teachers: (1) establish a classroom environment conducive to learning; (2) make better pedagogical decisions based on good listening skills; and (3) model good listening behavior for students. The Speech Communication Association Committee on Assessment and Testing Subcommittee Report makes clear that the communication competencies of sending and receiving informative, affective, imaginative, ritualistic, and persuasive messages are important in being an effective teacher. The Steil model is helpful in understanding what happens during listening. The model is comprised of  Sensing, Interpreting, Evaluating, and Responding to verbal and non-verbal cues. Teachers who wish to become better listeners, and foster a classroom environment where student interaction is encouraged should include speech courses and courses in instructional communication in their teacher education training. Practicing teachers may take such courses as part of their continuing education, or learn effective listening skills as part of inservice programs. Every facet of the educational process will benefit from attention to this important teaching strategy. (Eighteen notes are included.) (JC)",

        "description":"In order to view the field of communication as a practical discipline, this paper examines the debate between linguistic prescriptivism (the belief that standards of correct language exist and can be warranted), and scientific linguistics (which rejects the idea of standards in the name of scientific objectivity). Following an introduction to the idea of a practical discipline and an overview of the controversy concerning linguistic prescriptivism, the paper argues that although prescriptivist attitudes are generally unsound, the practical usefulness of linguistic standardization has been facilitated by prescriptivism. The paper also acknowledges the prescriptivist premise that linguistic choices are matters of taste subject to reflection and critical judgment. The paper  concludes both that linguistic science has failed to acknowledge aspects of language about which deliberation is possible and necessary, and that traditional prescriptivism has advocated choices that are not responsive to the full range of relevant considerations. Using D. G. McKay's linguistic research to evaluate the ramifications of replacing &quot;he&quot; with a singular generic pronoun &quot;they,&quot; the paper illustrates that deliberation about linguistic rules is possible and can be informed systematically by linguistic research, yielding a modified prescriptivism that rejects the dogmatism, social intolerance and intellectual slackness of traditional prescriptivism, while retaining the essential idea that questions about how humans ought to speak are worthy of serious consideration.

        "description":"There are two views of the rhetorical principle of &quot;kairos,&quot; or timeliness: first, the deterministic notion of &quot;kairos&quot; as a preordained &quot;right&quot; time in which certain activities are appropriate, and second, the relativistic notion of &quot;kairos&quot; as an exercise &quot;in the nick of time.&quot; A satisfactory definition of &quot;kairos&quot; must acknowledge that some well-timed rhetorical effects (humor, for example) cannot be determined by strict rules, but rather are relative to context and situation. The relativistic dimension of &quot;kairos&quot; also explains how rhetorical truth relies not on the representation of objective facts, but on the terms of what is understood and accepted at a particular time. Moreover, this sense of &quot;kairos&quot; explains how identical acts can appear just or good at one time, unjust  or evil at another. On a moral level, the absence of absolute standards by which to hold speakers accountable for their acts actually invests speakers with greater moral responsibility to discern when to act and what act to perform. The recognition of these two counterpoised views of &quot;kairos&quot; implies that rhetoric involves combining the prudence to judge the proper time to speak with the courage to speak at the precise moment one's rhetorical contribution will be most fitting.

        "description":"Radical feminist Andrea Dworkin has been instrumental in efforts to curtail pornography by defining it as a violation of women's civil rights and allowing individual women to sue the distributors for damages. Dworkin's position derives from the tension between &quot;what should be&quot; and &quot;what is.&quot; Her conception of the difference between the feminine and masculine nature offers women as the glorious image of what men could be, while men are the dark reminder of what is. For Dworkin, this tension is compounded by the tension between &quot;what is&quot; and &quot;what appears to be.&quot; If appearance--that pornography is about sexuality--were truth, pornography would be a liberating agent for both sexes. Dworkin's definition of pornography comes from the ancient Greeks, whose word &quot;porne&quot; meant the lowest  class of whore. Her referral to the ancient meaning attributes motive to the purveyors: the subordination of women through the way women are represented, equating them with vile whores. Dworkin further sees pornography as an agency of violence that awakens men's deeply rooted obsession with death, directing it toward women. Even when the image is nonviolent the ideology behind the image must be violent as an expression of the male world vision. Dworkin's rhetoric thus blames men while avoiding questions such as why some men are not drawn to pornography. Instead of finding &quot;male truth&quot; Dworkin has created a radical feminist myth of male truth. Her ultimately unproductive rhetoric allows for no commonality among men and women, and serves only to separate the sexes further. (Notes are  attached.) (NKA)",

The fifth section illustrates how collaborative talk works in one classroom by offering excerpts of talk from a third and fourth grade classroom.

        "description":"While the government of South Africa has outwardly promoted democracy since 1983, it nonetheless has placed its press under tight constraint to discourage dissent concerning political issues and enhance the government's credibility. Not only are journalists within the country restricted, but foreign correspondents as well. Moreover, although there are no official censors, censorship is implied by the laws because journalists are restrained from commenting freely and the subject matter on which they may report is limited to issues that are not contentious. The laws are so vague that journalists could easily report something the government subsequently objects to, which engenders a form of self-censorship. South Africa's government states that its mission is democracy, but its  reaction concerning free speech contradicts its assertions. A free press is necessary to a democracy because it promotes discussion and dissent, which in turn fosters public consensus. The government, however, believes a free press to be dangerous to its well-being until a democracy is established. South Africa's government needs to understand that a free press is not a product of a democracy but an essential element of the process of peaceful change. (Forty-three references are included.)

        "description":"The importance of the development of oral communication abilities has been documented in a number of sources. Studies of graduates, employers, and corporate executives have revealed, for example, that skills in problem solving, communication, and interpersonal relations are most valued in high tech corporations. Several recent indictments of education have also echoed the need for highly developed oral communication abilities. One way of assisting students in developing oral communication competencies is the required speech communication course, and another way is to integrate communication skills into content area courses. A review of the literature suggests that courses in English literature, composition, business communication, vocational education, engineering, psychology,  and teacher education at various institutions have effectively incorporated instruction in oral communication competencies. Other schools have established speaking labs, while emphasis on speaking skills received attention in different disciplines seemed to depend on the interests of individual instructors. Several school districts have defined integrated curricula including speech, and a handful of colleges also have integrated speech programs. It can be determined from these programs that integrating communication across the curriculum depends largely on the expertise of instructors, although few are specifically trained to teach speaking skills. Success of these programs also depends on student interest, a careful balance of skills integrated into the curriculum, and attention to  developmental sequence. (Fifty-five references are appended.)

        "description":"A study compared the two television series, &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; and &quot;The Equalizer&quot; to see whether the protagonists conform to the American archetype of the justice hero--defined as the hero who deals with crime in society. A formula analysis of the two television texts reveals that both heroes are male, scrupulous, independent, possess almost superhuman faculties, are aggressive and violent, show very little emotion, are mysterious (the masked Lone Ranger rides into town in time of trouble and leaves immediately after controlling the situation, while the Equalizer is an ex-secret operative based in New York City who accepts no payment for his help), and attractive to women. For all practical purposes, the Lone Ranger and the Equalizer are the same man. Sidekicks in both series  serve a similar function: they do the dirty work and act as foils. The criminals are always male, and their victims are nearly always vulnerable females. The opening credits of &quot;The Equalizer,&quot; depicting a dark and frightening urban atmosphere, consist of a barrage of images of men and women interacting. McCall, the hero, is highlighted at the end of the sequence--a masculine protector and a father figure. The more youthful Lone Ranger shows his masculinity in brilliant escapes and close calls. The justice hero in both series stands alone (functioning as a vigilante) outside the law enforcement system. Close study of these texts suggests that the television justice hero has remained virtually intact in his mythic structure over the past 30 years. (Notes and references are attached.)  (NKA)",

The case of Allan McDonald and Roger Boisjoly, engineers who blew the whistle on Morton Thiokol's poor management practices when the company agreed to launch the shuttle Challenger even after concerns for safety had been expressed, illustrates the problems involved in whistleblowing. McDonald was reassigned and Boisjoly took disability leave to recover from depression over the Challenger disaster. The whistleblower, if his or her charges are correct, characterizes one of the dilemmas of complex organizations: how to  restrict the flow of information up the organizational hierarchy and still insure that accurate, useful information reaches organizational decision makers. NASA has since instituted an anonymous whistleblowing system, retaining an outside firm to investigate the claim before it reaches NASA personnel. However, it is naive to think that &quot;a message sent is a message received,&quot; and it does not appear as though the new system will avert such disasters as the Challenger explosion.

Two groups of subjects, selected from economically determined working class students in a large introductory speech communication course at a southwestern university, responded to a questionnaire concerning two recent social conversations with a person of a different ethnic group--only Blacks conversing with Whites were chosen for analysis. Responses from the first group of 31 subjects were used to generate the issues, and those of the second group of 24 were used to test for coding reliability. Analyses produced seven categories of satisfying and dissatisfying  interethnic communication: (1) negative stereotyping; (2) acceptance; (3) emotional expressiveness; (4) authenticity; (5) understanding; (6) goals attainment; and (7) powerlessness. These categories appeared to be reliable and relatively independent of sex, age, and family income. Whether the categories constitute a uniquely Black perspective on communication effectiveness is a question that has not yet been answered, but they do provide a basis for exploring effectiveness in a variety of settings and relationships.

The statistical material is supplemented with descriptions of trends and discussions of the implications of the data for the condition of state schooling. The 30 indicators are clustered in 4 broad categories, which are presented as document sections. An introduction sets forth the study's purpose and methodology. &quot;Outcomes,&quot; the first section, defines state goals and compares Delaware students' academic performance and educational transition with those of other groups. The indicators of such outcomes include basic skills  achievement, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, and graduates' educational/occupational attainment. The second section, &quot;Resources,&quot; focuses on the resources that the school system has at its disposal. Data pertaining to fiscal allocations and expenditures per pupil are interpreted. A discussion of human resources includes data on class size, quality of the teaching force, and quality of support services. Concerns about the status of instructional resources are expressed. &quot;Context,&quot; the third section, compares state survey findings with national indicators that reflect the status of school environment, special need requirements, and public attitudes toward schools. The final section, &quot;Program and Policy,&quot; provides comparative data and descriptive information about educational opportunities.  Course offerings, dropout prevention, and provisions for academic diversity are examined.

        "description":"Federal education policy preferences of the Reagan Administration include both procedural and substantive elements. The overarching procedural policy is devolution--the transfer of the authority and responsibility for education policy and program development from the federal to state and local levels. Federal activities intended to advance devolution are decentralization, deregulation, and diminution. Decentralization advances devolution by formally transferring the authority for implementation of federal programs, but not the programs themselves, from federal agencies to state and local education agencies. Decentralization occurred with the enactment of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA) that established the block grant programs. Deregulation was  achieved by constrained enforcement and revoking of regulations. Diminution was accomplished through rescissions and reductions in the federal education budget. Evidence to demonstrate the impact of these factors on state and local agencies is focused on effects that are symbolic, organizational, environmental, substantive, or procedural. Documentation sources include official governmental publications, periodical coverage of federal and state educational policy, publications of policy analysts and agencies, and research studies.

        "description":"The Catholic Schools of Belmont County, Ohio, like many other public and parochial schools, have experienced declining enrollments over the past few years. The causes may be attributed to declining family size and to economic factors affecting the area. The paper describes a study of Belmont County's five Catholic schools undertaken by the Office of Educational Services at the Diocese's request. The study provides data for help in decisions affecting these schools' future. Following an introductory chapter, the report presents demographic information in chapter II. The county shows a general population decline. Two elementary schools show only a slight decline, while two others have declined dramatically since 1979. The high school's enrollment has declined and will continue to  do so. Chapter III reviews facilities and miscellaneous items pertinent to the study. Chapter IV contains consultants' conclusions and recommendations. After addressing some Ohio Department of Education concerns about auxiliary services, transportation, school charters, and teacher certification, the study recommends that (1) the schools continue under their present organizational structure; (2) the low enrollments of St. Mary and St. Joseph be assigned highest priority by the schools' supporting parishes; (3) St. Mary Central address its accommodation problem carefully; (4) more dialogue be promoted among the schools; and (5) pastors and school administrators be given this report. Appended are the minutes of meetings with pastors and school officials. (MLH)",

        "description":"Using data on mean achievement of third and sixth graders in individual California schools, coupled with salary data for those students' teachers, this study tested whether teacher salary variables are associated with student achievement, when socioeconomic characteristics are controlled. Differences among schools in the amount of teachers' pay per pupil are the result of differences in the level of district salary schedules, placement of each school's teachers on the local salary schedule, and the number of teachers per pupil. The study also introduced a novel procedure for using daily student class hours (instead of average daily attendance) as a more refined measure of student attendance. Several versions of the regression model were estimated for two different grade levels  and three separate subjects in two different years. Results showed that achievement was positively and significantly associated with local salary schedule level, positively associated with placement of the school's teachers on the salary schedule, and negatively associated with the teacher-pupil ratio. Possible reasons for these associations are discussed. Results clearly imply that raising teacher salaries would be more cost-effective than reducing class size in California schools.

        "author":["Iram, Yaacov"],
        "description":"Parents' involvement in their children's schooling can be justified on various ideological, psychological, philosophical, and educational grounds. Two dominant attitudes prevail toward parent participation: (1) the authoritarian-paternalistic view featuring a one-way teacher-parent relationship; and (2) the parents-as-equal-partners view. The first approach predominates when parents are immigrants. Although parents often become actively involved with controversial social and political issues, their participation is usually limited to extracurricular activities, PTA, and social entertainment programs. Curricular matters are left to teachers and administrators. This paper aims to analyze and interpret Israeli parents' involvement in curricular decisions in two cases: (1)&quot;Supplementary Programmes,&quot; a provision of the State Education Law of 1953 granting parents the right to determine 25 percent of their children's school curriculum; and (2) school desegregation, a 1968 policy designed to promote integration of school children of diverse ethnic origins. While parents have been actively involved in school integration, they have generally not chosen to influence curriculum content, aims, methods, or teaching staff and administrators. A few notable exceptions are listed, including the founding of traditional nonorthodox schools, reinforcement of Judaic studies in certain religious state schools, and the founding of a school geared to labor movement values. Clearly, the pattern of parental school involvement in Israel needs to be radically transformed from  paternalism to a more mutually interactive approach. A new Ministry of Education and Culture committee has recommended four strategies for change. Included are 25 references. (MLH)",

        "description":"Despite the proliferation of school improvement projects and school effectiveness research during the 1980s, there have been very few methodologically rigorous, large-scale, widely published school effectiveness studies. As a result, the research base is thin and needs to be updated. This paper presents a brief history of the Louisiana School Effectiveness Study (LSES), summarizes major findings, describes models for the long-term development of effective and ineffective schools, and delineates possible new research directions. Begun in response to a 1977 legislative mandate, the LSES study involved three phases: a pilot study, a data-gathering phase involving a stratified sample of 76 elementary schools, and a more detailed analysis of eight matched pairs of schools. The study  disclosed (1) significant between-student variance; (2) results generalizable to various parts of the United States; (3) the stability of outcome, process, and relational measures; (4) the importance of &quot;readily alterable&quot; school climate variables; (5) the significance of certain contextual variables like teacher behavior; (6) strong connections between teacher effectiveness and school effectiveness variables; (7) the significance of instructionally focused leaders; and (8) positive effects of internally initiated school improvement. Various steps that lead toward becoming either a highly effective or an ineffective school are also outlined. Four types of large-scale studies are needed: (1) correlational; (2) self-directed school improvement efforts; (3) well-controlled change studies;  and (4) long-term studies on the relationship of school effectiveness and socioeconomic status. Included are 1 figure, 2 tables, and 39 references. (MLH)",

Moreover, within the local districts, the central offices are assuming more control in such matters as curriculum content and state testing programs. The paper begins with an overview of recent governance trends and the underlying reasons for central control. The next section moves to the particular case of increased state and district control of instructional policy and the consequent impact on teacher autonomy and professionalism. The problems of local school boards are highlighted in the next section because school boards are the key legal unit of local governance. The paper concludes with some alternatives for rethinking the  balance of control. For example, the final sections address sorting out the responsibilities of each level, including such issues as flexible funds for school improvement and teacher professionalism. Several suggestions are advanced for trading state regulations for local school outcome incentives. Appended are 22 references. (MLF)",

        "description":"The rapid growth of law and litigation in schools during the last several decades has made it critically important that school districts secure good legal advice and representation. This pamphlet is designed to address this need of the New Jersey School Boards Association (NJSBA) membership by providing information on how to select, compensate, and work with a school board attorney. The first section, on selection of an attorney, outlines an appropriate job description, including litigation, attendance at board meetings, consultation and advice, and preparation and review of documents. Qualifications are then discussed, along with advice on obtaining applications, conducting interviews, and checking references. The second section provides suggestions for working with the school  board attorney: (1) seek advice early; (2) give the attorney adequate time to respond; (3) help the attorney assume the proper role; (4) work on better methods of communication and evaluation; and (5) what to do if problems persist. The third section discusses a set of alternative plans for compensating the board attorney: full-time counsel, general retainer agreements, limited retainer agreements, and no retainer. The NJSBA recommends that every board seek a fee arrangement that includes a retainer to cover telephone consultations at no additional charge per call. Also discussed are the written agreement, average district expenditures for legal services, and tips for controlling costs. The concluding section describes services available to school board attorneys from the legal staff  maintained by the NJSBA. Appended are results of an NJSBA survey of chief school administrators conducted in spring 1982 on the subject of school district legal services. (TE)",

The purpose of this publication is to provide an analysis and summary of decisions involving a board's exercise of this authority, and it is intended to serve as a guide and a reference tool to be used in determining when and how increments can be withheld. The first two sections construe the statutory language that gives boards this authority and establishes the nonnegotiability of increment withholding decisions by local boards. The next section discusses appeals for review of increment withholdings by the commissioner of education. Decisions are discussed that (1) clarify the standard of review, (2) uphold actions by local boards, and (3) restore  employees' increments. The third section reviews decisions interpreting the procedural requirements at the administrative and board levels that must be met in withholding increments. A final section discusses the four options available to local boards in determining the exact increment amount to be withheld and the time period for withholding it: (1) employment increment only, for one school year; (2) employment increment only, but on a permanent basis; (3) entire increment for one year; and (4) permanent denial of entire increment.

Recent research suggests that effective principals can make a significant difference in their schools' instructional programs through a combination of personal traits, particularly a strong belief in their schools, and the management strategies used to oversee and guide instruction. This bulletin examines some of the issues and tasks associated with instructional leadership from the perspective of instructional concerns and from the study of leadership behaviors. Within the contexts influencing learning--in communities, in the school's organization, and in the values held by their staffs--reside both the problems and the resources with which  instructional leaders work. After considering contexts, this bulletin looks at factors affecting the technology of instruction, including objectives, evaluation, staff development, and organizational climate. Finally, the document concludes by discussing the advantages of sharing leadership responsibilities to promote better instruction and improve student performance. Appended are 46 references. (MLF)",

DVA is a symptom cluster including at least some of 21 potential symptoms, such as delayed speech development and severe articulation disorder. The Boston Naming Test (a picture confrontation naming task) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised, Form L, were administered to all subjects. Evidence of word-finding problems was based on the number of correct responses, the speed with which responses were given, and other word-finding behaviors. Results indicated that the DVA children had more restricted receptive vocabularies, expressively identified fewer pictures correctly upon confrontation, identified the pictures more slowly  than did normal children of the same age, and exhibited more behaviors often associated with word-finding problems (such as fidgeting and hitting their heads). A year later, two of the DVA children were administered the new German's Test of Word Finding, which confirmed the continuing presence of word-finding problems. It was concluded that children exhibiting DVA are thus at high risk to exhibit significant word-retrieval problems, and remedial objectives addressing these problems should be included in treatment programs of DVA clients so identified.

        "description":"Metacognitive strategy instruction was used to teach two deaf children (ages 11 and 12) with differing American Sign Language and English language skills to summarize stories in writing. The instructional program used a knowledge of text structure--specifically story structure--to improve literacy skills by enhancing the children's ability to comprehend, remember, and generate stories. Program components addressed learning reasons for summarizing, identifying the kinds of information contained in a story, finding this information, organizing it for a summary, and writing the actual summary. Mechanical aspects of writing such as grammar, spelling, and punctuation were not stressed. Effectiveness of the program was evaluated using a single-subject design. Baseline measures revealed  that the subjects had only a meager knowledge of story structure. During intervention, subjects' performance rose dramatically. Although the summaries they produced were not mechanically perfect, they had the structure of a story and therefore appeared to be better writing samples than those produced before intervention. In one subject, this level of performance was maintained; in the other, performance declined during the maintenance period. (Author/VW)",

The guide also includes a bibliography, list of films, and resource directory. The second volume, &quot;Materials for Parent Training,&quot; contains items to be distributed to participants during the workshops. (VW)",

The papers point out the advantages of assessing ecological factors (such as natural stimuli and special education procedures) in a quantitative fashion and in a temporal relationship with student behavior. An introductory chapter by Charles R. Greenwood defines eco-behavioral research and indicates its potential benefits. The first paper, a literature review by Donald Dorsey, finds that frequently contradictory research on the effective use of instructional time should be made more precise and broader in scope, by pairing behavior analysis and ecological psychology. Next, Greenwood assesses eco-behavioral relationships in special education  outcome research and argues for the development of a powerful, widely practiced technology of instruction. Carmen Arreaga-Mayer examines the literature dealing with ecological and teaching variables that affect the academic performance of culturally and linguistically different learners. Judith Carta proposes an eco-behavioral approach to evaluation of preschool programs for the handicapped, which allows for determination of early intervention effectiveness and specification of the factors responsible. Gary Verna examines theoretical and empirical issues related to current ecological developments within the field of applied behavior analysis. (JDD)",

Sheltered workshops conducted by Goodwill Industries and Parc-way Industries were examined to determine client characteristics and the rate of placement in competitive employment. The opportunities for high-school level mentally retarded students included: programs within Pittsburgh high schools, programs at Pittsburgh's center for the more severely handicapped, vocational courses at special education centers, in-school paid job experience, co-op work involving paid jobs in the community, work activity centers, and area vocational-technical schools. Conclusions were that sheltered workshops need to increase  business, improve client placement into competitive work, provide programming for more people, foster communication among workshops, and make efforts to restructure Supplemental Security Income benefits for workshop employees. Concerning the high school vocational programs, the study recommended increasing the number of mentally retarded students taking vocational courses, developing additional courses suited to MR students, and studying the effect of high school-level vocational training on adult careers. Appended are lists of vocational courses offered by the school system, a list of area high schools with programs for MR students, and a bibliography. (JDD)",

Low-achieving readers are being referred to special education at high rates while the number of eligible students served in compensatory reading programs for the economically disadvantaged is declining, though poverty among children has actually increased. Statistics using professional literature citations show a decline in interest in reading failure as an environmental deficit and an increase in organic impairment as an explanation. The government's view of its role in support of education has also changed focus, from a concern for equity to a concern for excellence.  Many other factors are involved in the shift toward labelling low-achieving readers as &quot;mildly handicapped&quot; or &quot;learning disabled&quot; including: (1) the economically disadvantaged do not constitute a protected group under civil rights law as the handicapped do; (2) disabilities are defined so as to place children in better-funded special education programs; (3) the lower expectations allowed for special education programs are easier to meet compared to those of remedial reading programs. The need for a reformed policy on services to underachieving children is emphasized. Sixty references are appended. (JDD)",

Characteristics of learning disabled individuals are considered under five headings: perceptual and perceptual-motor disabilities, problems with attention and hyperactivity, cognitive disabilities, social and behavioral problems, and academic disabilities. In general, the learning-disabled individual seems to be a passive, inactive learner who lacks or does not use the strategies for attacking academic problems that the non-handicapped commonly use; in addition, the learning disabled are best thought of as a heterogeneous, rather than a homogeneous, group. Several options are available for administering the  education of the learning disabled. One of the most widely utilized instructional arrangements, mainstreaming, may be made more effective by the use of the Adaptive Learning Environments Model, teacher consultants, cooperative learning, and peer tutoring. Several promising, but not well-known, instructional techniques may improve education of the learning disabled; these include reciprocal teaching, self-monitoring of attention, metacognitive self-questioning training, and the keyword mnemonic technique.

Chapter 1 presents the rationale for vocational education programs, describes the DoDDS approach, and identifies what benefits/outcomes can be expected. Chapter 2 describes the model for the program encompassing three levels: (1) initial assessment of readiness and awareness beginning in junior high/middle school prevocational courses and activities; (2) assessment of work-related behaviors  and skills in high school vocational education course work; and (3) assessment of work-related behaviors and skills in work experience settings.

The goals of such curricula include encouraging students to incorporate innovative ideas into their learning activities, promoting self-actualization, unifying students' educational activities across subject-matter boundaries, and aiding students in organizing their knowledge and experience. Noted is the linking of integrative education to effective human functioning and self-image, independent investigation, inquiry approaches, and \"whole brain\" learning or \"whole child\" education. To translate the goals of integrative education into curricula, four models of curriculum development are discussed. The first, by Philip H. Phenix, proposes six dimensions of knowing and their corresponding  cognitive abilities, and matches each qualitative dimension with a quantitative one. Katherine B. Bruch has developed a \"Creative Characteristics Model\" which includes physical, emotional, mental, and integrative sub-systems. The third model is J. Cecil Parker and Louis J. Rubin's \"Process as Content Model\" which involves organizing each subject around cognitive and operational processes. Alastair Taylor's model approaches integrative education by examining the integrative principles in human societies and suggesting hypotheses that focus on uniformities among levels of social systems.

The classrooms were compared on the following dimensions: (1) social interactions among students, (2) teacher training/experience, (3) teacher verbal behaviors, (4) teacher expectations as perceived by students, (5) parental expectations as perceived by students, (6) exposure to course content, and (7) student participation. Data came from teacher questionnaires, teacher logs, live observations of classes, and student questionnaires. Results indicated no interaction between the hearing and hearing-impaired students in the mainstreamed classrooms.  The teachers in the mainstream classes had more training in the subject matter, as well as more experience as teachers. The teachers' verbal behaviors differed significantly, independent of the type of classroom. Teacher and parental expectations were not a factor. Mainstreamed classes received more work and more difficult work than the self-contained classes. Hearing-impaired students in both types of classrooms asked more questions than hearing students did. Cited are several important factors impacting achievement of the hearing-impaired, such as their initial abilities, family situation, and quality of teaching received. (JDD)",

        "description":"Two studies were designed to examine the effect of school placement (specifically, mainstreamed versus self-contained classrooms) on the social development of hearing-impaired high school youth. In the first study, 85 hearing-impaired high school students (some in self-contained classrooms, and others mainstreamed) were assessed on measures of social adjustment, emotional adjustment, self-image, confusion, and integration. Results did not indicate any statistically significant differences for the social development measures. Regression analysis (used to determine if the degree of social maturity was related to sex, race, total hours mainstreamed, or reading level) indicated no significant relationship except for the variables of confusion and reading level. It could not be  concluded that hearing-impaired students in mainstreamed classrooms experience poorer or enhanced social development than do their peers in self-contained classrooms. The second study involved 14 hearing-impaired students in an undergraduate psychology class at Gallaudet College (Washington, D.C.) who completed a questionnaire about their high-school experiences. Students in residential schools reported less confusion and felt more integrated into the school than mainstreamed students. Several factors contributing to social development and positive feelings about high school are cited. (JDD)",

Included in the guide are recommended teaching strategies, an assessment system, and related curriculum materials. The teaching strategies cover the concepts of reinforcement, prompting, generalization of skills, and teaching for maintenance of acquired skills. The assessment system yields qualitative and quantitative measures of individual performance in several skill areas, using standardized testing procedures. The curriculum materials include a series of curriculum-embedded tests in both physical fitness and  personal hygiene. The five skills taught in the physical fitness component are cardiorespiratory endurance, upper body strength and endurance, lower back and hamstring flexibility, abdominal endurance, and grip strength. The five skills included for personal hygiene are hand washing, face washing, toothbrushing, deodorant use, and personal appearance. For each skill area, the information is divided into: goal, skill, materials needed, teaching recommendations, teaching sequence (including instructional objectives), supplementary activities, generalization ideas, and maintenance ideas.

In response to these perceived changes, a series of in-service seminars was held for Omaha-area administrators.

The second chapter analyzes the job market, with mention of technological aids and the aging of the baby boom generation as factors opening more employment opportunities for the handicapped. The third chapter analyzes the U.S. handicapped population demographically using Frank Bowe's theory of thirds. A 1985 survey of 1,000 disabled adults by Louis Harris and Associates is discussed, which concerned  age of disability onset, self-perceptions, attitudes toward working, and knowledge of government services. Other chapters describe the employment situation for various age groups (16-24 years, 25-54 years, 55-64 years) and for special groups (women, Blacks, Hispanics, and veterans). These chapters are accompanied by tables and charts as well as by recommendations that the Committee plans to implement. (JDD)",

The sample consisted of 354 gifted Ontario students from Grades 5, 8, and 10 (150 in self-contained classrooms and 204 in integrated classes), with a control group of 408. Each subject completed an age-appropriate self-report scale of social competence and a rating scale regarding feelings about school. Peer nominations for social competence were also obtained from children in the integrated classes, that is, sample children as well as their classmates. The integrated gifted children at all three grade levels achieved higher scores of academic self-concept than  did the children in either the self-contained gifted or the control group. There were few salient differences between the groups in terms of sex, social self-concept, physical self-concept, or Grade 8 and 10 ratings of social competence. Gifted children were less popular in classes where there were large differences in Intelligence Quotient between the gifted and control subjects. While there were no significant differences in terms of attitude towards school between the groups studied, feelings toward school became less positive as age increased. (JDD)",

The first is a lesson plan involving pre-computer activities that prepare preschool developmentally delayed children for using a computer keyboard. Finger isolation and directionality are taught through the use of modeling clay, toy cars, tracing, and games such as Simon Says. The second presentation gives guidelines for forming groups of computer-using special educators who want to exchange ideas. Following that, two lesson plans provide drill and practice in reinforcing basic math skills for elementary resource room students. The software programs used are &quot;Mastering Math System&quot; and &quot;Milliken Math  Sequences,&quot; both operating on Apple IIe computers. Another lesson plan explains how a menu-driven program called &quot;Secret Filer&quot; is used by emotionally disabled elementary school students to create databases of information about stories they have read. The final lesson describes use of the &quot;Adaptive Firmward Card&quot; to customize computer input methods for physically disabled students, aged 8-11 in ability. For each lesson, the following types of information are given: target audience, hardware and software needed, project description including objectives, lesson description, scheduling information, and teacher preparation activities.

Interagency efforts within government are seeking to identify gaps in coverage, as well as duplications and overlap, in existing federal disability programs. Rather than attempting to embrace a single piece of vaguely worded, expansive legislation, bills tailored to specific problems will ultimately result in a more comprehensive set of protections for handicapped citizens. The passage of legislation to assure nondiscrimination in private sector employment is a top priority for action. Other areas needing attention are disincentives to work found in the social security  programs, and discrimination in housing, education, federally assisted health care services, and social services.

High rates of dyadic play behaviors observed at home and lack of significant overall differences between parent groups supported the notion that fathers and mothers were equally competent in interacting with their children with special needs. Within-family trends suggested that mothers matched verbalizations and directives more nearly to child abilities and interests. Fathers showed higher  frequencies of physical involvement in play, but handled children in a gentle style similar to that of mothers. Correlations of parental play and perceptions resulted in minimal associations for mothers, but moderate associations for fathers, perhaps reflecting fathers' more discretionary role in parenting.

A comparison group consisted of 16 high-risk premature infants matched by mental and motor age. At 6 months, the DS infants spent more time fixating on their mothers' faces than on toys. The premature infants showed a greater ability to examine more toys with their mothers' help than alone, while the DS infants did not. The study concluded that, to increase DS infants' manipulation of toys, mothers should place toys in the infants' hands rather than just demonstrate, and should maintain the infants' attention to a toy  rather than redirect their attention.

Medicaid's involvement with the retarded in institutions and nursing homes includes financing active treatment services, such as speech, occupational, and physical therapy; training in personal care skills; and training in community living skills. Medicaid services for the mentally retarded were reviewed in 15 nursing homes in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and similar reviews by the Health Care Financing Administration in Illinois and Indiana were analyzed. The report found that management controls were inadequate, plans of care did not adequately  address active treatment, and inspections were inadequate. The General Accounting Office's recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the comments from involved state agencies are provided. Recommendations included the revision of Medicaid regulations to require nursing homes to specifically address active treatment in plans of care for their retarded residents, and to require states to include a staff member trained in mental retardation on inspection of care teams.

The hearing examined the current funding provided through Medicaid, the range of services delivered, and the most appropriate setting for long-term care of the developmentally disabled (institutional care or community care). A 57-page report prepared by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress summarized the issues concerning Medicaid and other Federal services for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities. Representatives from the Health Care Financing Administration and the Office of Human Developmental Services presented U.S. government positions. Public witnesses represented  university programs, state agencies, and national associations. Additional prepared statements, letters, and supplemental materials represented state developmental disabilities and advocacy agencies; local, state, and national voluntary organizations; and concerned parents.

Three primary approaches involve eradicating, maintaining, or expanding the home language systems of such children. In the expansion approach, children are taught to use standard English in appropriate context while respecting and maintaining their home language or dialect. The role of the teacher is important in helping these children learn to interpret written and oral forms of standard English. The teacher should make an assessment of the cultural and linguistic diversity within their classrooms and should be speech models for children. Specific strategies can be implemented to assist children in building  language facility. These include: (1) using the language experience approach; (2) using pictures to build a visual-auditory association; (3) reading stories to students; (4) using techniques such as expansions, sentence building, sentence combining, and transformation to manipulate oral sentences; and (5) integrating language instruction within other academic areas.

Feedback from participants in inservice programs offered by the Learning Centre in Alberta (Canada) suggests the importance of better identification of individual needs of regular and special education teachers in planning inservice programs. A literature review revealed a lack of empirical data on the knowledge, skills and competencies needed by teachers of LD students and suggested that regular class teachers may need different competencies than special class teachers. A needs assessment survey revealed consistencies across school systems, grade levels taught, and regular and special  education in terms of preferences for inservice delivery. Survey questions tapping self-ratings of competence indicated that special education personnel were more confident than regular class teachers in their competence and training in general information, assessment and instruction/remediation of students with LD. Seven recommendations are offered, including suggestions for follow-up studies to validate the relevance of the knowledge, skills, and competencies targeted in inservice programs and consideration of several planning and delivery issues (such as scheduling and incentives) to maximize participation in in-service training.

Ways in which the program fosters five prerequisites for self-esteem (connection, uniqueness, power, models, and accomplishment) are considered. Based on the success of the outdoor adventure education process, six classroom adaptations are suggested: creating situations that promote disequilibrium, providing experiences using cooperative learning procedures, establishing a peer tutoring program, teaching students specific problem-solving strategies, providing direct instruction in social  interaction skills, and providing opportunities for group discussion.

The aim of these projects was to improve the cognitive skills of limited-English-proficient pupils through the addition of individualized instruction in learning centers to ongoing bilingual education programs. The native language of most of the pupils was Spanish, and the projects served two junior high schools and two elementary schools. The learning centers were staffed by resource specialists and bilingual aides, and provided specialized equipment and small-group instruction to assist in individualization. The programs were evaluated by statistical analysis of participants'  standardized achievement test scores and attendance records. Findings showed that the junior high and elementary school projects met their objectives in attendance and English reading skills, but neither met the English vocabulary acquisition objective. The listening comprehension objective was met only by the elementary school project, and the mathematics computation objective was met only by the junior high school project.

The student's track was determined by grades and language experience. Findings suggest that students in each track have different attitudes toward the foreign language. The native speakers showed an \"integrative\" attitude toward the usability and need for the class. The linguistic-track students had a more \"instrumental\" outlook focused on the relationship of language to job opportunities. Students in the \"cultural\" track had a negative attitude toward the second language and anything related to it and showed a \"rebound\" effect  whereby they reacted positively to anything related to English. The findings also suggest that attitudes toward language, the second language, and the second language teacher play a more important role in second language learning than previously described.

The comparison reveals striking similarities between the systems, including: use of the national language as a medium of instruction; requirement of literacy in a standardized national language; requirement of a second language that will allow access to current scientific and technological knowledge; problems in training a sufficient number of teachers who are bilingual and able to teach in non-western vernaculars; and centralized education systems that differ greatly from the American model. It is  concluded that the United States should consider an official policy statement concerning English as the nation's lingua franca and second language learning as tools for internationalizing the nation, especially if the policy were linked to broader transcendent aims of national cohesion and viability within the global community.

Language is the medium by which children acquire at least a portion of their sex role and social class or group characteristics, world view, and emotional and psychological well-being. Existing theories of psychological development ignore language, attempting to correlate parent behaviors and child outcomes without taking advantage of the substantial research on parent-child linguistic interactions. While developmental psychologists recognize that internalization of parental characteristics through identification is a broad and pervasive aspect of the young child's personality development, it is treated as a magical process in the literature of child development, ignoring  language directed at the child as a likely vehicle for transmission of the parents' orientation and value system. Several decades of data on parent-child interaction gathered by linguists can and should be used to illustrate the role that language plays in child development. (MSE)",

In the first experiment, 156 English-speaking children aged 2;6 to 6;6 and 21 adults were tested for their understanding of antecedents within reflexive sentences, pronoun sentences, and gender-control pronoun sentences. The results for reflexive sentences were as predicted by the Lexical Learning Hypothesis, but the pronoun sentence results were not. Following up this earlier experiment with similar subject groups, the second study tested infinitival structures and gender control for reflexives and the third tested whether the youngest children had the linguistic knowledge that reflexives and  pronouns need non-local antecedents. In general, when relative patterns rather than absolute scores or ages are considered, the results of the later studies replicated the results of the earlier experiment: when the target task is to make coreference judgments between the reflexive or pronoun and the two sentence-internal antecedents, children do differentiate reflexive from pronoun sentences in all experiments, regardless of complement type and the different tasks required. However, a developmental delay in acquisition of non-locality condition for pronouns suggests a need for additional investigation of the Lexical Learning Hypothesis. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study examined acquisition of new vocabulary through oral stories in first-, third-, and fifth-grade children. Each subject heard four stories, each including four nonsense words repeated three times. These novel words represented common nouns whose meanings could be derived from propositional information associated with their occurrence. The two factors of particular interest were the proximity of the novel word recurrences and the specificity of the propositional information surrounding them. The subjects' phonological production of the novel words, cued production with sentence context provided, and comprehension of word meaning by propositional recall, were analyzed. Producing the phonological word form and associating it with the correct proposition was difficult for all  subjects, especially the younger ones. Comprehension and phonological production task results revealed that specificity and proximity had differential effects on novel word acquisition dependent on the type of information to be acquired and recalled; these results support the idea that the listener processes various aspects of the novel word and its meaning differently, depending on the propositional context available. This method of fast mapping of novel words in story context was found to be a flexible and useful paradigm for examining fast mapping skills across a wide developmental range. (MSE)",

This hypothesis was tested as an alternative to two existing hypotheses concerning children's selective listening for content words and for stress. The subjects were three groups of toddlers. Their responses on an imitation task were analyzed for omission of functors for English and nonsense words. For one group, the experimenter gave content words more stress than functors. For the second group, the strings were generated on a speech synthesizer to give the same intonation contour to each. The third group was divided into two subgroups, one hearing recorded human speech and  one hearing synthesizer speech, but in all cases, the English and nonsense strings to be imitated contained schwa. The results of the three studies contradict both the content attention and stress hypotheses and support the hypothesis under consideration: That children omit functors because they have analyzed them as separate morphemes.

In the first experiment, 1-year-olds were presented with auditory stimuli (words) and screens containing paired color photographs of the object described by each word and of an unusual object for which the child had no label. Six different acoustic forms were created for each word: the citation form; the word with unreleased final consonant; deleted final consonant; deleted initial consonant; vowel replaced with another vowel; and the vowel produced alone. The children's looks to the right or left side of the screen were recorded. In the second experiment, the test was modified to increase the children's overall attention.  In both tests, the children looked preferentially at one side of the screen on some of the experimental word forms but not on the control words. They responded preferentially when either one or both consonants were present, and for some words, the correct vowel was critical. In general, the results are consistent with views that children do not perceive words in complete, adult-like forms, but focus only on a few salient features of the adult target. As anticipated, much individual variation was found and research methods to reduce data variability are recommended. (MSE)",

Results show that the children used the same types of questions and directives as those used by English monolingual adults and children. Questions and directives occurred more frequently in the language in which the children are more proficient.  Some types of questions, such as rhetorical questions, were used only by proficient speakers. Personality factors seemed to affect the number and types of directives used by some children. Other factors such as the context of the interaction, the social situation, and the audience influenced the number and types of these speech acts used.

The 2-week course and materials were designed for visiting Latin American faculty members in agricultural education. Course goals were to improve participants' academic English proficiency, to prepare them for large amounts of specialized reading, and to provide opportunities for discussion with professors and other students. One concern was the need to hold the participants' interest while language skills were developed. The resulting seminar had the theme of &quot;Problems in the Transfer of Technology: Focus on Latin America,&quot; a subject of general interest and one for which local resources were readily available. The course consisted of  lectures by specialists, informal discussions, follow-up language-related activities, readings, laboratory work, and field trips. The readings used were authentic and drawn from a variety of sources, but in place of traditional reading exercises, activities for previewing, picking out main ideas, determining central themes, drawing logical conclusions and inferences, and developing opinions were used. Responses of students and guest lecturers were very positive, and it is concluded that the course design is an attractive alternative for advanced adult students of English as a second language.

It is concluded that there is a synchronic and diachronic justification for a GPSG analysis of the tensed forms of the English copula as distinct from nonauxiliary verbs in two respects: (1) the semantics of their combination with tense is given lexically, and (2) they lack the morphology of verbal inflection.

        "description":"A study investigated how young children understand natural kind terms by examining how 3- and 4-year-olds rely on category membership to draw inductive inferences about objects. One hundred four children (53 girls and 51 boys) from six preschools in California and Michigan participated in the study. The children were shown 10 sets of pictures of natural objects or creatures, told something about the items shown, and asked to draw inferences about other natural kind pictures. Two conditions were added: word only condition and picture only condition. Results suggest that even the youngest children assume that objects with the same name share underlying similarities. When given just labels, the children used them as a base for making inductions, and when labels and appearances  conflicted, they relied more on labels than appearances. Even when no labels were given, the children sometimes figured out what categories the pictures belonged to and used this inference to decide about other properties. It is concluded that children are clearly sensitive to the power of language for organizing and extending language, and that words that refer, even common nouns, serve to identify objects as well as foster inductions.

        "description":"A study analyzed three episodes of self-repetition in a 1-year-old's utterances and examined the child's use of self-repetition for exploiting and elaborating on his phonological system in the context of discourse. The subject was a first-born monolingual child in the Stanford Child Phonology project. The analysis provides clues about how the young child's phonological system is organized, and particularly how he handles the problem of massive formal variation in a systemic context, behaving as a phonological strategist and system-builder. It is argued that the child's phonological behavior in discourse reflects an ability to flexibly and resourcefully exploit available phonological options in the service of short-term and long-term functional objectives, both immediate  communication needs and the construction and progressive elaboration of a phonological system for the articulation of words.

The second chapter outlines significant aspects of Hmong phonology, morphology, and syntax and contrasts them with English. It also suggests techniques for teachers to use in listening for errors in student speech. The third chapter gives ideas for classroom interactions with the Hmong student, drawing on cultural traits, experiences, and items familiar to them.

The growing diversity of tasks that modern higher education systems have undertaken has led to structural differentiation, which deconcentrates the overall system, and academic professionalism, within which academics specialize their interests and commitments in a widening array of subjects and institutions. Large countries may permit diffuse coverage of all subjects, while small countries have to be selective to invest in certain fields. State-guided limitations is one way to try to control complexity. In addition to such planned responses, there are adaptive profession-led and market-led forms of differentiation and integration. (SW)",

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 phases out the deductibility of consumer interest charges and as a result will cause the expense of most loans to increase. However, loans secured by a home mortgage are fully deductible, and special consideration is offered for home loans used to finance educational and medical expenses. The following requirements that must be met are discussed: qualified residence interest, qualified indebtedness, and qualified educational expenses. Colleges should consider administrative and logistical problems before  beginning a mortgaged-backed lending program, including title searching and mortgage recording. Public policy issues include: whether higher education may abuse the tax law for self-serving reasons, whether colleges will compete unfairly with the commercial sector, and whether the plans are fair to students and their families. Information is provided on two protypical programs offered by the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Education Loan Authority. (SW)",

        "description":"A \"tacit\" dimension of knowledge is being studied within the Swedish Research on Higher Education Program. This tacit dimension includes the practitioner's capacities for applying knowledge in practice, taking a personal stance, having a sense of history, and dealing with personal and moral problems. This kind of knowledge is assumedly unnoticed in course design, teaching and testing, and recruiting and promotion. Tacit knowledge is of particular interest in new professions such as technology, economy, computer science, and for various experts and administrators. The project will systematize the components of tacit knowledge with the aid of conceptual analysis; epistemology; and the demands from society and public debate, from employers, and from students, teachers, and  administrators. Topics addressed in this newsletter issue are: the university and professionalization; research problems of investigating tacit knowledge; scientific versus traditional knowledge; obstacles against cultivating tacit knowledge; analyzing knowledge and practice; solving problems and \"managing messes\" in practice; acquiring knowledge; knowledge maintenance, distribution, and coordination; professional knowledge of organizations; the relation of the professional to others; and moral reasoning and action.

Currently, the most common tax-exempt instrument issued by higher education institutions is the revenue bond. Until the early 1980s the most common form of tax-exempt financing was long-term fixed-rate debt. Variable or floating rate debt became popular during the early 1980s in response to the high interest rates of the late 1970s. Historically, capital projects were financed with long-term debt (maturities of 20 years or more). Shorter maturities are structured as serial maturities and longer maturity bonds as term bonds. Most higher education general obligation debt is sold on a competitive, rather than a negotiated, basis. Refunding is a means of issuing new debt to refinance  existing debt. Taxable debt instruments include taxable commercial paper, medium-term notes, U.S. domestic public market, private placement, and foreign currency denominated municiples. Advantages and disadvantages of each type of taxable and tax-exempt bonds are identified. The use of a debt-service reserve fund is also briefly addressed. (SW)",

Questionnaires were completed by 58 guaranty agencies and visits were made to eight agencies. Before revised regulations were issued by the U.S. Department of Education in November 1986, each guaranty agency was allowed to establish its own collection practices, and the agencies' collection practices varied. The revised regulations required all agencies to pursue five specific actions to collect defaulted loans. These steps, pertaining to the type and frequency of collection attempts, should help to reduce federal default costs. Legislative actions taken in 1986 include a requirement for defaulters to  pay reasonable collection costs and reporting to credit bureaus about the borrowers' loans and repayment patterns. Additional suggestions concerning loan collection are presented.

Problems that may hinder a Ph.D.'s success at management include: working as part of a team, relinquishing ownership of the products of their work, and the value generally placed on assertiveness in the business world.

After discussing the role and context of higher education, consideration is given to organizational goals and how these can be reified. It is argued that goals cannot be value-free, and that a key values issue in higher education institutions is the extent of voluntarism/determinism for staff and students. Various possible higher education futures are outlined, including some that  involve an increase in decentralization or a reduction in &quot;overload.&quot; The impact of time horizons and uncertainty on higher education systems are also assessed.

Consideration is given to the purposes of publicly supported education and reasons underlying the historic distinction between public and private education. It is suggested that the issue of choice concerns the rights and obligations of the individual and the state. The relationship between Jefferson's Enlightenment faith in natural religion, natural law, and government by majority rule is briefly considered. Jefferson supported the coexistence of public and private schools; however, public support was restricted to schools that were public in philosophy and governance. It is proposed that throughout much of the nation's history public schools have perpetuated what amounted to an established republican-Protestant civil  religion. The view of Horace Mann and other reformers was that public education should be civic, moral, and nonsectarian, but nonsectarian in practice meant nondenominational Protestantism. Supreme Court decisions that have expressed support for religious and political diversity in relation to the established school system are identified, and current criticisms of public education are briefly considered.

The analyses were designed to control for suspected differential resident expectations among the directors of various medical specialties, and were replicated to determine the stability of the findings. Completed forms were returned for 64% (119) of the 1983 graduates and 74% (160) of the 1984 graduates. For both 1983 and 1984 graduates, correlations between medical school achievement measures and mean residency performance ratings were low, but significant, with the exception of 1983 Alpha Omega Alpha membership which was also low but insignificant. While the medical school performance of  outstanding residents was better than that of below average residents, it was not possible to distinguish between outstanding and average residents, nor between average and below average residents on the basis of medical school course scores. The findings support the use of academic variables in the residency selection process. However, their use as a single factor or as a method of screening out applicants from further consideration was, at best, justified only in the case of extremely high or low medical school achievement measures.

The incidence of strike activity among these unions and the degree of organizing activity in universities where clerical workers are not represented by unions were determined. It was found that most of the unionization of university clerical employees has taken place since 1970, and the amount of organizing activity has increased steadily over the past 15 years. Unions have been successful, achieving bargaining rights on some 70% of the campuses where formal organizing campaigns have been initiated. Clerical unions appear to be more firmly established at public institutions than at private institutions, with two-year colleges more likely to be unionized  than four-year colleges. Data are provided on the number of union/non-union public and private institutions by region and level (two-year/four-year). For 13 large college and university clerical unions, information is presented on strike activity since 1970 by year, length of the strike, and the bargaining agent.

        "description":"The extent of democratization of Scandinavian higher education is evaluated. Democratization is considered to include: (1) the subordination of university decision-making to parliamentary democracy and, in Sweden, to corporate representative bodies; (2) the decentralization of higher education regionally, important particularly in Finland, Norway, and Sweden; (3) equal access to college on the basis of class and gender; and (4) the internal democratization of university decision-making. The rationale underlying the distributive choices made by policymakers is also assessed. The conceptual framework for the analysis is stated by Heidenheimer, Heclo, and Adams in &quot;Comparative Public Policy.&quot; Post-war educational reforms in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden are examined  for four categories of social choice: choices of scope, choices of policy instruments, choices of distribution, and choices of restraints and innovation. The analysis suggests that Norway and Sweden have been the most successful in democratizing higher education. Denmark and Finland, while implementing significant reform measures, generally have failed to equal the level of democratization reached by Norway and Sweden; and Iceland lags behind its neighbors.

Five indicated that they were first-generation college students, and three said they were low-income. Three were sophomores, one a senior, and one respondent was unidentified. The questionnaire covered: teachers' characteristics, evaluation of specific courses, advisement and counseling evaluation, Special Services Project evaluation, and administrator evaluation. Respondents basically found teachers to be organized,  experienced, and knowledgeable. There was no consensus on whether the course load was too much. Advisors and counselors were considered to be available, amiable, and advisory in a useful manner. The advising and counseling programs were considered well organized and managed, conveniently located, and beneficial.

The data were obtained from the 1985 Recent College Graduates Survey of the U.S. Department of Education. Although it was found that the college debts of the 1983-1984 graduates were still moderate, it also provided evidence that the debt burden for students has been increasing. One third of 1976-1977 baccalaureate recipients had college debt; 43% of 1983-1984 graduates had such debt. Of those who borrowed, the average college debt in 1983-1984 was about $5,470, almost twice the average of 1976-1977 ($2,700). For graduates earning an average salary, repayment of college debts called for about 4% of their pre-tax earnings in 1985, up from 3% in 1978. It is estimated that for  1986-1987 baccalaureate recipients, the average debt may be $7,500 with repayments requiring about 5% of pretax earnings.

Included are descriptions of assignments that students of abnormal psychology can choose to show their understanding of the idea that meaning and truth are relative.

The first part discusses basic principles, including the aims of training, who should be trained, what they will be trained in, who will train them, how they will be trained, and where and for how long distance educators will be trained. Tasks and training needs as proposed in a report of an earlier APEID (Asia and the Pacific Programme of Educational Innovation in Development) regional seminar are appended to this section. The second section describes the training modules and how they are used and provides exemplar modules designed for the  training of personnel involved in system administration, the production of correspondence materials, or the writing of scripts for educational radio or television. Orientation materials for distance learners and their families are also provided. The third section contains examples of training modules and materials that can be used to supplement the workshop programs, including bulletins, newsletters, journals, conferences, a mid-career training program for distance education personnel, and preservice and broadcast study programs.

Reports on distance education development and the contributions of APEID to that development are presented for each of the participating countries, i.e., Australia, Bangladesh, China, India, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Activities undertaken by APEID during the Third Programme Cycle are also reviewed in terms of program area, objectives, activities, and outcomes. A synthesis of the resulting summaries is presented in two  parts--regional and sub-regional meetings, and national workshops. On the basis of these summaries, it was concluded that substantial progress had been achieved on the distance education projects which resulted from regional/sub-regional and national activities initiated by APEID, particularly with respect to: (1) distance education systems and structures; (2) training of distance educators; (3) course and study materials design and development; and (4) the use of distance education as an infrastructure for other developments.

Two of the four classes, which are offered via closed-circuit television, are a vocational education class and a foreign language class at the secondary level; the other two are a professional education class for parent educators and a food preservation class for extension homemakers. Videotapes of class sessions and interviews with teachers and learners have been used to collect the data, which are being analyzed using ethnographic procedures. Two findings from the studies illustrate what is being learned about teaching and  learning in this context: (1) the interactive television technology did not appear to be a significant intrusion on the flow of lessons; and (2) there was much less interaction between the students and the teachers in several remote sites with small numbers of students. Based on these four studies, planners have more insight into the number of sites that might be linked together effectively; the responsiveness of adults and adolescents to the system; and the support that teachers need to succeed in this context. Teachers using the system can reflect on patterns of classroom interaction and technology usage in the four courses studied, and adapt the teaching strategies they use in a traditional classroom to this new medium.

        "description":"Microcomputers can be used with simulation software to provide students both with experience in the \"real world\" of decision making and feedback on the decisions made. Such software allows individual students to choose the roles they wish to play from a menu of diverse roles and provides alternatives for them to consider for each decision to be made. The emphasis in simulation decision-making tends to be on the quality of the decision rather than right or wrong answers, i.e., some decisions are better than others. Simulation software for the classroom should be free of grammatical errors; provide students with the opportunity to respond frequently to stimuli; and be at the students' level of understanding. Teachers need to be knowledgeable about the subject matter, sequence of  presentation, and the response students should make to the programs; be good managers of student time devoted to simulation usage; and utilize simulation programs with other instructional materials. Objectives for student achievement should address understandings, skills, and attitudes. Some educators recommend that teachers develop their own simulation programs; however, quality software is becoming more available, and the commitment of time and energy involved in software development are important considerations for teachers. A list of factors involved in the effective use of simulated materials to assist students in achieving higher cognitive level objectives concludes this paper. A sample software evaluation form is included. (RP)",

        "description":"Many basic skills are chains of cognitive operations. For teaching such skills, two questions have not been adequately investigated: (1) how the operations comprising the skill should be sequenced, and (2) the relationships among the operations that need to be taught. This investigation entailed four studies on different types and lengths of basic skills in either math or English, and the students were college freshmen. Four types of sequencing were investigated (forward chaining, backward chaining, hierarchical, and elaboration), as well as two types of relationships that might be important to teach (contextual synthesis and performance synthesis). The results indicate that neither sequence nor synthesis makes much difference for teaching a short skill, but that the longer the  skill (or set of related skills), the more difference both sequence and synthesis make. The forward chaining sequence resulted in higher achievement than the elaboration sequence. Based on both theoretical prescriptions and common curriculum sequences in K-12, it is proposed that an elaboration sequence may be effective only for considerably larger chunks of interrelated content (rules) than had been previously proposed, and that within each of those chunks a forward or backward chaining sequence is likely to be optimal.

        "description":"Focusing on the achievement and motivational effects of analogies of varying enrichment levels when used with abstract, unfamiliar, and difficult content, this study examined their effects on instruction at the recall and application levels using content consisting of both concepts and principles. The subjects were 123 eighth-grade science students who were assigned to one of three treatment groups for each of six topics: (1) no analogy, (2) simple analogy, and (3) enriched analogy. An instructional booklet and a posttest booklet were distributed to each student, and both immediate and delayed posttests were administered. Analysis of variance revealed no significant main effects on any of the immediate posttests, i.e., recall, application, or total. In contrast, significance was  approached or reached on 5 of the 12 delayed achievement test measures, 1 on the recall level and 4 on the application level. The results of this study suggest that, although analogies may not be very useful for either rote remember-level learning or application-level learning, they may often be very useful for creating linkages within memory that would have an important influence on meaningful understanding, long-term retention, far transfer, problem solving, and the skill of analogical reasoning. A 31-item reference list is provided. (RP)",

        "description":"Self-instructional booklets simulating computer-assisted instruction (CAI) were used to teach four basic concepts in science to first graders in three treatment groups which received different types of feedback--hints, correct answers, and right or wrong. A control group received neither instruction nor feedback. A multiple-choice test was administered to the 47 students in the 4 groups following completion of the instruction. It was found that the group provided with hints had the highest mean; the group provided with the correct answer had the second highest mean; the group provided with right/wrong feedback had the second lowest mean; and the control group had the lowest mean. The results were inconclusive with respect to the hypotheses as there were no significant differences  among the group means.

Two survey instruments were designed and distributed, one for librarians and trustees and the other for patrons. The first questionnaire was sent to 194 public libraries, while 6,227 copies of the second were sent to 182 libraries serving discrete patron populations. The rates of return for the surveys were 54% from librarians, 38% from trustees, and 28% from patrons. Questions addressed to librarians and trustees covered: (1) activity area priorities; (2) service priorities; (3)  service group priorities; (4) actions to increase patron use and/or satisfaction; (5) activity involvement and curtailment; (6) Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA), Title I, and local libraries; (7) LSCA, Title I, and statewide benefits; and (8) LSCA, Title III, and statewide benefits. In addition to demographic information and information on frequency of library use and need for library services, the questionnaire for patrons requested their perceptions of the quality of service, most needed services, services to discontinue, and the relative importance of 11 activities supported in part by federal funds. Data are presented in tables and graphs throughout the report, and a final table provides a comparison of the opinions of all three groups on the 11 federally supported  activities. It is noted that trustees and librarians agreed with each other to a greater extent than either group does with patrons. (Author/RP)",

        "description":"The New Start program at the University of Nebraska-Omaha was initiated in 1975 to focus on the needs and concerns of nontraditional students, i.e, individuals who are at least 25 years old and have been away from formal education for at least three years. Offered as an elective course for one hour of credit, the program includes reviews of basic skills in math and English as well as the learning of study and test-taking skills, stress management, and library skills. The largest single block of New Start time--25 percent of the class sessions--is spent in instruction on the use of library resources. Focusing on the bibliographic instruction component of the program, this paper discusses the special needs of this group of students and how the library instruction helps to meet  these needs. The content of the course is also briefly described together with the teaching methods used, students' and librarians' attitudes toward the course, and an assessment of its effectiveness. The 17-page Library Orientation Workbook, four worksheet assignments, and the evaluation form that students complete in the last class of each session are appended. (RP)",

        "description":"Developed by the Instructional Services Department of Northern Kentucky University's W. Frank Steely Library, this self-paced workbook is designed for students who are undertaking library research projects. Based on a five-step search strategy and designed to provide individualized guidance through the fundamental steps in the library research process, the guide can be adapted to any student's research topic, and its worksheets can be used as the basis for a working bibliography. Emphasis is placed on the ability to determine particular information needs, to determine sources appropriate to those needs, and to evaluate the usefulness and reliability of each source. Following general instructions on the use of the workbook, the search strategy is introduced, and discussions are  presented on the search strategy components of choosing and refining a topic; locating books, periodicals, and government documents on the topic; and locating additional information as needed. A concluding discussion considers the importance of evaluating information. Six worksheets are provided for the various components of the search strategy, and selected listings of subject encyclopedias and subject indexes are included. (Author/KM)",

A letter from John H. Luke, Associate Director of GAO's Resources, Community,  and Economic Development Division, summarizes the review and discusses OMB (Office of Management and Budget) Circular A-76 procedures, the status of the NOAA library review, an NOAA variance with procedures that was noted but did not affect the award of the contract, and the audit objectives, scope, and methodology. GAO findings on eight library employee and ALA allegations/concerns pertaining to the A-76 process and a listing of major contributors to the report are appended. (KM)",

Helmke Library at Indiana University-Purdue University, Fort Wayne, in re-evaluating various library procedures. Responses were received from nine of the 11 libraries to which the brief survey questionnaire was mailed. Survey questions focused on: (1) reference services, including total hours of reference service per week, number of full-time reference librarians, and reference questions answered over a one-year period; (2) computer searches, including when searches are performed, number of librarians performing searches, types of terminals, search subsidy policies, cancellation of print indexes  available online, and total number of searches performed during the past year; and (3) library instruction, including number of orientation and bibliographic instruction sessions held during the past year, grading procedures, and recordkeeping. Four miscellaneous questions addressed circulation, lost book replacement expenditures and ordering, and educational leaves for clerical staff. It is concluded that shared solutions to regional campus library problems may result in better service to the unique group of patrons the libraries are designed to serve.

The study focused on determining: (1) the accuracy of information patrons received; (2) the level of skill SRAs used in negotiating patron needs; (3) the ability of SRAs to refer patrons to professional librarians; and (4) the degree of satisfaction patrons felt about the service they had received. The five studies included an unobtrusive question test for the SRAs and surveys of patrons, reference assistants, department assistants, and professional librarians.  Following an introductory discussion, study findings are presented on the quality of reference service, the work environment, SRA training, and the professional librarian's reference desk service role. It is concluded that problems exist with the current reference service, and recommendations are presented for the areas of performance standards, training improvement, and subject specialist involvement.

The EAB is prepared by the ERIC Processing and Reference Facility on the basis of material submitted by the ERIC Clearinghouses and other components of the ERIC system. The EAB is issued every month or two, depending on the volume of material available. All EAB articles are reviewed and approved by Central ERIC before publication. The EAB is distributed solely within the ERIC system (approximately 20 contractors) and is intended as an internal newsletter  or journal of the ERIC system and a major means for the decentralized components of ERIC to communicate and interact with one another. The EAB is also a permanent record reflecting most of the major events in the life of the ERIC system (such as personnel changes, Standing Order Customer changes, etc.) and providing in printed form essential documents (such as ERIC policy and priority statements, Clearinghouse scope statement modifications, &quot;ERIC Processing Manual&quot; revisions, etc.). Current major categories for announcements are: Action Items; Network News; Personnel; Clearinghouse Publications; Meetings Participated In. All new forms and all major reports commonly are included as Attachments to EAB issues.

The delivery system used an existing transportation system to bring gifted students from individual schools together once a week at area vocational schools to achieve a cost-effective class size. At the vocational school, students received a variety of diversified educational experiences from a succession of teachers who were handpicked on the basis of their experience and skill in the instruction of gifted students. The project report provides an overview of the  activities, profiles of the participating instructors, and instructional modules designed and implemented by the faculty. The modules include, with some variation, information on suggested time frame, prerequisites, overview of the unit, objectives, unit outline, assignments, informational text, suggested activities, culminating activities, study guides, and suggested films. The modules cover: (1) \"The Exciting World of Dramatics\" (Dramatic Arts Module); (2) \"Karst Geomorphology and Speleology\" (Earth Sciences Module); (3) \"Contemporary World Issues\" (World Affairs Module); (4) \"Megatrends and Society\" (Social Sciences Module); and (5) \"Computers: Tools of Tomorrow\" (Technology Module).

While definitions and counting procedures vary considerably among institutions and states, several categories of transfer students can be roughly identified: (1) articulated vertical transfers, who move in regular sequence from high school to community college to university; (2) reverse transfers, who move from a four-year college to a two-year college; (3) vocational transfers, who move to a senior institution as a career/occupational degree candidate; (4) lateral transfers, who move from one community  college to another; (5) international transfers, who transfer from a foreign institution; and (6) nontraditional transfers, including adults who return to college after years of &quot;stopping out,&quot; applicants who received earlier training at a proprietary school, and applicants from educational programs in industry or government. Valid articulation/transfer agreements will depend on further research into the development of uniform identification and counting systems that can be used by all institutions in identifying and tracking various types of transfer students.

The centers, which are operating on 20 community college campuses, 14 California State University campuses, 9 University of California campuses, and 12 independent universities, provide information to students, staff, and faculty on admissions requirements and the transferability of courses between community colleges and  the other segments of higher education in California.

Following introductory material on the project, study design, and methods, an inventory of affirmative action initiatives is presented, covering federal programs, state programs, institutional commitment, minority transfer programs, and external support systems. The next section focuses on institutionally supported practices to identify minority students, facility student entry or assimilation, recruit minority students for a particular area of study or major, increase retention, and provide follow-up or assessment. This section also  looks at future initiatives and the initiatives thought to have the greatest potential. The next section offers a series of observations and concerns about ways in which the initiatives seem to be externally rather than internally motivated; the influence of the chief executive officer's attitude on the effectiveness of the educational equity office; the tendency of the institutions to equate &quot;minority&quot; with &quot;black&quot;; the fragmentation of affirmative action efforts; and the role of state policy in increasing institutional competition. The report concludes with a series of recommendations. Appendices include a list of affirmative action initiatives by college, and the survey instrument. (EJV)",

A temporary part-time position of sales representative was approved, with the following duties and responsibilities: (1) become familiar with all vocational programs assigned to Trades & Technologies at CCC; (2) develop a marketing plan to meet the unique needs of each program coordinator; (3) implement the marketing plan and provide weekly reports to the coordinators and the director on contacts and results; (4) coordinate the implementation of a vocational contact  checklist, a form to be completed by high school principals and superintendents indicating the presentations and materials desired from the college; (5) work with college students assigned to high school recruitment; and (6) submit an evaluation of recruitment results for review and action. During the 6 months of the recruitment effort, larger high schools in and out of the Salem area were targeted to receive the vocational contact checklist and to be visited by the sales representative. Results of the effort revealed the value of the high school teacher as contact person, of attending career fair or career days at the high school, of meeting with students outside of the classroom atmosphere, and of using a multi-media approach.

The book is divided into four sections. Part 1 presents a paradigmatic picture of the community college as it might look in 1979, offering a model of a \"self-renewing institution\" with a flexible curriculum built on a firm instructional base. Part 2 traces the history of curricular and instructional practices in junior colleges and attempts to address issues related to the continuing interest in instructional innovation, and  calls for curricular experimentation. Part 3 relates the model college of 1979 to its current counterpart, suggesting and extending arguments for making the transition.

The review suggests that aspects of the child care system, and of the child care system in interaction with the family system, may influence the development of young  children's social competency with peers.

        "description":"Effects of Logo instruction on the performance of 21 grade 2 and 26 grade 4 Canadian students on a map reading task was examined in a pretest-treatment-posttest design with controls. Logo instruction was implemented through a series of four graduated, sequential Logo Microworld programs which were used by students daily for 7 months. The control group consisted of children drawn from classes in which computers were used for drills and word processing. The pretest-posttest map-reading task required children to give instructions to a puppet about how to proceed along the paths of 12 maps. Findings indicated that (1) the acquisition of basic Logo concepts involving use of alternative frames of reference and the manipulation of directions involving rotation and angles can be  facilitated through the implementation of the Logo Microworld programs; (2) the careful implementation of the Microworld programs resulted in transfer of specific spatial skills to the related domain of map-reading; and (3) developmental constraints exist that limit the ability of young children to master certain spatial skills embedded in Logo and to use them in contexts involving transfer. It is concluded that findings highlight the importance of carefully matching concepts in Logo with specific cognitive effects and of taking into consideration task complexity and cognitive developmental factors.

        "description":"Observational records presented in this report demonstrate the powerful influence that adults have on the developing literacy of young children. The report reveals the role that language plays in contextually providing adults' expectations for the extent of children's participation in written language events. Observations of 4-year-old fraternal twin sisters interacting in literacy events with their mother and father revealed that the oral language of both parents functioned for similar purposes, suggesting that both parents held similar expectations for each child's written language effort. These observations were consistent with previous findings. While possibly similar for each individual child, parents' expectations differed from child to child. Thus, parents focused on  meaning in interactions with one of the twins, and on letter formation and placement with the other. It was seen as important that both girls responded as expected. It is concluded that oral language transactions between adults and children during written language activities have tremendous impact on the way children learn to make meaning through writing. It is important that parents and teachers recognize the influences their teaching language has on children's early writing efforts. (RH)",

        "description":"To find predictive relations between measures taken in infancy and later scores on intelligence tests, a study was made that measured in the infant those cognitive processes examined later in life. Operant conditioning tasks were employed which required 3-, 7-, and 11-month-old infants to execute some response to produce an environmental consequence. At each age, infants recieved 2 days of training separated by 24 hours and a retention test session 7 or 14 days later. Measures of retention were based upon the number of responses emitted during specific nonreinforcement phases. Subjects were 41 full-term middle class Caucasian infants who were tested with the Bayley Mental and Motor Scales of Infant Development approximately 1 week following retention test sessions and the Bayley  Scales and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test at 27 months of age. The two measures of retention were correlated at all four ages, but they were not correlated with Bayley Scale scores. Retention measures were significantly correlated between 3 and 7 and 7 and 11 months. Significant positive correlations were obtained between retention measures at each age and Stanford-Binet and Bayley Mental scores at 27 months, with one exception. Findings suggested that infant memory is a relatively stable component of infant cognition that is related to later intelligence. (RH)",

        "description":"A survey of research findings on environmental and person variables provides clues as to what is required in a high quality infant-toddler program. One of the most important components of such a program is a loving, responsive caregiver. Research has shown that there are specific adult qualities that nurture the roots of intellectual competence, cooperative interactions, and resilience in coping with stress. Some of these qualities are: (1) tender, careful holding; (2) the ability to provide feedings that respect individual tempos; (3) accurate interpretation of, and prompt attention to, distress signals; (4) provision of opportunities and freedom to explore toys on the floor; and (5) the ability to give babies control over social interactions. In addition, opportunities for  language interchanges and turn-taking talk are important in promoting optimal develpment. Adults also need to understand infant developmental levels and sensorimotor states when planning environments for infants and toddlers. Optimal nutrition and preventive health care are also important aspects of a quality program. Finally, adults should be aware of the importance they have as rule-givers and role models. Adults can encourage prosocial, altruistic behaviors in children by their own actions and by the way in which they handle conflicts. Quality infant-toddler programs can have a positive effect on the facilitation of cognitive and social development in very young children. (PCB)",

While families do share common needs and aspirations, it is unwise to invoke an image of the family which assumes that all families fulfill tasks in the same way. Practitioners in the fields of education and the social services too often find themselves struggling with the unintended consequences of a static and monolithic image of the family. It is possible to discern a pattern from among the interwoven economic, social, and demographic changes in society. In contrast to traditional patterns of home economics in which members of a family achieved material well-being and security because of their membership in a family, today, economic well-being is achieved in  spite of family responsibilities. If a place is to be made for families in the future, a critical assessment is needed of (1) patterns of economic development that require high rates of geographical mobility, (2) patterns of income distribution that severely marginalize anyone who is not active in the labor force, and (3) patterns of work and employment that are insensitive to the family responsibilities of employees.

The evaluation specifically investigated the extent to which PhoneFriend provided information and support to children at home alone after school and the extent to which the service provided a viable after-school service for parents. An additional focus of the evaluation was to assess the extent of the community's awareness of the program. Adult subjects, listed in the Pennsylvania State University faculty and staff telephone directory, were contacted by campus mail. When possible their children were surveyed by telephone. A total of 80 parents responded to the survey questionnaire  and 37 of their children were interviewed. Data suggested that PhoneFriend has been successful in providing a valuable and greatly appreciated service to parents and children in the university community. The overwhelming majority of parents and children surveyed were familiar with PhoneFriend and, in general, were pleased with the service. It is concluded that PhoneFriend has recognized and acted upon an important community need in an effective, efficient manner that has completely satisfied its target audience. Six tables provide detailed results; parent and child survey intruments are appended. (RH)",

A schema, script, or story grammar is a sequence of features that typically occur in a common event or story.

Rough toys, fashioned by local craftsmen, have been handed down from generation to generation. But today, India is beset with the problems of increased population, poverty, and illiteracy. Resulting socio-economic conditions are catapulting children into a premature adulthood by forcing them to work instead of play. Relatively more educated parents prod their children to be winners of the cut-throat competition for schools and employment, thereby encroaching on their children's play time. Nonetheless, in the time remaining at their disposal, Indian children can  be seen to be actively engaged in play and at their creative best in their manipulation of available resources in the play environment. Governmental child welfare intervention programs such as the Integrated Child Developmental Services scheme, the Bal Bhawan Kendras, and the Toy Bank, by providing stimulation and opportunities for overall development, seek to restore to Indian children their right to play.

        "description":"A scheme for classifying attachment patterns is proposed that retains important elements of Ainsworth's system, but extends it to allow for the inclusion of more deviant patterns of behavior. The proposed scheme asserts that attachment relationships can be ordered on a continuum of felt security based upon an organizational interpretation of the security that the child derives from the relationship with the parent in the Strange Situation. Behaviors considered in the new classification are those of (1) amelioration; (2) avoidance; (3) resistance; (4) difficulty in comforting; (5) depressed affect; (6) disharmony; and (7) disconnectedness. This system and Ainsworth's were used to classify a sample of 2- and 3-year-old children (N=38) of depressed mothers of varying ages who were  part of a larger study. Classification was based upon the immediate success of the child's efforts to use the parent as a secure base and a more general judgment of the security that the child derived from the parent. Comparison of results indicated that the new scheme allowed classification of &quot;unclassifiable&quot; patterns; permitted classification over a wide range of ages in early childhood; detected insecurity in behaviors not included in Ainsworth's system; increased discrimination within pattern classification categories; and reduced the potential error of measurement at the border between categories. A table shows the security ratings for 10 of the children studied. Fourteen references are listed. (RH)",

A summary of each unit follows with a day-by-day outline of lesson plans and the knowledge and skills taught or reinforced. Next come detailed, sequential lesson plans and illustrated handouts for students. Kindergarten units relate to the social studies concepts of one's self and one's surroundings and introduce students to the  subsistence lifestyle of a Tlingit fish camp and the importance of the salmon as a food source. First grade units look more closely at the forest environment surrounding the fish camp. Second graders learn about community by constructing a Tlingit Winter House. Third graders host a potlatch and are introduced to Alaska's cultural diversity. Fourth graders develop understanding of Alaskan history by learning about items traded by the Tlingits and Athabaskans. Fifth graders learn more about trade and respect for natural resources. (JHZ)",

Five categories of issues/needs emerged from the interview data: communications, jobs, transportation, relocation, and resources. Recommendations developed for the DVR to address these needs include: (1) continue liaison between the Pueblos and DVR counselors through a continued/expanded role for Rehabilitation Technicians; (2) develop/implement an awareness program in  the Pueblos regarding rights and needs of disabled individuals; (3) plan/implement meetings to provide information to department counselors regarding the Pueblos and their unique cultural characteristics to improve counselors' effectiveness; (4) identify major employers in the Pueblos and conduct an educational awareness program targeted at potential employers; (5) adopt a strategy of interaction that results in a consistent/predictable schedule of on-site office hours to facilitate access to vocational rehabilitation counselors; and (6) establish community councils within the Pueblos that have representation from state and local service providers, tribal officials, and consumers of services.

        "description":"A longitudinal records analysis of students enrolled in Chapter 1 and other categorical programs of the Mesa Public Schools in the 1980-81 school year was conducted. Data were collected from 1980 to 1984 regarding service patterns in Chapter 1, Indian Education, Migrant, and English as a Second Language (ESL) programs. It was found that Chapter 1 students received services on an average of 1.4 years, ESL 1.4 years, Indian Education 1.7 years, and Migrant Education 2 years. Generally, Chapter 1 students' participation was below 2% in Indian Education, 4% in the Migrant program and 10% in ESL. An average 30% of Chapter 1 students were served by reading and 25% by math services in grades 2-6. From 1980 to 1984, 1st grade and kindergarten participation rose from 20 to 38%. Within  Chapter 1, 40% of students received multiple services, mostly math and reading. Exit of students from ESL to Chapter 1 was the predominant form of transfer between programs (25%). Few Chapter 1 students transferred to categorical programs. Longitudinal analysis of a first grade cohort with 3 and 4 years of service showed that the average reading and math NCE scores declined with increased length of service. Gains made were not sustained. Chapter 1 showed the lowest retention rate (2.5%) with ESL the highest (9%). (JMM)",

The Commission serves as a forum for farm laborers to share information and concerns, monitors programs, conducts inspections, promotes coordination, and develops recommendations. Area meetings were organized in each of the three geographic regions (Western Maryland, Eastern Upper Shore, and Eastern Lower Shore) to bring together area service providers for a pre-season planning session and a post-season assessment session. Federal budget cuts also played a significant role in uniting agencies for survival purposes and continuing services. The initiative taken by the Commission, and adopted  by the agencies, led to open communication between providers and growers, excellent working relationships among agencies/providers, and innovative projects. The document is divided into four major sections: &quot;Model Projects&quot; lists and describes three significant coordination efforts in Maryland among migrant labor service agencies and providers; &quot;State Level Coordination and Initiatives&quot; describes agreements and coordination among state agencies and linkages with non-state agencies; &quot;Description of Agencies&quot; gives brief descriptions of 10 agencies; and Appendices consist of maps of the three geographical areas, and samples of tracking cards and a daily log.

Recognizing the growing challenge for local leaders and the contribution that educational assistance can make, the Cooperative Extension System has identified Revitalizing Rural America as a priority program for FY 1988-91. This publication analyzes the current situation in rural America and proposes a response to assist in its revitalization. It considers a number of urgent realities generated by changes in the United States and world economies, population shifts, structural changes in agriculture and other natural resource industries, and adjustments in the industrial economy. Among these realities are that hard work and successful manipulation  of natural resources do not guarantee economic success; control over local destiny has been diminished; rural areas are more dependent on volunteer leadership; service demands on local governments are growing as revenues diminish; and human/financial capital are flowing out of many rural areas. Coming to grips with these and other changes presents challenges including maintaining/enhancing competitiveness of farms and rural businesses; diversifying rural economic bases; finding alternative uses for rural resources; easing the transition for farm families and youth; providing technical/educational assistance to local governments; helping communities identify/implement policy options to increase jobs and income; and assisting with conservation/management of natural resources.

There are not many value differentiations that separate the Hispanic from the Anglo. In examining the first national study of Mexican Americans (Grebler, 1970), it is noted that Mexican Americans are both the oldest and the newest minority in the United States. Their life styles (now predominantly urban), family and marital trends, goals for their children, and work values are more and more similar to those of the dominant Anglo society, and they are increasing their interaction with Anglos. There is a greater diversity in political tactics, an  increasing differentiation in in-group and out-group perceptions, and a belief that discrimination is lessening. Cultural tenacity is not as widespread nor as powerful as literature and leadership would lead others to believe. Literature sources on Hispanic culture which may be useful to educators are discussed, followed by a 22-item list giving the bibliographic information. (JMM)",

Phase 1 identified the most important indicators of school quality and effectiveness across all respondent groups--teachers, students, administrators, boards of education, and adult community members. The 31 indicators were generally those derived elsewhere by educational researchers; among them are the following: creative teaching exists; there is good student and teacher attendance; clear standards of conduct are established; principals provide strong leadership; parents feel involved and  belong. Phase 2 determined the extent to which the indicators were found in local schools. No indicator had a mean rating at or below the mid-point of the 5-point scale, showing all groups rated their schools high on quality indicators. School staff were the most positive and students the least. Correlation coefficients were derived for each indicator with revenue/pupil, district size and wealth, and pupil/teacher ratio. School district wealth/pupil revenue were positively related to perceived quality/effectiveness, while school enrollment and pupil/teacher ratio were not. Profiles for the five most and five least effective schools were compiled. A bibliography and appendices containing sample forms, letters, and questionnaires conclude the report. (JMM)",

Different approaches are being tried in two rural Saskatchewan school divisions. In Division A (six schools), the project consisted of three main activities: reviewing a set of nine school effectiveness variables; having each school staff use a rating procedure to choose which of the nine factors might be the best starting point for an improvement effort; and explaining a &quot;plan of action&quot; process whereby specific targets, procedures, and responsibilities were developed for whole staff approval before implementation.  Reaction to the project was varied, but generally the improvements attempted were satisfactory to the staff. The degree of commitment and leadership were reflected in the success rate. In Division B (15 schools), the basic intention is the improvement of principalship, judged important because of the centrality of the principal's role in building and sustaining the organizational culture of the school. School improvement will then come about through cultural linkages. It is expected that the cultural development approach will yield more successful results, but the results are not yet known. (JMM)",

First, it uses a very broad definition of service delivery that encompasses revenue enhancement methods, expenditure reduction options, and innovative program arrangements. Second, it argues that three interrelated categories of research needs must be addressed: measurement of community management capacity, studies that inventory and assess intergovernmental responsibilities, and studies of the alternative financing and service delivery modes. Third, noting the lack of existing research, the paper argues for the implementation of limited or exploratory studies, especially those that examine several states comparatively. The report also offers guidelines for developing a research  design using a simulated case study approach in which local officials are asked to explain their perceptions of the usefulness of various options, drawbacks to their use, and other relevant factors. Such case studies would address the relationships among existing management capacity, intergovernmental responsibilities, and alternative financing and service delivery options, and the methodology would allow for systematic data collection while capturing the uniqueness of governmental units. Topics are suggested for future research with a focus on service delivery and financing options, policy implementation, and local capacity-building. Citations for 108 references are included.

Other policy  issues considered are the affordability of homeownership for young families and the impact of changes in the tax status of rental properties on the quantity, quality, and cost of rental units.

        "author":["Cotton, Kathleen"],
        "description":"The unusually high rate of teacher turnover in American Indian reservation schools (up to 41% of new teachers on South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation) is an ongoing source of distress to administrators, teachers, and community members. Teachers who move on tend to be young, inexperienced (four or fewer years in teaching), single, and from or preferring urban areas. School factors correlated with high turnover include lack of administrative support, low academic standards, inadequate professional development policies, low salaries, small enrollments with high percentages of Native American students, and inadequate curriculum development. Key community characteristics causing turnover are geographic isolation and language and cultural barriers. Suggestions for reducing teacher  turnover, based on research and administrator experience, are recruitment of experienced teachers from rural backgrounds and accurate descriptions of job, school, community, and regional benefits. Rural colleges, colleges with Indian or multicultural programs, and Indian-related agencies can help with teacher recruitment. Teachers and tribal representatives are valuable additions to screening/interview committees. Good induction programs, mentoring programs, social gatherings with community members and district staff, professional development programs, and effective administrative leadership will all assist in retaining good teachers.

These grants have enabled Indian tribes and Hawaiian natives to improve their public library services through a number of authorized activities, including training of library personnel, purchase of library materials, and the construction and renovation of library facilities. The amount of funding is an established percentage of the annual appropriations for LSCA I, II, and III.

The Middle School Science Project investigated ways to help middle school science teachers use teaching strategies that were identified in earlier studies as particularly effective in promoting meaningful conceptual-change learning. Such learning requires students to go beyond memorization of facts and terminology and to make sense of scientific explanations of phenomena. For students, such learning in science often requires them to go through a difficult process of conceptual change, reshaping and abandoning ideas or misconceptions that they have developed from experience and have believed for a long time. The materials  include an introductory description of students' difficulties related to learning about photosynthesis, a student text with accompanying comments and suggestions to teachers, a set of overhead transparent masters, and suggested laboratory activities.

The scientific uses of analogy are then traced through three time periods and the styles of analogizing practice by scientists at different points in history are contrasted. This comparison suggests that the notion of analogical soundness has evolved over time. (Author/TW)",

This document describes the major criteria and procedures utilized for materials selection to achieve the stated goals and considers the federal government's role in international studies education. Recommendations for federal agencies and departments  include: (1) encourage existing federally-funded programs to incorporate precollegiate global studies programs; (2) increase the funding for federal programs which support the development of global education programs; (3) improve the liaison among federal agencies that fund global education activities; (4) fund research projects, K-12 and college-level consortium programs, and summer institutes; and (5) increase funding to area studies centers.

Charles Fowler presented \"The Crisis in Teacher Education: Issues for the Arts,\" and Kathryn Martin, in \"On Teaching Teachers to Teach,\" analyzed a status report on learning processes in arts teacher education. In \"Art for Art's Sake and More,\" G. Leland Burningham considered the relationships and conflicts of arts teaching as they relate to the total education process. What art teachers need to know for effective classroom teaching is described by Gerard Knieter in \"Teaching the Arts,\" and Brent Wilson concluded with \"Evaluating Teaching in  the Arts: Scenes from a Complex Drama.\" Responses to a number of these presentations are included. Additionally, these proceedings contain information on: (1) planning and developing the symposium; (2) the agenda; (3) recommendations for arts teacher training improvements; and (4) a summation and evaluation of the symposium.

The selection criteria included: (1) appeal to elementary students; (2) the inclusion of mathematics or language arts exercises within an activity; and (3) usefulness in sex role stereotyping instruction. Nine worksheet activities feature lessons on role predicting, sex stereotyping within selected race and ethnic groups, a comparison of male and female incomes, and puzzles featuring Susan B. Anthony and Emmy Noether. Four specific situations and accompanying discussion questions are included in which student perceptions of specific sex roles can be identified and compared; and homework  assignments, involving evaluations of television programs, advertisements, and male/female shopping patterns, are described. Class projects are suggested to explore careers in science, interaction with persons of the opposite sex, the sex and the role of main characters in storybooks, and birthday celebrations of outstanding women. Surveys, quizzes, and games are also included. (JHP)",

However, the field of education might benefit from a greater input of Kantorian, as opposed to Skinnerian, theory. Policymakers, administrators, and teachers have failed to totally adopt Skinner's educational proposals, which focus heavily on programmed instruction and do not consider how teaching is actually practiced or how educators discuss educational goals. Two examples of interbehavioral educational approaches are presented. One, based on &quot;The Psychology of Learning and Techniques of Teaching&quot; by J. M. Thyne, explains learning as the adoption of a new response to a situation. The second example, the EXRIB System of Analyzing  Teaching, was developed as an indisciplinary endeavor and as part of the Classroom Interaction Project (CIP) at Jordanhill College. Project participants analyzed statements about teaching and observations of actual teaching situations and devised a model based on teaching as a goal-oriented activity. Appendices include an explanation of the EXRIB system and a report entitled &quot;An Interbehavioral Perspective on Applied Behavior Analysis.&quot; Figures and tables are included. (JHP)",

Findings indicated that 20 percent of the adult population participate in ballet by attending live performances, watching it on television, or dancing in a public performance. People most likely to attend ballet  performances are: (1) women; (2) between 25 and 44 years old; (3) living in single-person households; (4) college educated; (5) living in households annually earning more than $25,000; (6) living in or near an urban area; and (7) in professional occupations or full-time students. Recommendations focus on the importance of childhood arts education, strategies dance companies might use to promote performances, and the need for ballet to be produced on television.

Joseph Pitt, in &quot;Philosophy in Applied Economics,&quot; focuses on rationality and rational choice as a foundation for economics and stresses the idea of relevance in relating data to applied economics. He believes rational decision making is based on the notions that choice is necessary and possible and that behavior is predictable. However, Pitt considers the economic model a poor predictor of behavior. Allen Buchanan, in &quot;Comparative Efficiency Judgements, Economics, and Political Philosophy,&quot; develops a rationale to show that there are fundamental obstacles to efficiency comparisons of entire economic systems and reviews market suppositions developed by  economists and ethicists. Douglas MacLean and Claudia Mills examine the intellectual hazards of confusing normative and empirical statements about behavior in &quot;Normative and Empirical Issues in Economic Theory: A Philosophical Examination.&quot; They consider prospect theory a possible solution to problems inherent in expected utility theory. All three papers provide comments on the model-making and testing processes of applied economics. &quot;Postscript: The New Spirit of Inquiry in Economics and Philosophy,&quot; by Michael McPherson, considers the effects of economists' and philosophers' collaborative efforts.

The 1985-86 PSLP was designed to expand the program and to develop materials necessary to expedite program institutionalization. A curriculum manual and a videotape for classroom use was developed in July, 1986. The report consists of four chapters. Chapter one contains program background and scope of the evaluation. Chapter two is a description of program implementation. Chapter three is an analysis of student outcomes for the attitude survey and criminal justice examination. Chapter four contains conclusions and recommendations. The findings indicate that the program met its  objectives of establishing partnerships with educational agencies; training teachers and police officers in course content, methods, and materials; and developing curriculum materials, but did not meet its objective of improving student attitudes toward the legal system. Recommendations include: (1) prioritizing course requirements; and (2) using a control group of non-program students to assess change in student attitudes. Appended is an item analysis of the PSLP Attitude Survey and Criminal Justice Examination. (SM)",

Brain hemispheric research has stimulated new ideas about teaching processes that nurture spatial thinking and bring a positive new force to the studio and classroom. An introduction places the topic in context both in terms of historical awareness of different modes of thinking and in terms of recent research and popularization. Chapter 1 presents an overview of recent brain hemisphere research and its relevance to artists and art educators. Chapter 2 lists and concisely reviews 36 books. Chapter 3 addresses 89 journal articles in the same manner. The books and articles are listed alphabetically by author and  include titles, publication, source, and other bibliographic information. Concluding comments assert that while the topic is relevant to creating and teaching art, the concept of two separate and distinct sides of the brain is inappropriate and oversimplified.

Eight factors with eigenvalues greater than one were rotated to a final solution that accounted for 67.9 percent of the total variance. HCT-Subtest 1 loaded primarily on a factor that was composed of measures of attention and/or impulse control. HCT-Subtest 2 was best identified with a factor that concerned visual-spatial analysis and memory. The remaining HCT subtests loaded on two factors independently of other HRNB variables. Equal loading, but with opposite signs, was found for NCT-Subtests 3 and 4 on a single factor. An additional factor consisted of HCT-Subtest 5 (negative loading) and  HCT-Subtests 6 and 7 (positive loadings). These data were interpreted as offering little support for considering the subtests of the HCT as a single measure. Examination of error scores on Subtest 5 showed that an initial difficulty in identifying the underlying concept in that subtest may have a beneficial learning effect on succeeding subtests.

        "description":"Two measures of the &quot;world hypotheses&quot; of Stephen Pepper were mailed to 100 sociobiologists, 87 behaviorists, 79 personality psychologists, and 45 human developmentalists. The World Hypothesis Scale (WHS) was designed to measure Pepper's four world views: (1) formism; (2) mechanism; (3) organicism; and (4) contextualism. The Organicism-Mechanism Paradigm Inventory (OMPI) was designed to cover philosophical and practical areas. The OMPI seemed superior in validity, utility, and efficiency. Significant scale intercorrelations on the WHS indicate that it is redundant. The OMPI measures mechanism and formism at the low end and organicism and contextualism at the high end. These results suggest that social scientists' basic assumptions about human nature (whether people are active or  reactive, stable or changing, purposive or without design, etc.) tend to reflect the personality traits the scientists themselves possess. A 24-item reference list and 3 data tables conclude the document. (SLD)",

Fifty-three female and 52 male university students completed the Basic Personality Inventory (BPI). BPI scales assess measure of neurotic tendencies and aspects of sociopathic behavior. Reaction times were collected through responses on a computer. Negative correlations were obtained between scale scores and mean latencies for endorsing relevant items. Positive correlations were found between scale scores and mean latencies for rejecting relevant items. Scale scores were relatively independent of the latencies for processing scale-irrelevant items. This  effect pattern substantiates the idea of item response in terms of self-schemata and supports the construct validity of dimension specific reaction times. (SLD)",

Project 4-Health is a 5-year tobacco prevention research project conducted by the University of California at Berkeley School of Public Health and the California 4-H program, under funding by the National Cancer Institute. The primary aim of the project is to develop and field test a smokeless tobacco prevention program to be delivered to youth in 4-H clubs throughout the state. In-group surveys of nearly 2,300 4-H members were conducted in the fall of 1986 to assess tobacco use by  the target population and social and psychological correlates of tobacco use. Administrators' reports, observations by researchers, and discussions with program participants indicated that: (1) youth experienced moderate problems in reading and comprehending instructions; (2) one-day training for survey administrators proved to be satisfactory; and (3) it was difficult to ensure privacy.

Critical challenges to the assumed contribution of teacher evaluation to learning originate from at least three areas of scholarly work: (1) revisionist/Marxist literature, which describes educational structures including teacher evaluation as mechanisms for reproducing the social and economic class distinctions of society; (2) literature on educational organizations and teaching, which examines relationships between the management and service sectors; and (3) literature on the educational and social factors that contribute to the development of creativity. While teacher evaluation may promote teacher behavior that is oriented toward organizational goals, there is  little evidence that it contributes to an improvement in learning.

Subjects were 8 dental faculty members who ranged in age from 28 to 60 and who had at least 2 years of teaching experience. The task was to evaluate five three-fourth dental crown preparations twice, using each of the three types of rating instructions. Intrarater and interrater agreement and reliability were assessed, as was the level of rater accuracy. Higher coefficients of rater reliability, but not agreement, resulted from the global and combined instructions, compared with the 19-point, or  traditional, instruction. The global judgment alone improved reliability over traditional instructions, but intrarater agreement was lower. Expert rater consistency was higher when early hypothesis generation and self-monitoring were encouraged by the rating instructions. There were no significant differences in score accuracy among the three types of instruction. (MGD)",

The matrix will use the &quot;abilities requirements approach&quot; as the unifying element among these three dimensions. The present effort compiles and cross-references information on computer-based performance assessment batteries and models/theories of human performance. Data from 10 batteries, 123 tasks, and 7 models have been included. For the performance batteries, this information includes availability/acquisition details as well as computer hardware and software characteristics. This document, then, enables researchers to quickly access such data as well as to  ascertain those areas in which a paucity of data exists. In general, it appears that current computerized performance batteries emphasize measurement of those characteristics which are most readily measured by computer, without regard for the applicability of such measurement to enhancement of real-world tasks. In particular, a dearth of laboratory tasks with which to assess certain cognitive abilities was noted. This deficiency is regarded as particularly critical in light of the increased reliance on such abilities for performance on modern military and civilian jobs. Difficulties encountered and recommendations for future efforts are presented. (Author/RR)",

Research seeks to (1) systematically identify team skills, tasks, behaviors and conditions that influence training instruction and design; and (2) development of measures of these variables to provide a base of knowledge for designing and using interventions to enhance team training programs. This model suggests a seven stage life-cycle of a team progressing at different sequences and rates depending on  the efficacy of their training. Resulting data from the four teams to which skill measurement was submitted tend to support the proposed model as well as indicating the sensitivity in the device to differences between good and poor teams and to change behavior during training.

The three scoring methods were found to be equivalent to the scoring method recommended in the Woodcock Manual in terms of internal consistency reliability. Problems were observed with student frustration resulting in discouragement and diminished motivation and excessive time spent in test administration. Strong positive correlations were found between raw  scores obtained by the four scoring methods and between each group of raw scores and an external measure. Analysis of variance revealed statistically significant differences between the raw score means. Bivariate regression equations were provided to allow raw scores obtained with each of the three scoring methods to be adjusted so they can be used to obtain percentile ranks and equivalent scores. Two alternative scoring methods reduced to a statistically significant degree the mean number of items administered with no loss in reliability or validity.

        "description":"For an evaluation design or &quot;political strategy&quot; to succeed in instituting a process of valuing and be appropriate for a particular setting, patterns of social relations and beliefs about the evaluation must be in agreement with those of the chosen evaluation design. This agreement must be in place either at the onset or occur during the evaluation process. Alignment of political power and definitions of credible knowledge is inherent in six evaluation approaches or designed which include: positivism, interpretivism, critical theory, aesthetics, collaborative research and action research. The sociology of knowledge approach is used to examine the social meaning of each of these designs. This analysis exposes much of the taken for granted assumptions in each of these. Specifying  types of evaluation designs that are appropriate is to define a specific potential role benefiting specific parties in the evaluation and in the educational system itself. Educators and evaluators should consider the need for, the design of and political outcomes likely in any evaluation situation and to eschew general policies about the necessity and form of evaluations. Designs should be examined from a larger perspective to understand the full social meaning of educational evaluation. (RR)",

In contrast to the image of fairly stable incomes during most life-cycle stages, findings show substantial income volatility at all points in the life span, placing substantial numbers of the population at risk of suffering significant losses and, in the extreme, of falling into poverty. These risks were exceedingly high for black children, quite high for elderly women and lowest for men in their prime earning years. An examination of the events associated with this income volatility showed that divorce and unemployment of the household head were most significant for children, while retirement and widowhood were most important for the elderly. In contrast  to the effects of divorce and widowhood, the adverse economic consequences of unemployment appeared to be short-lived in most cases. What emerges from the analysis is a picture of the economically vulnerable population distinguished not so much by age as by sex.

        "description":"Student mobility is a phenomena that negatively affects performance on tests. In New Jersey this is a problem because test scores on statewide proficiency tests are used as criteria for graduation and as one of the criteria for state certification of the school district. A study done in Perth Amboy was designed to collect data on student mobility and to set guidelines for the standardized collection of such data in the future. Data were gathered from a sample of 315 tenth graders on social, behavioral, familial and performance characteristics. Their attendance records and transfer rates were considered in conjunction with these characteristics. The following factors were found to have a significant effect on the students' performance on the proficiency tests: (1) number of years  in the district; (2) behavior; (3) home language; and (4) attendance. Recommendations were the following: (1) entering or re-entering students should be assessed for remediation needs; (2) an assessment or investigation should be done of the alignment of the curriculum with the tests; (3) the district should encourage bilingual families to speak some English at home.

A decent home and suitable living environment is a right guaranteed by the 1968 Fair Housing Act, but many Americans are in housing crisis. The subcommittee investigated ways for the Federal Government to fulfill the housing commitment. Much of the testimony was from residents and tenant representatives of two apartment complexes in Alexandria, Virginia. At both of these residences tenants were faced with displacement and possible homelessness as their units were renovated and the rents increased. There was not enough low and moderately priced housing in the area to house the displaced tenants. A lawsuit was  lodged on behalf of the tenants. One witness was a representative of the developer who pointed out that housing hardships such as these are a result of the lack of commitment by the Federal Government to provide low income housing. He outlined a resettlement plan which the developers would initiate. (VM)",

The hearings were held to gather information for new regulations regarding public monies for child support. The Senate is considering whether to reform the present welfare system or to replace it with a new one. Of special interest at the hearings was the provision of services to families and children in crisis. The issues involved with reforming or changing the system are the following: (1) the primary responsibility for child support rests with the parents--in single parent families the absent parent must contribute; (2) an able-bodied mother has the responsibility to work at least part time; and (3) if these mothers are to work, job  training, child care, and transition services must be provided. Twenty-one witnesses testified on these issues, especially on the impact they would have on public finances and on the target population. Testimony and prepared written statements are included from welfare recipients, social service organizations, and public officials. (VM)",

The finding is that there is insufficient evidence in favor of such a change in designation. To designate American Samoans as Native Americans may set a precedent for amending numerous other federal laws and for using socioeconomic disadvantage as a claim to Native American status. Fundamental differences which distinguish American Samoans from groups currently designated as Native Americans are the following: (1) American Samoans are not on land which became a state; and (2) U.S. sovereignty in American Samoa is different than the trust relationship with Native Americans. The governor of American Samoa disagreed with the  findings and conclusions. He argued that the trustee relationship is implied. The U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of the Interior agreed with the findings. Data are presented in figures and tables, and a glossary is included. (VM)",

        "description":"This report assesses the income sources, amounts and relative poverty status of welfare families in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, and determines the implications of these results for federal welfare policy. Annually, about $15 billion in AFDC payments are made to needy families with children for such basics as food, shelter, clothing, and utilities. The Federal government pays about 54 percent of these costs. AFDC families are also eligible for in-kind food, health care and housing benefits. Each state sets payment standards by family size and can elect program options. Each month about 3.7 million families receive AFDC. Ninety-three percent are headed by one parent, almost always the mother. Nationally, two- to four-member AFDC families had monthly  incomes, consisting mostly of welfare benefits, that averaged $819 at market value and $646 at recipients value. AFDC families' cash incomes rarely exceeded the poverty level. Nine of ten AFDC families participated in at least two other federal welfare programs. The following three factors affect individual AFDC family incomes: (1) state of residence; (2) subsidized housing; and (3) earnings. As AFDC payments become larger, benefits from the other programs become smaller. The report highlights the following matters having implications for welfare policy: (1) the extent of states' discretion in setting AFDC eligibility criteria and payment levels; (2) AFDC's interactions with other programs; (3) public housing inequalities due to limited availability; (4) validity of official poverty  thresholds; and (5) valuing in-kind benefits in determining incomes. Data are presented on 20 tables and figures. Appendices describe the valuation techniques employed, discuss the data quality, and enumerate sampling errors. (BJV)",

McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, passed in July 1987, authorized over $400 million for fiscal year 1987 in homeless assistance for several federal programs, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This report examines how funds appropriated to HUD and FEMA were used before the act, describes actions taken pursuant to the act, and identifies issues concerning the act's implementation that may warrant more detailed examination in the 1988 report. Although the McKinney Act called for funds to be disbursed by October 11, 1987, it is unlikely that any appreciable disbursements will be made before December. Planned expenditures of pre-McKinney Act funds indicate that nearly 50 percent of FEMA's  program funds were to be used for food. The cities and counties receiving direct allocations from HUD's Emergency Shelter Grants Program planned on spending approximately half their funds for shelter operations and maintenance. The following issues should be examined: (1) under what condition should HUD funds be used for capital improvements to facilities owned by religious organizations? (2) Will HUD and FEMA programs reach targeted populations? (3) Do fund distribution formulas adequately measure needs? (4) Should homeless programs allow other federal funds to be used as matching funds? Data are presented in six tables. An appendix lists major contributors to this report. (BJV)",

All major immigrant groups to California are included. Using the information collected, this report discusses economic and fiscal issues associated with immigration, character and tempo of assimilation processes, and impact on California of proposals for immigrant reform. The report begins with a review of current knowledge about population dynamics in populations subject to immigration and/or emigration. Then, in the context of fertility below replacement and consistent annual immigration, two questions are explored: (1) starting from any arbitrary point, what temporal path does a population follow on its way to  a long-run equilibrium stationary population; and (2) how long does it take for that stationary situation to materialize? Finally some of the policy implications surrounding the twin features of non-replacement fertility and immigration are considered, along with a possible solution to the demographic dilemma confronting industrial democracies today. Barriers to more rapid immigrant adjustment must be removed and additional facilitators to immigrant adaptation must be found to speed the process of incorporating immigrants and their children into the mainstream of society.

        "description":"The Ryedale Adult Literacy Paired Reading Project pairs tutors and adults with reading difficulties. In the Ryedale program, tutees choose reading material that is within the tutor's readability level. The tutor and tutee read aloud together at the tutee's pace until the tutee has made enough progress to read aloud alone. When tutees feel ready, they signal nonverbally to read alone. The ultimate goal of the reading session is to increase tutees' spans of correct reading and have them develop the capacity for self-correction. Praise plays a crucial role in the model and is provided at all stages, including the joint oral reading, the tutee's decision to attempt solo reading, and the solo reading itself. This training packet is intended to help volunteers learn to tutor within the  framework of the paired reading arrangement. The scope of the adult illiteracy problem, the history of the adult literacy movement from 1973 onward, and ways in which the problem can be addressed are discussed in an overview. The history and services offered through the Ryedale Adult Literacy Paired Reading Project are described, and selected project publicity materials are provided. The procedures for conducting a group training session for volunteer tutors and an instructional outline for the training session are included. A pamphlet referred to as a dictionary of praise has been provided to help tutors refer to and record their pupils' progress in a way that is both constructive and encouraging. A flowchart explaining the paired reading methodology is also included. The materials in  the pack are designed for interactive use with a related videocassette. (MN)",

The interdependence of gender, as well as fiscal year, on selected state-level indexes of client characteristics, service delivery, and program impact was examined using a study group approach. Data for the study were drawn from the R-300 data files that are submitted annually by each state agency to the Rehabilitation Services Administration. The study found important differences in characteristics, service patterns, and outcomes and impacts of  the vocational rehabilitation program as between men and women in the region. The results indicate a serious problem of inequity in the impacts of the vocational rehabilitation program on men and women with disabilities. The research clearly demonstrated that women with disabilities did not acquire financial resources and occupational success at the conclusion of rehabilitation comparable to those achieved by men. The research raised issues regarding outcomes, inputs, processes, and systemic changes, and recommendations were made to address the problems found in these areas. (KC)",

Using 19 standards originally developed by the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation, the General Accounting Office (GAO) analyzed the services' needs assessment processes. At 10 Army, Air Force, and Navy installations in Europe visited by the GAO, the military services identified the programs or courses servicemembers desired to take largely through informal day-to-day contacts among students, educational program officers, and instructors. This information was supplemented through surveys of servicemembers. The study found that educational services in Europe could be  delivered feasibly under the multiple supplier system or under the single provider system that the Air Force has adopted. The decision as to which of the two systems to use revolved largely around questions of competition in the selection of schools and advantages or disadvantages of having more than one institution offer the same courses.

The funds provided under the Criminal Justice Initiative (CJI) were intended to expand the academic and vocational training programs for residents of the District of Columbia's institutions to provide them basic life skills and a trade that they could use upon release to avoid a future life of crime. Programs developed under CJI were to serve as a model for the nation's correctional community. Thirty-eight months after architect/engineering firms were selected to design the facilities, DPW had spent about $6.2 million and had not completed the first facility. Reasons for the construction delays included less time than  normal for planning, the disruptive effects of the reorganization that led to establishment of DPW, a lengthy procurement process, inadequate oversight of construction activities, and poor management practices. DPW initiated action intended to minimize such delays on future projects and to improve overall departmental operations.

Computer-based teacher education was provided through distance delivery independent study with tutoring. The course was designed using the performance-based instructional design procedures being taught. Data were collected from 17 of the 21 people who started the course. Forty-seven percent indicated that their attitudes toward computer-assisted instruction (CAI) changed for the better; 76 percent had very good or good opinions about CAI; 82 percent said that the CAI format of the course would help them as instructors; and 93 percent of those who responded to the question about expectations about the course indicated  that expectations were met. Some unique planning and delivery problems were posed for teacher educators by delivery of teacher education courses through distance delivery CAI; these problems concerned course structure, course orientation, teaching time, and learner time. Advantages to the delivery method were self-pacing, taking of courses at remote locations, savings for teacher education institutions, savings of time and money for students, and higher probability of mastery of course content and higher quality of products. Primary disadvantages were lack of immediate feedback, time to operate a computer, and no textbook for reference. (YLB)",

The techniques that have worked well to teach psychomotor behaviors can and should be modified to embrace the teaching of occupationally related cognitive and affective behaviors. Solid competency-based procedures can be adapted to teach affective behaviors. First, job-related affective behaviors that are required for a person to succeed in the occupation can be identified through a job analysis. Second, the specific content that an instructor must teach for a learner to acquire those behaviors must  be identified through behavior detailing. Third, how the behavior will be taught must be planned. The Performance-Based Instructional Design System contains a lesson structuring (planning) system that is equally applicable to the psychomotor and affective behaviors.

During the 1980s, PHE critically analyzed the format for the delivery of the specialization seminars for the three programs. PHE decided that the new system should include a learning contract, required units, elective units, participation in the Summer Institute, and a synthesis paper. The first two specialization seminars to be modified were in the vocational, technical, and occupational education program; they are: Personnel-Human Resources Development and The Emergence of Vocational, Technical, and Occupational Education in America. Doctoral  students in the Vocational, Technical, and Occupational Education program are, for the most part, pragmatic managers and pragmatic humanists. The exercise to create alternative scenarios of the future was a rewarding experience for the participants and a necessity if the program is to produce transformational leaders, agents of change. The synthesis papers have become qualitatively better over the years. Each student completing the two specialization seminars demonstrated marked improvement during the second seminar, regardless of the sequence in which they took the courses.

        "description":"A study examined development programs, uncovered during a literature review, that would assist in the supervisory training of Wage Grade employees who are promoted to working supervisors. The examination determined guidelines that could be used to construct a supervisory internship program within the Phoenix Air Guard. Hall's experience-based career development model (1986) was found to contain guidelines for establishing a career development program that could be used as the framework for the construction of an internship program. Other conclusions were that the internship program must have an orientation phase, the Phoenix Air Guard's management must go through the steps in work force planning to make the program effective, all candidates should be volunteers, and the program  should incorporate aspects of all three career development programs. Recommendations included management's identification of (1) key organizational positions or families of positions to serve as career targets, (2) desired job behaviors for key positions, and (3) specific supervisory positions to be incorporated into the internship program.

The report has two parts. The first part discusses trends in vocational education and issues concerning vocational education for disadvantaged persons. The second part contains profiles of the studies being conducted in each area of the study plan. Chapter 1 presents a brief statistical portrait of enrollment in vocational education at the secondary level as of 1982 and some preliminary evidence on change since then in enrollments. Preliminary findings show that nearly all students take some vocational education, but overall enrollment in  vocational education courses appears to be declining. Chapter 2 (1) discusses the problems various disadvantaged populations have with vocational education services at the secondary and postsecondary levels; (2) describes the Perkins Act provisions to serve disadvantaged persons; and (3) identifies, on the basis of some preliminary field studies, how states and localities are responding to these provisions. Chapters 3 through 7 are profiles of the projects to be conducted in five broad research areas identified in the study plan. A synopsis of the Perkins Act is appended. No findings or recommendations are included in this interim report. (KC)",

The report provides information on farms and land in farms; farm acreage purchased, sold, and rented; farm labor and wages; capital investments and improvement; farm production expenses; farm and nonfarm income sources; and farm business assets and liabilities. The information was generated by the 1985 Farm Costs and Returns Survey conducted in February and March 1986 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service. The probability-based survey provides comprehensive farm operation information for analysis of farm operating and financial characteristics by size, type, location, occupational specialty,  organization, and operator age. Some of the highlights of the findings are the following: the average U.S. farm at the end of 1985 operated 709 acres and for the year had total production expenses of about $74,000, assets of $325,000, capital investments of $10,000, gross cash farm income of $82,000, and debts equal to 22.5 percent of total assets.

The number of self-employed women--the majority of whom are sole proprietors--continued to grow. In 1982 the median earnings of self-employed women were substantially lower than those of wage and salary women workers and self-employed men. Most women business owners were married with husband present. Three factors were particularly significant in the rapid rise in the number of women-owned businesses: increasing numbers of women who have acquired skills that can be translated into entrepreneurship; more women who are preparing themselves through education and training for business opportunities in expanding fields; and entrepreneurial opportunities provided by the expanding  role of small business in the economic growth of the country. Women increased their share of business ownership in each major industry division. Franchising and international trade seemed to offer future opportunities for women entrepreneurs. Home-based work also provided the opportunity for women to combine more effectively the dual responsibilities of work in the paid labor force with family and child care. (YLB)",

They are also attractive to students, older workers, handicapped persons, couples desiring to share work and home responsibilities, persons wishing to upgrade skills or switch careers through a return to school, and employers needing to serve the public outside the traditional workday, wanting to use their capital more intensively, or hoping to benefit by reducing absenteeism. Flexitime is an alternative work-time pattern that allows employees to vary their arrival and/or departure times. Experimental approaches allow employees to vary work schedules over the year. A compressed work schedule is one that enables a full-time employee to work the equivalent of a full week in less than five full days. Job sharing refers  to the accomplishment of one full-time job by two or more persons, each working part-time. The predominant alternative work schedule for women is part-time work. Temporary work allows flexibility in scheduling while at the same time providing a variety of both work and training experiences. (YLB)",

        "description":"Four key trends will shape the American labor force in the final years of the 20th century. The American economy should grow at a relatively healthy pace. Despite its international comeback, however, U.S. manufacturing constitutes a much smaller share of the economy in the year 2000 than it does today. The work force will grow slowly, becoming older, more female, and more disadvantaged. The new jobs in service industries will demand much higher skills. These trends raise a number of important policy issues. If the United States is to continue to prosper, policymakers must find ways to accomplish the following: stimulate balanced world growth; accelerate productivity increases in service industries; maintain the dynamism of an aging work force, reconcile the conflicting needs of  women, work, and families; integrate Black and Hispanic workers fully into the economy; and improve the educational preparation of all workers. Because of the uncertainty of long-range economic forecasts, three scenarios of the U.S. economy in the year 2000 have been devised. The first of these, the baseline or &quot;surprise-free&quot; scenario, calls for a modest improvement in the growth rate that the nation experienced between 1970 and 1985 but not a return to the boom times of the 1950s and 1960s. The &quot;world deflation&quot; scenario focuses on the possibility that a worldwide glut of labor and production capacity in food, minerals, and manufactured goods could lead to a sustained deflation and sluggish economic growth. The third scenario, the &quot;technology boom,&quot; postulates a powerful rebound in U.S.  economic growth to levels that are comparable with the first two decades after World War II. (MN)",

The first section summarizes each of the four reports that were completed by the project staff at Michigan State University: (l) a baseline survey of secondary agricultural instructors in Michigan; (2) status and trends of vocational-technical education in agriculture; (3) opinions of secondary school principals of schools that have dropped, added, or maintained secondary agriculture programs; and (4) employer opinions about graduates of secondary agricultural education programs. The summary statements presented are designed to emphasize  and highlight the findings of the various reports that have direct implications for formulating recommendations for policy and program changes in vocational and technical education in agriculture in Michigan. The second major section reports the findings and recommendations of the External Review Committee. Information about the review committee, its activities, and its recommendations are presented. The concluding section of the report includes the consultant's summary and recommendations and reaction to the recommendations by the review committee. (KC)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the role of staff development units with respect to &quot;corporate culture&quot; and in light of the experience of the Staff Development Division of the Saskatchewan Public Service. The term &quot;corporate culture&quot; has been defined as the values, symbols, and beliefs that people in a given organization hold jointly and that thus guide an organization. Corporate culture has a powerful influence throughout an organization, affecting everything from what decisions get made to who gets promoted. It is especially important for persons joining an organization to know whether the organization's culture and values are compatible with their own. Managers must likewise understand how their organization's corporate culture works if they want to accomplish the goals that they have  established. Staff development units can perform four roles with respect to corporate culture. Such units can (1) analyze an organization's values, (2) define them, (3) influence them, and (4) reflect them. Analyzing an organization's values might involve identifying the values people believe that a given organization has, or it may mean making an organizational diagnosis (i.e., determining where the organization is today, where it wants to go, and how it can get there). A staff development unit can establish mechanisms whereby people at all levels in the organization can define its values. Influencing an organization's values entails establishing heroes who personify the culture, developing communications systems to carry the culture's message, and developing performance management  systems to reward performance that is in keeping with corporate values. Like human resource departments, staff development units fulfill a supportive function. Yet, because staff development has a strong mandate to provide education (which is a form of socialization), it has an opportunity to socialize employees to the corporate culture and values of an organization.

        "description":"Educators must create learning opportunities to stimulate older adults and allow them to develop. These educators must also operationalize self-fulfillment in adult education. Research and theory indicate that cognition is an adaptive process and elders who practice learning activities will maintain their abilities. Further, research and theory of the psychological state of older adults suggest that reminiscence or \"life review\" is of serious consequence. Programmers should also be aware that interests based on gender may merge or reverse in later life and should consider how education might provide life satisfaction in old age. A longitudinal study of older adult learners has found that the act of partaking of education was often an empowering gesture. A followup study seven  years later indicated that most had stopped attending formal educational activities. Reasons fall into three general categories: health problems, life patterns, and unfulfilled expectations. Other findings are that informal educational activities still attracted elders, age is irrelevant, and the motivations that brought them into the educational system have not changed--most were related to lifelong personality constructs. Educators must keep in mind that research in gerontology is often cohort-bound; therefore, they must follow older adult participants into the next stage of their lives to see the effects of education.

Some individualized instruction techniques that have been implemented over the years with varying degrees of success are ability grouping, nongraded schools, special classes for exceptional children, tracking (academic versus vocational), remedial classes, and team teaching. Individualized instruction programs may be categorized on the basis of the amount of choice students are permitted to exercise in determining instructional objectives and methods and materials. It may be (1) individually diagnosed and prescribed, (2) self-directed, (3) personalized, or (4) presented in the form of independent study. The viability of individualized instruction as a technique for teaching typewriting was tested  over the course of two weeks in college-level beginning, intermediate, and advanced typewriting classes. The students set goals for speed achievement and for accuracy development for three- or five-minute straight-copy timed writings. If the students' goals had not been realized, they were encouraged to continue to work for another week or two until the goals were realize. If the goals were accomplished, the students set new goals. When the students were encouraged to set short-term individual goals, the long-range result was increased productivity. This was satisfying to the students and teachers alike. (MN)",

        "description":"Between July 1, 1986, and June 30, 1987, the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee (NOICC)/State Occupational Information Coordinating Committee (SOICC) network has made significant gains in meeting the information needs of planners and administrators of vocational education and employment and training programs as well as of individuals making career decisions. There are now microcomputer-based occupational information systems in place in 38 states and territories. A new microcomputer-based occupational projections system makes it possible for individuals owning an MS-DOS microcomputer to develop state and substate supply-demand occupational projections. Two other new software enhancements to the network make it possible to identify education and training  institutions and program offerings by geographic area and to retrieve data on industries that employ a certain share of workers in selected occupations. A census occupation/industry matrix file has also been developed for each state. In 29 states, occupational information is being used to plan programs at local community colleges, and 37 SOICCs report that their information is being used to plan programs for local Job Training Partnership Act service delivery areas. During the past year, SOICCs in 36 states provided training on the use and analysis of occupational information for program planning. Forty-six states now have computer-based career information delivery systems (CIDS). In the 1986 program year, these systems served 6-8 million people at approximately 15,000 sites nationwide,  with almost 67 percent of the systems' users being school students. Pilot programs involving the U.S. Naval Reserve and Department of Defense were also launched during the program year. (MN)",

        "author":["Bhola, H. S."],
        "description":"There have been few, if any, significant changes in educational policy regarding the provision of adult literacy education in India over the past two decades. The changes that have taken place in India's adult literacy programs have occurred in the realm of technology rather than ideology, thereby supporting a continuity in the existing distributions of economic, social, and political goods within the nation. India's present cultural and political climate have resulted in an educational policy that is functionalist in the sense of being geared to provide the labor force necessary to keep the system going and populist in the sense of being geared toward gaining the votes necessary to win elections. This in turn has translated into greater investments in higher education and  proportionally less in constitutionally mandated universalization of elementary education. The most important official confirmation of the need for expanding adult education services in India came in the form of the National Policy Resolution of 1968. The first important initiative in adult education--the National Adult Education Program (NAEP)--was not established until 1978. It defined education as literacy, functionality, and conscientization, and although its structures were eventually established, they did not always function effectively. When Indira Gandhi returned to power in 1980, the program was renamed (it was now simply called the AEP) and expanded from a 10-month to a 3-year program with emphasis on health, family planning, and functional progams. Unfortunately, the AEP was  not extremely successful either. The main thrust of the new National Program of Adult Education (established in 1986) is like its predecessors in that its main thrust is efficiency rather than equity and its general mode is technocratic.

        "description":"A telephone survey of 610 service delivery areas (SDAs) and a mail survey of a national sample of 983 postsecondary institutions were conducted to assess the status of local-level coordination between vocational education and Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs. Ninety-seven percent of the SDAs were engaged in some type of collaborative effort with public vocational education institutions in the year ending June 1987. Ninety-one percent of the SDA administrators described their relationship with public vocational-technical programs as satisfactory or better. Almost 90 percent of the postsecondary institutions included in the study have some relationship with the JTPA, with 68 percent providing direct services and an additional 19 percent providing facilities or  instructors for JTPA programs they do not conduct themselves. A history of good relationships and shared goals were the two main factors cited by JTPA administrators as facilitating good coordination between vocational education and JTPA. The degree of coordination achieved within SDAs was not systematically associated with any of the economic and demographic characteristics of the SDAs that were analyzed. The JTPA administrators urged vocational educators to keep the SDA information about vocational programs, do more joint planning, be more responsive to labor market needs and more flexible concerning program lengths and entry and exit times, coordinate better within vocational education itself, and accept performance-based contracts. Appendices provide 11 data tables on the SDAs and the  two survey forms. (MN)",

        "description":"A study compared private and public training programs in the Baltimore (Maryland) metropolitan area. Survey instruments were sent to 105 individuals who had been identified as either directing or coordinating a job training program in the Baltimore area. Seventy-six usable survey instruments were returned (a 72 percent response rate). There was considerable agreement among private and public training organizations as to the importance of the skills listed in the first part of the questionnaire. Generic or people-oriented skills were valued most highly by all respondents, with specific job skills receiving a much lower ranking. The private programs did tend to place more value on knowledge of the company's field, working at remote locations, and meeting the pressure of deadlines.  The public and private programs were all developed in much the same way (individuals were given projects to develop). Both types of organizations preferred on-the-job and competency-based approaches; however, private programs placed more emphasis on self-instructional materials than did their public counterparts. One area where considerable differences were found was that of communications applications of training materials. Private organizations were more likely to use materials for employee news and information, management communications (to employees), annual meetings, and sales functions, whereas public organizations were more likely to use materials for community relations. Thus, public organizations were more likely to use materials for training, whereas private organizations were  more likely to use materials for communications purposes. A greater percentage of private organizations had separate training budgets (69.2 versus 58.3 percent), whereas training budgets were more often subsumed under another line item among public organizations.

A study used data drawn from the High School and Beyond research (a multipurpose national longitudinal study of America's high school students) to examine 4,537 high school graduates (class of 1980) who did not attend a two- or four-year college within two years of their high school graduation. Fifty-eight percent of the class of 1980 attended college, leaving 42 percent that did not. Not surprisingly, students from the highest social levels and with the highest levels of academic achievement were most likely to attend college. On the other hand, many of those who did not choose to attend college could have chosen  to do so (this appeared especially true for qualified blacks, who often chose full-time employment over college). Of those 1980 graduates who did not attend college, 3,667 found full-time employment and 870 engaged in &quot;other&quot; activities. Four years after graduation, a full 30 percent of the 870 persons in the &quot;other&quot; category had found full-time employment.

All Ohio secondary schools that offered vocational agriculture programs in agricultural production or farm business management during 1985-1986 (a total of 260 schools) were included in the study. Data were obtained from survey instruments that were mailed to superintendents, principals, and vocational agriculture instructors and from Ohio Department of Education records. Eighty-one percent of the 252 questionnaires mailed out were returned. Vocational agriculture instructors were found to be very important in schools' decision as to whether to offer an adult agricultural education program. High school principals were also important. Closely  related to the influence of instructors and principals is the extent and nature of school policy about adult education as a function of the particular school. Schools offering young farmer programs usually claim that program as an adult agricultural education program for which reimbursement can be received from the Ohio Department of Education. Surprisingly, schools that offer agricultural education programs have fewer vocational agriculture instructors per school than do schools not offering such programs. Thus, consultation and advertisement efforts to establish an adult agricultural education program in a secondary school should focus on that school's administrators and instructors. (MN)",

        "description":"The study described in this report sought to determine why industrial plants become no longer economically viable and how to prevent this from happening prematurely. Conducted in Cleveland (Ohio) for the Cleveland Tomorrow Committee, the research was done by the McKinsey and Company staff, who interviewed chief executives, conducted case studies, and surveyed trade literature concerning these industries. The three critical factors they identified in Cleveland's decline were high union labor costs, increased foreign competition, and low capital investment. Chapter 1 of this study analyzes the causes for a plant's loss of economic viability and raises questions about plant closing decisions. Chapter 2 describes several plant closures in Northeast Ohio, caused by declining markets,  increased competition from more efficient producers, and obsolete facilities. Chapter 3 reviews four cases in which labor relations issues played a direct part in the threatened closure. In all four cases, work rule changes significantly reduced labor costs, and improved labor-management relations promise productivity improvement in the future. Chapter 4 introduces two cases in which no explicit threat to close was made, but in which, with job security at stake, changes were made that induced management to locate new facilities close to existing plants that were becoming obsolete. Chapter 5 summarizes the findings of the earlier chapters and suggests some public and private policy conclusions. (KC)",

        "description":"Beginning in October 1987, Pelavin Associates conducted an exploratory study of consumer rights and accountability in postsecondary vocational-technical (PVT) programs for the U.S. Department of Education. The study focused on how effectively the governance structure--accreditation and federal and state regulation--ensures that consumer rights are protected and that institutions are appropriately accountable to both consumers and taxpayers for the educational services being provided. The study relied primarily on interviews with federal officials; state and guarantee agency staff in California, Illinois, and Texas; and institutional administrators at nine public and proprietary institutions recommended by accreditation agencies and states as having exemplary practices. The  findings of the study indicate that the structure of PVT education permits problems to occur and thus consumers' rights are not being adequately protected. In particular, the study found serious structural problems in the governance, operation, and delivery of postsecondary vocational-technical education. Some of the significant problems found included the following: (1) questionable recruiting and admissions practices; (2) awarding financial aid to ineligible students; (3) low program completion rates; (4) failure of schools to provide refunds to students who drop out; (5) loan defaults by students; and (6) flaws in the accreditation process.

The results of the survey revealed that (1) low achieving students are being served primarily in trade/industry and occupational home economics; (2) there are no specific guidelines regarding assessment and counseling about programs that offer the most realistic opportunities for success and job placement; (3) vocational center directors typically have higher expectations about the training  and placement of low achievers than do counseling and placement staff; (4) the most useful aspects of the vocational curriculum for low achievers are the hands-on instructional approach, career exploration and more individualized attention, and the development of positive work habits and attitudes; and (5) available resources are not being used effectively to help low achievers. Recommendations were made on developing policy for early and systematic assessment and placement of low achievers in remediation and employability skills programs, developing alternative programs, providing incentives for employers, and expanding counselors' roles in assessing and counseling low achieving students.

Some of the results of the survey were as follows: (1) over 31 percent of the employers said they were not getting enough qualified applicants for entry-level positions, especially in the construction industry; (2) the need for preemployment training of workers varied by industry; (3) the four worker characteristics most preferred by employers included good work habits and attitudes, interpersonal skills, specific job skills, and prior work experience; (4) although employers did  not rate &quot;basic academic skills&quot; highly, there was serious concern about the lack of these skills in some applicants; and (5) nearly three-fourths of all respondents said they preferred to hire workers who had received vocational training over those who had not. Recommendations were made to study the potential role of vocational education for all students, to increase employability skills training, to involve employers in vocational programming and student recruitment, and to make assessment of employer satisfaction and student job placement components of vocational program evaluation.

        "description":"The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) was heralded as a major overhaul of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) program. Five years after passage of JTPA, the answer to the question of whether it has indeed managed to remedy CETA's shortcomings appears to be an unequivocal maybe. Although the JTPA has been praised by numerous business representatives and politically conservative public figures and government officials, a careful assessment of JTPA programs reveals that their performance falls far short of the claims made by administration officials and many program managers. Evidence suggests that JTPA's superiority over CETA may be illusory. For one thing, local administrators and training contractors select a more qualified clientele than CETA served. Moreover,  by offering briefer and less intensive courses, JTPA does too little to improve the saleable labor market skills of its enrollees. JTPA's emphasis on outcomes also creates strong temptations to &quot;doctor&quot; program outcome data. Because of federal and state negligence, JTPA's dislocated worker projects have spent only two-thirds of their appropriated funds. Dislocated worker programs run under JTPA have tended to exclude the least educated and older workers (the ones most in need of help). In contrast, the Job Corps program seems relatively unchanged since the JTPA's passage, and efforts are now underway to replicate the highly effective Job Corps model of combining remedial and vocational education. Training programs for migrant farm workers and Native Americans have been particularly  neglected under JTPA. Evidence suggests that, with reform, the program could improve considerably, even without altering its administrative structure. (This document contains extensive reference notes and an index.)

        "description":"This collection, which should be of particular interest to adult education teachers, trainers, and researchers, suggests new models for attaining learning management skills to facilitate on-the-job learning. In the introduction, Mark E. Cheren discusses the need for new models and terms and examines the concepts of learning management and situational learning. In her paper entitled \"Developing Learning Skills,\" Sylvia Downs recounts her work in learning skills development in England and covers supporting research, learning blockages, categories of learning, and applications in commercial organizations. Howard S. Barrow's paper, \"Learning Management in the Context of Small Group Problem-Based Learning,\" describes a problem-based learning method that was originally developed for  medical students and practicing physicians. The approach enables professionals to monitor their own learning needs during the problem-solving process, thereby enabling the learner to become less dependent on the teacher (who becomes a facilitator of learning). In a paper entitled \"Learning Management Skills Development as an Integral Part of Training and Development,\" Mark E. Cheren suggests several ways of developing learning management competence within the context of training and development activities such as orientation programs, courses and workshops, learning resource centers, and self-instructional materials. The organizational perspective on learning management in discussed by Robert Smith in a paper entitled \"Learning to Learn in the Workplace.\" An appendix containing a working  definition of self-directed learning and a list of 50 references are included.

One way of understanding local influences is to learn about such influences on educational programs for adults in other national settings. This monograph is intended to illustrate the uses to which conclusions about societal influences can be put when making local planning decisions. The utility of an international perspective on the following seven decision areas is explored: planning, participation, campaigns, staffing, clientele, pluralism, and higher education. The section on strategic planning analyzes societal influences on agency functioning and on the service area, including social  trends and client interests in six major regions of the world. Societal influences that deter participation in educational activities by hard-to-reach adults and that affect program priorities are examined. Selected societal characteristics associated with successful literacy programs are covered in the section on planning literacy campaigns. The section on providing professional development activities for adult education practitioners compares the contributions of providers, associations, and universities in various regions of the world. Examples of collaborative efforts that have been established in Europe, Canada, and Australia are provided. Each section includes implications for practitioners in the United States.

Chapter 3 reviews data relevant to the retraining initiatives begun under the Job Training Partnership Act. Chapter 4 deals with the skills and capacities that employers regard as essential now and in the future to allow their employees to maintain and increase productivity and thereby prevent  obsolescence. Chapter 5 investigates efforts of employers and institutions to remedy the situation, in terms of educational and training programs and learning opportunities made available to employees. The final chapter summarizes results and discusses critical issues that require attention.

In his monograph &quot;Trends in Career Education: Implications for the Future,&quot; Kenneth B. Hoyt examines past, present, and future trends in the field from the perspective of seven components of career education. These components are as follows: promoting and implementing partnerships between the private sector and public education system; equipping persons with general employability, adaptability, and promotability skills; helping persons in career awareness, exploration, and decision-making activities; reforming education by infusing a careers emphasis in classrooms; making work a meaningful part of a total  life-style; relating education and work so that better choices of both can be made; and reducing bias and stereotyping, thereby protecting freedom of career choice. Karen R. Shylo's monograph, &quot;Effective Leadership Strategies for a Successful Career Development Program: A Case Study,&quot; examines the way in which Ohio implemented its career development program in the 1980s by following a nine-step implementation strategy that was designed to maintain career education as a viable program. The program is examined in terms of the following implementation strategies: develop a rationale for the program, get support from the top, design the program as part of a larger human resource system, target the managers, bolster the basics, make sure the power to head the program is at hand, develop a  variety of delivery systems, support the program with organizational policy, and evaluate the program and promote its outcomes.

        "description":"The number of single-parent families has increased dramatically. These families are subject to extreme economic problems and thus are in special need of career development and vocational preparation. Displaced homemakers are at a disadvantage inasmuch as they must reenter the work force; moreover, they face the additional career development hurdles of an external locus of control and low self-esteem. Adolescent mothers generally face the problems of diminished educational and vocational achievement and limited or no access to child care. Although single-parent fathers generally have a healthier economic status than their female counterparts, they often find their sole child-rearing role conflicting with their work expectations and must often fill social roles for which they have  not been prepared. Effective career development programs for these special needs groups need a variety of components, including the following: emotional support, job-seeking skills, basic skills instruction, outreach and recruitment, child care, analysis of the role of gender in occupational choice, self-concept building, skills assessment, challenges of combining work and family roles, nontraditional job skills, and parenthood education. Examples of successful programs that have been tailored to single-parent audiences include high school dropout prevention programs for pregnant teens and teen parents, special programs catering to nontraditional adult students at established educational sites, support and referral networks linking a variety of community agencies and services, and  newsletters geared toward single parents.

        "description":"This monograph proposes and describes a systems-based field of study for the training and development (T&amp;D) profession: human performance technology. The first section describes what is meant by a field of study and professional practice and then provides a rationale for the proposal. Section 2 explores training and development in the context of the growth of a new professional specialization. Section 3 presents an overview and description of human performance technology and then proposes a formal goal and definition of the field. In section 4, implications are set forth that should have relevance in two areas related to T&amp;D: professional practice and academic programs. The final section presents 11 propositions that encapsulate the general characteristics of the field. These  propositions illustrate that the uniqueness of the T&amp;D profession lies in its role of helping people improve their performance using all aspects of the work environment and systems to make these improvements occur. Conclusions and a 74-item reference list are included. (SK)",

        "description":"This study analyzes the 1980s upturn in per capita consumption of dairy products in the United States. The study found that per capita consumption of total dairy products in the United States first trended downward then stagnated for the two decades prior to the early 1980s. Per capita consumption of items such as whole milk declined, whereas items such as lowfat milk and cheese tended to move upward. In the 1980s, per capita consumption of items such as lowfat milk and cheese increased at rates that more than offset decreases in other products, leading to an increase in the overall average consumption of dairy products. Despite a slowdown in the U.S. population growth rate, per capita consumption increased enough during the 1980s to generate the sharpest prolonged increase in  total consumption of all dairy products at the national level in decades. Rising consumer incomes and declining prices for dairy products relative to other foods caused most of the 2 percent average annual increase in per capita consumption and the 3 percent increase in total consumption posted from 1983 through 1986. Advertising, concern about health and nutrition, changes in demographics, and government donations also affected consumption. However, these influences were small for most dairy products compared with the effects of changes in relative prices and consumer incomes. (Author/KC)",

France is also a major grain exporter and thus competes with the United States in world markets. The United States is pursuing a policy of lower world prices to regain market share. Large grain surpluses in the European Community have resulted in increased budget expenditures to support grain farmers and pressures to lower prices. The study tried to determine the implications of lower prices on French grain production. The results suggest that the French grain area is price elastic. However, supply response also depends upon yield, which is not sensitive to changes in output prices in the short run. French products receive preferential  treatment within European Community markets, and their exports to nonmember countries are subsidized, enabling France to increase exports and market share. French competitiveness has also been enhanced by technological improvements, relatively high and stable prices, and structural change. (Author/KC)",

Using the High School and Beyond data base, specifically--sophomore cohort data--a study created 21 tables that show (1) relationships between the primary variables of race, gender, and socioeconomic status and level of participation in vocational education or the selection of a vocational education specialty; (2) whether the primary variables affect the amount and kind of post-high school vocational training and credentialling; and (3) whether there were similar relationships with labor market outcomes. Some of the findings of the study were that race/ethnicity did not appear to be a major factor in level of participation or in  selection into the vocational specialties; however, race/ethnicity was associated with the kinds of certificates and licenses earned after high school. Race/ethnicity was related to wages in an unexpected way--Hispanics held the highest hourly wage rates. Gender was a major factor in the level of participation in vocational education in the high school and in the selection of vocational specialty. Women worked fewer hours and received lower rates of pay than men. Students from lower socioeconomic levels were more likely to follow a vocational curriculum. The research was not considered complete but could be used as raw data for further study of the correlations. (Two tables are appended to this report.) (KC)",

The study developed assumptions about the future social context of postsecondary vocational education. A list of characteristics that can be manipulated to adapt the future curriculum was drawn up and organized in 10 categories (program needs assessment, program access, articulation among programs and institutions, program purpose, content identification, evaluation of student learning, program format, lesson structuring,  learning resources, and program evaluation). Finally, a scenario of the probable future was developed, based on similarities and differences in the perceptions of the curriculum among key decision-making groups who will influence curricular change.

        "description":"A study examined existing collaborative activities between private or public employers and adult basic education (ABE), general educational development (GED), and English as a second language (ESL) programs in Maryland's 24 local education agencies. Information was gathered directly from 16 ABE administrators (including 4 community college administrators and 1 prison education coordinator), 5 community-based organizations and literacy networks, and 9 employers. The information gathered indicated that collaborative partnerships can be beneficial to public and private sector organizations alike. One apparent major impediment to the expansion of current partnerships is that employers are often unaware of literacy education needs in their current work force and among individuals  likely to become future members of their work force. The fact that ABE programs often lack the staff and financial resources needed to disseminate information about the availability and benefits of adult literacy and specialized training courses imposes a further obstacle to the expansion of partnerships. These obstacles can be overcome by (1) establishing a broadly based advisory committee, (2) developing employer interest in literacy, (3) expanding initial contacts with employers, (4) encouraging employer involvement through internal and external activities, and (5) doing more in the way of assessing the results of collaboration. (Appendixes include summaries of major pieces of federal legislation supporting adult literacy programs, the survey instrument, the study contract, a brochure  on adult literacy programs in Maryland, and the names and addresses of employers and organizations involved in adult literacy education.)

        "description":"Home study has enjoyed a slow but steady growth in popularity and acceptance. The growth of independent home study may be attributed to both the realities of the present educational environment and the consistently positive results of the home study method. At least one researcher has suggested that the initially slow growth of home study may have been due to institutionalized inertia by traditional educators. In recent years, however, such factors as the reexamination of traditional educational methods, concerns over increasing costs, and recognition of the need for the education and training of persons living in areas that are remote from school and campus sites and for persons who have already entered the work force, have made home study more attractive as an educational  option. In the United States and abroad, increasing numbers of educators, government and military leaders, and business managers are coming to appreciate the flexibility, adaptability, effectiveness, and economy afforded by home study. It is estimated that more than 150 external degree programs are currently being offered by universities and state associations in the United States. Distance education programs have even been established at the doctoral level. Both Australia and New Zealand have been actively pursuing home study programs, and West Germany has established a central office for monitoring correspondence education throughout the country. In Asia, Africa, and the Americas, home study has been accepted by a broad array of countries, ranging from the most developed to nations that  are just now developing. (MN)",

A detailed outline of the curriculum goals of a geriatric clerkship is included. The next section contains curriculum units on the following topics: communication skills, evaluation of health status, management of common health problems in noninstitutional elderly persons, health promotion/disease prevention, family and elder counseling, and long-term care issues. Suggested criteria for establishing a clerkship are enumerated. The following implementation steps are discussed: obtaining administrative support; adapting the model clerkship to the individual clerkship structure of a given  program; implementing a preclerkship geriatric curriculum; generating faculty support for the clerkship plan; locating, selecting, and negotiating with appropriate training sites; selecting clinic preceptors and providing faculty development as necessary; selecting or developing written and audiovisual training materials and evaluation forms; developing a learning experience schedule; recruiting and scheduling individual students; following students and evaluating their progress; and evaluating the clerkship program. (Ten appendixes include an annotated bibliography on the role of PAs in geriatric medicine, an abstract of Medicare provisions for reimbursement of PAs, lists of geriatric care centers, bibliographies of materials of geriatrics, lists of facilities providing geriatric care,  and answers to the postassessment test.)

        "description":"Listening is an extremely important dimension of a counselor's vocational life. The counselor is constantly involved in the process of listening. Verbal and nonverbal messages sent by clients must be received, interpreted, and organized. Counselors need to be active in listening to clients and critical in their analysis of the messages being transmitted. Feedback is an important attribute of active listening, allowing the listener to monitor his/her communication with others and avoid misunderstandings. This paper presents an effective listening exercise and suggests ways that counselors can train themselves and assist prospective counselors with the use of listening as a skill. Recent research on the listening habits of clients and counselors is also presented. Discussions are  included on how misinterpretation affects relationships, early learning and its effects on listening, active listening, and gender differences in listening. The issue of proxemics, the personal cultural spatial needs of individuals, is addressed, and the differences in how individuals take in and send out information auditorily, visually, and kinesthetically are considered.

On the basis of frequency of occurrence among the general population, a distinction has been made between ordinary violence (frequent slapping, pushing) and severe violence (less frequent use of hitting with objects or use of lethal weapons). This study was conducted to examine how individuals evaluate ordinary and severe forms of physical aggression and how they evaluate female physical aggression and male physical aggression. Undergraduates (N=202) completed a demographic questionnaire and reported their experiences as aggressors and victims of physical aggression in past and current dating relationships using the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS), an inventory assessing the frequency of occurrence of various conflict  resolution methods. Subjects were also presented the CTS with the husband as actor and the wife as recipient of aggression and with the wife as actor and the husband as recipient, and were asked to rate the actor's behavior. Both male and female subjects rated the husband's or wife's use of severe physical aggression more negatively than use of ordinary aggression. Both males and females rated female physical aggression less negatively than male physical aggression. In addition, evaluations of physical aggression were related to the occurrence of physical aggression in the dating relationships of the subjects. (NB)",

All students who withdraw from AISD are initially considered dropouts. When a request for a transcript is received from another school or district, that student is reclassified as a transfer. Estimated dropout results were examined for the 1983-1984 and 1984-1985 school years. The results showed an estimated increase in the dropout rate of 1 percentage point between the 2 years, representing an increase of 10%. Black students showed a 5% decrease in dropout rate while Hispanics showed an 11% increase and Whites/Others showed a 15%  increase. The preliminary rates for both males and females increased. In proportion to the total, a higher percentage of Whites/Others than of Blacks or Hispanics dropped out during the summer months. Blacks and Hispanics were comparatively more likely to drop out during the school year. Junior high school dropout rates were estimated for the first time in 1984-1985. The results are preliminary and may overestimate the number of dropouts: according to these preliminary figures, the rate for males and females was the same and the percentage for Hispanics was more than double the percentage for Blacks.

It looks at longitudinal and annual dropout rates, dropout interviews, and current and future plans.

Further investigation revealed that enrollment was dramatically higher at ninth grade than at any other grade. Twenty-two percent of all ninth graders were found to be repeating their freshman year. It was found that over 800 students in the AISD dropped out of school during their freshman year. Those who stayed in school missed more classes than students in  any other grade. Compared to other grades, more ninth graders misbehaved and required disciplinary action. In addition to problems of low attendance and discipline, one-half of AISD ninth graders received at least one failing grade each 6 weeks. In every area investigated, ninth grade presented the greatest challenge to students, parents, and educators. These groups must work together to increase the success of all ninth graders. (NB)",

A study was conducted to compare the values and attitudes of students attending the University of Maryland, College Park in 1976 and in 1986. Freshmen entering the university in 1976 (N=1,470) and in 1986 (N=713) were administered the University New Student Census, an anonymous questionnaire designed to elicit general information on demographic and attitudinal items. The results showed that there were significant differences between the two groups in terms of personal values and attitudes, especially as related to the areas of career choice and life goals. More specifically, students in 1986 were more likely to choose  careers because of high earnings or prestige, and to see the purpose of the university as preparing for jobs than were students in 1976. Students in 1986 were also more likely to choose drug abuse and crime as major national problems, while students in 1976 cited the environment and the economy most often. (Author/NB)",

A help source questionnaire was administered to 118 incoming university freshmen in 1976 and to 462 incoming freshmen in 1986. Students were instructed to assume they had tried unsuccessfully to solve a problem alone and were about to seek help. The questionnaire listed 12 help givers and asked students to rank them, in order of preference, first for an educational/vocational problem and then for an emotional/social problem. Help giver choices were: faculty member, faculty advisor, parents, relatives, male counselor, female counselor, older friend, student  friend, nonstudent friend, psychiatrist, physician, and clergyman. Data were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance. The results revealed that help source preferences remained relatively stable over time. Compared to males in the 1986 sample, males in the 1976 sample ranked clergy higher for educational/vocational problems, physicians and clergy higher for emotional/social problems, and nonstudent friend lower. No significant changes in help sources were demonstrated for females between 1976 and 1986 samples.

The Profile of Mood States was used to measure mood in 96 female college students who were heavy drinkers. Subjects were randomly assigned to the cells of the balanced placebo design with equal numbers in each of the three menstrual phases (ovulation, premenstruation, menstruation). The four conditions within the design were: expect alcohol/receive placebo; expect placebo/receive placebo; expect alcohol/receive alcohol; and expect placebo/receive alcohol. Subjects were found to differ on age and on Shipley Institute of Living Scale intelligence quotient scores. Prior to any manipulation, subjects in the three menstrual phases reported no  mood differences, failing to support the notion of phase-related moods. Over the course of the experiment the only reliable mood changes that did occur were a reduction in tension-anxiety and, possibly, vigor. Alcohol, expectancies, or menstrual phase did not have reliable effects on mood over time. These findings support Social Learning Theory. (Author/NB)",

Four examples are used to illustrate these aspects. With regard to the fourth diliemma, data is presented on the relationship between social class and criminal justice system outcome for 25 battered women who killed their abusers. The  difficulty in transcending class issues and achieving a real understanding of the impact of battering by an intimate in the lives of women of different backgrounds is recognized and the need to separate social class issues from dangerousness concerns is stressed.

Findings from the National Crime Survey (NCS) for 1978 to 1982 are highlighted, some of which indicated that calling the police did seem to help prevent recurrences of domestic violence. Other studies conducted in Kansas City, Missouri and in Minneapolis, Minnesota are described which showed that the police could help to prevent domestic  violence and that arresting the offender was an effective deterrant, respectively. Also presented are findings from a study which used NCS data to examine whether domestic violence victims should call the police. Findings are discussed which suggest that calling the police seemed to reduce a domestic violence victim's chance of revictimization.

Psychological literature contains a great deal about freedom but it is almost always found under the rubric of freedom versus determinism. This study examined the concepts of freedom in subjects (N=450) who ranged in age from 7 to 21 years of age, divided evenly among ages and sexes. Subjects--students attending Catholic educational institutions in small and large cities--were asked to write their definitions of freedom. These responses generated 30 concepts of freedom, which were ranked to produce the concept-of-freedom scale. The coefficient of interjudge reliability for coding the responses along the scale was significantly high. The concept of freedom was found to  vary significantly with age. Children, middle teenagers, and late teenagers differed significantly on categorical concepts of freedom (ability to choose, ability to do, activity, liberation). Many significant differences on categorical concepts of freedom were found both within particular age groups and between age groups (ABL)",

The 99-item questionnaire devised for the study on retirees was administered to the young and middle aged subjects.

No significant difference was found between males and females on any of the 11 attitudes.

It considers personal suffering, which mean's one's own suffering, and not the suffering of other people. It notes that a particular interpretation of suffering may be formulated in any number of perceptual statements and that a perception of suffering, an affective reaction to that interpretation, and the action tendency resulting from the perceptual and affective responses to suffering constitute the attitude toward suffering. Attitudinal components gathered from listening to reports of patients about their suffering, reading therapists' reports, and analyzing the literature on suffering are discussed and categorized into 11  attitudes toward personal suffering: (1) punitive; (2) testing; (3) bad luck; (4) submission to the laws of nature; (5) resignation to the will of God; (6) acceptance of the human condition; (7) personal growth; (8) defensive; (9) minimizing; (10) divine perspective; and (11) redemptive.

Despite the considerable research interest in social influence theory as it relates to counseling, there has been little attention to the demonstration of the presence or absence of such behavioral skills as expertness, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. In connection with another study, a set of videotapes were developed to demonstrate these three behaviors in a clear, relatively undisputable manner. A client role-play was developed to be maximally relevant to the undergraduate student participants. Four unrehearsed, 7-minute counseling sessions were carried out with the same male counselor, who varied his counseling responses from one videotape to  another. During one of the interviews, a non-deficient demonstration, the counselor displayed high levels of all three targeted social influence variables (expert, attractive, and trustworthy). In each of the remaining videotapes, one counselor characteristic was intentionally lowered. The counselor continued to make empathic responses directed to the client's concerns. The videotapes were validated using a group of 13 doctoral students' ratings of each counselor on expertness, attractiveness, and trustworthiness. Students were fascinated to see a counselor behave in ways that illustrated the social influence behaviors. The same videotapes can serve as excellent discussion starters in beginning counseling classes. (ABL)",

Most were found to have undergraduate degrees; only in Venezuela did the proportion of school psychologists with graduate degrees exceed that of psychologists with undergraduate degrees. Important differences existed in the number of professional  programs available in the countries. High percentages of school psychologists were members of national associations. Respondents from all four countries rated as very important knowledge and skill areas that focused on the academic areas of psychology emphasizing individual differences, intelligence, motivation, professional service, work with the visually and physically impaired, learning disabilities, and parent education.

The prevalence of common conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular accident, heart attack, or intermittent claudication was no greater for POWs than for the general population. However, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, and depressive disorders had a high prevalence. The etiologies of these disorders are generally agreed to include traumatic experience. Disorders with etiologies thought to be less related to  traumatic experience such as alcohol abuse/dependency, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorders did not occur with increased frequency. Those POWs who had experienced more than a 29 percent loss of body weight were at higher risk of developing depressive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, and, to a lesser extent, anxiety disorders. Results highlight the strong association between captivity trauma and later psychiatric disability. The psychological problems experienced by former POWs are real, persistent, and in the large majority of cases, directly attributable to the trauma they experienced in captivity.

It sought to clarify the nature of the coordination problems that arose and the reasons for those problems in order to make recommendations about how to alleviate them in the future. Interagency conflict and service blockages were found to be independent problems for coordination. For teenage pregnancy, institutional survival concerns were the primary contributor to interagency conflict. The main cause of interagency conflict in  student assistance was treatment philosophy and the main blockage to coordination was service capacity. For early intervention coordination, the main blockage was again service capacity. Conclusions and recommendations included: (1) coordination can increase the cost of services by increasing the demand; (2) coordination is facilitated by complementary interests; (3) arrangements that minimize competition between agencies should be established; (4) regulations contribute to coordination problems; (5) coordination is facilitated when programs have a clear purpose compatible with the philosophies of other involved parties; (6) local coordination councils can facilitate coordination; (7) planning and adjustment to facilitate coorddination must continue after new projects have started; and  (8) increased resources are often needed to reduce service blockages.

It discusses biological mechanisms related to Alzheimer's disease, including glucose metabolism and the molecular pathology of changes in the proteins of nerve cells of the cerebral cortex which are associated with the disease. Research conducted in the last decade about the cause of Alzheimer's is reviewed, including trace metal, slow virus, immunological, and genetic studies. Psychosocial research is discussed, noting that to date behavioral  science research has focused on diagnostic tests to differentiate between Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia, on changes in language use in relation to brain function and dysfunction, and on special supports needed by families of victims. A review of clinical research discusses sleep studies and treatment approaches. Intramural initiatives by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute for Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke are described. The report concludes that advances have been made in the past decade and that, at some future date, Alzheimer's disease may be prevented or cured. (ABL)",

The demography of the disease is discussed, noting that approximately 2.5 million American adults are afflicted with the disease and that the large increase in the number of Alzheimer's disease patients is due to the growth in numbers of older people, a better approach to diagnosis, better training of health care professionals regarding the problems of old age, and the public's awareness of Alzheimer's disease. A cost estimate of $35 billion for the care of Alzheimer's disease patients is given. Research advances in diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease are reviewed, including advances using magnetic resonance imaging, and a test for a protein in the  blood of victims. Biological mechanisms of the disease including differences in healthy and diseased brains and changes in brain chemistry are discussed. Theories about the cause of Alzheimer's disease are reviewed, including an examination of the role of aluminum, infectious agents, and genes as well as risk factors for the disease. Assessment and treatment approaches are summarized. The report concludes with future research directions. (ABL)",

Medicare administrators of the Health Care Financing Administration interpret the Act as applying to government-sponsored plans; administrators of federal, state, and local government-sponsored plans do not. This report discusses the background of the disagreement and delays beneficiaries could experience getting their bills paid. The report concludes that the Social Security Act should be amended to resolve differences in interpretation by stating that Medicare is the second payer to government plans under section 1862(b)(4) of the Act  to the same extent that the section applies to other health plans. Quick action is recommended to avoid delays in paying disabled beneficiary claims. (ABL)",

        "description":"States are required by the Medicaid law to identify and investigate cases of suspected Medicaid abuse by reviewing recipients' and providers' use of Medicaid services. The General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted an assessment of programs to control recipient abuse in six states and to control provider abuse in four states to determine whether states were effectively identifying Medicaid abuse and to assess the extent of states' actions to apply sanctions against Medicaid abusers. The results revealed that some states were not effectively using their computerized management information systems to identify potential Medicaid abuse, some were reviewing only a small portion of the potentially abusive recipients identified, and most states had applied sanctions against few abusive  Medicaid recipients. This document discusses actions needed to assure that state Medicaid agencies operate effective postpayment utilization review programs to identify and prevent abuse of Medicaid services. It includes a series of recommendations designed to: (1) assess the extent of provider and recipient abuse in each state; (2) establish minimum review requirements based on the results of the assessment; and (3) improve the states' use of their management information systems to identify potential abuse. Eight appendices describe methodology used to identify recipient abusers in California and provide comments from the Department of Health and Human Services and six of the states investigated. (NB)",

        "description":"Although college counseling agencies serve many clients, published accounts of counseling outcomes in these agencies are relatively rare. An important aspect of counseling evaluation is the client's resolution of presenting and subsequent problems. This study investigated the impact of counseling on university students using a measure of symptom relief, obtained by comparing the client's own rated severity of presenting problem at intake with a posttreatment rating, and a measure of client satisfaction. The sample consisted of 102 female and 53 male clients and a control group of 47 females and 8 males. Chi-square analysis revealed a higher return for controls (84%) than for clients (54%) (p&lt;.01). T-tests performed on the target-complaint data showed that female clients reported  more improvement on their presenting problem than did male clients (p&lt;.01) and that female clients reported more improvement than did female controls (p&lt;.05). Inconsistency of individual client responses on the two outcome measures is interpreted in terms of the support function provided by the counselor. The importance of using both measures in future research is stressed. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Early research demonstrating an association between success and the male stereotype and between failure and the female stereotype, and the Bayesian analysis of attribution theory provided the bases for predictions about the effects of gender and performance outcomes on probability estimates of future success. The relation between gender stereotypes and attributions for skill-based performance were examined from the framework of the psychology of prediction. College students (N=235) observed a videotaped male or female target either succeed or fail at a task. Following this observation, a male or female coactor either succeeded or failed at the same task. After viewing the tapes, subjects made probability estimates of the targets' future success at similar tasks. Probability  estimates of the target's future success revealed that males benefited more from success than did females, and that females were hurt more by failure, whether their own or another's, than were males. Given identical successful performances, probability estimates of future success were greater for males than for females. Support for predictions derived from attribution theory suggest that the effects of consensus information on attributions depend on the congruence of outcomes with gender stereotypic expectations.

Recently there has been extensive research on mental operations and the ways in which a person can use certain cognitive strategies to enhance learning and performing of skilled movements. This paper: (1) examines the efficacy of using cognitive strategies as a method to enhance motor skill learning; (2) analyzes some of the differences between older and younger learners in their ability to learn and perform movement  skills to better understand how aging affects motor skill acquisition and performance processes; and (3) suggests ways in which the elderly can learn and perform skills more effectively through the use of cognitive strategies.

Twenty-five participants took part in group seminars designed to address the process of supervision and the theoretical, personal, and stylistic differences among supervisors. This paper describes the context of group discussions and looks at group processes and evolution since the seminar began in the 1982-1983 academic year. Several salient issues discussed in the groups are examined, including: (1) whether the primary focus of supervision is on the student-therapist or the client; (2) the developmental phase of the supervisee; (3) attention to the therapist's personality; (4) therapists who have not been in psychotherapy; (5)  competing models of treatment; (6) evaluation of the supervisee; and (7) multidimensional influences among patient, therapist, and supervisor. Illustrative case material is considered. Suggestions for those considering working on supervision of supervision are included in the areas of the learning function, the supportive function, the exploration of countertransference, attention to the supervisory process for implications concerning therapy, and the evaluation role.

Students' responses were compared with their use of counseling center services over the next eight semesters.  The results revealed three noncognitive variables which significantly (p &lt; .05) predicted counseling center use: understanding and ability to deal with racism; nontraditional ways of acquiring knowledge; and preference for long-term goals over short-term, immediate needs.

Results of preliminary research support the hypothesis that sex-role orientation is a better predictor of leadership behavior than is biological sex. This study was conducted to replicate the results of previous research using actual managers as subjects, to extend the proposed conceptual model by incorporating other variables relevant to managerial leadership which also pertain to the dimensions of instrumentality and expressiveness, and to examine the relationship between sex-role orientation and self-perceptions of managerial effectiveness. Male (N=121) and female (N=126) middle to upper  level managers completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory; the Job Description Index; a job stress scale; and adaptations of the Ohio State Leadership Behavior Description Questionnaire, the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Resolution Scale, and the Profile of Organizational Influence Strategies. Subjects rated their leadership effectiveness, how good a manager they were, and how well their subordinates performed. The results strongly support the contention that biological sex is not an important factor in determining managerial style. They provide empirical evidence for a conceptual synthesis of androgyny, leadership, and conflict resolution theories. (NB)",

The study was conducted in Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Kansas, and Wisconsin. The GAO identified nursing home requirements that most directly affected resident care, health, or safety; analyzed nursing homes' compliance with those requirements during the four most recent inspections; developed detailed case studies on 26 judgmentally selected nursing homes to evaluate the adequacy of enforcement actions;  reviewed federal and state laws relating to nursing home care; evaluated potential alternative sanctions; and interviewed federal, state, and private sector officials. The results revealed that repeated noncompliance was widespread, that nursing homes with serious deficiencies avoided penalties, and that alternative penalties were needed. Based on these findings, the GAO recommended passage of federal legislation to establish a wide range of alternative sanctions for noncompliance with nursing home requirements. (NB)",

Both Anger Coping conditions used cognitive-behavioral and social problem-solving training, and one of the conditions included an adjunctive teacher consultation component designed to enhance teachers' facilitation of their students' problem solving skills. Eleven boys received Anger Coping, 13 received Anger Coping plus teacher consultation, and 8 boys  served as untreated controls. The students had an average age of about 11 years. In comparison to the untreated aggressive boys, treated aggressive boys displayed significant improvements in their disruptive-aggressive off-task classroom behavior and in their perceived social competence, and they tended to have reductions in their teachers' ratings of their aggressiveness. The teacher consultation component did not augment treatment effects, and treatment effects were actually slightly stronger in the condition that used only Anger Coping groups with the boys.

This study assessed salience effects on the abilities of aggressive and nonaggressive boys from the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades to generate alternative solutions to social problems. Twenty-one aggressive and 15 nonaggressive boys were randomly assigned to two conditions, the Open-Middle or the Multiple-Choice condition. The dependent measure was the Problem Solving Measure for Conflict (Lochman &amp; Lampron, 1986), which consisted of six means-ends stories. In the Open-Middle condition, subjects responded to the means-ends  stories in the usual spontaneous manner, and produced patterns of solutions similar to prior results with aggressive and nonaggressive boys. When the Multiple-Choice condition was compared to the Open-Middle condition, aggressive subjects produced a significantly different pattern of response choices, with more verbal assertion and help-seeking solutions and fewer direct action choices. However, while the aggressive and nonaggressive boys no longer differed in rates of direct action solutions in the multiple-choice condition, the two groups still had a significantly different pattern of verbal assertion and help-seeking solutions. Aggressive and nonaggressive boys' response choice patterns appear to be highly affected by the social cognitive process of salience. (Author/ABL)",

The following changes in emphasis are predicted about what should be included in vocational assessment and in the methods used to accomplish assessment: (1) process variables and assessment methods will become more crucial; (2) assessment tools placing a greater emphasis on articulating one's personal constructs will be used; and (3) counselors will move away from interest assessments to more detailed and ideographic  examinations of skills used in performing specific functions and values which delineate the work environment.

        "description":"Pregnancies, abortions, and births to unmarried women occur frequently in the United States; these are of particular concern when they occur to teenagers. This study examined the effects of age on the decision to have an abortion for teenagers (N=256) at a clinic serving a predominantly white clientele from several mid-size cities and the surrounding rural areas. For the purposes of this study the 256 teenagers were divided into two groups: the young young who were age 16 or younger (N=66) and the old young who were age 17 to 19 (N=190). Results confirmed six hypotheses which assert that the younger the teenager: (1) the more likely it will be that age is the dominant reason for terminating the pregnancy; (2) the more likely it is to be her first pregnancy and therefore her first  abortion; (3) the less likely she is to be married and living with a husband or male partner and the more likely to be living with her parents; (4) the more likely she is to be a student but with fewer years of schooling and less likely to be employed or economically self-sufficient; (5) the more likely she is to involve others in the decision to terminate the pregnancy and the more likely the partner and/or parent would agree with the decision, support it, and accompany her to the clinic; and (6) the less likely she is to ever have used any method of birth control.

        "description":"Although previous research has established a relationship between gender role orientation and self-esteem, and gender role orientation and social conformity, few studies have established a clear relationship among all three constructs, especially for different age groups. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between adolescent gender role orientation, self-esteem, and locus of control utilizing two different age groups of adolescents. The sample was composed of junior high school and senior high school students from a rural midwestern state. Participants included 7th and 8th grade female students (N=87) and 11th and 12th grade female students (N=48). For each test group participants were categorized into a younger adolescent group (7th and 8th graders) and  an older adolescent group (11th and 12th graders). Subjects completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory, the Texas Social Behavior Inventory, and the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for Children. Results indicated that adolescent females classified as androgynous or masculine in gender-role orientation had higher self-esteem than adolescents classified as feminine or undifferentiated. Further, junior high adolescents had more of an external locus of control whereas senior high adolescents had more of an internal locus of control. No other significant differences were found.

        "description":"A study examined the cognitive development of at-risk students (those who have experienced difficulty or failure in their careers as learners), focusing on such groups as potential drop-outs, minority children, and disabled students (dsylexic or non-English speaking), as well as teaching thinking to this same student population. Although research results on programmatic effects for at-risk students are somewhat controversial and frequently mixed, some guidelines for successful instruction are formulated, emphasizing interactive discussion during instruction. Teaching thinking involves not only learning cognitive skills such as analysis, classification, and evaluation, but also becoming conscious of the strategies that are appropriate to a particular task. The movement to teach  thinking also focuses on the role of the teacher as a mediator of learning. Finally, the development of instructional materials and programs to teach thinking is being encouraged. Implications for the future include the need for teachers concerned with cognitive development, the need for long-term change as opposed to quick fix activities, the need for a better integrated curriculum, and the need to examine current policies and practices.

It involved 11 students in grades 2 through 5 who were low achievers in reading and/or math. It was designed to improve reading comprehension by providing training using six specific strategies and techniques: (1) reducing student anxiety, (2) finding causal relationships, (3) cuing students with specific directions, (4) rereading material, (5) summarizing material, and (6) using advance organizers. Specific goals were to improve students' knowledge of reading strategies, their attitudes toward reading, their self-perceived ability in reading, and their grades in reading comprehension. To determine the success of the  program, evaluative instruments were administered at the beginning and end of the study measuring knowledge of strategies, use of strategies, comprehension, attitude and self-perception. Analysis of the data revealed that students improved their reading comprehension and their attitude toward reading. Gains were made by students for each objective that was measured. Appendixes provide a teacher interview questionnaire, student attitude questionnaire, strategies test, sample test passage, and students' perception survey. (NH)",

        "description":"A study tested the effects of hedges (which signal writers' tentative assessment of referential information) on readers' learning. Subjects, 145 ninth-grade students from three middle class junior high schools in a midwestern city who were ranked on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, participated in the experiment--74 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and 71 to a control group. The text materials consisted of two passages of approximately l,000 words written at a ninth-grade readability level taken from two textbooks, one from science and one from history. The hedges appeared in either personal or impersonal voice; in either the first half, second half or both halves of the passages; and in either a low intensity condition or a high intensity condition. A measure of  what subjects learned from reading the passages showed that they learned most when the hedges appeared in personal voice, in the second half of a passage, and in low intensity. Findings suggest that the implications of this work can be extended to practices in composition classes--particularly practices of evaluating whether or not material should be hedged--in order to broaden students' critical-thinking abilities and their views of language.

        "description":"To study the relationship between inferences made on standardized reading tests and item difficulty, 50 items on the reading comprehension section of the Metropolitan Achievement Test were analyzed independently in this study by two raters using four general categories of inferences: (1) reference inferences, (2) between proposition inferences, (3) source inferences and (4) metalinguistic inferences. The items were in standard reading comprehension test format (reading passages followed by multiple choice items based on the passage). An inference was operationally defined as the mental process of inducing or deducing, as cued by the test item, information not explicitly stated in the test. No significant relationship was found between inference types and item difficulty; however,  a significant relationship was found between a general measure of raw amount of information processed and item difficulty. Although most reading skill hierarchies assume that inferential cognitive operations are inherently more difficult than non-inferential operations, these findings suggest that either inferential cognitive operations are not inherently more difficult than non-inferential cognitive operations, or that the inferential cognitive operations have been internalized at the level of automaticity for school-aged test takers.

A structured interview with each child's mother and classroom behavior observation also took place. Results indicated that reading disabilities and the prevalence rates of reading failure among children reading the Chinese writing system (logographic) were by no means lower than those among the children in the alphabetic writing systems. Results also showed that general information was the most powerful predictor of the child's reading achievement. Thirty-one family variables and reading achievement turned out to be  positively intercorrelated in Chinese culture. It was noteworthy that only the cognitive subtests of verbal tasks were significantly related to reading success or failure in Chinese.

The sample consisted of 100 kindergarten students (53 boys/47 girls; 96 white/4 black)--77 were 63 months or older, and 23 were 62 months or younger; 67 had preschool experience, while 33 had no preschool experience. Both groups were exposed to the traditional kindergarten curriculum with computer-assisted instruction in readiness skills. The Pre-Reading Composite (Auditory Skill, Visual Skill, and Language Skill) subtest of the Metropolitan Readiness Test was used as the dependent variable; sex, age, and presence or absence of preschool experience were  used as independent variables. Results indicated that the children did demonstrate differences in performance on the Auditory Skill subtest and were significantly affected by attendance at preschool. There was no significant difference in readiness achievement between older and younger children. Findings suggest that computer-assisted instruction may require caution in program material selection.

        "description":"In order to evaluate an experimental writing program involving word processors as tools, a study examined the use of cloze techniques as a method for indicating reading progress as it relates to writing. Subjects, 87 Canadian primary school children, were involved in a three-year longitudinal study of the effects of this experimental writing program on primary school literacy development. The students were administered cloze tests along with a variety of tests of intelligence, oral language skill, and writing ability. Results from tests given in both first and second grades indicate that cloze tests that allow as correct any word with semantic or syntactic credibility are the best predictors of writing ability. A high degree of relationship between both cloze reading and writing  performance suggests the similarity of processing of these tasks. Findings also indicate that word processors ease the administration of cloze tests and are more enjoyable for students. Further findings show that Spache standards (1966), used to measure readability of cloze passages, are only roughly accurate. (A table of data and cloze tests are appended.) (ARH)",

The subjects in the first study, 461 third- and fourth-grade students in a suburban Maryland school district, were divided into experimental and control groups, with the experimental CIRC groups working in heterogeneous learning teams for all reading, language arts and writing activities. In reading, CIRC students worked with partners during follow-up times on partner reading, decoding, story structure, prediction, and story summary activities related to the basal stories. In writing and language arts, CIRC students used a process approach to writing and peer conferences during planning, revising and  editing stages of the process. Subjects in the second study, 450 third- and fourth-grade students were chosen from a wider range of ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds than those in the first, although the second study was an extension and replication of the first. The results of both studies show significant effects in favor of the CIRC students on standardized test measures of reading comprehension, reading vocabulary, language mechanics, language expression and spelling. Also noted were effects favoring CIRC students on writing sample and oral reading measures. (Six tables of data are included, and 51 references are attached.) (NH)",

The first posttest, administered immediately after instruction, showed no significant differences among the three treatment groups, findings that were not unexpected  because students were all motivated to study for an upcoming test. However, the delayed test administered two weeks after instruction indicated that the group which received definition, sentence and visual image performed significantly better than the first group receiving only the definition, indicating that visual imagery can be used successfully as part of an instruction technique in vocabulary development programs at the college level.

Training subjects received explicit demonstration of appropriate strategies, while induction subjects were presented with materials that &quot;suggested&quot; the use of targeted strategies, and control subjects received no special instructions. Each subject was individually administered four memory tasks: (1) organization--three 20-item word lists were sorted and recalled; (2) rehearsal--three 20-item word lists were rehearsed and recalled; (3) inference--16 sentences were read, followed by explicit-cued and implicit-cued  recall; and (4) story recall--a titled and an untitled story were read and recalled. Subjects were presented with a final set of neutral materials for each task to assess transfer of strategy use. Results indicated that good readers used appropriate strategies more effectively and recalled more information than poor readers. Further, good readers seemed to benefit most from the induction procedure of the organization tasks, while poor readers generally displayed superior strategy use and recall in the training condition. Such findings indicate that good readers benefit most from &quot;learning by doing&quot; in a supportive context, while poor readers perform better with explicit training procedures.

A model of indicators relevant to reading education (outcome, process, and input) can be used to judge more accurately the health of the educational system. Outcome indicators, which describe the results of educational efforts, should include performance on the following sub-aspects of reading: (1) decoding, (2) literal comprehension, (3) locating information, and (4) higher order processes. Process indicators measure a means for achieving desired results, and contain the dual traits of instructional effectiveness--quality and quantity.  Quantity of instruction includes the number of courses taken, the quantity of reading instruction, and the quantity of reading for homework. Quality of instruction entails not the time, but the events that occur in time that are instrumental for learning. Characteristics of quality instruction include using students' background knowledge, summarizing, and teaching vocabulary and inferencing. Input indicators describe resources for the educational process such as school plant and equipment, educational and ethnic characteristics of students, and literacy materials at home. Indicators such as these can be used for policy purposes, as well as for research on learning and teaching. (Thirty references are attached.) (MM)",

Providing opportunities for free reading during the school day is a qualitative way of filling a literacy gap for children. Educators should consider implementing lasting innovations that guide students to become independent, successful learners. The following suggestions provide some insight and direction for implementing independent reading on a long-term basis: (1) consider independent reading in the context of remedying school problems; (2) be aware of complex factors that are necessary for program durability; (3) prevent potential crises that could have a  negative impact on the innovation; and (4) use approaches that increase the chances of successfully maintaining the innovation. Genuine cooperation among colleagues is also necessary for a lasting independent reading program because a strong sense of ownership contributes significantly to a sustained commitment.

Four testing sessions, each on a different day, were required. The first session introduced the topic and encouraged prewriting activities. In the second session students wrote a rough draft, while revising took place at the third  session. The fourth session was used to write a final copy. Average scores for the analytic traits at each grade level, with the exception of the voice trait in grade 11, indicated that student papers were such that observed strengths generally balanced observed weaknesses, i.e., that student writing skills were developing as reasonably expected at their respective grade levels.

        "description":"In most public schools today, where teachers must function as dispensers of knowledge and judges of correctness while students must function as listeners, repeaters, and memorizers, the learning process is passive. Such a passive learning process is an exhausting, burdernsome, role for the teacher and is draining on students, for it requires them to be silent, attentive, and disciplined in a manner that is not applicable in other life situations. Passive learning has not always been the rule. The Progressive Movement, begun by John Dewey, involved students in their education, preparing them not just for college--which many would never attend--but also for life. However, shortly after 1957, in response to the Sputnik scare and the belief that America was soft not only in  technology but also in educational standards, the Progressive Movement yielded to the Academic Model, which looked upon language arts as a subject to be tested, structured, and measured. It was not until the mid-1960s, when critics pointed out that racial and cultural minorities were being left behind, that the Academic Model lost ground. Several recent studies show that since the middle 1970s, American schools have been influenced by a back to the basics movement, which came about as a reaction to the more progressive educational current of the late 1960s and early 1970s. This back to the basics movement is also characterized by the passivity of the learning process. It is important for educators to reactivate the learning process. An educational system which discourages critical and  creative thinking is unlikely to aid students in becoming active and questioning members of their society. The key to reactivation is inductive teaching which excites, challenges, and allows students some control over their learning. The benefits of reactivation are great--for students, teachers, administrators, and society. (ARH)",

The students were divided into two groups: (1) one group participated in a traditional approach to writing instruction defined in terms of separate, sequential skills being taught during an assigned period using a basal reader; and (2) the second group participated in a more informal approach allowing students to negotiate with the teacher concerning the choice of themes, book genres, writing and reading assignments, etc. Student answers on forced-choice questionnaires  designed to probe their perceptions, interests, and their behavior toward writing indicated that students' perceptions do vary with the kind and nature of the instruction. Students in the informal classes appeared to have an advantage over their counterparts in the traditional classes across all probes employed in the study, and they saw writing as an enjoyable and meaningful activity that was initiated for their own purposes.

        "description":"Focusing on language development--from beginning speech to literacy--with particular attention paid to growth in writing, this paper identifies and describes: (1) links between speech and writing; and (2) features of children's written and spoken texts that indicate growth. The process of constructing &quot;texts&quot; is presented as the fabric of all discourse where connections between speech and writing and reading and writing can best be seen, and the process is traced through an overview of children's language development from the infant's initial contact with speech to the early primary grades when children produce written texts. By highlighting key concepts of language and learning such as intersubjectivity, intertextuality, and the constructive function of language, the study shows  how literacy can naturally evolve from language. Examples of early reading, and story telling and writing are presented and analyzed as they illustrate development in terms of story structure, cohesive elements and social/cultural contexts. (NH)",

        "description":"In recent years, teacher education curriculum has become more focused on the &quot;back to basics&quot; issue of teaching, encouraging teachers to manipulate students and classroom environments to attain one goal: academic learning. Critics claim this narrowing of the teacher education process has led to negative social consequences where children are represented as things or raw material to be made into finished products. Following Urie Bronfenbrenner's suggestion that preservice teachers should have opportunities to enter into relationships with their students, and school curriculum should integrate academic learning with prosocial or altruistic development, the elementary teacher education program at the University of Georgia assigned daily dialogue journals to be written between each  student teacher and a young student to provide the student teacher with a vehicle for entering into and developing a relationship with a student in a limited period of time. Daily entries were made in the journal (notebook) by both the student teacher and the child, with the student teacher instructed not to correct the entry or use it for didactic purposes. Although early entries tended to be superficial in many respects, later journal entries indicated that a sense of trust and rapport was beginning to emerge between journal partners at the same time skills in written communication were being promoted.

The first experiment, reporting on 20 children at each of the dimensional substages (mean ages of 4.8, 6.1, 8.5, and 10.6 years), showed that a qualitative shift occurred between four and six years when scripts were replaced by plots. At eight and ten years, the story structures showed a quantitative increase in the episodic complexity which correlated positively with working memory capacity. The second study, using four groups of 20 children (aged 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-years old), demonstrated that the developmental progression was maintained when increasingly explicit structural cues were offered to a second group of similarly aged  children and that the processing demand of the story structures showed no significant deviation from the hypothesized processing capacities, across age groups. Moreover, when task processing demand was adjusted to correspond to the capacity levels hypothesized for each age group, performance was altered.

Although English education journals have resounded with exhortations to teachers about the importance of encouraging children to talk, the recent limited research suggests strongly that speaking and listening activities in Years 7-l0 classes have very low profile by comparison with the amount of time devoted to reading and writing activities, at least in Australia. One macro-level speech community which cuts across age, sex, and social class boundaries in Australia is sports, and an examination of the speech community inhabited by sporting &quot;heroes&quot; reveals the nature of the role models for young  people's oral language. A study of 15 hours of video tape interviews with sports heroes yields four major classifications (expressive moments, self-reflection, decision-making considerations, and outer-directed analyses) which account for virtually all the utterances apart from social banalities and chitchat revealing startling limitations of self-observation, analysis and reflection. These interviews not only provide a model for sporting fans--of whom children and adolescents form a substantial group--they also provide a data base for the study of the products of the English education of the seventies and eighties, presenting evidence to support the need for constructive direction from curriculum designers and researchers.

Certain process-oriented thinking skills are inherent in both, including comprehending and composing, regenerating ideas, the application of language learning and processing. Five characteristics of effective composing and comprehending can also be identified: planning, drafting, aligning, revising, and monitoring. Three case studies, in which artists and writers discuss the process of composing, provide useful models demonstrating the parallels between composing in painting, writing, and reading. The composition of meaning in reading can be observed through a five-step method of repeated readings: (1) survey the headings; (2) read the  introduction and summary; (3) study the graphics and captions; (4) read the first and last sentences in the paragraphs of each section; and (5) read each section phrase by phrase. The parallel between paint and print media provides teachers of novice writers with ways of concretely illustrating the process of constructing meaning. The value of revision and editing in writing can be more fully appreciated by young writers who have experienced its effects in both painting and reading.

A number of  procedures which focus on the formative, on teaching, on the holistic, on the student and on process within the language arts--listening, speaking, reading and writing--are available and should be sought by the classroom teacher since ill-considered tests can lead to a thoughtless curriculum as teachers teach to inappropriate tests.

The disciplines represented included art, chemistry, communication, economics, English, music, physics, psychology, and theatre. Thirteen of the faculty members had completed a speaking and listening across disciplines workshop, and all were individuals who incorporated student speaking liberally in their courses. Because each discipline was represented by only one respondent, no conclusions  about a specific field should be drawn. However, with a broad specturm of fields represented, useful similarities and differences can be identified, and four conclusions suggest themselves as guides to the disciplinary fields: (1) some distinctions in kinds of talk regarded as appropriate in undergraduate classrooms are seen; (2) in developing programs of speaking and learning across disciplines, a proviso should be introduced to the effect that talk is not the same in every classroom; (3) a discrete &quot;discourse field&quot; which could exist may be labeled &quot;academic,&quot; that students should get used to; and (4) the less valued kinds of talk relating common experiences should be built upon rather than discounted.

Community colleges' close links to their communities plus their ability and desire to service a variety of student needs allow them to provide innovative and specific on-campus noncredit courses, such as specialized business courses. Communication faculty have the potential for developing noncredit communication skills courses, and even greater opportunities blossom when the communication faculty member can work directly with the client to recommend and to develop appropriate courses. However, flexibility is needed to interact with noncredit staff and administration in ways that bridge the credit/noncredit gap. The benefits to the community college of faculty involvement, particularly communication  faculty, in this partnership are as follows: (1) increasing enrollment through noncredit courses; (2) providing faculty with more experience by teaching a diversity of students; (3) strengthening of the quality of faculty members' teaching methods; (4) increasing the college's interaction with community residents and businesses; and (5) closer linking of credit and noncredit areas. Developing new noncredit training courses taps the creativity, specific expertise and interests of the faculty and helps eliminate the burnout that comes with the routine of always teaching the same courses.

Additionally, the study investigated the relationship of the instructor's gender to the student's perception of instructor immediacy and the experiencing of cognitive and affective learning. Data collected on 389 undergraduate students indicated that females experience more communication apprehension (CA) in the classroom, but females were generally more immediate than males. Male students showed a preference for more independent and avoidant learning styles, while female students preferred collaborative and participative learning styles. Interestingly, though female students  reported higher CA in the classroom, they experienced more affective and cognitive learning than male students. Overall, communication variables proved to be better predictors of learning than learning style variables. Low CAs learned less and felt worse about themselves in the classroom. Female instructors assigned higher grades and were perceived as more immediate than male instructors. (A 72-item reference list and 4 data tables are appended.) (Author/GPL)",

Many departments of communication are positioned to offer a series of courses that could serve as a core for peace studies. For example, courses in intrapersonal, interpersonal, and public communication can be joined with a course in conflict management, audience analysis, and communication ethics to form such a core. Courses outside the Department, in areas  such as negotiation, management, and psychology, could extend the minor to a viable major. Finally, Western higher educators must make sharing wisdom as well as technology with developing nations a high priority, requiring a redirection in the emphasis upon bigger (quantitatively) being more important to society than quality of life.

There are three areas to consider from an ethical perspective: program issues, professional issues, and intern and director relationship issues. The discussion of internship ethics evolves primarily from a descriptive ethics perspective, with descriptive ethics considered as &quot;telling people where they are&quot; and making it necessary to &quot;analyze the important and difficult decisions made by the more respected members of that profession.&quot; Ethical implications in program areas may  be found in students' course preparation, student selection, student placement, recruiting, and evaluation. In the area of professional issues, ethical questions include those of allegiance and legality. Concerning intern relationship issues, the director's role is to accommodate the intern's learning experience, yet this may be affected by conflicting personalities, or by the director's imposition of personal values and ethical perspectives. Because of these concerns, intern directors must become knowledgeable about major ethical perspectives, and assess and define their own ethical perspectives, thereby becoming aware of the influence of those perspectives on the decision-making process. In addition, directors should be responsible to assist interns in establishing ethical guidelines to  help in their decision-making.

Although the current emphasis in communication consulting is on skills and theories needed as a base for effective consulting, the actual role of persuasion is rarely addressed. At least two benefits exist in examining the persuasive nature of consulting: (1) when both client and consultant are aware of the persuasive context of their relationship, they can be sensitive to their relative responsibilities, and (2) this perspective  provides access to the research, theory, and skills involved in the concept of persuasion. During the different phases of the consulting process--entry, diagnosis response, and disengagement--different persuasive elements are involved, including attribution instability and evaluation apprehension in the entry phase, and reactance theory in the response phase. Because persuasion theory and skills are required for effective consulting, persuasion training programs are needed for key members of organizations which utilize consultants.

        "description":"For the internship site visit to be the most effective vehicle of evaluation for the director, and for open communication between intern and supervisor, the director must be aware of both the communicative relationship issues and the content of the interactions. In all six phases of the site visit--pre-site visit, site visit entry, intern interview, triadic interview, debriefing, and post-site visit--a communicatively competent director must explore the following communication issues; (1) purpose of the site visit; (2) director's role during the site visit; and (3) timing of the site visit. After clarifying the communication goals of each phase, the director can then self assess and develop any communication skills which would achieve the successful meeting of those goals. Some  possible communication skills needed include feedback skills (evaluative, interpretive, and descriptive), listening skills both verbal and nonverbal, and third party intervention skills. (A site visit reaction form, and handouts on feedback and active listening are appended.) (MM)",

        "author":["Ringer, R. Jeffrey"],
        "description":"A study examined differences in the language of direct mail advertising used by political campaigns at different levels--national state, and local. Seventeen direct mail fund-raising political campaign letters were content analyzed with Wiseman and Schenck-Hamlin's typology of compliance-gaining techniques, language style and readability. The letters came from national campaigns with a national constituency, campaigns for a national office with a local constituency, and campaigns for local offices with local constituencies. Analysis revealed the following differences between national and local letters: (1) while national letters were emotional and personal in style, local letters were shorter and more general and attempted to maintain a professional, almost removed, style; (2)  the national letters were the easiest in terms of readability whereas the local letters were the most difficult; (3) and the national letters contained the most compliance-gaining appeals, as well as explanation and warning appeals, while the local letters concentrated on explanation appeals. These differences probably exist because national letters are most likely written by professionals while local letters are most likely written by volunteers who have little experience with direct mail. Local campaigns may be more hesitant, however, to use the emotion-laden, harsh style of national letters because of their proximity to their constituency.

        "description":"Since the advent of cable television in the early seventies, the success of television evangelists including Oral Roberts, Jim Bakker, Robert Schuller, and Jimmy Swaggart has grown, both in terms of finances and in conversion of souls. Although many television preachers use similar strategies for getting donations, their backgrounds and messages are largely different. These preachers can be classified as evangelicals, fundamentalists, Pentecostals, or charismatics. Jimmy Swaggart, the television evangelist with the strongest following in America is, in religious terms, a charismatic, or neo-Pentecostal leader. When analyzed according to Max Weber's definitions of political leadership, Swaggart's leadership style is also charismatic. An analysis of three of Swaggart's speeches  using Theodore Windt's characteristics of political leadership gives further insight into Swaggart's charisma. In Windt's analysis, charismatic leaders: (1) possess unique gifts that other men do not share; (2) are perceived as extraordinary; (3) arise in times of turmoil; (4) are part of a messianic movement; and (5) are part of a movement that contains contradictions that only faith in a leader can resolve. Swaggart's rhetoric contains many examples of all but the final of Windt's characteristics. This calls into question the idea that contradiction is an important aspect of charisma. (ARH)",

        "description":"Employing learned helplessness theory as a trait orientation, a study examined the interrelationships existing between instructor classroom behaviors, student perceptions of control, and student behavioral responses in the college classroom. Subjects, 317 male and female undergraduate students who were enrolled in communication courses at West Virginia University, over a two day period, evaluated the class immediately preceding their communication class by completing a two-item measure of perceived control and a 24-item multidimensional-multiattributional causality scale (MMCS) measure of achievement-related attributions. State measures included the modified Behavioral Indicants of Immediacy (BII) scale, teacher communication style (TCS), measures of teacher classroom learning  aids, and learning (affective, cognitive, and motivational) measures. Results indicated that student perceptions of state control in the classroom were significantly related to both affective and cognitive learning; students perceiving lack of control over achievement-related behaviors demonstrated reduced affective and cognitive learning and reduced motivation to work and study. Findings suggest that the successful instructor is one who incorporates as many positive behaviors--such as eye contact, smiling, relaxed posture, and vocal variety--as possible, and makes students feel comfortable in a learning environment.

        "description":"Because there are too few minority mass media personnel and minority media owners of newspapers, magazines, and radio stations today, large segments of our nations's minority populations are not kept adequately informed about their respective communities. A corollary of this situation is that the White-majority mass media audience is prevented from gaining a true sense of what life is like for millions of Blacks, Asians and Hispanics as well as other minority Americans. Although the overall mass communications job market offers openings for minority personnel, these openings are not easy to fill. Several factors are responsible: (1) many talented members of minority groups go into other career areas; (2) journalism is not viewed by teachers or counselors as an area of opportunity  for members of minority groups; (3) there are too few media role models; and (4) methods and attitudes found in both public and private educational institutions do not promote interest in communication careers for minority students. If mass communication career interest is to be developed among minority Americans, elementary and junior high school students need to be made aware that career possibilities exist, and more minority teachers at all levels are needed to provide giuidance and role models for minority students.

This report presents the observations and recommendations of the Select Seminar on Teacher Evaluation comprised of 9 master teachers and 9 competent administrators from 18 school districts near Albany, New York. While individuals expressed some disagreement after the five-day seminar, a surprising amount of consensus was reached. Eight observations are presented: (1) teachers are undervalued, enjoying minimal financial or other rewards; (2) most current teacher evaluation practices are ineffective; (3) the public is generally uninformed about evaluation practices;  (4) evaluation is often an adversarial process; (5) some evaluators may be unqualified; (6) evaluation time and resources are inadequate; (7) evaluation practices vary by district; and (8) each district needs a set of shared beliefs. Recommendations to districts include: (1) establishing plans for improving teacher compensation; (2) reexamining and changing current evaluation practices; (3) putting value into evaluations; (4) improving data collection; (5) enabling teachers to assume peer review and major evaluation responsibilities; (6) differentiating evaluation through career steps; (7) systematically determining policy effectiveness; and (8) allocating at least 3 percent of the district budget for staff development.

This divergent group met over a three-month period to reflect on the first year of teaching. Participants identified the problems and frustrations plaguing new teachers, discussed ways to support neophytes, and prepared recommendations to serve as guidelines for districts planning induction and support programs.

The study used a three-part instrument designed to gain background information,  respondents' perceptions concerning the presence or absence of effective school factors, and measure the extent of principals' engagement in various direct and indirect instructional leadership behaviors clustered into five separate scales: staff development, teacher supervision and evaluation, instructional facilitation, resource acquisition and building maintenance, and student problem resolution. All principals indicated that they at least sometimes engaged in all 30 behaviors included in the Instructional Leadership Behavior Questionnaire (ILBQ). High school principals tend to engage in more indirect than direct instructional leadership activities. Overall ILBQ scores were higher for principals from &quot;effective&quot; high schools.

After an extended introduction that raises this question, the key characteristics of effective schools are specified as leadership, a climate of high expectations, and clear instructional objectives, reflected in a variety of classroom activities and management techniques. Next, conditions associated with at-risk students are identified, and successful strategies for at-risk students are discussed. Research findings on these strategies are grouped into three categories: (1) federally funded studies, (2) pull-out programs (autonomous programs that provide an experiential  curriculum); and (3) classroom-based studies. The primary commonalities of successful programs for at-risk youth include a strong level of commitment on the part of the instructional staff, strong leadership, and small program size. The paper concludes by assessing the relationships between research on at-risk youth and effective schools research. The accumulated knowledge of alternative programs for at-risk youth substantially supports the findings of the effective schools researchers, suggesting that the high expectations, clear goals, coherent classoom management, monitoring of student progress, and orientation toward learning that characterize effective schools are also best for addressing the needs of at-risk students.

A dominant theme in the research findings is that some types of instructional grouping contribute to more positive academic and affective outcomes for students. Other groupings, particularly stable, long-term groups based on student ability, have an adverse effect on students. This paper synthesizes this research, defining instructional grouping and describing the following approaches: learning cycle groups, cooperative groups, and long-term  ability groups.

This follow-up study investigates whether the findings from the preceding study were representative of the country as a whole or restricted to large school districts. Accordingly, a proportional selection of 20 school districts in Tennessee were investigated--two urban, six suburban, five medium-size city, and seven rural districts-- for 1972, 1982, and 1986. Data were analyzed by individual district, type of district, and the entire sample of 20 districts to see if there had been changes in the representation of females in each of nine administrative positions during  this period. Aggregated data (by position) for the entire sample of 20 districts were compared with data from urban districts to see the statistical effects of urban districts. Although males continued to dominate administrative positions in all four types of districts, holding an average of 80 percent of the positions from 1972 to 1986, results showed that the percentage of females increased steadily in urban and rural districts, and irregularly in suburban and medium-city districts. These findings suggest that the increasing number of females in administrative positions in large districts nationwide do in fact reveal a general trend that is occurring in other kinds of districts, albeit more slowly. Bar charts compare the number of males and females by type of district, while a table  shows the results of t-tests to determine the significance of changes in numbers of female position holders by time period and type of district.

        "author":["Daniel, Larry G."],
        "description":"Organizational theorists have viewed organizations as \"mini-societies\" based upon commonly held cultural values and assumptions, which may serve to revolutionize organizational practices or to bring about new organization structures. The middle school is an example of an educational institution that has arisen as a result of a particular set of cultural values and assumptions. To test various theoretical assertions about organizational culture in educational institutions, this paper proposes conducting an empirical study of the middle school as the unit of analysis. The proposed investigation will define the ideal culture of the middle school as espoused by its advocates in the professional literature. Research instrumentation will be developed to determine the degree to which  this ideal culture matches that found in selected middle schools. Two independent sample populations will be utilized. A pilot sample of 100 middle school teachers will generate reliability and validity data. The data gathered from a second sample of 200 middle school teachers will be applied to the two research instruments. The instruments will assess the degree of congruence between teachers' perceptions of the presence of various cultural elements in the middle schools in which they teach and the teachers' concept of the desirability of these factors in an ideal intermediate-level school.

        "description":"This paper focuses on the role of language in understanding the inequality of male and female access to positions in educational administration. By applying techniques of sociolinguistics, the paper seeks to demonstrate the potential of the microanalysis of language for identifying the assumptions, norms, and values in the culture of school administration. As gender issue questions arose, studies revealed that more women than men designate education as their first career choice, that women attain administrative positions later in life than men, and that men achieve higher salary levels than their female counterparts. Recent research shows that the requirements of a male-oriented career have made women appear less competent and feel less comfortable with entry administration. If  such positions are available to women, the superintendency is not one of them. Sociolinguistic research can serve as a new tool for analyzing the contributions in language differences among men and women, as well as demonstrating that women administrators offer a source of insight into the administrative culture. A range of research agendas using linguistic analysis would reveal particular norms and patterns for the empirical grounding of a serious critique that would expand leadership theory to incorporate the values and experiences of women. Such reformulation of the administrative culture should originate from the voices of women. Sixty-one references are appended. (CJH)",

All the vignettes are grouped by the principle illustrated or questions raised, and brief analytical commentaries by the editors accompany each case grouping. After an introductory explanation of the methodology, the vignettes in chapter 2 focus on the process of mentoring: establishing the working relationship, individual consultation, observing and coaching, and modeling. Chapter 3 turns to aspects of the  relationship between mentors and principals, with vignettes grouped around issues such as confidentiality and evaluation, the appropriate match between the two roles, and continuity of support. Chapter 4 addresses issues affecting the life of a mentor: novice teachers and novice mentors, rewards, frustrations, relations with others, and friendships with other teachers. Each chapter concludes with an annotated bibliography. (TE)",

        "description":"This study investigated the school superintendency in British Columbia from 1979 through 1987, which has been a time of change from provincial to local employment of superintendents. Research explored the turnover and attrition among superintendents and the activities subsequent to their departure. Such demographic data were gathered from Ministry of Education records and from interviews with personnel. The present status of the superintendency, the circumstances of recent years, the scene across Canada, and future imperatives were investigated through indepth interviews of 42 respondents throughout British Columbia and from other provinces. Of the 129 individuals who held a superintendency for some time during the 9-year period, 66 reamin in the British Columbia superintendency.  Twenty-one retired after full service and 46 went to other positions and activities on departure; only four have reentered since departure in this province. A position in the Ministry of Education is no longer available as a career option for superintendents. Only those employed previously as district superintendents by the Ministry could make such a move after the introduction of local employment. The study identifies superintendents' perceptions of the position and its circumstances and demands; the future of the position is considered by examining key skills seen by the respondents as essential. The study offers recommendations for recruitment and selection procedures, conditions of employment, and preparation. There is need for further research into the superintendent's &quot;political  statesman&quot; role, which was perceived by many respondents as crucial. Tables of research data and two reference pages are included. (Author/CJH)",

Part 3 provides a series of strategies and model programs for responding to these new realities. The first discussion focuses on student problems: keeping \"at risk\" students in school, curbing drug and alcohol abuse, and addressing the issue of teen suicide. Subsequent discussions focus on early childhood education, some hopeful indications for teacher supply, the promise of computers and technology, cooperation between schools and business, parents' involvement, and educational finance reform.

        "description":"The research study sought to determine the status of student assessment instrumentation and practices in programs dealing with the transition of special education students from school to work or postsecondary education, and to determine areas where current practice was not able to meet the changing demands of transitional services. Transition projects funded by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services were surveyed to determine the student competencies assessed, commercially available or locally developed instruments used, and usefulness of the information obtained. Twelve competency categories were identified: general ability/intelligence, special ability, vocational skills, academic achievement, language, adaptive behavior, social skills, career interest,  motor skills/dexterity, lifestyle/consumer satisfaction, daily living skills, and survival skills. Following an overall analysis of the projects' use of the identified instruments, 3 appendixes provide: (1) the survey instrument; (2) reviews of 141 of the instruments, providing such information as publisher, cost, date of publication, competencies assessed, population characteristics, recommended uses, test content and format, skills/materials required, norming/standardization practices, reliability, and validity; and (3) a bibliography.

A dichotomy between departments of special education and educational administration is noted. Only replacement of the system with an entirely different configuration and not rational technical efforts at reform can effect real change. There is a lack of theoretical basis to the mainstreaming debate and in the original formulation of Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. Special education has erred in locating the cause of disability within the person and excluding from consideration causal factors lying in the larger external social, political, and organizational processes.  Among topics considered in support of this argument are: school organization and change, professional bureaucracies as machines, response to change demands, organizational paradigms and change, values/power, school organization and disability, the nature of special education, the nature of progress, empirical evidence on the implementation of P.L. 94-142, and prospects for the future.

Data from students applying in 1983 and 1984 (over 800 per year) were available, as were grades of students admitted in 1983. A series of multiple regression studies showed that selection and first year grades could be accurately predicted. This finding suggested that statistical methods of selection could logically replace at least a portion of a more labor intensive clinical method. Additional analyses showed that students admitted in each year significantly outperformed other applicants on all objective measures. Recommended is a two-stage approach to selection with 260 semi-finalists being selected strictly on a statistical basis and the  remaining 140 semifinalists selected by school officials. Semifinalists would then be interviewed by admissions committees and final selection be based partly on committee recommendations and partly on the discretion of school officials. Other recommendations involved more detailed definitions of admissions standards and expanded studies of school outcomes. (DB)",

Home visits provided ratings of maternal sensitivity, the Bradley and Caldwell (1980) HOME inventory provided ratings of environmental quality, and developmental tests provided ratings of cognitive development. Results found that the quality of the infants' home environment combined with the severity and duration of perinatal illness were strongly associated with early cognitive development.

        "description":"The study reviewed application of the Myklebust Learning Quotient Method of identifying learning disabilities (LD) in the Macomb (Illinois) community school district from 1980 to 1987. The learning quotient (LQ) is a ratio of actual achievement to expected achievement. The Macomb program established ability estimates by use of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Revised) and the Kuhlmann-Anderson Test; and achievement estimates with the Science Research Associates (SRA) achievement series and the Peabody Individual Achievement Test. Use of a correction factor for grade level with an LQ of 83 as the cutoff resulted in qualification as LD of 4% of the population. Use of the discrepancy formula was recommended as the first step in LD identification with more specific  individual evaluation following. The review of current practices found that 6-9% of students continued to be classified as LD. Problems identified included placement in an LD class without the screening procedure, use of the screening procedure as the entire basis for LD diagnosis, placement without further evaluation, and LD placement regardless of the results of the screening procedure. It was concluded that, though the screening procedure itself was not failing its original purpose, implementation procedures need to be modified. (DB)",

The core vocabulary is organized into eight sequential stages of increasing complexity and communication priority and can be personalized by elimination of irrelevant items and addition of other concepts. The teaching procedure has six steps: (1) setting up acts of communication; (2) establishing a learning pattern; (3) using vocabulary in the context of real objects and  events; (4) teaching a range of functions; (5) teaching new concepts; and (6) teaching understanding and use of phrases.

The first step, \"Evaluating Tests,\" covers the purpose of a language assessment and issues such as norms, validity, and reliability, and concludes with a checklist for evaluating language tests. \"Selecting a Test Battery\" defines a test battery, discusses formal-informal testing, reprints the Kendall Communicative Proficiency Scale, provides examples of test batteries, and cites test  modification techniques. \"Administering the Test Battery\" lists general considerations for administering tests and special considerations for testing the hearing-impaired child. \"Obtaining and Using Language Samples\" describes ways to obtain written, elicited, and spontaneous language samples; discusses methods of recording and analyzing spontaneous language; and gives sample recording forms. The final section contains descriptions and critiques of 36 available language tests, including ordering information, ages for which the tests are designed, instructions for test administration, norms, reliability, validity, advantages, disadvantages, and other notes.

Six cerebral-palsied (CP) children were compared with six children not suffering motor system dyscontrol (NCP) on a brick tower-building task. Results showed that the most competent CP child achieved the same level as the least competent NCP child. Two distinct sub-groups were found within the CP group--one which achieved acceptable age-related performance with slightly lower levels of control than the NCP group and another which showed very low levels of control especially in digital manipulation of the test objects.

Activities are developed to build on three levels of performance/response: awareness, imitation, and self-initiation. Instructional methods stress precision teaching (task analysis) and effective group teaching. A sample classroom layout, instructions for making pillow chairs and a swing-out divider arm, and a  sample schedule precede the specific unit on \"back to school learning.\" The unit's four instructional objectives are (1) becoming familiar with staff, peers, and routine; (2) learning to use basic objects and equipment associated with school; (3) building a classroom \"family'\" and (4) building and strengthening each person's identity. Activities for this unit and for the \"autumn antics\" unit focus on \"current events,\"\"integrated arts,\"\"discovery,\" and \"home management.\" The \"autumn antics\" unit revolves around the concepts of autumn and apples, fall sports (football, World Series), fall leaves and their colors, and country life. Presented for each activity in both units are a general description, content area, materials, teaching suggestions (coded to behavioral objectives) and a form  for recording the individual student's response to the activity.

Many are Black or Hispanic. Some are brothers and sisters who need a home together.\" Between mid-January and the end of June 1984, approximately 13,000 questionnaires were mailed to affiliates of the North American Council on Adoptable Children (NACAC), foster parents associations, and other groups and individuals. Usable surveys were returned by 535 respondents, of whom 55.7 percent were identified as having experienced a homestudy barrier. Of the 191 white married respondents, 125 experienced a homestudy barrier. Consistent with  other investigative findings, Blacks and single females and males clearly encountered homestudy barriers. Very few respondents expressed interest in adopting mentally retarded children or those with severe or even moderate disabilities. Almost 60 percent were unwilling to adopt a child older than 9 years. It is concluded that there is a mismatch between available children offered by agencies and what most respondents apparently want. Identified limitations of the study include the inability to identify the number of persons who believe they actually experienced a homestudy barrier. In addition, it is suggested that investigators may need to study number and race of staff available to prepare homestudies, examine eligibility criteria, and study application forms. More than half the  document is made up of statistical tables displaying the study data. The NACAC questionnaire is appended. (JW)",

During the first year the project staff met with state education agency personnel responsible for the Comprehensive System of Personnel Development (CSPD) program and reviewed the CSPD portion of all State Plans submitted to the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services. They were then able to produce a functional needs assessment product, including a manual and software, with enough flexibility to meet unique needs identified in each state. The second and third years of the project were spent assisting states to implement the SpecPE Needs  Assessment Management System through both regional and on-site training programs. Direct training was provided to personnel in the contiguous 48 states, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. Hawaii and the trust territories were provided all project materials plus a videotape covering all training sequences which have also been provided to each of the Regional Resource Centers. Throughout the duration of the project, nationwide open communication was maintained by project administration of the SpecPE Bulletin Board through the SpecialNet electronic network. The report contains a general overview of the project, a description of methods and procedures, a table summarizing physical education services for special education students, a list of trainees by state, and a sample state analysis plan.

The planning framework contains four components: (1) aesthetic perception/multisensory integration; (2) creative expression; (3) dance heritage/historical and cultural; and (4) aesthetic valuing/enjoyment, observation, recognition. Contents, goals, and long- and short-term objectives are identified for each. The teaching units correspond to the first three components and are designed to encourage student awareness, imitation, and self-initiation. The creative movement curriculum developed for component one contains nine lessons. Instructions for each lesson cover objectives, warm-ups, improvisational dance, relaxation, isolated  movement to music, partner movement activities, and object control. For component two, some 24 activities designed to build a repertoire of experiences with improvisation, choreography, and elements of form are described and accompanied by music, diagrams, and a list of books, records, and videotapes useful for their implementation. The teaching units for component three present structured \"dance\" lessons in the areas of folk dance, square dance, and contemporary dance that are presented in the format of an all-school performance.

        "description":"The project conducted research and developed a demonstration model aimed at helping schools and families plan transitions for young children moving from special preschools to less specialized settings including regular preschools and kindergarten. The model's target population consisted of 40 handicapped children (ages 3-5) enrolled in three special preschools in Douglas County, Kansas. Emphasizing the inclusion of family members as active participants in the child's transition, the program includes guidelines to plan transitions for children who have different learning needs and for families who differ in their socio-economic resources. The transition model includes formats for: (1) constructing interagency agreements; (2) communicating between the school and home; (3) involving  families in the decision-making process; (4) constructing a program timeline; (5) constructing an individualized transition timeline; (6) identifying local agencies for referral; (7) preparing the child for a change of classrooms and programs; and (8) evaluating the transition component. This document consists of a project summary and three appendixes providing checklists and evaluation instruments, planning guides, interview protocols, teacher and parent surveys, and other representative project materials.

Factors determining classroom placements for the child include chronological age, results of school readiness and developmental screening tests, rates of inappropriate child behavior and teacher attention, and the ability to meet demands of the future classroom environment. Parents choosing to actively participate as partners and teachers can help prepare the child for transition, help maintain and generalize some of the critical skills necessary for a successful transition, and serve as a bridge between the two programs. The sending teacher can become familiar with the  curriculum and routines of potential receiving programs and focus on teaching the skills that the child must demonstrate upon kindergarten entry. The receiving teacher may need to evaluate traditional kindergarten routines, teach academic support skills in addition to academic content, and establish new communication patterns with parents. Educational agencies should promote interagency coordination and communication. Thirty-nine references are provided. (VW)",

While traditional approaches to early intervention tend to be exclusively child-focused, professionals are encouraged to respond to a child as part of a family unit because handicapping conditions place both the child and family at risk. Intervention goals might take into account the extent of family time and resources available for home- or center-based therapy, the family's interest in the development of certain child skills, and the family's ability to be involved in the therapy program. Professionals ought to review existing assessment tools and  interpretation methods to determine if they evaluate need from the family's perspective and promote understanding between professionals and families. The purpose of both intervention and assessment should be clearly understood, the purposes should be similar when possible, and needs should be stated in measurable terms. Intervention goals and tasks should address the family's strengths as well as needs while taking into consideration the impact on the family's time, finances, and skills. Outcome measures must reflect parent and family gains and satisfaction along with child gains. Fifty-two references are provided. (VW)",

During a full year of supervised practicum, the students were videotaped as they interacted with children in instructional contexts. The tapes were used to provide coaching and feedback, to establish self-monitoring skills, and to evaluate the students' attainment in each competency area. Target competencies included: (1) using and interpreting assessment instruments and techniques; (2) designing and implementing individualized intervention programs; (3) designing and organizing appropriate learning  environments; (4) developing appropriate early childhood developmental activities; (5) providing opportunities for choice, problem solving, and responsibility for learning on the part of the young child; (6) developing teaching strategies and handling techniques; and (7) performing and applying task analysis in the learning environment. The program's effectiveness was evaluated using data measuring the competencies attained by students and the efficiency/effectiveness of videotape usage, opinions expressed by participants and their employers, and the numbers and types of positions program graduates assumed.

It is argued that both the adjective and &quot;-mente&quot; are word-level morphemes rather than stem+affix, implying that MAs are compounds and raising the question of how MAs conform to compound typology, which is characterized relative to the interpretation of the compound. The types of compounds discussed by one researcher are summarized, and it is proposed that the interpretation of MAs is based on the thematic relationship between the base adjective and  its external (or subject) argument, satisfied by the nominal &quot;-mente.&quot; (MSE)",

This report is based on data collected from a subsample of 20 mothers. Mother-child interactions in feeding, teaching, and play at eight months and two years were videotaped and transcribed, and the children's utterances were coded for grammatical complexity, discourse variables, and pragmatic variables. The results indicate significant differences between adolescent and older mothers, especially at eight months. At that stage, older mothers were more responsive to their infants and more likely to impute intentionality to their infants' noncommunicative behaviors, an activity linked to rate of  acquisition. While the adolescent mothers appeared to enjoy interacting with their infants as evidenced by a high percentage of initiations and equal simultaneous interaction, they reacted to their children more concretely, rarely reading anything into their actions or verbalizations. Parallel trends were found at two years. There did not appear to be any significant difference in the children's general linguistic abilities at two years, but there were differences in standardized test scores at eight months, two years, and three years.

The schedule for acquisition of the inflectional system may be determined not by the learning of particular affixes but by whether inflection is a core or peripheral property of the grammar being acquired. There is a striking difference between languages concerning this property. This would explain the early acquisition of the morpheme &quot;-ing&quot; in English but the relatively late acquisition of other inflectional morphemes in the somewhat impoverished inflectional system of English. It is the degree of deviation from the core grammar rather than the intuitive complexity of the data that  accounts for the relative ease or difficulty of acquisition. The theory would also explain the phenomenon, occurring in languages with rich inflectional systems, of children's avoidance of zero morpheme affixation. Evidence of these processes also appears in such diverse languages as Polish, Italian, Serbo-Croatian, Russian, Hebrew, and American Sign Language. This view of markedness as peripheral in one language and part of the core grammar in another is unusual and should be further tested in other languages. (MSE)",

Free anaphors, pronominals, cannot be bound in the domain of reflexives (principle B); their interpretation is largely determined by non-grammatical factors. Thus, the resolution of bound and free anaphors exploits different modules of knowledge. Since different kinds of knowledge are involved, a reasonable expectation is that a different development can be found for the two kinds of anaphor resolution in language acquisition. To test this expectation, experimental studies investigated how Dutch children aged 4 to 10 interpret sentences  involving reflexive and non-reflexive anaphors. The results showed a difference in the rates of acquisition for the two types of anaphors. This experimental finding is taken as support for the view that bound and free anaphora resolution involve different kinds of knowledge. (Author/MSE)",

Studies of formal reasoning among persons with limited schooling in Central Asia, West Africa, and Mexico are noted and discussed in the context of schema theory and parent educational background. Language minority students with little formal schooling in their own language are reported to have had difficulties in interpreting formal reasoning problems. The students often refuse to interpret problems as meaningful because the problems included persons, objects, and events that were not a part of their everyday life. Future research will address how language minority students'  acquisition of schemata for language forms such as transition expressions may affect their ability to reason effectively in a second language.

First, findings on three elements of success (interest and motivation, intelligence and development, and psychosocial access) are examined. The discussion then turns to providing students with access to learning opportunities, the process of concept development, the relationship between student and teacher, and development of cooperative work skills. Finally, the Finding Out/Descubrimiento Approach (developed by Edward A. De Avila, Sharon E. Duncan, and Cecilia J. Navarrete) is described and its curriculum is outlined. The approach provides an  integrated language skills program for oral and written communication mastery in English and Spanish within a cooperative learning environment. It is used in grades 2 through 5, and is designed to meet the needs of students from diverse cultural, academic, and linguistic backgrounds by capitalizing on their natural interest in how the world works. The program consists of two phases: (1) introduction to social aspects of cooperative work, and (2) supervised content-learning activities. Organization of the classroom environment and appropriate learning materials are discussed, science and math activities drawn from the curriculum are listed, and several sample activities are outlined in detail.

The children were asked to perform a task with a toy either before or after performing another task with a different toy. Some children were provided with a choice of toy for the task (context) and others were not (no context). Results indicate that by five years, Japanese children know the meaning of temporal terms, a finding similar to that for English-speaking children. The results on contextual support suggest that contextual information was helpful in a methodological way, when the order of suggestion of the tasks matched the order of their supposed performance. This finding  favors a processing rather than syntactic or semantic account of children's performance failures. (MSE)",

A study investigated nominal plural markers in the speech of 20 Cubans representing both sexes and various occupations, ages, educational levels, and geographic areas of the island. Results show very little difference between the rate of /s/ deletion for masculine and feminine NPs, contrasting with previous research findings. Very little redundant use of /s/ or concord within NPs was found, also contrasting with previous findings. A small percentage of NPs were ambiguous with respect to plurality, supporting earlier findings suggesting that context usually disambiguates. These findings support the functional theory, that languages tend to maintain elements  containing semantically relevant information, only in a global sense. Claims of functional compensation within the phonology are not supported here, but some aspect of the context (morphological, syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic) generally disambiguates NPs that are phonologically ambiguous with respect to number. Remaining ambiguous NPs are tolerated and probably forgotten. (MSE)",

First, it is shown from investigation of inconsistencies in transcribed conversations that unintentional contradictions are resolved in repair sequences with three basic strategies: conversationalists modify one term to agree with another; they relativize both terms toward a synthesis; or they assign the contradictory terms to distinct frames of reference. Second, it is demonstrated that these strategies are used to interpret intentional contradictions, based on elicited  paraphrases of written paradoxes. The three strategies were found to apply regardless of context and without significant variation for speakers of unrelated languages, suggesting that they represent universal semantic principles rather than pragmatic processing procedures. These principles refute the analysis of discourse contradiction in terms of maxims and implicatures. (Author/MSE)",

In this presentation, the president of the University of Chicago suggests that the importance of understanding education, particularly liberal arts education, as a complex subject is critical in understanding the relationship between liberal learning and private enterprise. Education, corporations, and management have a complex relationship that must be understood in order to put liberal arts in the proper perspective for the future. All people have ideas and theories about education, but little emphasis is placed on specific and complex ways of looking at changes in institutions of higher education and their relationship to other institutions. When  considering education, it is necessary to bring in other topics, since thinking about education is in many ways like thinking about the future, present, and past. Ideas about what constitutes a good education have changed over the years; a liberal arts education was championed by the Renaissance humanists, who opposed the \"sterile academicians\" of their time. Liberal arts must be shown to be currently relevant in ways that differ from the merely technical or professional training. A fuller, more detailed sense of context for developing and teaching liberal arts is necessary. (SM)",

        "description":"A one-day invitational forum was convened to gain some insight into factors that continue to impede the identification, recruitment, admission, retention and graduation of minority students in graduate education. The objectives of the forum were to review the current status and to formulate recommendations on this subject. Following a summary of the keynote address by Anne S. Pruitt and the comments of respondents, a discussion of exemplary programs is summarized. Several administrative, recruitment and admissions factors affecting admission and success in graduate programs are identified. The consensus arrived at by several task force discussion groups is reported, followed by some statistical data on declining minority participation in graduate study and factors affecting low  minority participation which supported the groups' conclusions. Ten recommendations resulting from the forum, and steps for the implementation of each, are presented. Among these are the following: (1) designate a national organization as the agency to identify and disseminate information on graduate study and career opportunities for minorities; (2) each institution should sensitize graduate faculty to the need for mentoring among minority students; (3) institutions should reduce the heavy dependency of minority students on funding sources outside the university; (4) institutions should recruit minority faculty and administrators at all levels; and (5) further research on minority participation should be undertaken to address specific issues.

        "description":"Two trends will impact the academic labor force through the rest of this century: approximately half of the existing professorial positions are held by persons within 15 years of retirement, and demographic projections are that by the year 2000, ethnic minority groups will constitute 30% of the national population. Underrepresented minority students may not be able to take full advantage of this favorable climate due to their continuing underrepresentation among annual Ph.D. recipients. Between 1980 and 1984, overall minority school enrollment declined 8.5%. In 1984, underrepresented minority students received only 5.5% of the Ph.D.'s awarded and were concentrated in education, social sciences, humanities and life sciences. If this situation is to be rectified, universities with  degree-granting programs must play a large role in the identification, enrollment and preparation of minority graduate students. Seven steps for improving identification of minority graduate students are presented, including the increased involvement of minority undergraduates in university activities and the development of recruitment activities and materials targeted to minority students. Four steps for improving minority student admission procedures are presented, including the inclusion of minorities on the admissions committee and increased use of assistantships. Four steps are presented for increasing minority participation in academic life and thus enhancing their desire to choose college/university teaching as a career. These include more involvement with faculty members and in  departmental activities and providing more opportunities for teaching/research assistantships and for presentation and publication of the work of minority students. The necessity for recruiting and developing minority faculty is also discussed. (KM)",

This survey focuses on resource allocations of 249 accredited U.S. business schools and 15 Canadian schools. A total of 128 schools completed the 13-page questionnaire, yielding a 48% response rate. The report is divided into nine sections: (1) introduction; (2) profile of surveyed schools (demographics, budgets); (3) computer resources (mainframes, minicomputers, and computing staff and services); (4) microcomputers (models and market penetration, microcomputer densities, acquisition and ownership, and portable systems); (5) communications (terminal and  microcomputer communications, and local and wide area networks); (6) software (word processing, spreadsheets, database management systems, integrated and statistical packages, mathematical modeling, simulation, games, languages and graphics); (7) instruction and research (curriculum penetration, courseware sources, classroom electronic equipment, training, computer course and language requirements, and available databases); (8) administrative activities; and (9) summary and issues. The evidence supports the general impression that microcomputers have become a significant component in a school's resources; whereas 20% of schools had microcomputers 5 years ago, today the figure is 100%. Operational costs and computers support staff are important funding allocation issues. Data are presented  in 17 tables and 10 figures. Three appendices comprising nearly half the document provide data on the schools and their mainframe/minicomputer and microcomputer equipment. (KM)",

Some of the questions addressed include: what are the costs, who pays for them, and which arrangements, policies, partnerships, and cooperative interactions among the stake holders are effective? A mail survey of the top 100 public and 34 private colleges and universities was undertaken to determine the full cost of a sample project including indirect costs and fringe benefits. The Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research (CISER) checked responses and coded for analysis. Of the reporting 113 institutions, the average indirect cost rate was 48.4% of  the modified total direct cost. The rate of recovery was found to be 24% of the complete research cost. When compared with governmental studies, the actual recovery appears to be about $78 million lower than former government estimates. Underrecovery of direct costs is concluded to be a major problem for universities, with only 35% of respondents having a carry forward provision to recover in future years any underrecovery. It is important that a sound collaborative effort between universities and government agencies be established to deal with this problem. Part 2 of this report contains survey results summary tables.

They were placed in pairs with half of the participants expecting their partners to give them high control on the task and half expecting low control. The results indicate the students offering high control were liked more, though there was no main effect for responsibility. Also, when students had low responsibility, they preferred the other person more with high control than low control conditions. They had higher expectations of themselves when given high control.  Students with more classroom control are concluded to become more involved, expect more of themselves, and like the instructor and other students better. Classes with no student control or responsibility may have very little student involvement, lower expectations from students, and less liking for one another and the instructor. (SM)",

Estimates are close to $7.7 billion for capital construction, renovation, and repairs through the Year 2000, due to 12 years of funding instability, the increased demand for new facilities with the recent types of enrollment growth, and construction, renovation, and equipment funding of segmented offices. Without these funds, segments may not be able to handle all eligible students, instruction quality could decline, there may be health and  safety problems, and the enormous state investment in the 135 public campuses may be threatened. The State needs to use many funding sources and options in order to meet the minimal infrastructure needs of higher education. Options include issues related to: increased utilization standards for classrooms and laboratories; year-round operations; expanded use of technology; use of off-campus centers; greater use of the independent sector; tax incentives for private contributions to capital projects; general fund support for maintenance of non-state funded space; encouraging lower-division students to attend the community colleges; and bond funding. The legislature must decide which methods to use to make private donations for various facilities more attractive to the institutions and the  donors. (SM)",

Enrollments are expected to grow from the current level of 500 full-time equivalent students in 1987-1988 to 1,700 in 1992-1993. The proposed programs provide a core curriculum plus other majors, such as education, business administration, and computer science. Full testing  services will be offered as well as student orientation programs. Outreach and recruitment services for traditionally underrepresented groups in the area will be undertaken. Other services will include career development services, an educational opportunity program, services for disabled students, psychological services, and some student health services. Steps are being taken to provide easy access to the site by automobile and public transportation. (SW)",

Graduate student recruiting should be coordinated through the graduate school office for a number of reasons, including the effectiveness of combining or coordinating recruitment efforts in closely related fields. General recruiting efforts must be supplemented by work at the departmental or program level. Faculty members can refer students to graduate departments at other schools and can  tap potential graduate students from the pool of public school teachers, practicing professionals, and companies. Alumni are another recruitment resource; successful alumni from the program is a persuasive advocate.

These data were compiled for each of the 15 SREB member states in the curricular areas of reading, writing, and mathematics. The SREB states used almost 100 tests in reading, writing, and mathematics for placement purposes. The average number of placement tests used per state in the region was eight in reading, eight in mathematics, and  seven in writing. While 121 institutions used the Nelson Denny Reading Test, 72 used the American College Testing English Subtest. However, some individual tests were used by only one institution. Twelve of the 15 SREB states did not have official state policies to govern placement testing at the college level.

Information is also provided on the contribution of state and local governments to  public and private institutions. Changes in the Higher Education Price Index between 1960 and 1986 are documented. A majority of witnesses testified that the greatest factor affecting tuition increases reflected changes in student financial assistance policies at the federal, state, and institutional level. Many of the witnesses expressed concern for the impact higher tuition rates will have on students from minority or disadvantaged backgrounds. The testimony indicated that decisions by colleges to increase tuition appear to be in response to rising costs of operating the college. (SW)",

The issues related to the environmental factors affecting teaching hospitals are discussed along with how the assessment of the governance options could affect a hospital's teaching, research, service, and operation. The matrix on governance options for university-owned public teaching hospitals was developed by a small task group specifically to help policymakers define the short- and long-term impact of various government models on the functions of the hospitals. It was made to identity  important issues for consideration at the legislative, state, or institutional level. Sixteen questions the policymakers must consider are listed and discussed, and it is further noted that for each of these questions, three basic areas should be explored as a first step, i.e.: Does the issue affect the teaching hospital and its mission? How important is the issue? Would a change in the location of the decision alter the actual decision? With this matrix, all parties affected by or interested in the governance can provide input, and the objectivity of decision makers is increased. Areas affected by the governance structure include quality patient care services, enhanced education and research, and organizational administration.

This report offers information on the various functions, costs, and funding sources of academic health centers. Because it is difficult for state health policy leaders to determine precise funding requirements, academic health center funding is often by lump sum appropriation with any decrements or increments fairly unrelated to the real work loads and costs. Therefore, policy leaders must understand the functions, costs, and funding involved in academic health centers. These centers are responsible for teaching, research, and service, and costs vary according to their emphasis. Cost and funding are affected by  variations in the health professions schools. These variations include sponsorship, size, location, mission, and relationship with parent universities, clinical training sites, and clinical faculty. Points for policy leaders to consider in comparing costs and funding patterns between health professions schools include specific missions, patterns, and procedures of each school.

An introduction to tuition and fee calculation is followed by definitions of tuition, required student fees, and student residency status. A study of tuition and fees at New Mexico institutions is conducted annually by the New Mexico Commission on Higher Education, and these statistics are compared to national data. Policy options and implications are considered as they concern the determination of tuition levels. Major questions are: what share of the cost of education should students bear? What share of the cost of education should state/local appropriations bear? and How should the student share be calculated?  Practices in other states are noted. A list of Carnegie Commission recommendations includes reevaluating tuition policy to gear it closer to actual costs of education by level of training, and modestly and gradually increasing tuition rates for public institutions. The impact of low tuition rates and price increases upon enrollment is considered, and a list of tuition options is presented. The attached appendix offers tables giving a historical perspective on resident and nonresident student tuition and required fees for public colleges in New Mexico and nationally. (SM)",

A summary of this report and a general overview of the trends and status of computers in American education are followed by an analysis of the use of technology by Chapter 1 programs. This analysis reviews early use of technology in such programs in both public and private schools and profiles their current use of computers. The analysis of technology use with students with limited English proficiency considers the current status of this population and describes ways in  which technology (primarily the computer) is used in these programs. The implications of the findings of this study for federal policy are considered for both groups, and four areas that need attention to improve the use of educational technology are identified: (1) teacher training; (2) software development; (3) dissemination of information; and (4) evaluation and research. The text is supplemented with graphs and diagrams, and footnote citations are provided throughout the text. The primary sources of the data used are an Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) survey of Chapter 1 directors and national surveys conducted by Market Data Retrieval, Inc., Quality Education Data, Inc., and the National Survey of Instructional Uses of School Computers (Henry Becker, Johns Hopkins University).

The knowledge base for the simulation consists of 111 questions organized into 117 rules. The questions and linked advice were derived from questionnaires completed by human judges of teacher dossiers, and the knowledge base is organized into sub-bases for five phases of dossier analysis: (1) preliminary screening; (2) analysis of nine individual data sources; (3) determination of data safety; (4) promotion decisions; and (5) comparison of two dossiers. This report lists the questions and rules for each of the nine individual data sources: (1) student achievement; (2) administrator  reports; (3) other or unique data; (4) parent surveys; (5) peer reviews of materials; (6) professional activities; (7) student surveys; (8) systematic observations; and (9) teacher tests. It is noted that two judgments may be derived from the application of this system--to promote or to deny promotion, and the ranking of dossiers.

The first of three chapters in this sourcebook provides a brief discussion of ways in which educational technology materials can be used to achieve some broad educational outcomes. The types of media produced in the participating countries are outlined in the second chapter, which also suggests 11 criteria for the selection and/or production of multimedia materials and 17 steps for the development of such materials.  Materials brought to the workshop by the participants for demonstration and evaluation are then briefly described, and a table displaying the results of the evaluations concludes the chapter. The third chapter discusses the use of multimedia kits to solve teaching problems and describes the design and use of multimedia kits for three specific situations: (1) a kit for one teacher schools in India; (2) a kit for shared reading in multicultural classes at the elementary level in New Zealand; and (3) three multimedia kits prepared by the Korean Educational Development Institute (KEDI) for teaching in large classes. One of the KEDI kits is designed for use by elementary students and the other two for teacher training programs at the elementary level. (EW)",

That study, which will be repeated in the spring of 1988, considered differences between older and younger adults in their social integration, everyday activities, and use of and attitudes toward television. The qualitative interviews with older adults elicited information on the following topics: (1) reasons for application for cable television connection or reservations; (2) favorite programs and channels and the  degree to which specific channels are known; (3) changes in daily routine since connection to cable television; (4) effects of television on interpersonal communication; and (5) use of other media, especially daily newspapers. The first, partial results of these interviews are described in a generalized fashion, but further evaluation of the transcript material is planned, including analysis of the data against the background of media-theoretical approaches.

The literature was identified through a search of the ERIC database using the descriptors Distance Education, Telecommunications, Teleconferencing, and Communication Satellites combined with the descriptor Schools. Five research reviews and nine primary research studies were selected from the 42 relevant documents retrieved, and these 14 studies were examined in relation to three research questions: (1) the types of media used in public  school (K-12) distance education; (2) the focus of instruction in public school distance education, i.e., who is served and the content and instructional design that are used; and (3) the judgments that are being made about the effectiveness of distance education at the K-12 level. It was concluded that more evaluations of the effectiveness of distance education via electronic media are needed, and that a set of criteria needs to be established for both formative and summative evaluations to obtain meaningful data.

The committee's vision, which is reflected in this document, of the teacher-learning process of the future is based on a division of labor where teachers can function in the uniquely human areas of diagnosis, prescription, motivation, and overall management of the learning process for individuals and groups of various sizes, while technology can play a greater part in exposition, simulation, and information processing and retrieval.  The committee sees various forms of educational technology in use in the future, including computer-based work stations with access to local and remote databases; student access to portable computers; schools equipped with satellite receiving and transmitting equipment; widespread use of holography; student access to a variety of information sources, including primary sources; and student access at all grade levels to technological tools such as lasers, robotics, and music synthesizers.

        "description":"The opinions of 89 educators in Utah on learner needs and the potential for using technology to meet these needs were gathered through a two-stage process of telephone interviews and written questionnaires. Persons included in the sample were the state's 40 district supervisors plus a sample of &quot;key informants&quot; identified by previous experience with technology projects. A list of the critical student learner needs based on telephone interview responses was developed, and responses to other telephone interview questions were summarized. In particular, the assessment teams noticed a polarization of opinion over the usefulness of educational technology in general. The written questionnaire requested that respondents rate each item on performance or importance and then choose the  eight most critical needs for immediate attention. A listing of these immediate needs was compared with the rankings of the critical needs identified by the telephone survey. The third analysis performed was a means difference test of the item's rating of performance from the mean rating of importance. Finally, a Spearman rank correlation was done of the rankings obtained in the study. Analysis of the data provided a list of 14 learner needs which merit attention by Utah technology projects, and nine recommendations for technological interventions are made by the assessment team. Two appendixes provide notable responses from the telephone survey and some results of the data analyses, as well as copies of the survey instruments. (EW)",

Five topics were covered by the survey: (1) degree of organization of computer applications; (2) computer applications staff and staff development; (3) research and development of software for end users; (4) hardware; and (5) software distribution. Responses to the survey indicated that end users expected the universities' extension and research departments to provide them with assistance in hardware and software selection, training in the use of computers, help in interpreting and applying  computer output, and the organization of science and associated technological information into databases for their efficient and timely use. The responses also indicated that the current status of computer application programs was still largely developmental in the five areas studied; three microcomputers, Radio Shack, Apple, and IBM, were most widely used by the institutions; and resource sharing was being promoted among the universities.

Two separate questionnaires, both of which inventoried computer equipment and software and dealt with the instructional and administrative uses of computers, funding, and software inventory, were distributed to all South Carolina public school (K-12) principals and district superintendents. A total of 1,099 school (99.8% response rate) and 92 district (100% response rate) forms were returned. Major district findings indicated that all school district offices had computers; over 43% of the total computers used at district level were Apple microcomputers; and the total change in the number of computers at the district level was 180% in 1985 and 83% in 1986. School  findings indicated that over 98% of the public schools had computers for either instructional or administrative use; over 95% of the schools having at least one computer (1,061) had at least one printer (1,004); over 90% of the schools had a moderate to major need for more software and computers; the rate of change in total number of computers had decreased in the past 2 years from 134% to 61%; and IBM had replaced Radio Shack as the second largest computer supplier to schools. Detailed survey findings are presented in tables, charts, and graphs together with brief descriptions of computer applications in individual schools and school districts. (CGD)",

The argument is made that there is a need for the EEC Commission to play an ongoing, regulatory role in this area. An examination of ways in which education and training might gain access to a satellite distribution system leads to a discussion of low-powered services and direct broadcasting services, including national systems, pan-European satellites, and possibilities for educational services on the ESA (European Space Agency) Olympus satellite, an integrated European-wide DBS (direct broadcasting services) system planned for the near future. The roles of  different types of organizations in getting a satellite service operational are described, including international regulatory agencies, international consortia, governments, satellite owners and operators, channel operators, and program producers. Economic models for education and training on satellites are also described, i.e., the commercial model, the &quot;must carry&quot; model, and state ownership. Discussion of operating models for providing an educational service covers a free-for-all situation and an educational channel, and descriptions of several ways in which an EEC educational channel could operate includes open access for educational producers and a public service channel. It is concluded that there is a need for a consortium to bring educational television providers together, with  the EEC providing baseline funding and a framework in which to encourage the development of an educational satellite channel.

Delivery systems for such courses would include one or more of the following elements: broadcast media, audio teleconferencing, video teleconferencing, electronic blackboard, slow-scan-video, electronic mail or computer teleconferencing, and telefax. Site visits were made to three rural high schools, from which case studies were developed to provide some idea of the current distance education offerings. The following observations were made from a survey of the questionnaire responses: (1) the provision of certain computer courses via telecommunications is seen as a  promising direction by all groups surveyed; (2) there is a consensus among teachers and administrators that the most desirable courses for offering by telecommunications delivery are advanced placement offerings in the math and science areas; and (3) the findings show a certain amount of insecurity on the part of teachers in using telecourses. It is felt that this insecurity can be overcome by use of telecommunications for inservice training and giving teachers direct experience with telecourses. Appendix A provides summaries of the three case studies; Appendix B contains sample questionnaires and accompanying letters; and Appendices C-E present the data from each of the three groups surveyed--teachers, administrators, and students.

A sample of 250 articles was selected from the 1,912 substantive articles identified. Each of 61 research articles selected from the sample was then classified by research methodology, subject areas, statistical methods, and author affiliations. The final analysis and comparison led to the following two conclusions: (1) the core of journals under consideration was expanded in the present study, and therefore suggested possible  differences in quality as well as quantity of the literature studied; and (2) the study was based on a sample, rather than on all the substantive articles published in core journals during a given year, indicating that less confidence could be associated with the findings on research methodologies. Suggestions for future work in this area include the application of multidimensional scaling techniques in determining the subject areas for the articles, and characterization of the articles by institutional setting rather than by subject. Appended materials include a listing of the 61 research articles together with the research methodologies used, subject areas covered, and statistical methods, and 13 tables displaying analyses of the data on the core journals used and on the articles  studied.

        "description":"A survey of library directors and assistant/associate directors at the 19 campuses of California State University (CSU) revealed a number of factors mitigating against the implementation of assessment center programs for the development of academic library managers. Respondents were asked in a questionnaire to describe their attitudes toward assessment centers in terms of: (1) assessment support; (2) number of identifiable potential candidates for assessment centers existing in their own libraries; (3) willingness to serve as an assessor; and (4) definition of job dimensions attributable to a CSU library manager. The data collected from 29 of the 44 questionnaires distributed in January 1987 (66.6% response rate) were analyzed, and it was concluded that philosophic differences in  the administrators' views of professional development for librarians, as well as ambivalences about the value of programs intended to promote such development, are a major factor working against the implementation of an assessment center specifically for librarians. Three tables display the analyses of data on the administrators' attitudes toward assessment centers; job dimensions of library managers as rated by the CSU administrators; and a transcript of some of the respondents' comments.

        "description":"This document summarizes the nine presentations made at an institute on laser disk systems in libraries held at the Library of Congress in May 1987. The first speaker, Linda Helgerson, discussed advances in CD-ROM technology as well as its advantages and disadvantages. Judy McQueen focused primarily on the disadvantages of CD-ROM and urged caution in adopting the new technology. Deborah Bezanson described the implementation and evaluation of patron access to the PsychLit database on CD-ROM in an academic library. Less satisfactory experiences with the use of INFOTRAC by law students and law professionals who had experience with online searching were described by Phil Berwick. Experiences with Books-In-Print Plus (BIP+) were related by Chester Pletzke, who was favorably impressed  by the system but found that listings for publishers were not up-to-date. Charles Worsley discussed applications of CD-ROM in school libraries and outlined plans for implementing CD-ROM in a public school district. The costs of CD-ROM systems and problems in dealing with vendors and consultants were discussed by Charles Robinson. Linda Kosmin observed that most producers have been slow to recognize the market potential of scientific and technical libraries for the right products. The final speaker, Michael Halperin, described the advantages of DATEXT as a source of data on individual companies and industries. A list of exhibitors at the institute concludes the report. (CGD)",

Based on a skills continuum (sequential development of locational, inquiry-investigation, reporting, literature appreciation, and reading guidance skills), the program reflects a curriculum and format match with the Department of Education Essential Learning Skills and the English Language Arts Common Curriculum Goals. The correlation of the three documents has been divided into two specific areas of responsibility: those areas where the library media teacher is the principal instructor (locating information), and those areas where the classroom teacher and library media teacher complement each other in teaching the  skill (understanding and appreciation of literature). The literature appreciation and information skills presented for mastery in this document appear at the third, fifth, eighth, and eleventh grade levels, although they may be introduced earlier, and it is expected that the learner will be able to demonstrate knowledge and application of the skill by the end of the prescribed grade.

        "description":"An evaluation of cooperative collection management among academic libraries participating in the Illinois Collection Analysis Matrix (ICAM) was conducted in March 1987 by the Illinois Association of College and Research Libraries (IACRL) and the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE). Data were gathered from two questionnaires, one of which was sent to the 28 ICAM libraries and the other to 58 ICAM subject specialists. The response rate was 82% for the institutional questionnaire (23 library directors), and 62% for the subject specialist questionnaire (36 subject specialists). Analyses of the data obtained through the questionnaires indicated that, overall, subject specialists and library directors were satisfied with the IACRL/IBHE efforts on cooperative collection  development (CCD), although ratings of the various aspects of the program differed between the two groups. Additional evaluations based on ICAM data and other sources investigated the percentage increase of library collections; bibliographic and physical access provided by the libraries; subject specialists' assessment of values; internal validity of the Existing Strength Collection (ESC) and Current Collection Intensity (CCI) codes used in ICAM; and alternative funding models. Appended materials include copies of the two ICAM questionnaires; a tally of the responses to the institutional questionnaire; a summary of the responses to the subject specialist questionnaire; comparisons of ICAM collection growth among four Illinois university libraries and all ICAM libraries; and a comparison  of research level collections as indicated by ESCs in the 1986 ICAM.

The third objective was added to this survey via the inclusion of evaluative variables to determine whether a correlation existed between the students' overall satisfaction with Walter Library and their use/nonuse of materials and services, activities while in the library, reasons for choosing Walter Library, major areas of study, and grade point averages. A total of 555 students out of the 910 approached (61% response rate) completed questionnaires. Data collected were used to examine six  hypotheses which suggested that overall student library satisfaction, number of visits within the past year, duration of library visits, and use/non-use of each of 10 areas of the library, nine specific library materials, and four specific library services were functions of such variables as user demographic characteristics. Pearson Product Correlation and multiple regression analysis were used to test the correlation, and it was concluded that the previous survey findings were valid. In addition, a demographic profile of the typical student user of the library was compiled through the tabulation of descriptive data. However, the evaluative variables added to this survey were no more conclusive in predicting why students used Walter Library. Five appendixes include the questionnaire,  descriptive statistics, and multiple regression analyses of the data. (CGD)",

A non-random survey of information organizations was made, and the printed materials provided by the organizations were analyzed. Profiles were made of each of the 80 responding organizations that fit the &quot;information enterprise&quot; definition, although the organizations are identified by fictitious names. Information enterprises were then categorized into two major groupings--information management enterprises and information service enterprises--and categorized in sub-groupings within the two major  groupings. A table was developed to summarize the services provided by both types of enterprises, and a model of the information transfer process was developed to relate the information enterprises and their activities to the wider information transfer process. The model is also provided in diagram form, and a 44-item reference list is provided. Six appendixes contain background material, a copy of the letter to organizations requesting information for the study, a list of organizations arranged in categories, and a list of the names and addresses of organizations that participated in the study.

        "description":"ED QUEST (Quick Environmental Scanning Techniques) is a strategic planning process designed to identify emerging trends, issues, and events which portend threats or opportunities for colleges and universities, analyze their probable impact on the institution, and facilitate the development of appropriate institutional strategies. A workshop was held in 1986 to demonstrate the ED QUEST model. Participants were asked to simulate the activities of an ED QUEST planning team of a hypothetical community college and to formulate the strategies that the college could follow over the next five years. The session began with an overview of ED QUEST, focusing on the primary activities of the process: (1) preparing for the process (2) developing a notebook of critical trends and events (3)  defining the nature of the organization in terms of mission, key performance indicators, and strengths and weaknesses; (4) identifying and assessing the impact of critical trends and probable future events; (5) developing and assessing scenarios by analyzing trends and events; (6) selecting strategic options; and (7) incorporating those options into the strategic management process. Participants were provided with a notebook showing future prospects, handouts identifying the unique aspects of the college's mission and programs, a list of key indicators of institutional performance, and a list of institutional strengths and weaknesses. A brainstorming session was conducted to identify the trends and events the participants believed would influence the future of the college, and to vote on  the top 5 critical trends and top 10 influential events. After further refining the list to identify critical trends and high impact/high probability events, the interrelationships between these trends/events were determined and the effects of the trends/events on the college's mission and performance were identified. The last activity was to develop strategic options based on a set of pre-prepared scenarios, and to identify the optimal strategies for inclusion in the college's strategic plan. A 15-item bibliography on strategic planning is included. (EJV)",

Part I provides an overview of Iran's current economic status and manpower needs, the advantages that the development of a community college system would afford the country, the specific educational needs that could be met by a two-year postsecondary educational system, and the measures that would need to be taken to ensure the success of the institutions. Part II examines the components of the proposed community college model, focusing on (1) admissions policy, which would be more flexible than that of the existing colleges and universities in Iran, but more selective than the &quot;open door&quot; institutions in the United States; (2) institutional control and finance,  which would follow a U.S. model of local control and institutional autonomy, but an Iranian model of central government financing; and (3) comprehensive curricula. Part III offers recommendations concerning the programs that should be offered by the institutions, including transfer education, technical-vocational education, agriculture education, teacher training, adult education, general education, remedial education, and guidance and counseling. Concluding comments stress the need to consider the values of the Iranian people, local customs and traditions, patterns of interaction, and indigenous academic traditions in order to implement the community college model in Iran.

In fiscal year (FY) 1987, the total grant allocation to the colleges was $7,566,000. The 38 Illinois community college districts reported a total of 246,739 students who received support services, representing a total of 1,037,768 contact hours of special instruction and support services. Tutoring was the most heavily used support service, followed by testing and evaluation and educational/career counseling. The total number of  contact hours reflects an increase of 55% over the number of contact service hours provided in the previous year, though the total number of students served decreased from 294,954 in FY 1986. Disadvantaged student grants provided 53,967 contact hours of adult basic education, adult secondary education, English as a Second Language, and remedial instruction and support services. Literacy development programs were attended by 10,630 individuals who did not read or who read below the fifth-grade level. Sixteen districts reported having developed support programs especially for minority students, with the major services provided being tutoring and counseling. Salaries and benefits constituted approximately 72% of the total expenditures, with the second highest cost of the grant programs being  in administration. The disadvantaged student grant has become a major source of funding through which colleges provide the special services needed by academically disadvantaged students to succeed in their chosen program of study. Tables providing data by college are appended. (EJV)",

After discussing activities to prepare for and follow-up on guest speakers, the manual offers instructions for community interactive errands, including site visits and team quests; \"human bingo,\" which requires students to obtain the signatures of several individuals fitting a number of descriptions; and idiom searches, which require students to ask three native speakers to explain and illustrate the use of an idiom.

        "description":"Community college students tend to perceive a gap between their current writing ability and the level of writing skill they expect to need as employees in the future. Unfortunately, college composition classes generally do a poor job of capitalizing on the true value of writing to career development, and fail to have students practice the kind of writing which will contribute directly to that development. In light of these curricular deficiencies, composition instructors should take pains to acknowledge to their students that there are good reasons, beyond the need for satisfactory grades in school, to write well. They should also provide students with an opportunity to discover and enjoy some of the benefits of good writing. The \"Future-Perfect Writing\" process addresses both of  these goals. This process involves the following steps: (1) each student identifies a career field in which he/she has a strong personal interest; (2) within the chosen field, the student seeks two job-holders whose positions are similar to ones that the student would like to fill someday; (3) the student negotiates with the two designated community assessors to establish a writing task which approximates a real on-the-job responsibility; (4) when the student has completed the writing task to the satisfaction of the community assessors, the assessors sign a statement confirming that judgment; and (5) each student presents an oral account of his/her experiences and discoveries involved in the \"future-perfect writing\" project. This process reinforces students' understanding of how writing  can be of value in their future careers, and provides individualized writing practice that can contribute to future career success.

        "description":"A perennial challenge for developmental educators is to upgrade students' skills over many years without losing their own sense of professional dedication and momentum. Two instructional techniques that can be of use to developmental educators in meeting this challenge are interactive errands and dialogue journals. These activities enable students to transfer classroom learning into the community; bring students' out-of-class knowledge to bear upon classroom interactions; break down students' academic, cultural, linguistic, and social barriers; and enhance instructors' feelings of self-worth. Interactive errands are assignments which require students to make contact with people outside of class, induce their contacts to perform some predetermined behavior, and analyze the  encounters afterward with instructors and fellow students. Examples of interactive errands are &quot;human bingo,&quot; which requires students to get signatures from people in the community who fit certain requirements; &quot;team quests,&quot; which require students to find information about historic sites; and collecting and analyzing billboards, advertising slogans, and bumper stickers in terms of their cultural significance. Unlike other journals, dialogue journals are shuttled back and forth from student to teacher at regular intervals in a reciprocal process in which both instructor and student share feelings and ideas respectfully, individually, and repeatedly. Students are free to write as much as they please on any topic, knowing that their instructor will respond fully and individually. Both  dialogue journals and interactive errands encourage frequent, genuine communication and are relevant to students' lives outside and inside the classroom. (Author/EJV)",

        "author":["Kessler, Ronald P."],
        "description":"In 1986, a study was conducted by the Rancho Santiago Community College District (RSCCD) to evaluate the relationship between reading placement scores and classroom performance. The study sample consisted of students from fall 1985, spring 1986, and fall 1986 who had been tested using the College Board Assessment and Placement Test upon registering. An analysis of the relationship between course grades, the percentage of students who were successful, and placement scores indicated that there was only a modest relationship between placement scores and grades and that a fair number of students who had reading scores below the 25th percentile were successful (grade of &quot;C&quot; or better) in transfer-level courses. These findings suggested that placement scores were not a reliable  predictor of classroom success for many courses and challenged the predictive-validity of such measures. A second part of the study utilized a series of discriminant analyses to determine the ability of reading scores to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful students in transfer-level courses. The results showed that only 46% to 79% of the students could be correctly classified on the basis of reading placement scores alone. Based on study findings, it was concluded that the use of cut-off scores was inappropriate since many students who would have been predicted to fail actually earned a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better. An appendix contains a series of tables of individual courses sampled with Spearman correlations and grade distributions. (Author/UCM)",

Programs that need improvement or should be eliminated can be identified, and fiscal accountability can be achieved. Program reviews generally have qualitative and quantitative components. The quantitative component utilizes the types of numerical data that are collected and reported to state agencies (e.g., student enrollment, weekly student contact hours, percentage of students completing the program, numbers of degrees granted, and numbers of students transferring to four-year institutions). In gathering qualitative data,  students, faculty, advisory committee members and other members of the college community who have knowledge of or experience with a program are asked to share their perceptions and judgments. Quantitative and qualitative components are integrated into an institution's overall plan for program review in various ways, ranging from heavily qualitative to heavily quantitative. Three program review models representing different places on this continuum are Michigan's Program Review in Occupational Education, which is highly qualitative; the statewide program review process used by the Maryland comunity college system which stands on the quantitative side of the continuum; and Pasadena City College's and Foothill College's highly quantitative review models.

        "description":"A study was conducted to investigate the probability of transfer from a two-year college to a four-year college for a random sample of 2,500 students who attended a community college within 2 years of high school graduation in 1980. Nationally representative longtitudinal data from the High School and Beyond study established the characteristics of the 1980 high school graduates, and grouped them by their primary activity within 2 years after high school. On background characteristics, high school behaviors, and achievements, community college students fell about midway between those who went to four-year colleges and those who did not go to college at all. The sample of community college students was divided in two groups: those who transferred to a four-year college (24.3%) and  those who did not. Causal models were then used to obtain estimates of the effects of family and student background, high school and college behaviors, and outcomes on the probability of transferring to a four-year college. College behaviors (e.g., grade point average, completed courses in mathematics and science, and employment record) were found to have the strongest direct effects, although other factors, including social class, placement in the academic track, application to college while still in high school, and good grades and high standardized scores exerted important indirect effects on transferring.

When the program's curriculum units were translated from the French, a revised version of the Agam Program was developed which involved no major changes in program content. Program implementation, begun in December 1983, was continued during the 1983-85 school years at four preschools, and expanded to include implementation in a first grade class twice a week. During the year, teachers were trained and a video film presenting an overview of the program was produced for use in future teacher training sessions. Program implementation was evaluated by several means, including teacher questionnaires for each learning activity,  discussions at periodical review meetings, teacher interviews, and classroom observations. Findings suggest that the program is suitable for 4- and 5-year-old children and for first graders, and that a considerable amount of teacher training is necessary for effective classroom implementation. Also reported are findings of two investigations of the Agam Program's cognitive outcomes, including effects on intelligence, creativity, and the visual skills of identification, memorization, and reproduction. Affective outcomes and other effects of the program are reported. Related materials, which are written mainly in Hebrew, are provided in the appendices, and include a questionnaire for the preschool teacher, a set of visual skills tests, the first year summary test, and a summary of cognitive  research instruments.

        "description":"To investigate the ability of young children to perceive the feelings of others, 44 preschool children with a mean age of approximately 3 years, 8 months were shown 12 vignettes in which a puppeteer emitting facial and vocal cues twice contrasted all possible pairs of happy, sad, angry, and afraid emotions. Mothers completed a questionniare containing narratives of all 12 vignettes and indicated the affective behavior that they thought their child would express in the depicted situations. In the performance of vignettes, a puppet of the same sex as the subject represented the emotion that differed from the emotion mothers had indicated their child would have. Children were asked: &quot;How does the puppet feel?&quot; To answer, children selected one of two cloth faces representing  differing emotions and affixed it to the puppet. It was hypothesized that subjects would show a greater than chance ability to use personalized information about the puppet, rather than relying on their own experience, and it was expected that such ability would be age-related. In addition, personalized information was expected to be more readily used by preschoolers when the puppet's and their own emotions differed along positive or negative dimensions, and when certain pairs of emotions were contrasted. Findings supported each of these hypotheses. (RH)",

This volume, the first of two, presents survey findings and a comparison of programs and transition grantees. Respondents included, for each program, the Head Start director, the principal of a randomly selected correspondent elementary school, a kindergarten teacher in that school, and parents of two children in that teacher's class who had formerly attended Head Start. In addition, for  grantee programs, personnel surveyed included Head Start component coordinators, a Head Start teacher, and, for each program, a school district official. Project proposals were used to develop descriptions of each transition program. Findings indicated that Head Start programs with transition grants were more likely to conduct transition activities with schools than were programs without grants. Furthermore, grantees were more likely to transfer records and to involve school teachers and principals in transition activities. Grantee school teachers were more likely to talk with parents. Parents involved in grantee and other surveyed programs were very similar in their participation in transition activities and concerns.

The evaluation was designed to obtain data on project implementation, successes, and obstacles. Ten grantee programs, which varied in geographic location, were surveyed by mail or through personal interviews; five which varied in program approach, geographic distribution, and auspices were selected for site visits. Respondents at the 14 cooperating sites included Head Start directors, program component coordinators, Head Start teachers, school district officials, school principals, school teachers, and former Head Start parents  whose children were currently in kindergarten. Project proposals, which were used to develop descriptions of the transition programs, depicted transition activities unique to each project. Section 1 of the report provides the narrative descriptions of the 15 original programs (one site did not respond). Section 2 provides a quantitative analysis of the data that focuses on activities commonly conducted by grantees. Many programs cited the striking discontinuity that exists between Head Start and elementary school approaches to early childhood education. To deal with such discontinuity, the transition grantees developed a variety of activities, agreements, and approaches. Thirty tables are provided. (RH)",

The couples apply the learned procedures consistently, and under supervision, while they also provide good care and parenting. Though superficially similar to foster care, foster-family-based treatment exists for the purpose of providing treatment, and not just food, clothing, and protection. Ten aspects differentiate the two types of services. A recent development, foster-family-based treatment does not fit neatly into any existing discipline, such as social work, special education, or psychology. Its intrinsic advantages include minimal restrictiveness and maximal generality  with regard to the behaviors and situations it can address. Experience with the treatment indicates that foster-family-based treatment can also be intensive, in that it uses several powerful treatment technologies that converge to yield major changes in very significant behaviors.

Fathers were videotaped in feeding interactions with infants at hospital discharge and at 1 month of age. During two 1.5 hour training sessions, the Information and Insights about Infants (III) program attempted to sensitize fathers to fetal and early infants' characteristics and behaviors; the need for early and responsive attunement to infant state and signals of distress; and ways to modulate distress. Soothing techniques were modeled with a doll. Intrauterine bonding was encouraged through  specific skin contact with the pregnant partner. Difficulties in recruitment were caused by fathers' lack of commitment to partner or infant, suspicion of a project about babies, drug and alcohol abuse, illiteracy, or personality problems. At maternity clinics, pregnant women were enlisted to encourage their partners to participate. Transportation to the clinic and oral presentation of questions helped ensure father participation. Early identification of fathers, skill and persistence of the intervenor, and continuity of caring were identified as prognosticators of success in reaching fathers-to-be. (RH)",

The report presents highlights and records comments from four public meetings and from a survey of people who had read an executive summary prepared earlier by the council. The information is arranged in the form of answers to the following questions: (1) What is the appropriate role of state government in supporting families and children? (2) What methods might be used to ensure that all children receive adequate health care? (3) What should be the roles of government, business, and the voluntary  sector in helping families to secure adequate child care? (4) Who should provide education for parenting--and are schools responsible? and (5) How can government exercise a protective function for children in dysfunctional families and still respect the rights of all persons involved? The summaries and comments are followed by three appendixes: (1) Governor Perpich's executive order, which established the Council on Families and Children; (2) the text of the council's 1984 executive summary on the status of Minnesota's families and children; and (3) information on the survey, \"We Need To Know,\" which elicited many of the comments in the body of the report.

        "description":"Research indicates that families that adopt have many problems that would have existed even if the adopted child had been a biological member of the family, but that become more complex and intense due to adoption. A psychosocial and psychodynamic perspective toward family life suggests that in the adoption process, child and family pass through predictable phases that coincide with family and individual development. These phases are: (1) pre-awareness of the adoptive status; (2) dim awareness of a special state; (3) cognitive integration of biological and social differences; (4) personal and identity crisis of the adopted adolescent; and (5) concomitant acceptance of the biological and adoptive family. Compared to younger adoptees, those who are older pass through a similar set  of phases, but move through the first two more rapidly because of their broader intellectual capacities, and through the last two more slowly because of their greater difficulty in bonding. Identification of these phases helps focus primary and secondary preventive therapy for adoptees and families experiencing typical adjustment difficulties and also helps target families in unusual stress. The body of this paper discusses the phases in detail, and then delineates signs of serious disturbances in adjustment to adoptions. A final section provides guidelines for conducting phase-relevant therapy with this population. (RH)",

Data were obtained from three self-administered questionnaires concerning the priority and importance that members attached to broad family goals, the quality of family relationships, and sources of social support for parenting and family management. The most important goal domain for families was having strong, positive relationships among all family members. Single and married mothers  did not differ significantly in how satisfied they were with their relationships with their children. Fathers were less satisfied than mothers. Single and married mothers differed in influences on their judgment about relationships. The greatest differences between one- and two-parent families were in the area of social support. Grandparents' involvement in one-parent families positively influenced mother-child relationships. Frequency of contact between married mothers and grandparents was negatively correlated with satisfactory mother-child relationships. The few fathers who discussed parenting issues with a close friend had more satisfying relationships with their children. Copies of 10 slides are attached. (RH)",

Findings challenge prevailing assumptions that characterize black fathers as uninvolved with their offspring and unwilling to make material contributions to support them. The 32 men interviewed were employed fathers in 2-parent families that were involved in a study of black infants' social development. Fathers were questioned about their motives and satisfactions in holding a paternal role, frustrations as fathers, and supports and barriers to enacting their roles. Descriptive analyses revealed that being a father was a core motive and organizing principle for participants' life-styles. Being a model to their infants and a guiding force in their  children's lives were primary objectives for fathers. Family life experiences and family relationships were primary satisfactions associated with being a father. Fathers' jobs and incomes were second only to their relationships with their wives as critical supports in fathers' efforts to meet their standards of fathering. Findings are discussed as strong evidence of contemporary black fathers' commitment to their children's emotional and physical welfare and their eager participation in family life experiences. (RH)",

Discipline must be used in the context of a warm, caring relationship, with the realization that it takes time for young children to absorb and understand what is being taught. In addition, appropriate discipline depends on an understanding of developmental stages which allows one to decide which situations require discipline. Many potential disciplinary problems can be prevented by carefully planning the child's environment, being clear and consistent about rules, noticing children's needs and differences, keeping promises, and refocusing children who are engaged in inappropriate behavior. When behavior becomes a problem, there are a number of techniques which can be used with  infants and toddlers: (1) change the environment; (2) offer choices; (3) use the \"hold and talk\" technique for tantrums; (4) remind about rules; (5) model good behavior; (6) offer alternative means for expressing aggressive behavior; (7) appreciate and encourage socialized behaviors, even if they are only beginnings; (8) firmly share concerns about hurting others; (9) help children see connections between what they do and how it affects other children; (10) help children to see the connection between their misbehavior and deprivation of their play situation when time-out is used; (11) give children words to express strong emotions; and (12) show affection and try to see humor in the situation.

        "description":"Visual processing of televised information was compared among 85 Japanese and 111 American boys and girls at the kindergarten and 4th-grade levels. The literatures on cognition and learning indicate that language and child rearing factors are more conducive to the development of iconic processing skills in Japanese children than in American children, a phenomenon which increases with age. The reverse pattern is found for verbal processing skills. It was predicted that after viewing a television program without narration or dialogue, Japanese children's amount and concentration of visual attention and comprehension would be higher than that of American children, particularly at the 4th-grade level. Results confirmed the predictions for visual attention, suggesting that different  television processing strategies were employed. Contrary to the predictions, American children scored higher than Japanese children on the comprehension test, perhaps because of the cultural differences in expectations about the testing procedure. The results are discussed in the context of processing differences. Alternative explanations for the findings are explored, and directions for future research are suggested. Appended are seven pages of references, seven tables and two figures. (Author/RH)",

        "author":["Bentley, Prudence A."],
        "description":"This document, the first in a four-part series, presents a synopsis of a Geneva research report delivered at Cornell University (New York). It describes a study in which 10-month-old infants were given intermittent free-play opportunities to manipulate 18 objects. Regularly presented in disarray were 6 balls, 6 sticks, and 6 open cubes; each set was graduated in size. Repeated viewings of videotaped behaviors revealed a consistent pattern and succession of organizing practices which were implemented spontaneously and universally over the course of 14 months. Also spontaneous and universal was the abrupt cessation of the organizing behaviors following a final, perfect, continuous review of all the organizing patterns which had previously been practiced. It is argued that the  contrived setup used in the study, which regularly presented the same three sets of objects in disarray, stimulated the children's curiosity and motivated the acts of initiative which occurred. Properties of the objects and the disarray induced purposeful explorations, enhanced and sustained constructive interest, and prompted the repetitive displays of relation among the objects. It is thought that the abrupt cessation of the organizing practices marked the time when the relations were no longer held in question by the young children, but rather were known by them (i.e., internalized as schemes). The internalization accounts for the reappearance of the practiced schemes later when the children were faced with new problems. (RH)",

        "description":"Over a 14-month period, infants who were initially 10 months old were intermittently allowed to play with three sets of graduated objects presented in disarray. All of the infants acquired the ability to completely organize the materials. The infants exhibited patterned behavior in their organizing practices when they individualized objects by handling them one after another, filled and emptied containers one by one, nested the objects, established object identity patterns, and exhaustively imitated these patterns. The paper explores inferences from the infants' organizing procedures which can be applied to the task of communicating the place value concept, base ten, to preschool and elementary school children. Two questions are raised and answered: (1) In the learning  environment staged for the infants, what principles functioned to guide their focal attention? and (2) What mechanisms caused change and continuity in the infants' behavior? It is asserted that continuous direct imitation of initially established identity patterns inevitably led to the infants' displays of organization; interruption was the causal mechanism of change; imitation the causal mechanism of continuity. Discussion specifies six rules of practice used by all the infants in organizing the materials and suggests requirements for an instructional plan for teaching the place value notation concept to children. The plan is similar to the research design of the study of infants. (RH)",

The activities are entitled: (1) The Cup Game; (2) The Ten-Count Game; (3) Number Towers; and (4) The Flip-card Counter, Base Ten. Each construction is designed to display and confirm particular components of the place value notation  concept, base ten, as it is used when children exercise initiative and control in performing patterned interactions with the materials provided. Guidelines for teachers implementing the games in classrooms are provided in the discussion.

        "description":"The objective of this paper is to explain the need for and defend the sufficiency of the child's-play method of teaching the place value notation concept to preschool and elementary school children. Discussion first illustrates error patterns of school children in the use and interpretation of place value notation, arguing that the errors reflect counting principles learned in preschool and that such errors are the natural consequence of children's assimilation of information concerning digit symbols into their cognitive structures. Subsequent discussion suggests that future research will show that the inadequacy of the preschool principles is a major, if not the root, cause of mathematics anxiety in children, and that the harmonious integration of the preschool counting  principles with number representation rules will lessen, perhaps eliminate, math anxiety. Discussion then explores the problem of integrating the rule systems, focusing on cognitive conflict and the task of instruction. The extensive concluding section presents five arguments supporting the child's-play method; these center on: (1) the simplicity of the method and the need for that simplicity; (2) the completeness of the concrete demonstrations and the sufficiency of the confirmations afforded by them; (3) the method's connection to a proven model; (4) evidence of the method's value from preliminary findings; and (5) minimal cost of the materials.

This study examines standards of deportment held by parents and classroom teachers, and evaluates in particular whether similarity of behavior standards in the two settings promotes positive school adjustment as indexed by end-of-year test scores and report card marks. These ideas are examined with data from the Beginning School Study, in which a panel of 825 beginning first grade students attending Baltimore City schools in  the fall of 1982 were interviewed. Teachers' deportment standards are found to exercise strong influence on year-end performance, but parents' standards are found to be largely ineffectual.

Word processing packages are especially useful with beginning writers, whose lack of motor coordination often slows down their acquisition of competence in written communication. Software developed for beginning writers can: (1) provide learners with visual, motor, and even auditory support; (2) encourage learners to write more by minimizing mechanical drudgery; (3) encourage writers to focus on content rather than form; (4) increase the likelihood of revision; (5) provide learners with letter-quality output, which encourages sharing of writing; (6) promote social interaction, by making writing visible to  passersby; (7) make writing appealing for special needs children; and (8) encourage positive attitudes toward learning. Researchers believe that while the graphics-oriented programing language LOGO does not teach the planning skills necessary for programing, it can help young learners by: developing problem-solving abilities; facilitating learning of mathematical concepts; and encouraging collaboration, social development, creativity, spatial relation development, and overall cognitive development--especially in special needs children. Teachers who understand both the power and limitations of these programs for children make the most effective use of both LOGO and word processing software. (SKC)",

The class size/achievement model shows the results of a meta-analysis of research on class size which indicated that as class size decreases, achievement increases. The PRIMETIME project reduced the student/teacher ratio in first grade classrooms to 14:1. The current study examined 10 sets of data collected from over 2000 first-grade classrooms. Only 3 of the 10 studies examined reported a positive relationship between decreased class size and increased achievement scores. The conclusion of this study is that reduced class size is necessary, but not sufficient, to increase achievement scores. The role of  teaching methods in small classes as a factor in increasing test scores is discussed, as are other contributing variables which may have affected achievement scores. It is recommended that PRIMETIME be continued, but that teaching methods and materials in smaller classes also be changed to increase achievement. (PCB)",

Eighty-six usable responses yielded data on age and sex of respondents, sources of financial assistance, professional positions, country of origin, degrees held, satisfaction with programs, courses taken, perceptions of program goals, and desired changes in curriculum. While students were generally pleased with their formal graduate programs, some voids existed, and 93% of the respondents showed interest in attending the International Training  Program. It was concluded that these students could be prime participants in the program, and potential students for a summer program. Recommendations included: a good informational program should be instituted to provide students with timely course/enrollment information for the Farm School; efforts should be made to encourage countries to sponsor their students in the school's summer short course; and the American Farm School and United States international graduate programs should alter their curricula to address more practical concerns, such as rural development activities.

In November 1986, 25 representatives from academia, farming ranching, commodity groups, agricultural organizations, and agribusiness met with Soil Conservation Service (SCS) personnel to discuss and respond to the issues raised in a draft version of this paper. Their reactions and recommendations have been incorporated into the paper. Four broad concerns are identified: the changing structure of agriculture, the changing structure of rural communities, changing agricultural policies, and  technological changes, as well as others changes in the agricultural environment (such as financial changes). Discussion within concerns touches on changes in farm ownership, increased off-farm employment, emerging conservation coalitions, changing patterns of communication, new legislative initiatives, biotechnology, information and equipment technologies, international factors, etc. Implications conclude each large section. Issues raised in this paper will set the stage for providing modifications, changes, and additions to the program initiatives of the SCS National Conservation Program that has provided priorities for United States Department of Agriculture activities since 1982.

Six certified counselors were hired to provide supplemental counseling. All counselors were supervised by the District Coordinator of Indian Education. Supplemental counseling helped students accomplish specific competencies. Four problem-solving programs were developed to help students in the areas of drugs and alcoholism, personal and social problems, leadership, and parental  involvement. A directory of resources was compiled listing agencies for referral. Students were provided support services for obtaining school supplies and participating in school activities. Parents were informed about the program activities and services through a series of six newsletters. Program achievement was evaluated in terms of seven objectives.

This study builds such a typology for 166 counties in the northeastern United States and examines the effects of variables taken from a series of popular hypotheses regarding local fiscal stress. Findings show that the category with the largest effect on local fiscal stress is per capita expenditures for highways. Other causal factors include: high local demand for services (e.g. education, welfare); location (rural localities suffer from more local fiscal stress than metropolitan localities); high local needs (e.g. unemployment and crowded housing); and high centralization of formal  political influence and authority. However, local fiscal stress is comparatively lower in manufacturing localities, and state intergovernmental revenue transfers to localities generally reduce inequalities in fiscal stress. Suggested policy implications to enhance distributive justice regarding local fiscal stress are that states should transfer more funds to highly stressed localities particularly for highways, but also for schooling and welfare. In addition, localities should try to create more accountability in their local budgeting process rather than to concentrate power in the hands of their elected officials. (JMM)",

A representative sample of public school students (n=175) was interviewed on 12 concept principles considered critical to a full understanding of the acidic deposition problem. These included geological, meteorological, ecological, political, and economic concepts. Student knowledge was rated for each concept principle on a scale of complete, high partial, low partial, or no understanding. Common misconceptions were also noted. Generalized correct concept statements of current student knowledge was reported as well as generalized missing concepts. The results suggest some implications for teaching about acidic  deposition and the design of environmental education curriculum materials based upon student knowledge. Ways that can help teachers better teach students about current environmental problems and thus help learners gain an appreciation for the complex and multidisciplinary nature of science and the environment are discussed.

About 65% could classify liquids correctly, 50% could classify rigid materials correctly, 30% related non-rigid materials to the group of solids, and only about 20% classified powders in the group of solids. The majority did not use a consistant and systematic set of criteria to classify all the materials. In addition, they tended to change their criteria during the course of classification. They used such criteria as color, weight, function, usage, and spatial relatedness. (TW)",

This document reviews the literature dealing with metacognition in mathematics and science education.

The lessons were varied according to the degree of complexity of the examples that were presented. Students then were tested over their understanding of the concepts. The test questions ranged from straightforward application of the lesson material to multi-step problems with high computational complexity. Significant main effects were found due to level of test question complexity, level of lesson complexity, and student ability level. Significant interactions also were identified. These results are discussed in terms of planning and presenting lessons in mathematics. (Author/PK)",

        "description":"This paper posits a cognitive model for understanding and learning physics that is an alternative to the formal deductive system. Recent findings of Fuller, Karplus, Lawson, and others are cited in arguing against using a formal deductive approach to teaching physics. The model demonstrates types of action-oriented knowledge structures as they actually exist and operate in a person, including practical knowledge, qualitative physical models, concrete mathematical models and written symbol manipulation. A major aspect of the theory is that the ability to link together structures from these different domains is crucial to understanding a topic in physics. Each of these structures is defined and examples of student learning are given to support the theory. It is stated that some  links are simple associations learned by rote while others are formed when one domain assimilates and interprets a structure from another domain. Finally, the paper provides a list of five pedagogical implications derived from this theory that provide a framework for discussing some interesting pedagogical problems. (CW)",

In such situations, children aged 6 to 7 concentrate on the states, combining them in different ways. The present research aims to illustrate that difficulties and strategies observed with children 6-7 years old are not specific to this age level, but are also encountered by children up to age 12 and probably older. Numerous situations of reconstruction, ranging from easy to more complex, were prepared relying on criteria defined in a reference framework elaborated in the light of past research on problem solving. These items were presented to primary school children at all levels. Results reveal that the same errors reappear constantly, bringing to light important obstacles that interfere  with the construction of a very fundamental concept in mathematics and sciences, that of transformation.

        "description":"Achievement attributions of adolescent females in the masculine domain of mathematics were investigated in relation to self-schemas for gender, expectancy of success, and mathematics achievement. The most important findings revealed by multiple regression analysis were that mathematics achievement and the self-schema for masculinity predicted expectancy of success. Expectancy of success, the self-schema for masculinity, and mathematics achievement predicted the attribution of success to ability. Expectancy of success predicted the attribution of failure to lack of ability, and expectancy of success and the self-schema for androgyny predicted the attribution of failure to task difficulty. Results are discussed in terms of both Deaux's model of attribution behavior and the  importance of the schematic structure of the individual in relation to expectancy of success and attribution.

        "description":"Use of a computer programming language in problem-solving activities provides an opportunity to examine how young children use a restricted set of language primitives. The generation, and execution of computer instructions was used as a verification stage in the problem-solution process. The metric is intended to provide a descriptive classification, and thus allow simple comparisons of productions. Procedures are assigned a cumulative score for: (1) lines of code in the procedure; (2) unique Logo operators; (3) arithmetic operators; and (4) correct procedure definition. When appropriate, points are subtracted for failure to use either primitive operators that simplify structure or arithmetic operators that reduce procedure length. The data were collected during twenty 1.5-hour  weekly sessions. Twelve children (age 7 years 8 months) participated as volunteers. The children were selected unsystematically from a larger group who had participated in a &quot;writing workshop&quot; program, where each child had at least six hours of use of a word processor. Scores were derived for all procedures generated in the workshop. The relation between these scores and other measures of performance, specifically, with a Piagetian measure of horizontal/vertical coordination are discussed. In addition, documentation of methodology and the support materials are presented. (Author/PK)",

If pupils are unable to answer a question, one would expect that the wrong choices have equal chances of being selected. In many multiple choice items on stoichiometric calculation which have been studied over recent years, pupils were attracted to one or two wrong answers more than to the others. It is apparent that they have reached a wrong result by using a wrong answering strategy. The aim of this study was to develop new multiple choice test items involving stoichiometry in such a way that the correct and the two false answering strategies would lead to different results, to create items that include only number  ratios which allow quick mental calculations and to determine whether on the new items pupils actually adopt false answering strategies. The strategy for developing questions and answer choices is discussed in detail. Instruments were administered to pupils in grades 11 and 12. This study concludes that when developing a test for classroom or research, items should include false and correct strategy application in the same proportion. (CW)",

One instructional sequence that was used dealt first with monohybrid autosomal inheritance patterns, then sex-linkage. The alternate sequence was the reverse. Instruction was individually delivered via microcomputer tutorials to 41 engineering and science majors enrolled in a Purdue University introductory biology course. Computer delivered instruction was chosen to control for teacher effects. In terms of achievement the average score of the subjects who received integrated instruction was significantly higher than that of those who received the non-integrated instruction. Also, the groups which  received integrated presentations scored significantly higher on two novel genetics problems that required a meaningful understanding of the role of meiosis in genetic inheritance.

The purpose of the project was to address the biology instruction provided to the students while at the same time providing examples of appropriate uses of computers in instruction, applicable to elementary teaching, and involving the students in the use of computer-based science teaching materials. Groups completing supplemental computer-based activities were compared to non-computer groups on regular class measures of achievement and on measures of attitudes towards computers, biology, and the supplemental activities. There were few apparent achievement differences between the computer and non-computer groups. However,  there were instances where students gave more favorable evaluation to the computer-based activities, and students showed significantly more positive attitudes towards computers as a result of the project. The findings suggest that the integration of computer-based instruction in preservice elementary teachers' science coursework may be an effective means of incorporating computer education in preservice teacher education.

The study was a naturalistic one, conducted over a number of years, at all grade levels, in one all-boys secondary school in Australia. In particular it was concerned with identifying and representing students' existing conceptions, and investigating aspects of the process of conceptual change in classroom learning. A restructuring of teaching approach preceded the investigations of conceptual change. Alternative conceptions were found to be common and complex. Subsequent conceptual change was often, but not universally, achieved. At the level of individual students, this change was idiosyncratic, complex, and often unpredictable.  Some change resulted in more sophisticated alternative conceptions. Students were also found to have naive views of learning, and perceptions of the content of physics and how it should be learned which would hinder their learning. (Author/TW)",

The objectives of this investigation were to develop a method for scoring the Level of Abstraction (LOA) of science reading material, and explore its relationship with certain other known methods for assessing curriculum materials (passage readability level, student cloze score, and teacher prediction of students' level of comprehension). Also examined were relationships between students' cloze scores and passage readability levels. The study was based upon nine passages taken from life, earth, and physical science textbooks written at three different levels. Non-significant correlations were found between: (1) passage LOA and passage readability; (2)  student cloze scores and passage LOA; (3) passage LOA and teacher prediction of student success; and (4) student cloze scores and passage readability level. However, the consistent and high, but non-significant correlations between LOA and cloze scores combined with the fact that the LOA is based upon deep structure rather than surface structure of written material indicate the importance of further investigation of the LOA in its relationship to student comprehension of written material.

This study investigated a group of grade eight and nine students' knowledge of personal health and physical fitness concepts and its relation to locus of control. A 20 item true-false knowledge questionnaire with opportunities for students to explain their choice indicated that while students scored relatively well on the items the explanations of their responses frequently indicated erroneous reasoning based on preconceptions or misconceptions. Students' locus of control was measured using two instruments for health and fitness respectively and showed that this sample had a higher  expectation of control by themselves for their fitness compared to their health. Correlation data between knowledge and locus of control scores indicated that students who possessed high knowledge scores had a tendency not to believe in chance for their personal health and physical fitness. Conversely students who possessed low knowledge scores had more of a tendency to believe in chance for their personal health and physical fitness. The study comments on the success of the health education curriculum and offers suggestions for further research. (Author)",

The purpose of this research was to illuminate and justify options for in-service teacher education programs to enrich the quality and quantity of science instruction in the elementary grades. The study indicated that an effective in-service program would require that both the instructional and administrative skills needed for reform be developed simultaneously within the existing structure of educational leadership.  Further consideration indicated that such an objective should be readily attainable through joint training of teams of elementary teachers, principals, and supervisors of instruction.

Many people are wondering about the best way for teachers to foster the growth of reasoning skills in their classrooms. This study attempts to improve the teaching of reasoning by investigating teaching behaviors or characteristics that might be related to the teachers' reasoning ability. Since there are many science teacher variables that could be related to reasoning ability, a sequential approach was adopted to investigate the problem. Researchers first investigated the degree of clarity of concrete and formal reasoning teachers exhibited in their classroom teaching, their attitudes toward science, and their beliefs about science teaching. Next, researchers  replicated their initial findings and investigated other possibilities. The subjects chosen for the study were preservice elementary school teachers. The subjects were in their last quarter of methods instruction before student teaching and were divided into two groups (30 students in the first group, 31 in the second). The critical assessment for this study was formal reasoning ability. The results showed few consistent differences between teachers classified as formal reasoners and those classified as concrete. There was no relationship between reasoning ability and belief in structured science teaching or laboratory oriented science, degree of clarity in the student teaching setting, or learning style. Some speculations about the nature of preservice teachers were advanced.  (CW)",

        "description":"Density is the first intensive physical quantity students encounter that can be understood in terms of an underlying model, the particulate theory of matter. Learning about density provides students with explanations for a range of phenomena such as sinking and floating, and changes of state. Teachers report, however, that density is a difficult concept for students to grasp. Researchers conducted pilot studies to determine whether students can understand a visual analog of density presented in computer graphics more easily than they can understand the concept of density inferred from manipulation of real world materials. Second-, fourth-, and sixth-grade students received two sets of parallel tasks: one involved manipulation or real materials and the other involved shapes  presented in a computer display. Findings indicate that experience with computer models can help students to think about the difference between steel and aluminum cylinders as an intensive one--that is, stemming from the kind, not the amount of the material. Younger children, however, need help to see the computer analog as a &quot;model&quot; of density. (CW)",

        "description":"Two classroom studies, one conducted in the spring of 1985 and the second in the spring of 1986, showed that many high school students do not differentiate between heat and temperature; instead, they have a single concept that contains some of the features of heat and some of the features of temperature. Because the distinction between these two phenomena is essential to an understanding of other thermal phenomena in both physical and biological systems, researchers developed Microcomputer-Based Laboratories (MBL) to facilitate students' differentiation of heat and temperature. Lessons focusing on the quantitative relationships between the amount of heat, mass and temperature change, heat storage capacity, cooling curves, and latent heat were developed in two formats,  computer-based and traditional. In the computer-based lessons, students use the computer as a laboratory tool to record heat and temperature data and to display them as graphs and tables. Results indicate that the MBL can help students understand more clearly the quantification of heat and distinguish between heat and temperature. The MBL allows students to collect data more quickly and with greater precision, and it frees them from performing calculations and drawing graphs. Students need plenty of time to experiment with and discuss thermal phenomena. Lesson plans are included for the topics of: (1) heat and temperature; (2) heat storage capacity; and (3) latent heat. Eighteen tables analyze the results of interviews and tests. Tests and interviews from both the 1985 and 1986 studies  are presented in 17 appendices. (CW)",

        "description":"Teacher isolation is a significant problem in the science teaching profession. Traditional inservice solutions are often plagued by logistical difficulties or occur too infrequently to build ongoing teacher networks. Educational Technology Center (ETC) researchers reasoned that computer-based conferencing might promote collegial exchange among science teachers by giving them a new way to communicate with each other--individually or in groups, from their own workplaces and homes, at whatever time suits them. Using &quot;Common Ground&quot; conferencing software created at ETC, these researchers established an electronic network and conducted two initial studies of its operation. Researchers studied both technical and substantive aspects of the network's operation. Initial feedback from  teachers was quite positive, and data on their usage patterns yield several findings: (1) some participants need support and encouragement in the initial stages of learning to use a conferencing system; (2) some participants encountered snags in setting up their own equipment or using their communications software; (3) access to equipment remains a problem for some school people; (4) inexperienced participants tend to send more private than public messages; and (5) forum moderators and/or a network coordinator can play an important role in stimulating and sustaining substantive discussions. Half of the document consists of appendices. They include magaine articles, case studies of teachers' use and evaluation of the network, sample telephone interviews, and sample network messages.

        "description":"Because density is unobservable and must be inferred from knowledge about weight and size, it is a difficult concept to teach and learn. Even after traditional instruction, many students still have an undifferentiated concept that mixes characteristics of both weight and density. In this study, researchers tested the effectiveness of a unit they created to help students make this difficult conceptual differentiation, which is crucial to understanding the particulate nature of matter. The Educational Technology Center's Weight/Density Unit uses both computer simulations and classroom activities with real materials of different weights, sizes, and densities. The simulations attempt to make density more visually accessible than it is with real objects. Researchers used the unit in  one sixth-grade and one seventh-grade class. The findings suggest that providing conceptual change is both difficult and possible, and they further suggest that computer models, used in combination with hands-on materials can help students to understand an abstract and perceptually inaccessible concept such as density. Evidence from the pre- and posttest and the clinical interviews suggests that the teaching intervention brought about two kinds of change: (1) conceptual differentiation among students who initially made none; and (2) conceptual consolidation in which students who already had a beginning, fragile distinction deepened and extended their understanding. Appendixes make up the bulk of the volume. They include samples of the assessment instruments; teaching materials for three  units, with worksheets; and a discussion of the computer programs. (CW)",

This project explores why this should be and whether there are some simpler, more accessible notions which can serve as the basis for building a concept of density in students' minds during the later elementary school years. The study explores the effectiveness of using computer models to help students build an understanding of density. This teaching strategy proved to be moderately successful with sixth graders. It was found that the majority of students did correctly assimilate this model in a way that supported their understanding of density as an intensive quantity and that they were able to articulate some relevant  differences between weight and density. It was found that this distinction was necessary for children to have success at ordering by relative densities and in understanding a phenomenon such as sinking and floating.

The Videodisc Project Group, a subsection of Educational Technology Center's New Technologies Group, is: (1) conducting research on the educational effectiveness of videodiscs for teaching science; and (2) studying the process of videodisc creation by designing, producing, and evaluating an interactive videodisc. This document is designed to provide a status report on the research. The research videodisc, designed for use with middle school students, presents science subject matter in a manner that both illustrates and elicits the application of  scientific modes of inquiry. It utilizes existing science television programs from the WGBH Educational Foundation and the Children's Television Workshop and will be produced using the authoring system Authority (TM), developed by Interactive Training Systems, Inc. The process of creating the research videodisc revealed design opportunities and constraints for retrofitting videodiscs. Because of the unchangeable nature of existing visuals, retrofitting is a difficult method for creating educational videodiscs in which content and instructional variety are important. (Author/CW)",

Major changes in management systems have occurred during the 1980s and are reflected in the bank's assistance in: (1) analytical support of policy implementation; (2) mobilization and coordination of external resources; and (3) lending and institutional support. Financial support is the most visible and tangible aspect of the World Bank's assistance, and this document describes how it is provided and how time frames and staff costs are measured. Key stages in the bank's lending cycle include: (1) identification of a country's specific investment proposals and programs; (2) preparation of  materials needed for pre-financing decision making; (3) technical, financial, economic, and institutional viability appraisals in relation to suitability for World Bank financing; (4) negotiations concerning the scope, terms, and conditions involved in financing an operation; (5) the implementation period; and (6) the evaluation of a completed project. Case studies and graphs are included. (JHP)",

This research study examined computerized oversight information systems in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Accounting Office (GAO) of the federal government to determine how system capabilities affect user expectations, what constraints impede a system's use by primary users, and what factors appear to enhance the evolution of effective oversight information systems. Six systems were examined through structured interviews with  primary users and/or systems designers and by reviewing input and output documents. Findings indicate that information provided by these systems tends to be used primarily: (1) for upward and outward accountability; (2) to support internal strategic planning efforts; (3) to report to external groups, such as the U.S. Congress; and (4) to provide performance reports to oversight agencies' managers. These systems help an agency demonstrate that it is accomplishing goals, justify resources, and develop data to support policy initiatives. They enhance internal accountability in the oversight agencies, but not in the overseen agencies, and oversight agency managers also utilize these systems to promote political accountability. (JHP)",

        "description":"This paper outlines the method and theoretical basis for establishing and implementing an independent study music curriculum. The curriculum combines practical and theoretical paradigms and leads to an external degree. The computer, in direct interaction with the student, is the primary instructional tool, and the teacher is involved in indirect consultative interaction with the student. The design of the curriculum involves \"educational goals clarification,\" a process by which the students develop a body of information about themselves in order to clarify goals. Through computer assisted instruction (CAI), the intended and resultant curricula begin to merge. This program is oriented toward general studies of music rather than vocational orientation. More than one-half of the  program consists of required courses in arts and humanities, science and mathematics, and social and behavioral sciences. Through computer assisted instruction, course offerings could be expanded to include music history, theory orchestration, composition, and keyboard skills. Through Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), digital synthesizers can talk to each other or other computers. The external degree study program exemplifies a union of theory and practicality for the learner who is ready to assume the responsibility for self-directed learning. (SM)",

Currently, there is a movement toward artistic freedom within strict limits. The film industry in Japan, thriving since the early 1900s, experienced the artistic growth of Japanese films as a result of  freedom from corresponding restrictions imposed by the war. Japanese films are divided into two categories: (1) contemporary life films; and (2) period films. An overview of the films of five influential Japanese film makers and a brief list of their films is provided. There are numerous Chinese films available for rent and a brief description of five classic films made between 1937 and 1969 is included.

In 1947, the &quot;Tenney Committee&quot; introduced eight bills in the California legislature to prevent the teaching of controversial subjects in elementary schools and to increase legislative control over textbooks. Eisenberg was charged with &quot;indoctrinating with subversive ideologies&quot; in the small rural agricultural community of Canoga Park, California. In spite of strong parental and student support, Eisenberg, a teacher of journalism and English and the faculty advisor for the school newspaper, became the target for suspicion and hostility during a period of nationalism. Known  anti-Semites were called as witnesses against her as well as students who had never been in her classes. Although the board of education appointed a committee which investigated the charges and completely cleared her, she lost her position in 1954. During this period the superintendent of the Los Angeles Schools required teachers to read a booklet on Americanism and to sign a loyalty oath. (NL)",

        "description":"A discussion of geography's place in the curriculum and suggested methods for teaching geography are presented in this paper. Geography may be included in the curriculum in a variety of ways, such as infusing it throughout the curriculum or designing an integrated curriculum with geography as the core. Principles of learning derived from educational psychology should form the basis for teaching geography. The geography curriculum must stress: (1) interesting experiences for students; (2) meaningful learning opportunities; (3) purposeful lessons and units; (4) provision for individual differences in the classroom; (5) balance among diverse objectives; and (6) appropriate sequencing of activities. The study of different philosophies of education will help teachers attain clarity of  ideas pertaining to each philosophical school of thought. A carefully selected philosophy of education may provide a basis for rational decision-making in terms of objectives, learning activities, and appraisal procedures. Microcomputer use and the variety of available software add other dimensions that provide for individual differences among students. (SM)",

The international dimensions of education are fourfold: (1) the capacity to communicate in languages other than English; (2) understanding of other nations, cultures, and people; (3) the capacity to compare educational systems across national boundaries; and (4) the exchange of educational practices. The recommendations are directed at the CCSSO, federal agencies, state education agencies, local education agencies, and colleges and universities. Among the recommendations are the following: the CCSSO should provide leadership in improving the quality of second language study and the teaching of  international education; federal agencies should strengthen the international education capacities in the U.S. Department of Education programs through mission statements addressing cross-national studies; state education agencies should work with state boards of education to establish policy statements improving and expanding the international dimensions of education; local education agencies should support programs designed to strengthen second language study and international education; college and universities should establish second language requirements for admission.

        "description":"\"A new order of the ages (is born),\" is the meaning of the Latin phrase \"novus ardo seclorum\" which can be found on the back of a U.S. dollar bill. U.S. citizens are concerned with the passage of time, the near future, acting in a timely manner, and accomplishing tasks efficiently. These traits have become part of the national character. Efficiency is the U.S. cultural value that most explains the characteristic approach to business, allowing a desire for short-term profits to eclipse concern for long-term competitiveness. The reasons for this preoccupation with time and efficiency result from the birth and development of the United States as a nation. When the new world was first colonized, hard work and efficiency were essential for survival. One of the most influential faiths  was Calvinism, which held that worldly prosperity was an outward sign of salvation. An influential later period in U.S. history was the time of frontier settlement, during which survival depended on getting necessary tasks done in an efficient and effective manner. Basic cultural values and attitudes change at a glacial pace, and the outlook of many U.S. citizens in the late 1980s continues to be that individual worldly success is morally desirable and there is no reason why a person should not attain it with maximum efficiency.

In this paper, which was drawn from a larger research program, illustrative findings about three aspects of architecture studio teaching are analyzed from the perspective of the existing literature on teaching and teachers' viewpoints. The three topics examined are: (1) an aspect of students' thinking; (2) teachers' conceptions of their roles; and (3) a typical instructional decision. A studio curriculum that considers the developmental nature of students' thinking needs to be designed. Students' thoughts about alternatives to design problems need to be fostered throughout the program. Teachers' roles are defined by their expectations for students' work and  their knowledge of the topic. Teachers are involved in complex thinking and in making decisions as they teach. Skilled teachers are able to effectively draw upon and orchestrate large bodies of knowledge using skills uniquely suitable for the problem at hand. Decisions about instructional methods must rest on teachers' assumptions about the purpose of studio learning and the nature of student thinking processes. The studio teachers' challenges and dilemmas are complex and rich and deserve illumination through research. (SM)",

This document describes and illustrates a method of constructing and comparing choropleth maps for selected Iowa communities. The use and construction of scatter diagrams as a supplement to map comparison is also discussed. The choropleth map uses different shaded area symbols (normally ranging from black to light grey) to show distributional patterns. Selected colors should be within the same family, such as brown, red, orange, and yellow. Steps in constructing the map are to: (1) determine the area unit to be used; (2) select the statistics to be mapped; (3) select an appropriate categorization method such as  quantile method or equal interval method; (4) group the statistics into four or five classes; and (5) use the darkest symbols for areas with greater magnitude. A method of visually showing the relationship between two variables for a selected number of observations is the scattergram which also can be easily constructed. The document concludes with a listing of statistical sources for mapping local areas. (SM)",

The ASSP is a non-political, non-profit intergovernmental organization of 17 African nations that stimulates, promotes, and monitors innovative curriculum. The ASSP evolved from two major meetings (Queen's College Oxford, England, September, 1967 and Mombasa, Kenya, August, 1968) of concerned African educators and representatives from the United States and English development agencies. The organizational structure of ASSP is a coordinating committee composed of one government-appointed representative from each member country and a six-member executive committee which works with the  executive director. This committee is chosen by the coordinating committee to make decisions on its behalf. The major accomplishments of the ASSP center on its role in supporting national efforts within member nations to introduce, develop, and expand social studies education. Challenges for the ASSP are working within the constraints of scarce resources and overcoming the innate sensitivity of the social studies subject matter in developing nations. (SM)",

Both Canada and the United States have cultural links to Western Europe and the British Isles and both countries have a common commitment to the core values of democracy.  Teaching about Canada can be incorporated into existing social studies courses at all levels. University level courses should include sufficient Canadian content to provide future teachers with adequate knowledge to teach about Canada. Separate interdisciplinary Canadian studies courses could include Canadian literature, art, and culture.

Three contemporary efforts to assess teacher knowledge, each with a different purpose, are presented. The first, based on a report of the Office of Educational Research and Improvement, summarizes state assessment efforts and issues raised by such efforts. The second article describes Michigan State University's National Center for Research on Teacher Education's approach to instrument development, detailing how the organization conceptualized what teachers need to care about, know, and be able to do to teach mathematics and writing effectively, and how the development of instruments to assess teachers' learning is approached. The question of what it means to  be prepared to teach an academic subject is also addressed. The final article offers an interview with Lee Shulman of Stanford University (California) who describes his ongoing work with the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy, which is developing assessment prototypes for a national board examination of teachers.

This program is a pilot project designed to provide internships to new teachers and intervention to tenured teachers who are in need of assistance. The purpose of peer assisted internships is to help develop and retain effective new teachers. The PAR program pairs new teachers (interns) with experienced teachers (mentors) during their first year in the District. Mentors help interns develop and refine their teaching skills and also acquaint the new teachers with their other teaching responsibilities. This paper presents a description of the program and outlines the salient factors involved in a comprehensive evaluation of the program's effectiveness. The  purpose of the evaluation was to: (1) determine whether PAR internships have had an impact on developing and retaining good teachers; (2) provide a mechanism for improving the PAR Program; and (3) document efforts contributing to staff development, student achievement, and teacher professionalism. In describing and discussing the program and its evaluation, reflections are included on the implications for policy formation in the District. (JD)",

In developing this program, designed to discover and address the needs of mid-career teachers, the developers first examined the rationale behind preservice and first-year supervision and support programs and the ways in which knowledge of beginning teachers might inform the choice of a program responsive to the needs of experienced teachers. A discussion is offered on the problems faced by the program planners, such as questions of costs to the institutions and participants and allocation of time. The collaborative roles of the university and the schools within the organization of the program are described. In  discussing the design of the curriculum, an explanation is presented of the reasons for deciding to create a model that included a focus on the teacher as an individual striving for self-improvement. From this focus, a model emerged that had a framework encompassing six major themes: reflection, empowerment, knowledge, collaboration, articulation, and self-evaluation. (JD)",

Another question concerns the demonstrated teaching competency of the teachers selected and prepared by institutions relying on rigorous admission and exit criteria. A final question emerges about the employment of student teachers who do demonstrate competence on tests in performance. This paper reports on a series of five studies conducted at a major university over a two-year period. Admission criteria, performance and employment of student teachers were examined in the light of scores on the National Teacher Examinations  (NTE) for General Knowledge or for disicpline specialization in either the life sciences, physical sciences or social studies areas. Results show that the NTE tests do not contribute additional information about the student teachers that isn't already available through other measures, nor does NTE predict either teaching performance or employment of teachers.

        "description":"This paper deals with questions having to do with the nature and effects of teachers' beliefs about schooling, and to the psychological relationship between theory and practice. It is posited that teachers' beliefs are likely to have a profound influence on their actions. A critical analysis of current school performance and teacher education methods leads to the conclusion that a single type of epistemology, primarily empiricist in nature, is pervasive in schools and in teacher education generally. Suggesting that the prevailing set of beliefs is over-simplistic, the primary problem of teacher training as a developmental issue is explored. The issue is addressed from a psychological point of view in terms of a proposed process of reflective inquiry. The inquiry model is then  extended and it is argued that a similar inquiry system is necessary to help students build connections between theory and practice. Both uses of inquiry are illustrated by means of examples from other bodies of literature. A philosophical justification of a reflective inquiry approach to teacher education is presented with emphasis on the benefits in terms of teacher empowerment. A brief synopsis is presented of a current attempt to implement these ideas in the context of a foundational course in educational psychology. The primary purpose of the paper is to provide the basis for a new research agenda in teacher education. (JD)",

The purpose of the project, developed as a result of the school excellence award, was to improve student motivation, attendance and achievement through dual activities: (1) enhancing teacher competency through a staff development plan using the Classroom Management Training Program; and (2) increasing parent contact with the school. Thirty of the school's 54-member faculty were trained in two groups, with the first group of teachers acting as trainers and subsequent coaches for the second group. The training focused on an integrated model of positive discipline and positive instruction. Explicit efforts were made to increase the number of contacts with parents, through phone  calls from counselors, conferencing with teachers, and mailing of mid-term grade reporting information. As an outcome of the training, teachers, students and parents saw improvement in student motivation. Office referrals for discipline dropped an average of 28 percent during the period of time compared to the same period the previous year. Attendance rates for students remained virtually unchanged for the comparison times, but membership in the Honor Society increased by 47 percent.

The practices are found to follow a continuum from elementary through high school that proceeds from an early emphasis on \"pupil orientation\" to a later emphasis on \"subject-matter\" orientation. These emphases drive decisions about the scheduling, staffing, and grouping practices that foster the particular learning environments and activities that define a school's instructional program. The paper specifically examines the implications of these practices for middle schools. Survey data are displayed in  graphs and tables and 29 references are included. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"This study tests the general hypothesis that there is no single best way to organize a middle school to meet the variety of needs of early adolescent students. Using data from a sample of 433 schools in the Pennsylvania Educational Quality Assessment, it examines the effects of self-contained classroom instruction and departmentalization on two generally agreed-upon educational goals--positive student-teacher relations and high quality subject-matter instruction. The study finds self-contained classroom instruction benefits student-teacher relations at a cost to high quality subject-matter instruction, while departmentalization improves the quality of instruction in specialized subject matter at a cost to student-teacher relations. The same types of effects are proposed by  analogy for scheduling and grouping practices. (Author)",

In order to provide a contextual perspective, the discussion of these two items is prefaced by a brief overview of the origins and mission of the Center for Excellence in Education at Northern Arizona University. The pilot project was designed to determine whether a teacher observation instrument can be used effectively in a preservice program during the course work phase prior to student teaching, and also be used during the student teaching phase. The study sought to determine areas in which students tended to be relatively  strong and relatively weak. The pilot sought to identify any emergent patterns during the acquisition of proficiency in teaching skills, and whether any students were &quot;at risk&quot; due to poor performance. It was hoped that clues would be found that would help tie preservice and inservice together in a way that would foster new partnerships between universities and public schools. (JD)",

The survey polled Associate or Assistant Superintendents of Instruction in 23 of Maryland's 24 county school systems and a sample of school-based and central office-based staff whom they identified as active in providing training or support to new teachers. The survey provided information about goals of the programs for new teachers, personnel involved in selected administrative tasks, the number and type of new teacher participants served, strategies for new teacher development used in these programs, program changes anticipated in the next year  or two, and perceptions about their strengths and weaknesses. The case studies reviewed seven programs that represented promising approaches to new teacher development. The case studies also provided detailed information about various programmatic and administrative components of these programs, and suggested what made them work in their settings. (JD)",

Beginning teachers (first or second year in elementary settings) were randomly chosen and assigned to one of the two models. Methods used for the study included both qualitative and quatitative means. The researcher acted as a participant observer during the length of the study. Results indicated that there are important elements that must be considered in order for an induction  program to be effective and that such a program should be initiated during the first year of teaching in order to be most beneficial for beginning teachers. Participants stated a preference for the highly structured Induction Team approach rather than the loosely conceived Buddy System approach. (Author/JD)",

Thirty-six students enrolled in an upper level course, Principles of High School Teaching, during the 1986 Fall Semester, were subdivided into groups of 18 each and were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. Each group received 40 hours of instruction during the first eight weeks of the semester. The experimental group studied materials in the areas of research findings on effective teaching, classroom interactions, classroom management, and instructional evaluation. Additionally, they  conducted simulated practices of teaching skills related to the materials studied. The control group studied materials traditionally taught in the Principles of High School Teaching course. Opportunities for this group to practice specific teaching skills were limited. Results indicated that the experimental group achieved significantly higher scores than did the control group on the criterion-referenced test on effective teaching concepts. Also, the experimental group demonstrated an overall higher performance in the classroom than did the control group. Implications for improvement of the preservice education program are discussed.

        "description":"This study examined relationships among teachers' management effectiveness ratings, student achievement, social and academic participation structures, patterns of instructional sequencing, and teachers' contributions to thematic development in classroom lessons. Representative case samples were selected to explore effective and less effective management and instructional practices in four junior high school English classrooms. The cases were selected on the basis of identified differences among teachers on measures of observed management effectiveness and student achievement. Patterned differences across classrooms were identified in: (1) the demands placed on students to interpret subtle changes in their rights and obligations for participating; and (2) the development of a  conceptual framework to guide academic participation and meaning construction processes. Rank order comparisons suggested that effective management is necessary, but not sufficient, to bring about student achievement gains. Implications are provided as a set of questions to guide instructional planning and reflection. (Author/JD)",

This report provides information about activities in the pilot program during the school year 1986-87. During that period, the following major activities occurred: (1) 42 percent of the participating employees earned Career Status II; (2) a state-wide appeals procedure was developed and implemented; and (3) a plan for program self-study was developed. An analysis of the data indicated that evaluators within units rated teachers consistently during 1987-88. There were differences, however, in the ratings of teachers across units, indicating that a common understanding of the rating criteria did not exist across the state. The data also show that evaluators within 13  units changed their ratings as they became more experienced, with some lowering their ratings while others raised them. A summary of the progress of the units in moving toward the goal of implementing a valid and reliable evaluation is presented. The equity of the system is also discussed.

The curriculum does not focus on illness, disability and death. Those topics should be dealt with separately from aging education and are not synonymous with aging. Selected early children's literature plays a vital role in this curriculum. A book list used in the  curriculum is given. The logo on the curriculum unit, an orange cat with the acronym K.A.T.S., stands for the \"Kids Are Tomorrow's Seniors\" program.

Certain innovations were based upon current research on effective teaching. Central to the program was an integrated methods course and courses in elementary reading and diagnostic/remedial reading. Teacher educators, preservice  teachers, and public school personnel worked together intensively in field experiences in the schools.

Forty-four teachers, administrators, and other school personnel participated in the Teachers Teaching Teachers project from February, 1986, to May, 1987. All project participants were given eight separate pretest and posttest versions of both the Likert Bipolar Attitude Inventory and Osgood's Semantic Differential Scale. Mean pretest and posttest scores were compared to determine project effectiveness. The results indicated that pretest-posttest gains were obtained in seven of the eight desired outcomes, four of these were  significant. One measure showed a decrease in posttest score, but this difference was not significant.

        "description":"It is suggested in this paper that practical arguments can be used in teacher education and staff development programs to introduce teachers to research-based practices. Practical arguments consist of three types of premises--value, empirical, and situational--that conclude with an action, or an intention to act. Such arguments are a useful way to think about the ways teachers can use research results as evidence, as information, and as sources of insight for them to consider along with their own experiences. A staff development process based on practical argument elicitation can help a teacher bring together, organize, and analyze a set of premises that provide rationale for an action, and examine them in relation to research. An example is given of the use of practical  arguments in changing beliefs and practices. A description is presented of a teacher education model currently being developed as part of the Reading Instruction Study that will use belief interviews, videotaping, group practical argument elicitation, and current research discussions to change teaching practices. The purpose of this model program is to provide teachers with a way of examining their practice in relation to their classroom goals and also to explore their premises about reading, students, and teaching.

The indicators are used to provide meaningful comparative information for analysis and planning, to encourage school employees to make productive curricular or organizational changes, and to provide predicted scores for selected cognitive and affective student measures. Means by which the indicator data are reported to school districts are presented, and whether the indicator data were used at the local level is investigated. The selection and refinement of the indicators has taken place over an 18-year period. Currently, over 60 indicators are in use within the state program. Consideration is given to the  alteration or replacement of the indicators for use within a national indicator system. Tabulated data and a descriptive tabular listing of indicator condition variables are appended. (TJH)",

        "description":"This study sought to determine the cognitive levels of questioning of end-of-chapter test items accompanying selected fifth-grade science textbooks. The extent to which test items emphasized high level questioning and significant differences among texts in the distribution of knowledge and above-knowledge-level test items were also investigated. Data were derived from 500 test items randomly selected from five most widely used fifth-grade science textbooks in Alabama, California, Tennessee, and Texas. Three raters classified the items according to Bloom's six major taxonomic categories. Collectively, 304 items were judged as assessing knowledge, 169 as assessing comprehension, 26 as application items, and one as an evaluation item. Implications derived from the findings of this  research are based on two assumptions that: (1) the use of higher order questions stimulates critical thinking; and (2) tests that accompany textbooks are important guides to instruction and evaluation. In general, it appears that high-order thinking skills are not elicited by end-of-chapter tests in science textbooks and that ready-made tests, which accompany science textbooks, tend to become guides for instruction as well as evaluation. An 87-item reference list concludes the document. (TJH)",

This paper summarizes the important aspects of the sampling theory for Cronbach's (1951) coefficient alpha--a widely used internal consistency coefficient. This theory enables researchers to test a specific numerical hypothesis about the population alpha and to obtain confidence intervals for the population coefficient. It also permits researchers to test the hypothesis of equality among several coefficients, either under the condition of independent samples or when the same sample has been used for all measurements. The procedures are illustrated numerically, and the assumption and derivations underlying the theory are discussed.  (Author)",

        "description":"A study was made to determine characteristics of teacher-composed classroom tests, with emphasis placed on describing the levels of knowledge addressed by the test items. In this preliminary investigation, 19 mathematics and 16 science teachers working in 4 high schools in a mixed suburban/rural school district were asked to: (1) complete a brief instrument describing the format, objectives, analysis, and uses of their tests as well as their level of confidence in their testing skills; and (2) supply the researchers with their most recently administered unit or quarter examination. A rating form was devised to analyze a sample of teacher-composed tests. Interrater agreement for a sample of the tests ranged from 90 to 100 percent. Teachers' perceptions of the levels of knowledge  addressed by their test items were compared to the researchers' actual ratings by means of t-tests or mean differences with the alpha levels adjusted using Bonferroni's formula. Multivariate analyses of variance were used to examine the main effects of school and subject taught on the percentage of items addressing each level of knowledge. Results provide insights into teachers' perceived purposes for testing, construction of test items, cognitive levels tested, overall test presentation, and confidence in testing skills. Major weaknesses discovered include a tendency to test at low cognitive levels, flaws in construction of individual test items, and inadequate instructions. Study data are presented in seven tables.

        "author":["Hoffman, Lee McGraw"],
        "description":"This paper attempts to define evaluation use and manipulable variables related to it. Approaches to defining evaluation use have included typologies inventorying kinds of evaluation use, threshold criteria defining accepted levels of evidence, construct or operational definitions, and dependence on the perspective of the decision maker. None of these approaches is found to be satisfactory. Within models of evaluation use, the concept is conceived as a dependent variable, and much of the literature constitutes an attempt to identify the factors that act as independent variables in their relation to use. Descriptive models are often structured around components of an evaluation and its setting. Explanatory models, of which there do not seem to be many in the literature of  evaluation use, include those developed by A. J. Meltsner (1976), R. D. Brown et al (1984), and G. E. Hall (1981). An effective model of manipulation should have the following characteristics: (1) open-mindedness in defining use as well as non-use and misuse; (2) conceptualization of evaluation use as a process; (3) inclusion of relevant components and their interrelationships; (4) treatment of manipulable and non-manipulable variables; (5) central focus on the interaction of factors; and (6) reduction of variables as much as possible.

        "description":"The Italic Handwriting Series developed for public schools in Portland, Oregon, emphasizes a continuous flow in handwriting development and instruction and is designed to allow a more natural transition from print to cursive. Italic writing was first implemented during 1983-84 at the kindergarten through fourth-grade levels, with an additional grade-level implementation occurring during successive years. A three-year evaluation study examined the effects of italic handwriting instruction on students' handwriting legibility. The program, which includes a staff training component, concentrates on joins between letters rather than on changes in letter formation that characterize more conventional handwriting programs. Legibility criteria included shape, slope, size, and space. The  evaluation study presents program outcomes for the 1985-86 school year, as well as a summary of all 3 years of the italic adoption implementation. Fall and spring handwriting papers were collected from students in grades 3, 4, and 5 and the 9 sample schools. A teacher survey was also conducted. Analysis of the student writing papers and teacher feedback indicate that the general legibility of student handwriting has declined over the 3-year period, but teachers generally were positive about the program, though each year of implementation saw a slight increase in the number of teachers who wanted to drop it. A description of the &quot;Italic Handwriting Series&quot; materials and scope and sequence is appended. (TJH)",

The role of depressive distortion in the maintenance or stabilization of depression was also examined. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four groups: depressed-treatment, depressed-control, non-depressed-treatment, and non-depressed-control. The treatment for depression that was used involved a precision teaching model to alter proportional rates of positive self statements without targeted modification of the thinking process. Specifically, the procedure involved teaching subjects to generate a list of 30 positive adjectives to be rehearsed and recalled during a predetermined &quot;test&quot; time. The CBQ  was administered to all subjects before and after treatment. The results indicate that: (1) depressed subjects showed higher frequencies of depressed distorted and depressed non-distorted responses and lower frequencies of non-depressed non-distorted responses; (2) non-depressed distorted responses were not relevant to the level of depression; and (3) the treatment did not significantly alter these responses.

Feasibility standards recognize that an evaluation usually must be conducted in natural conditions and require that no more materials and personnel time than necessary be consumed. Propriety standards reflect the fact that evaluations affect many people in different ways; these standards are aimed at insuring that the rights of persons  affected by an evaluation will be protected. Accuracy standards include those standards that determine whether an evaluation has produced sound information; these standards require that the obtained information be technically adequate and that conclusions be linked logically to the data. Each of these four categories were broken down into topic areas, from which 30 standards were derived. Once the standards are established, the evaluator must face issues associated with tradeoffs among standards, determination of the validity of standards, development of standards for personnel, and international considerations.

The procedure uses modified version of F. S. Ellett's lottery method as a means of partially satisfying the principles of substantive fairness. Ellett's procedure establishes an upper cut-score and recommends acceptance of everyone whose test score is at or above the cut-score. A second lower cut-score is also established, so that everyone scoring at or below this score is rejected. After hiring or admitting candidates in the upper group, additional openings are filled by those between the upper and lower cut-scores. The modification of Ellett's procedure, referred to as the probability level assignment  model (PLAM), involves division of the score scale between the upper and lower cut-scores into several equal-width intervals, within which applicants are selected via lottery in proportion to the probability for success upon admission or employment. Results from application of this method to 272 first-year students at the Universidad de Oriente in Cumana, Venezuela, indicate that the PLAM appropriately addresses the various criteria of selection fairness.

The  results of analysis of covariance and the Johnson-Neyman Technique indicate that the treatment condition was effective only for students with higher levels of prior knowledge related to language arts methodology upon entry into the course, and that it was detrimental to students who had lower levels of prior knowledge, as reflected in the pretest scores.

Performance trends over the past several years were analyzed. Major findings indicate that: (1) reading achievement trends varied somewhat across the region from 1984 to 1987; (2) students at all grade levels throughout the region showed considerable improvement in mathematics from 1984 to 1987; (3) students across the region perform much higher than national norms on standardized tests, with particularly high scores characterizing children at the elementary school level; and (4) there was a high degree of achievement with regard to  minimum basic skills in reading and mathematics, with most students meeting minimum standards established by the respective states. In summary, regional achievement trends were positive during the target period, a trend following the 1978-1984 trend. In areas where declines were found, it is possible that these phenomena can be attributed to change in test forms. Although aggregate score trends were very positive, there was much variability within states. (TJH)",

Students in one group focused on test-taking techniques, while students in the other group received an intensive review of objectives and content measured by the Stanford Achievement Test. Each group participated in the experimental activities for 50 minutes per day for 20 days prior to administration of the Stanford Achievement Test. Multivariate analysis of variance were computed on data from study  instruments, and univariate analysis was performed on data from the Stanford Achievement Test. Results indicate that instructing students in test-taking strategies is as effective as is intensive instruction in content. A replication of this study with a larger mixed-race population would be beneficial. (TJH)",

Each student was administered the WISC-R and K-ABC by the same examiner to minimize examiner bias and influence. Results indicate that there was a significant relationship between the WISC-R and the K-ABC in the sets of children selected for placement in learning disabled and gifted programs. There was no significant relationship between these two instruments in the sets of children  selected for programs for educable mentally retarded persons. The removal or de-emphasis of the language component in the K-ABC diminishes the effect of psycholinguistic deficit for many learning disabled students. The removal of the acquired facts from the intelligence scales of this instrument provides a more efficient measurement of the fluid intelligence of these students. (TJH)",

With enactment of Act 76 in 1983, an instrument was developed for field testing in 1984 over objections of the Arkansas Education Association. The test, the Arkansas Educational Skills Assessment, is comprised of 50 multiple-choice reading questions, 50 mathematics questions, and a 200-word writing sample. Many legislators attempted to modify or eliminate the Act but the governor strongly supported it. Disagreements over cutoff scores, test bias, confidentiality of results, and testing procedures marked the period prior to the test date, March 23, 1985. Problems, including mixed-up scores and content leaks, were associated with subsequent test occasions  in 1987. Finally, 3.6% of the teachers were never able to pass the test. In spite of the comedy-of-errors aspects of the test controversy, public support for teacher testing seems to indicate that the education profession needs to confront its own problems and to take steps to ensure the competency of those who enter its ranks.

Eighty subjects in Experiment 1 drew capital letters from lines or descriptions of lines in a seven-page booklet. The results indicate that imagined information and perceived information were integrated with equivalent accuracy and strategies. When the problems became more cognitively demanding and mental combinations of lines into figures contained four elements, different strategies were used. Sixty-eight subjects were given explicit instructions on how to identify imagined or perceived lines as letters. When strategies were restricted, integrating  imagined information was less accurate than integrating perceived information. Several factors, many of which were related to the cognitive demand difference from these two origins, influence the substitutability of imagination and perception. To describe cognitive processing of information from internal and external origins, researchers should use multiple performance measures. (SLD)",

Performance assessments concentrated on relevance, timeliness, technical adequacy, and impact. Results indicate a decline in federally sponsored research and in statistical and evaluative information on education; a shift away from collection of new data to service-oriented activities; and a trend toward contract awards to institutions rather than field-related endeavors. Agency comments and recommendations are outlined. (TJH)",

Philip Randolph--engineering; (2) Townsend Harris--the humanities; and (3) The Paul Robeson School--business and technology. Each of these programs integrated some combination of features such as honors level curricula, elective courses, career education, college faculty participation, enrichment activities, and internships into a cohesive program structure. Staff interviews and student performance data indicate that all three programs met their general goals of providing rigorous academic training and increasing students' awareness of career and higher education  opportunities. However, only the Townsend Harris program met its specific evaluation objective. The difference between staff perceptions and the attainment of specific evaluation objectives may be a result of the use of objective criteria that were too difficult to accomplish in a one-year program. The programs are described, and recommendations for improving each are made. Data are presented on three tables. (BJV)",

        "description":"The paper summarizes the results of an analysis of recently issued Census data. Examining the anti-poverty effectiveness of cash and non-cash benefit programs from 1979 to 1986, the analysis focuses on the impacts of those programs on families with children, the group whose poverty rate has risen most rapidly since 1979. The data reveal that government benefit programs now lift a smaller proportion of families with children out of poverty than they did in 1979. One-third of the increase in poverty among families with children since 1979 would not have occurred if government programs had as much impact today in removing families from poverty as the programs did in 1979. Among the factors accounting for the lessened impact of the programs are reductions in federal benefit programs  through the early 1980s, the failure of states to increase benefits to keep up with inflation, changes in the economy that may have reduced the earnings of some poor families, and changes in the composition of the poverty population. There has been an underlying trend in the economy in which poor families are growing poorer and falling further below the poverty line. Charts and tables are included which summarize results and contain statistics on antipoverty program effectiveness. (PS)",

While the majority of those who became pregnant were 18- and 19-year-olds, 1,700 were aged 10 to 14. Of the total, 59 percent were white, and 39 percent were black or from another ethnic group. This report provides recommendations addressing problems associated with adolescent pregnancy, and examines the implementation of recommendations made by the Governor's Task Force in previous years. Recommendations are made in the following areas: (1) developing self-sufficiency skills as a consequence of a youth and family development approach; (2) improving the school-to-work transition; (3) creating opportunities for teen parents;  (4) enhancing the family support network for adolescent parents; (5) utilizing schools as a hub for services; (6) strengthening multi-service approaches; (7) coordinating existing funding streams to improve housing options for pregnant and parenting teens; (8) promoting positive messages through the media; (9) involving the private sector; (10) facilitating responses of local agencies; (11) addressing related policy issues; and (12) assessing current programs and services.

Three popular models for these collaborations are the following: (1) the pairing of a business with a single school; (2) collaborative efforts that focus on entire educational systems; and (3) collaborations intended to increase employability through the provision of special classes and/or part-time jobs. Nine programs were studied in order to ascertain their efficacy in improving the chances of success for at risk youth. The components, population, and type of collaboration are presented for each program. The major findings are the following: (1) the programs provide youth with  experiences which show the link between schooling and employment; (2) while some programs exist in name only and others merely serve public relations functions, many are rigorous and intensive; (3) personal growth and employability have increased for participants; (4) many schools have been improved physically, academically, and affectively; and (5) the programs have become catalysts for educational change.

In general, the programs showed strong potential for addressing educational reform and serving at risk youth. The increased scrutiny that businesses bring to schools seems to generate better attention to critical needs and new  strategies for improving educational performance. Some of the best programs provide the students with experiences that ease the transition from school to the world of work. It is noted, however, that enthusiasm for the new collaboration should be tempered by the knowledge that such programs are limited in what they can do. Measurable positive changes in academic achievement due to these programs have yet to be documented. A 43-item list of references is included. (VM)",

The programs which will be affected the most are those which pay heating bills for poor households, those which provide emergency food and shelter for the homeless, and those which provide housing assistance for low income elderly and handicapped people. Some of these categories have been cut in half since 1981. Originally the budget resolution had called for funding at 1987 levels plus inflation, but when Congress and the White House negotiated the deficit reduction package funding for these programs was reduced. A few programs, such as supplemental food programs and compensatory education programs have received increases, but many of these programs currently reach only  about 40 percent of those eligible for them. Budget increases in some categories will be offset by cuts in the funding to agencies which provide the services. Funding levels and changes in funding for low income programs are presented in three tables. (VM)",

        "description":"Increasing concern about the overall quality of America's schools has altered federal and state education policy priorities. This shift has resulted in a reduction of federal support, an increase in state-level initiatives, and development of new policies aimed more toward improving the education system generally than toward solving the problems of the most disadvantaged urban schools, which serve poor, minority, and non-English-speaking immigrant children. Through telephone interviews with urban school district administrators and a review of the literature, five types of reforms currently being widely implemented in urban districts were identified: (1) efforts to increase the &quot;effectiveness&quot; of schools, curricula, and instruction; (2) alternative delivery systems; (3) early  childhood programs; (4) social supports; and (5) cooperative partnerships. This document analyzes the effectiveness of these direct intervention strategies in addressing the issues in the most troubled urban schools and helping low-income and minority students break their patterns of low achievement, dropping out, and joblessness. The most promising strategies for helping inner-city students are those that will accomplish the following: (1) build capacity at local school sites; (2) provide school autonomy and flexibility in designing and implementing improvement plans; (3) take a broad view of curriculum and instruction; (4) provide real-life incentives for urban students to achieve at school; and (5) coordinate efforts with other institutions and agencies to provide social and economic  opportunities beyond the reach of the school. Strategies are analyzed on two tables; a list of 169 references is appended. (BJV)",

        "description":"The MetroLink project supported and studied the process of collaboration for human resource development in American metropolitan areas. The project was conducted in 1984 and 1985 in the following eight metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Georgia; Boston, Massachusetts; Hartford, Connecticut; Indianapolis, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Saint Louis, Missouri; and Portland, Oregon. The study documentation indicated that: (1) successful collaboration to overcome longstanding systemic problems in human resource development can be achieved; (2) there appear to be five stages in the development of collaboration; (3) different elements of leadership, history, and levels of commitment combine to determine the nature of collaborative alliances; (4) 12 themes apparently  characterize collaborative efforts. The 5 phases and 12 themes of the collaborative process are discussed at length in the body of the report. MetroLink also achieved the following specific outcomes in each site: (1) a coordinator trained in assessing and gathering information about a metropolitan area's political and economic environments, and in using external networks to bring information and expertise to the area; (2) a cadre of leaders who understand the complexities of metropolitan area planning and policymaking processes, and effective strategies for intervening in those processes; (3) a process for documenting and assessing cooperative activities among schools, businesses, higher education institutions, and among labor organizations, governmental agencies and individuals; (4) a  specific, publicly visible example of results gained from cooperative efforts; and (5) a small national network capable of disseminating experiences gained through MetroLink to additional metropolitan areas. The cross-sector collaboration process in each of the eight metropolitan areas is discussed. (BJV)",

        "description":"Failure and fraud in civil rights enforcement by the Department of Education are reported. Investigation and enforcement of the law is the duty of the department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which has not followed procedural guidelines for these duties. Complaint cases have accumulated without resolution and few attempts have been made to withdraw federal monies from states and agencies which are not in compliance. Desegregation plans in school districts and institutions of higher education have been disregarded, causing a retrenchment in black enrollment and the number of black graduates. Efforts have been made to backdate some civil rights documents, improperly close discrimination investigations, and provide false information to a federal court. The Committee on Government  Operations recommends that the OCR investigate these infractions thoroughly. Opposing views are presented by a group of 15 Representatives who believe that the work of the OCR is not as delinquent as has been suggested. The following issues are raised in support of the OCR: (1) there is a tremendous amount of material the OCR must review before making determinations; (2) failure to achieve a desegregation goal is not sufficient evidence of a violation; (3) OCR has taken corrective measures in the cases of back dating; and (4) OCR is not part of a scheme to mislead the court.

Programs which present evidence of positive effects and which can be replicated at other sites are identified and discussed. A proposal is made for the development of a data base which gathers information on instruction practices across sites so that their efficacy can be evaluated accurately. Factors such as the background of the students and their socioeconomic status can be held constant or disaggregated to discover the most successful strategies for different populations. The following kindergarten issues are presented: (1) preparation for first grade; (2) schedules and activities; and (3) what to do when students are unsuccessful. Three approaches  to the problem are considered: repetition of the kindergarten program; extending the kindergarten day; and delivery of a specialized curriculum. Effects of each of these approaches are discussed, with the third approach--use of alternative programs of instruction individualized according to the learning avenues best suited to a particular child--receiving the most extensive treatment. The discussion, which includes detailed descriptions of six specialized programs, covers the following points: effects of programs of instruction; effective programs and students at risk; and program effectivenss and alternatives. A 17-item list of references is included. Student outcomes and program effects are presented in tables and figures. (VM)",

The questions and testimony centered around the following questions: (1) why had the department delayed enforcement in cases where violations of civil rights were found; (2) why had the department circumvented the Adams order, which outlines enforcement guidelines; (3) why were some cases referred to the Department of Justice, which took no action; (4) why is the Department's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) now using good faith criteria to measure desegregation efforts rather than actual accomplishments; and (5) why has the OCR taken no action in 10 states whose court-ordered desegregation plans  expired a year ago. Statements and testimony alleging the unlawful actions of the department were given by witnesses representing organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Women's Law Center. Many of the inquiries and statements reveal a coverup effort in which the dates were changed on complaints and investigations to make it appear that the OCR was fulfilling its mandates. Representatives from the Department testified that although some of the allegations were true, each case had a plausible explanation and was a minor break from policy or practice. They stated that there was no systemic effort to circumvent the law or the duties of the OCR. (VM)",

        "description":"Previous research has failed to support the widely held assumption that the academic difficulties experienced by many minority and low socioeconomic status youth are due to their \"outsider\" standing vis-a-vis the middle class culture thought to govern the social relations of schooling. This analysis suggests that this proposition errs in exaggerating the extent of cultural hegemony in the way schools work. Examination of data on the first grade experiences of a diverse sample of 825 urban public school children demonstrates that not all teachers are equally given to status-related biases. In particular, teachers' own social origins exercise a strong influence on how they react to the status attributes of their students. Especially striking are the disadvantages accruing to the  low status pupils of high status teachers: their teachers hold to different behavior standards than their parents, consider the pupils to be less mature, hold lower performance expectations for them, and score exceptionally low on a measure of perceived school climate. Year-end marks and standardized test scores of low status students are depressed by these indicators of pupil-teacher social distance and teacher disaffection. A model of pupil-teacher \"congruence\" or \"fit\" is proposed as an alternative to the cultural hegemony framework, and the implications of such \"fit\" for the interpersonal dynamics of the classroom are discussed. Data are presented on four tables. A list of 45 references is included. (Author/BJV)",

        "description":"American educational institutions have used the literature of a few Anglo men to represent American literature. The problem of this one-sided presentation was alleviated somewhat during the 1960s when publishers began to offer some works of ethnic writers, especially for elementary school children. This was the result of influence by the civil rights movement and the feminist movement, which made people aware that white men were not the only people who contributed to American literature. In the 1980s the discussions moved to the psychological impact of literature on the individual. Not only do multicultural reading materials enhance reading skills, but they also sharpen sensitivity on the commonalities of human experience and improve the self-esteem of racial and ethnic  minorities. Some retrenchment has been in evidence in the past few years as ethnic literature has become less available than it was in the 1970s. Further, many recent books perpetuate common stereotypes and misconceptions about minorities. Some educators try to find the one book that encompasses the ethnic experience without realizing that no single work can represent the totality of a point of view. Others make the assumption that all books with ethnic characters are ethnic literature. Bibliographies with ethnic categories and identifiers can help educators to find and understand ethnic literature. (VM)",

It addresses the special problems of collecting, interpreting, and transcribing literature of North American Indians. Many of the original transcriptions of these works were done with an Indian translator for whom English was not the first language. This accounts for the incompleteness of early works. Later, when audio recordings were used, the quality of transcription improved. In the 1960s an approach called ethnopoetics further aided the transcription process by concentrating on the maintenance of linguistic accuracy and fidelity to the performance context. Now video recording technologies make it possible to have a more expansive record of oral literary  productions. This technology has brought about changes in the relationship between the audience and the performer; they no longer have to be in physical contact with each other. But electronic technologies require economic considerations which plain writing did not. They also require a considerable amount of infrastructure, such as power lines which put the transcriber and the audience in a dependent position. (VM)",

The subjects which students are asked to read and write about should be multi-cultural in nature so that students learn more about other cultures while they analyze their own cultural experiences. Many constraints limit the professor's ability to have such a well rounded curriculum. In a composition course at the University of California at Irvine the constraints are the following: (1) the large number of students in the class; (2) the commitment to finish the course in a ten-week quarter; (3) the placement of the course in the English Department, where the faculty has narrow views about what constitutes a good  composition course; (4) staff members who are mostly Anglo and have little knowledge of multi-ethnic literature; (5) the bias of publishers against including some ethnic groups but not others, like Asian Americans and American Indians; (6) the cost of books; and (7) student resistance to all or part of the multi-cultural approach. The solutions to these problems may be that instructors of these courses must develop and evaluate their work outside of the mainstream of existing departments, and students must be encouraged to validate their own cultural experiences as well as those of other groups.

A &quot;standard&quot; approach to counseling that does not consider a client's cultural background can create barriers that block effective communication.

A total of 463 students were classified into four categories depending on whether they were single year, multiple year, or continuous participants in the program; or whether they were from the regular education program. Three different standards were used to gauge the growth of the three groups receiving compensatory education: (1) normal curve equivalent; (2) normal growth; and (3) relative growth. The single and multiple year groups failed to meet the criterion score in reading, while the continuous group exceeded it. All three groups exceeded normally expected reading growth but failed to do so  in mathematics. On the index that compared the compensatory groups to the regular group, only the continuous group showed a decrease in the gap between their group and the comparison group. The recommendations were the following: (1) future studies such as this one should be outlined in advance to assure that accurate longitudinal records are kept; (2) special studies are needed for students who test high but are still in need of compensatory education; and (3) these kind of data should be collected state-wide and shared with all of the educational community. Tables, appendices providing calculation instructions in gap reduction research design, and a brief bibliography are included. (VM)",

Three reading and math programs, for selected grades between grade 1 and grade 9, had the following goals: (1) to provide intensive academic instruction to the educationally disadvantaged; (2) to involve parents in the program; (3) to supply students with incentives for academic improvement; (4) to operate staff inservice programs; (5) to measure academic growth; and (6) to prepare students to effectively meet the academic competition of the general classroom. The 1986-87 delivery system showed a decrease from the previous year in the percentage of participants who achieved grade level in reading. There was some improvement in the percentage who  achieved grade level in math. The overall results remained strong. The following recommendations were made: (1) communications should be improved among all involved in compensatory education programs; (2) there must be more inservice activities; (3) there must be greater recognition and rewards for excellence for both students and teachers; (4) student testing and selection procedures must be improved; and (5) efforts must be made to reduce variations in the program between building sites.

This document is the portion of that procedure that addresses the involvement of students in their learning, or how low achieving students cognitively operate on content. The discussion is set in the context of various teaching styles that may be used to transmit this content to the students. This approach is a departure from what has been practiced and researched in the past, when the focus was on how teachers' beliefs, attitudes and expectations influence their dealings with students. This new approach adds an important student-centered dimension to the analysis of teaching and learning. Research  literature related to the following topics is reviewed: (1) the definition, measurement, and predictive value of cognitive ability for student achievement; (2) the differences between low achievers and high achievers in the performance of cognitive tasks; (3) how students respond to success and failure, how they believe success and failure happen, and what they do as reactive behavior; and (4) how cultural differences affect academic achievement.

During the summer of 1986, an ad hoc committee of students, faculty, and administrators was formed, with the goal of increasing racial and multi-cultural awareness and improving race relations at the university. To best determine the course of action, the committee decided that the first step was to identify minority needs and the way students viewed intergroup relations. Initially undergraduate students were selected as the target group, but as instrument design progressed, committee members realized the importance of obtaining the perceptions of graduate students, faculty, and administrators as well. The purpose  of this paper is to present the development and refinement of the student instrument and its modification for other groups. The final instrument that was administered to students was a result of planning meetings that were held with nearly 30 student groups, committee meetings, and field tests. Results from the three instruments (administered to undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty and administrators) are briefly presented along with committee recommendations for future steps.

The philosophy behind the MESP is that all students can learn in a conducive learning environment; this study assesses students' perceptions of their learning environment. Questionnaires were administered to all seventh, ninth, tenth and eleventh grade students from 11 Memphis City Schools to determine the following: (1) the MESP students' perceptions of classroom climate in relation to 15 measurable class group properties (cohesiveness, friction, cliqueness, competitiveness, favoritism, democracy, satisfaction, apathy, diversity, goal direction, disorganization,  difficulty, formality, speed, and environment); and (2) differences between the MESP and two control groups on each of the 15 class group properties, and between the grades examined. The following results were discovered: (1) there are significant differences on class group properties within the effective schools; (2) MESP students perceived more cohesiveness, satisfaction, democracy, and formality than did members of the control groups; (3) there was more cliqueness in the lower grades, regardless of group; and (4) the innercity students perceived the subject matter as less difficult and at the same time perceived more friction in the classroom than did the students in the more affluent schools.

CSIP offers a holistic approach to school improvement and planning, and is designed to meet the rigorous guidelines for school improvement established in the CAR, as well as the Chancellor's Implementation Plan for Schools in Need of Assistance. The primary goal for the first year was for each school to submit a written, three-year plan presenting specific goals and activities designed to improve students' academic performance and the school's climate. Individual schools formed committees to write these plans, and CSIP  facilitators assisted these committees in analyzing data, identifying problems, conducting surveys, and developing solutions. In general CSIP met its objectives. However, the programs had varying degrees of impact and acceptance across sites. The following recommendations are made: (1) principals and other staff should be made to realize that their commitment and participation is necessary for the success of CSIP; (2) planning committee members should have a common meeting during school hours, at least once a week; and (3) a program coordinator should be appointed. An appendix lists the chancellor's minimum standards for elementary, middle, and secondary schools. (BJV)",

        "description":"Are there universal characteristics of adult thought? If so, how do they evolve and manifest themselves in cultures throughout the world? Piaget's formulation of formal operations is the best known and most extensively researched answer to the question regarding universal characteristics. Theoretical alternatives to formal operations differ in the specific characteristics proposed as defining adult thought, but they share an assumption about a level beyond formal operations that has come to be characterized as post-formal. Judgment and reasoning constitute a central psychological process in adult thought. The appropriate type of task with which to assess judgment is one in which there is no \"correct\" solution. Rather, irreconcilable alternatives should be considered and  evaluated. A general methodology for investigating the nature of adult thought is proposed within the framework of systems developed by Oser and Reich (1987) and by Wood (1983). A review of a wealth of disparate published reports indicates a consistent suggestion of a distinctively adult level of thought whose manifestation may be influenced by a variety of factors, none of which is presently clearly identifiable. Whether this level is universally attained or whether it is better viewed as a style whose evolution may also be influenced by educational and cultural factors as well as \"native endowment\" remains to be determined.

The sample consisted of 198 GED students and 201 traditional high school graduates who entered Queensborough Community College, City University of New York, in the Fall 1981 semester. The instrument used was one developed by Pascarella and Terenzini (1980) that was designed to tap the major dimensions of the Tinto model--specifically, levels of academic integration, social integration, institutional commitment, and goal commitment. Results supported the predictive validity of the Tinto model in identifying potential dropouts among GED examinees as  well as for the comparison group. It was found that for GED examinees first-year grade point average was the most important predictor of persistence; institutional commitment was the most important predictor for the traditional high school graduates; and the two groups were not statistically different in the rate of persistence. Results imply that institutions must address facilitation of academic integration, possibly through an effective academic advisement and orientation program. (YLB)",

Major employers in the Denver Metropolitan area were surveyed to determine (1) whether or not there are policies regarding GED credentials versus high school diplomas in governing the hiring of new employees; (2) whether or not possession of a GED credential will make an individual equal in hiring status to a person having a high school diploma; (3) whether or not jobs are available that might not be without an educational credential; (4) whether or not a GED credential will enhance promotion possibilities; and (5) whether or not a GED credential affects pay increases. Questionnaires were sent to 360 employers of more  than 250 persons, with a return of 184 questionnaires (51 percent). The results showed that almost all employers in the Denver area accept the GED as equivalent to a high school diploma when hiring new employees. The study also found that the types of jobs available to those with a high school diploma or equivalent are more managerial, technical, and skilled than those available to persons without either a high school diploma or a GED credential. Having a GED credential could also increase the possibility of promotion by showing the employee's initiative. Earning a GED credential would not influence pay except as it might increase chances for promotion. (KC)",

Registrars at each of Florida's 28 community colleges were asked to complete a survey designed to gather information concerning students with a GED and those with traditional diplomas. Ten registrars responded to the survey, although they indicated that such data are difficult to obtain. The study found that students with a traditional high school diploma greatly outnumber those with a GED at community colleges in Florida, although all of the registrars  indicated that their colleges had an open-door policy for any high school graduate or holder of an equivalent diploma. GED and traditional high school graduates who are admitted spend about the same amount of time to complete degree programs at Florida's community colleges, but the proportion of GED holders actually completing degree programs is smaller than that of traditional diploma holders. The study also found that traditional high school graduates had a slightly higher grade point average (GPA) than GED holders, but that both GPAs fell in the &quot;C&quot; grade range. The study concluded that the results should help to dispel misconceptions held by educators concerning the capabilities of the GED holder in higher education. (KC)",

Personnel directors from 101 businesses and agencies in the state, representing a variety of business types and sizes, returned the surveys. The  results of the study indicated that in the areas of performance, retention, and dismissal, a majority of employers surveyed believe that individuals with the GED diploma can function, and are subsequently treated, no differently than those persons having a traditional high school diploma as a terminal degree. The study also indicates that GED graduates are promoted at the same rate as regular graduates in less than half of the reporting businesses and suggests further research to determine the reasons for the discrepancy.

        "description":"A study used the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Force Experience Youth Cohort to determine the labor market consequences for young people of acquiring a General Educational Development (GED) degree in 1985. Three major consequences of receiving a GED were examined: labor force participation, employment status, and hourly wages. The analysis showed that GED recipients had greater chances of being labor force participants than young people without GEDs or high school diplomas. High school graduates were more likely to be participants than were GED recipients. Moreover, the more time that elapsed after obtaining a GED or a high school diploma, the greater the chance that a youth was a labor force participant. As was observed with labor force participation, the chances of  being employed were much greater in 1985 for young high school graduates than for GED recipients or youths with neither a GED nor a high school diploma. Interpretation of annual salaries from hourly wages indicated that the typical GED recipient would have earned in 1985 about $780 more than a youth without a GED or diploma, but $1,340 less than a youth with a high school diploma. Further research is needed to determine what the GED means to employers, to GED recipients and aspirants, and to the general public. (KC)",

        "description":"The General Educational Development (GED) testing program has been a part of the Alberta High School Equivalency Program since 1981. Between December 1981 and December 1983, 4,333 applicants passed the GED in Alberta, and 802 applicants failed to pass the test. Random samples of 200 individuals from each of these groups were studied to determine whether there are any consistent differences between members of the two groups. Usable questionnaires were returned by 46 percent of the GED-fail group and 67 percent of the GED-pass group. The characteristics of the Alberta GED student population were found to be quite similar to those of other equivalency program student populations. The older students tended to seek a GED certificate because they deemed it personally rewarding, whereas  younger enrollees generally saw the GED as a way of gaining a better job. Those in the GED-fail group were likely to be younger, have lower levels of formal education, and be unemployed than were their counterparts in the GED-pass group. A second part of the study assessed the acceptance of the GED by Alberta postsecondary institutions. This was accomplished by a survey of registrars from 19 Alberta universities, colleges, and technical institutes. Evidence from the survey suggests that while the GED program has benefited a small number of persons who have participated in it, the magnitude of the benefit is difficult to ascertain. There was, however, some indication that additional program participants may benefit in the future as a number of postsecondary institutions seemed interested  in establishing policies concerning the Alberta GED program.

        "description":"A nationwide survey examined the role of educational credentials in the employment practices of private sector companies and institutions. In September 1983, surveys were mailed to a random sample of 1,500 members of the American Society for Personnel Administration. A follow-up mailing was conducted a month later. A total of 643 completed surveys (43 percent) were returned. Finance, insurance, and real estate companies were slightly overrepresented in the sample, and wholesale and retail companies were probably underrepresented. More than 90 percent of those responding place either a major or moderate emphasis on educational credentials, with larger companies tending to emphasize them more than smaller companies. Overall, about 18 percent of the employees covered in the study  are working in positions that require less than a high school diploma. Twenty-three percent of the responding companies have no jobs that require less than a high school diploma. About half of the companies in the study sample have fewer than 8 percent of their employees in jobs requiring less than a high school diploma, and approximately 15 percent of the companies have 50 percent or more of their employees in such jobs. About 38 percent of the employees are working in positions requiring a high school diploma or equivalency credential, and about 16 percent of the positions require certification beyond the high school level. About 25 percent of those surveyed request a copy of job applicants' educational credentials, and nearly 40 percent request a copy of applicants' educational  transcripts. (MN)",

In an effort to integrate a study of technology into the public school curriculum, educators at the University of Idaho identified the following areas as representative of modern technology literacy: computers and computer-aided drafting, robotics, principles of technology, and computer numerical control technology. In order for educators to remain abreast of new developments and to present them effectively to their students, they may need to attend workshops or conferences, and then, with limited resources, try to integrate new knowledge into a traditional curriculum. Others may need to enroll in graduate programs and pursue advanced degrees. All must constantly  read and reflect on professional and technical journals. The University of Idaho is working with teachers throughout the state to assist them with the modernizing of the curriculum and is presenting workshops, seminars, and summer programs on technology in the curriculum.

It set out to determine: reasons for this group's choosing to study in the external mode; the nature and extent of required provision of external education; special curriculum, delivery, counseling, and support needs; and specific future policy recommendations. The study methodology included questionnaires, literature analysis, expert consultations, and a limited number of student interviews. Respondents to the questionnaires included 180 students (a 23% response rate), 43 Heads of External Studies (a response rate of approximately 93%), and 13 student advisers in Australian colleges. The data indicated that principal reasons for study externally were distance,  preference for the flexibility of this method, work commitments, financial reasons, and scheduling conflicts. Findings indicated that Technical and Further Education (TAFE) was the major provider of postsecondary off-campus studies and that a shortfall already existed in the provision of on-campus places for students at Colleges of Advanced Education and universities. Heads of External Studies did not believe that 16- to 19-year-olds were suitable users of off-campus studies; they favored a mixed mode. A wide range of support mechanisms and delivery media was used. Staff generally believed this group required greater support than older students when studying off-campus.

The first section, which deals with the reasons why transition is needed, covers the following topics: major federal legislation addressing transition services provided under the auspices of special and vocational education and vocational rehabilitation, legislation and initiatives versus practice, ways of narrowing the gap between theory and practice, the role of transition services as the missing link between education and adulthood, and components of the transition model (residential environment, employment, and social and  interpersonal networks). The second chapter examines ways of helping moderately and severely disabled persons increase their productivity, independence, and participation in the community and workplace. It includes information on high school programs, curriculum development models, integrated school systems, and community-based instruction. The third chapter covers the \"players\" and procedures entailed in planning the transition process, including the core transition team and methods of individualizing and evaluating the process. The array of available residential, vocational, recreation/leisure, and community-at-large services is described in the next chapter, which deals with the outcomes of the transition process. Finally, process and product/outcome barriers are addressed in a  concluding chapter on barriers to transition planning. Appendixes include a parent/guardian transition questionnaire, follow-up survey, and format for organizing individual transition objectives. (MN)",

Unfortunately, they include no underlying rationale, an omission that is a major obstacle to interpretation and implementation. Also, they do not emphasize or even accord much place to the key United Nationals (UN) stated principle of the inherent dignity of the human person, upon which so much else depends. The rules say very little about justice or criminal justice and leave largely to those working in the field the task of deriving from the text underlying principles of justice. The rules tend to reflect prevailing practice and perpetuate the conventional  wisdom according to which penal justice is fundamentally punitive and retributive. An interim step to a thorough review of the rules would be a strengthening of the statement of principle. This step would serve to provide a basis for interpreting and implementing the rules other than in conventional ways and in ways more in keeping with the UN's long-standing concern for human dignity and the development of the human person.

Focus was on the extent to which VR services are successful in returning SSDI beneficiaries to productive employment. The review was carried out in 10 states with widely varying practices in referring SSDI claimants to VR. These states accounted for nearly 40 percent of disability decisions made nationally in 1985. Only a small minority of disability beneficiaries--not more than 10-15 percent--were realistic prospects for rehabilitation and return to the work force. Generally, the disabled population was older and more severely disabled than other individuals with whom rehabilitation agencies work. Although about 12 percent of the disability  beneficiaries were evaluated for rehabilitation services, only 1 percent left the rolls because of renewed work activity. Only about 3 in 1,000 beneficiaries left the benefit rolls after receiving services from a VR agency. Fears of losing disability cash benefits and Medicare coverage were reasons many beneficiaries chose not to participate in rehabilitation programs. A recommendation was that changes in the benefit payment structure could increase the number of beneficiaries who return to work. (Appendixes include instruments and data.) (YLB)",

To stimulate competition, the Department of Education awarded planning grants to four institutions that had applied to enter the competition for the National Center (Berkeley, Ohio State, Northern Arizona University, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University). The first three  of these institution eventually completed the grant application process. Five field readers were selected by the acting assistant secretary to read and score applications on the basis of published evaluation criteria. Based on these evaluations, Ohio State received the top ranking, followed by Berkeley and Northern Arizona. About a month later, the field readers made site visits to the three applicant institutions. Ohio State and Northern Arizona provided tours of the facilities that would be used for the National Center, whereas Berkeley officials did not. Instead, they discussed their plans for the National Center facilities that would eventually be developed by subcontracting institutions. Afterward, the field readers revised their scores. This adjustment resulted in increases of 2.4,  13.2, and 9.2 points in the respective scores of Ohio State, Berkeley, and Northern Arizona. The assistant secretary then recommended that Berkeley receive the grant because it had the highest score. (MN)",

        "description":"This document provides information about five adult basic education (ABE) staff development programs that illustrate the use of the principles identified in a research report. (The 70 principles and 39 corresponding techniques relate to planning and conducting training for ABE teachers and other staff.) Each of these staff development projects presents a real life example of one or more of the staff development principles. Although four of the five projects are statewide efforts, the examples given have all been applied to local ABE programs with ABE practitioners. Fairfax ABE Program, Virginia, illustrates the technique of a professional development plan and principle of allowing participants to choose their involvement and linking training to an individual plan. The San  Francisco State University technique of coaching addresses the principle of oncall assistance of colleagues at the work site. The technique of staff exchange, which the Wisconsin ABE Program illustrates, involves the principle of providing teachers with the opportunity to meet and share ideas. The Oregon Talent Bank, Oregon State University, phased training technique shows the principle of spacing staff development over time. Maryland's Adult Performance Program illustrates the technique of training for program development and the principle of making staff development a part of program development. (YLB)",

Factor analysis of the 1,624 responses to a 110-item questionnaire identified 20 fundamental priority needs of administrators. Most pressing needs were reported in the areas of organizational planning, organizational principles and practices, computers in information management, and business  planning and marketing. Discriminant analyses performed on both needs scores and data on the respondent and organizational characteristics identified similar and dissimilar patterns of needs for executive directors, assistant directors and program managers, for administrators in each federal region and for administrators in facilities with different daily caseloads. More differences in needs were found among administrators in facilities of different sizes than among the regions.

To achieve this today, educators need to produce writings that are easily accessible through computerized searching (online and on compact disk) in databases. The trend toward end-users doing their own computerized information retrieval has caused database vendors to make changes that ease end-user frustration. In addition, writers can control certain components of the writing process to meet the goal of making their writing more easily located via computerized bibliographic or full-text database searching by end-users and intermediaries. Writers can (1) have a clear and unambiguous title, (2) provide a narrative abstract or annotation, (3) cite authors' names in a consistent format, (4)  select appropriate words for the title and abstract, and (5) furnish an informative document title page.

Data are from the Agricultural Work Force Supplement to the December 1985 Current Population Survey. The three components of the agricultural work force--hired farmworkers, farm operators, and unpaid farmworkers--are examined separately. A comparison of the findings from each of the three work force components follows the analytical results. Additional statistical tables, information on the source and reliability of the survey estimates, and the definitions of key terms used in this report are in the appendixes. Some of the findings of the survey are as follows: (1) more than 8 million people 14 years of age and  older were employed on U.S. farms at some time during 1985, including 2.5 million who did hired farmwork, 2.9 million who operated a farm, and 3.8 million who did unpaid farmwork; (2) more than 1 million workers participated in more than one of these activities; (3) the agricultural work force was predominantly male; (4) nonfarm work was an important sources of earnings for all three agricultural work force groups.

        "description":"Farms and the people who live on them differ dramatically from one part of the United States to another. These differences are prominent both from one region to the next as well as between farms and people in the same region. The varying characteristics of agriculture and the farm population have helped shape regional experiences in the 1980s. In the Midwest and Northern Plains, heavy reliance on income from sales of government-supported crops, large numbers of financially vulnerable midsized farms, and fewer alternative sources of income have led to the most widespread farm financial distress and the most persistent calls for agricultural policy remedies. In other parts of the country, income problems among farm households are as often linked to low earnings in manufacturing as  in agriculture. Still other parts of the farm population are rather affluent and unaffected by federal farm policies. The varying circumstances in which the farm population lives and works affect the likely impacts of agricultural and rural development policies. In some regions, farm policy remains highly significant to farm households and rural communities as a component of income and economic development. In others, farm people themselves are likely to be affected much more by policies directed to all residents than by policies specifically targeting the agricultural sector. (Author/KC)",

The first section recounts the process of developing an integrated environmental science-vocational education program at Sandy Union High School in Sandy, Oregon. Planning a combined program is the subject of the second section, which explains the processes involved in the following four program planning steps: conducting a survey, brainstorming with teachers, zeroing in on a &quot;combined course,&quot; and surveying students. Criteria for selecting teachers are discussed next. The importance of selecting teachers who (1) can be flexible, (2) are compatible with teachers who are not from their own discipline, (3) have solid  backgrounds in their own field, and (4) are student-directed in the sense that they consider student outcomes to be central to instruction, is one of the keys to success. A section on overseeing the program stresses the crucial nature of community support and explains the advantages of having a program advisory committee. Guidelines for assessing the program's success are presented. A sample completed topic analysis, breakdowns of the science and vocational skills addressed in the student/project goals, and a sample environmental science questionnaire and student profile instrument are included.

Content analysis, legal case analysis, standard statistical analysis of data sets, and survey research methodologies were used in the investigation. Almost 300 federal court cases were analyzed; among the findings were that the filing of claims under the ADEA has been  dominated by white males, especially managerial and professional personnel, with 54 percent filed by employees between the ages of 50-59. Older workers usually filed suit only when separated from their jobs. Nationally, employers were victorious 68 percent of the time. In regard to performance appraisal, employers were successful in defending themselves 78 percent of the time, especially if they used standard appraisal methods. The study also found that the majority of employee claims were not upheld by the EEOC, especially in more recent years. Actions in the states studied mirrored the federal findings, although some actions varied among them. Some evidence of retaliation was found.

Several bills have been introduced in the 100th Congress to reauthorize section 127. Without the exclusion, individuals may have to pay taxes on such assistance unless the education meets more stringent tests for an employee business expense deduction. The debate over whether the provision should be reauthorized involves issues of administrative burden, taxpayer equity, investment in human capital, and federal revenue loss. (Author/YLB)",

        "description":"In order to measure the preservice and inservice preparation of vocational education teachers, a mail survey was conducted of beginning vocational teachers' perceptions of their competencies and preparation for teaching--especially their preparation for teaching basic skills and special student populations. The survey population included 740 beginning teachers (a 32 percent response), 69 preservice preparation programs (a 61 percent response), and 530 local school administrators or mentors (a 23 percent response). The study found that vocational teacher preservice preparation gives little or modest attention to preparation for teaching basic skills and special student populations. The majority of beginning vocational teachers received no inservice preparation during their first  year of teaching, and the small amount of inservice education that was offered was judged by them as being only somewhat effective. Apparently, such recent developments as \"induction year programs\" and first-year mentoring and assistance programs for teachers are yet to be implemented in secondary vocational education. Recommendations were made for upgrading teacher education programs by including more liberal arts and more preparation for teaching basic skills and special populations, as well as by having colleges and high schools work together to provide more student experience and inservice programs for beginning teachers. Basic skills competency testing of preservice teachers also seems desirable and inevitable. (KC)",

        "description":"An analysis assessed the effects of a high school vocational curriculum over time as labor market experience accumulates. Since two additional years of labor market experience had become available for respondents to the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience-Youth Cohort (NLS-Youth) and longer trends of effects could be observed, the study replicated the exact specifications of an earlier analysis and added the dimension of expected lifetime earnings. Data were from the NLS-Youth and High School and Beyond databases. Findings indicated that vocational education provided, in the short term, a direct wage advantage for vocational students. The advantage became indirect as time in the labor market accrued and appeared to operate through increased hours of work and  fuller employment rather than differential wage rates. An optimum mix between vocational and academic courses in terms of lifetime earnings was characterized by moderate rather than heavy concentration in vocational education. An alternative theoretical model of the net societal effects of the vocational curriculum was evaluated. It did not appear to be adequate for evaluating the effects of vocational education because several of its key assumptions did not hold when tested by the available data. The analysis associated with this model testing suggested, however, that the pronounced effects of training-related placement operate not through training, but through assisting the vocational graduate in selecting a better-paying job.

        "description":"Alcohol researchers have sought to characterize the relationship between cue responsivity and alcohol consumption by alcoholics. This study used the beverage tasting paradigm to test for differences in cue responsivity in adolescent sons of alcoholics. It was hypothesized that, compared to sons of nonalcoholics, sons of alcoholics would be more insensitive to internal cues to drinking nonalcoholic beverages and more sensitive to external cues to drinking. Subjects were 36 nonalcoholic male college students, matched for current drinking practices, who were randomly assigned to either a preload or a no preload condition. Seventeen subjects were identified through family histories as high-risk because of paternal alcoholism. Presence or absence of internal cues related to drinking  was manipulated by withholding or administering, respectively, preloads of 16 to 20 ounces of water. All subjects were then given orange juice and grapefruit juice to drink. The results revealed a significant interaction between risk group and preload condition, confirming the internality hypothesis. Sons of alcoholics drank significantly more juice following a water preload than did sons of nonalcoholics. The externality hypothesis was not supported. These findings suggest that a non-alcohol-specific \"deficit\" in responsivity to internal cues related to beverage consumption may be a risk factor for the development of alcoholism. (NB)",

White girls (N=150) between the ages of 10 and 13 years completed the Youth Behavior Profile, the Self-Image Questionnaire for Young Adolescents, and the Scale of Early Adolescent Life Events. Physical growth was assessed via physical examination. The results revealed that negative life events, specifically those associated with family and school, were associated with internalizing and externalizing problem behavior, while positive life events were not. Pubertal events were not associated, although an  interaction between pubertal events and negative family events was found. The occurrence of negative family events was more likely to be associated with internalizing behavior in premenarcheal than postmenarcheal girls, while in girls for whom no negative events occurred, internalizing behavior was somewhat higher postmenarcheally than premenarcheally. Positive relationships mitigated the consequences of life events, with main and interaction effects being found. (NB)",

This study used a heterogeneous sample of 722 employees from 8 organizational groupings to investigate possible gender differences on 26 personological variables and 23 job reaction variables. Data analyses revealed relatively few significant differences, and they were of small magnitude. Some differences diminished or disappeared when the effects of gender-related differences in age, tenure, education, job characteristics, occupational category/level, and income were controlled. The findings suggest that men and women are highly similar in their reactions to the world of work and that the modest differences that may be observed largely reflect the spurious effects of differences in the jobs  typically held by men and women. A few gender differences were not accounted for by the covariates, and evidence was noted for some covariates exerting \"suppressor effects\" on gender differences. A developmental path model of male and female job reactions also confirmed the appropriateness of the same causal model for both men and women. (NB)",

Subjects completed the Jenkins Activity Survey-Form C as a measure of the Type A pattern, and provided information on sex, age, education, and job tenure. Trained researchers sat in the same room with one focal subject and recorded information continuously. Hierarchical regression revealed that two components of the broader Type A pattern, hard-driving competitiveness and job involvement,  were better predictors of job demands and work activity than was the global A score. Results support an interactional perspective in that Type As relative to Type Bs received more externally imposed demands from sources such as superiors or peers; yet those same Type As also generated more demand by initiating work tasks for themselves and attending to multiple tasks simultaneously.

        "description":"Since Kohlberg (1958) first extended the cognitive developmental theory of moral judgment to include moral reasoning in adults, it has been found that women tended to score at a lower developmental stage than did men. Gilligan (1982) has conceptualized women's moral reasoning as being different in kind from men's moral reasoning, with women's development focusing on relationships and the contextual aspects of situations and men's development focusing on competition and achievement. This study attempted to address the issue of gender differences in moral reasoning by investigating or controlling factors that may be contributing to this difference. Questionnaires were mailed to 1,207 households selected randomly from a metropolitan area telephone directory. Male (N=39) and female  (N=63) adults completed the surveys by giving written responses to questions about three moral dilemmas with either a male or female protagonist. A relationship between education and age was found such that the lower the age, the higher the education. When just subjects with college educations were compared, a strong trend for lower scores for women was evident on the Kohlberg Moral Maturity Scale when the protagonist in the dilemma was female. Older individuals also tended to score lower. Other results indicated that empathy was not related to the moral reasoning score. Further research is needed to determine the relationships among moral reasoning, gender, sex of the protagonist, education, age, attributions, and empathy. (NB)",

Clearly, individuals differ in the degree to which they evaluate their body image and in the importance they place on their body image. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between self-monitoring, gender, and body image. Undergraduate students (N=177) completed the Self-Monitoring Scale and the Body Self Relations Questionnaire. The results support the self-monitoring and gender hypotheses in that high self-monitors and females paid more attention to, and directed more behaviors toward their physical appearance than did low self-monitors and males, respectively. It was concluded that  the importance placed on physical appearance by high self-monitors may be more general than previously demonstrated. Future research might examine the relationship between other personality variables and how these variables may interact with gender in understanding self-perceived physical appearance. (NB)",

Analyses are presented in five tables that show the out-of-pocket liability for Medicare beneficiaries currently and  under the pending bills for: (1) inpatient hospital services; (2) nursing home care; (3) home health care; (4) Medicare part B services; and (5) services not covered by Medicare. Each table is accompanied by text which includes discussions of the services, Medicare coverage, out-of-pocket expenses, legislative proposals, and GAO comments. A sixth table compares the catastrophic expense protection limits established in the bills. Financing and costs are discussed and presented in the final table. The report concludes that either H.R. 2470 or S. 1127, if enacted, would represent an important step in increasing the health insurance coverage available to the elderly, but that significant gaps would remain.

        "description":"This report presents findings based on interviews with three nationally representative samples of currently married women between the ages of 15 and 44 years, as documented in 1965 National Fertility Study and the 1973 and 1976 National Surveys of Family Growth. Statistics from these surveys are presented on the contraceptive practice of respondents according to various socioeconomic characteristics. Findings are presented in two sections: use of contraception (contraceptive status) and couples using contraception (contraceptors) according to the method used. Findings are discussed which show that changes in contraceptive status, with use increasing from 63% in 1965 to 68% in 1976, were small compared with the changes in methods used among contraceptors. The background and  methodology of the three surveys and trends and differences in the use of contraception are presented. The main body of the text describes trends in use of the pill, intrauterine device, sterilization, and other methods, according to age, race, number of years since first marriage, parity (number of children ever born) and intent to have more children, religion, and education. Within each section, trends and differentials are described. Appendix I contains technical details about the surveys; appendix II provides definitions of terms; and appendix III is a reprint of selected questions on contraceptive use from the 1976 National Survey of Family Growth.

        "description":"Some work in feminist psychology has suggested that male-female differences are not as universal, dramatic, or enduring as has been previously asserted. Feminist psychodynamic theories, in contrast, assert that there are deep-seated and enduring differences between women and men in &quot;self-structure&quot; and relational capacities. Proponents of these theories view gender differences as universal, highly dichotomized, and enduring. Using constructivism as a conceptual framework, gender theories can be considered as representations which either exaggerate or minimize male-female differences. The tendency to exaggerate differences is called &quot;alpha bias,&quot; and the tendency to minimize differences is called &quot;beta bias.&quot; Alpha bias can be seen in psychodynamic theories, Parson's sex role  theory, and in feminist psychodynamic theories. Beta bias can be seen in psychological research on men which is incorrectly generalized to women, in theories that view male and female roles as complementary, in some systems approaches to family therapy, and in recent social policies. All current representations of gender involve alpha and beta bias. The constructivist view holds that the true nature of gender is undecidable. Theories are thus evaluated not by correctness but by utility, by examining how representations of gender have been used to provide the symbols and support the scientific and sociopolitical aims of either the status quo or feminism.

        "description":"For adolescents faced with many developmental tasks, a loved one's death by suicide is a tragic event linked with increased morbidity, death fears, and psychopathology. Adolescents struggle to master tasks such as refining abstract thought, achieving independence, developing values, exploring intimacy in social and sexual relations, and becoming the person one wants to be. Bereavement after suicide confronts the adolescent with the reality of death and with the need to decide if life is worth living without the loved one. Bereaved adolescents are a population in need of counseling. Unresolved bereavement may be one factor leading to adolescent suicide. Adolescent survivors of suicidal death learn that death is permanent, suicide is possible, and they did not prevent the suicide.  Links between bereavement after suicide, development, and adolescent suicide require further study. Inconsistent definitions of adolescence, samples of adolescents in psychotherapy, and other methodological problems limit the understanding of how adolescents cope with bereavement after suicide. Conclusions based on bereaved adolescents in therapy should not be misinterpreted as data about normal bereavement. (Author)",

        "description":"Although there has been much interest in the United States about Japanese education, few studies have examined the Japanese school system from the teachers' perspective. This study investigated 143 Japanese and 386 U.S. high school teachers' attitudes concerning their work conditions, roles and responsibilities, and work experiences. An attitudinal survey was used to record views on their professional situations from 143 Japanese and 386 U.S. teachers. Teachers in the United States scored higher on every item concerning job satisfaction than did the teachers in Japan. The cause of the Japanese teachers' dissatisfaction appeared to be rooted in their expectations of the job before becoming a teacher. While U.S. teachers reported more job centrality than did Japanese teachers, job  centrality took on much more negative attributes in the United States than in Japan. In the area of job stress, the only item significant for the Japanese teachers was concern over the ability of teachers to get control of the curriculum and materials being used in their classrooms, while U.S. teachers were concerned with the concrete problems of their jobs, class size and after-school work, and the general morale of the staff. Differences in concerns between teachers in the two countries appeared to result from the teachers' need to give their students the best possible preparation for becoming a productive person in the society and, therefore, reflected what society felt those prerequisites for entrance should be.

While research has shown that the majority of students obtain some help from peers or instructors, the study of help-seeking as a learning strategy has been virtually neglected. This study examined how help-seeking relates to cognitive learning strategies such as elaboration, metacognition, and resource management. Data were obtained from students in biology, English literature, and social science courses at four different types of higher educational institutions. Strategy use and help-seeking information were obtained using the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. The use of 10 cognitive strategies  was assessed: rehearsal; elaboration; memory techniques; organization; metacognitive techniques of planning, monitoring, and regulating; and resource management of one's time, study environment, and self. The results indicated that students who used various cognitive strategies were also more likely to seek help when needed. This supports the view that seeking help is an alternative means of goal accomplishment to be used when the need arises. Students who were less likely to use various strategies were also less likely to seek the help they needed. (NB)",

It is not known what life factors influence an abused wife's initial choice to leave home and seek help in a shelter agency or to stay home and seek help in a non-shelter agency. This study was conducted to examine the relative importance of various factors associated with where an abused wife initially turns for service in the community. Women (N=75) who entered a shelter for abused wives were interviewed concerning the type of initial contact for help they made and five independent variables: abuse patterns in their family of orientation, their husband's criminal assault record, pregnancy, socioeconomic status, and the length of the marriage. The results revealed that 16 respondents had  initially sought help from the shelter, while the remaining 59 women had initially contacted a variety of community resources as their initial source of help. Data analysis revealed no statistically significant relationship between initial source of help and four of the five independent variables. Length of marriage appeared to influence the behavior of abused wives. The abused wife who had been married for 5 years or longer was found to be more likely to seek help initially at a shelter than was the abused wife who had been married for less than 5 years. The decision of where to seek help initially appears to be the result of a complex interplay of factors, the length of the marriage being only one of those factors. (NB)",

The paper includes an overview of theoretical models used to explain adolescent suicidal behavior, including Durkheim's theory of suicide, social learning theory, psychoanalytic theory, psychological and social-psychological approaches, biological approaches, family systems theory, and human ecological theory. Emphasis is placed on the human ecological model, which provides a multidisciplinary approach to understanding adolescent suicide that incorporates individual,  environmental, and social system factors that may influence adolescent suicidal behavior. As a first step toward an ecosystem intervention approach for suicide prevention and intervention, existing literature on adolescent suicide is reviewed and categorized according to the human ecological model, with an emphasis on family dynamics and suicidal behaviors. Ecosystem predictors of suicidal behaviors are discussed at the organism, microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem levels. Recommendations for interventions and prevention efforts are made at each of the levels. Fifty-nine references are included. (NB)",

Questionnaires and interviews were conducted to examine grandfather-grandchild interaction patterns and the personal meaning of grandfatherhood. Subjects were 106 men between the ages of 40 and 84 years. A modified random-digit telephone dialing procedure was used to contact a random sample of households from which participants were recruited. Kivnik's measure of perceived meaning of grandparenthood was used to obtain information on the personal dimensions of grandfathering. It was found that older grandfathers tended to  have less contact with grandchildren than did younger grandfathers. The gender of the grandchild was not a significant predictor of frequency or type of interaction. All five of the grandparenthood meaning factors correlated positively with age, three significantly: reinvolvement, centrality, and indulgence scores were higher for older grandfathers. In addition, the lower a grandfather scored on a self-rated measure of health, the more likely he was to agree that he gave more than he received in relationships with grandchildren. (Author/NB)",

Data from the Maine Office of Data, Research and Vital Statistics revealed that both the number of births to adolescents as a percentage of all births and the birth rate for adolescents declined through the 1970s and into the mid-1980s. The percentage of  adolescents not married at the time they gave birth rose from 20.9% in 1970 to 58.0% in 1985. For the years of 1980 through 1984, adolescent mothers began prenatal care on average about one-half month later than did older mothers. Compared to infants born to older mothers, a higher percentage of infants born to adolescents weighed less than 2,500 grams. The trend was linear, with the highest percentage of low birthweight infants being born to the youngest mothers. The mean Apgar scores for infants born to adolescents were lower than were scores for infants of older mothers. Adolescents were disproportionately represented in the category of abortions. (NB)",

GAO obtained data from state agencies; a total of 19 providers who delivered services to the targeted populations; and 278 state- and local-level interest groups involved in alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health issues in California, Colorado, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, Texas, and Vermont. The results revealed that the eight states studied used a variety of procedures to collect  information about program needs. In most cases, states allocated their funds according to historical trends or to maintain existing service delivery systems, rather than relying on the results of their needs assessments. The federal requirements to set aside funds for targeted populations promoted a minimum level of spending for new or expanded services to target groups. In 40% of cases, the states increased their commitment to provide required services. In remaining cases, states addressed requirements by either using projects they had already planned or by passing the responsibility for the requirements to local service providers. (NB)",

It explains the three epidemiological indices commonly used to describe a population in the study of dementing illnesses: mortality, prevalence, and incidence. National prevalence rates of senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease are presented and reasons for variations in the prevalence rates are cited, including methodological techniques, a lack of diagnostic specificity, differences in disease severity, and the sampling procedures used. The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in North Dakota is then described. Methods used to project the prevalence of Alzheimer's  disease in North Dakota residents aged 60 years and older for the period 1980 through 2000 are discussed. Medicare and Medicaid data obtained from hospital admissions records are presented which substantiate the trends suggested by the projections in the report: Alzheimer's disease is related to age, its connection with gender is unclear, and places with larger populations will have higher numbers of Alzheimer's disease patients. Implications of the report are discussed in the areas of the care of Alzheimer's disease patients, the public understanding of Alzheimer's disease, and the need for further research.

They span interdisciplinary information, person and environment, research and practice, practice and policy, and theory and practice. The values, knowledge, and skills integration that is proposed may not be successfully implemented for three reasons. Two reasons are specific to social work: the impossibility of carrying out all of the activities expected of social work educators and the fact the social work professionals are conflicted concerning their commitment to integration at all levels and fields of practice. Integration is not really respected or rewarded in either practice or academic arenas.  Research reveals that integration is unlikely for any profession in the absence of an integrative structure. The establishment of a national social work linkage service is proposed. The service could focus on the integration of research, policy, and practice while including several areas of integrative concern.

        "description":"The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) was begun in 1958 to trace the effects of aging in humans and to distinguish between the true effects of aging and those processes, including disease, socioeconomic disadvantage, and lack of educational opportunity, that may appear or become more pronounced with time but are biologically irrelevant to the underlying mechanisms of human aging. It has sought to achieve this goal by making measurements on over 1,000 male volunteers who at their entry into the study were aged 17 to 96 years and were living independently in the community. Since 1978, women have been systematically added to the BLSA. This document presents a report of the BLSA's first 23 years. Chapter I describes methods for the study of aging. Chapter II provides a  literature review of studies that illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the longitudinal method and that were conducted on normal community-residing adults. Chapter III describes the general design of the study, characteristics of the subjects, the tests used, data storage and retrieval, and methods of data analysis. Chapter IV describes in detail the testing procedures followed. The results of published BLSA cross-sectional analyses are summarized in chapter V, while those based on longitudinal examinations of selected variables are summarized in chapter VI, and 35 of those longitudinal studies themselves are reprinted in the appendix, which comprises over half of this volume. Preceding the appendix, the seventh and last chapter looks at future directions for the BLSA. Thirty-five  tables and 48 figures are included, and a 386-item reference list is provided. (NB)",

        "description":"Use of a mediator to facilitate voluntary agreements between disputants is becoming a widely used method of conflict resolution in a variety of contexts. This study simulated a dispute to examine the influence of mediator and negotiator gender on mediator behavior. Male (N=94) and female (N=94) college students mediated a computer-simulated dispute between either two males, two females, or a male/female pair. The results revealed a gender difference in the type of messages the mediators sent to those designated as bargainers. Compared to females, males were more confident in their ability to mediate and felt that their recommendations had greater influence on negotiators. It was more important to females that the negotiators approve of their recommendations. Males used coercive  pressing and compensating tactics more than did females; females used integrating tactics and were more inactive than were males. Mediators were more likely to use coercive pressing and compensating tactics with opposite gender negotiation pairs than with same gender pairs. No gender related effects were found for the quality of mediators' proposals. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Research using expectancy models has shown contraceptive choice among adults to be a rational process in that intentions and behaviors reflect an individual's beliefs, values, attitudes, and perceptions of social norms. This study examined whether such an approach could accurately represent adolescents' contraceptive decision-making. It used the model of reasoned action developed by Fishbein and Ajzen (1980) to examine intention to use each of four methods of birth control (pill, condom, diaphragm, and withdrawal) in the next year. Adolescents (N=505) seeking health care from either a university adolescent medicine clinic or an adolescent clinic of a large health maintenance organization were interviewed regarding their beliefs, values, and intentions regarding contraceptive use.  Analyses were performed separately for the four groups of sexually active/inactive males and females. The results support the utility of the model in the adolescent sample. For sexually active and inactive females, beliefs about the consequences of use of each method and evaluations of those consequences were significantly related to subjects' global attitude or overall attitude about using the contraceptive. For males, these relationships were significant for three of the four methods. The findings suggest that adolescents do engage in a rational process in making contraceptive choices and that these relate to their intentions as well as their behaviors. (NB)",

The basic goal of the PAL program is given as helping the younger students to have a more positive and productive school experience and to make more responsible and informed decisions. Activities in which PAL students participate are listed, including outreach programs in the communities which deal with teenage sexuality, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse. It is noted that PAL students provide younger students with individual and  group peer support, discussion sessions, and tutorial assistance. The history of the PAL program since its beginning in 1980 is briefly reviewed, PAL student training is described, and results of evaluations of the PAL program are discussed which attest to its success. The role of the PAL Advisory Committee, a volunteer organization of outstanding former PAL students, is discussed and future uses of PAL as a model program are considered. (NB)",

        "description":"Social gerontological studies have found little relation between family availability and interaction and well-being of the elderly. Friendship and neighboring interactions seem more consistently related to well-being, but even this is not universal. This study, conducted to examine whether similar patterns exist in other age groups, included young adults, early middle-aged adults, late middle-aged adults, and older adults to compare the effects of social support on well-being in different stages of adulthood. Data were obtained from the Quality of American Survey which provided interview data from 3,692 adults about their social-psychological condition, their needs and expectations from life, and the degree to which their needs were satisfied. The results showed that family  support had the strongest effect on well-being of men and women in early adulthood. Support by friends was the next highest predictor of well-being, followed by support by neighbors. All three supports were found to be significantly related to well-being for young adults. Similar patterns were found for other age groups as well. These findings support the hypothesis that social support is positively related to well-being. These findings were different from findings of previous social genrontological studies, possibly due to the difference in measuring interaction and social support variables. The findings do appear to be consistent with various theories in social gerontology. (NB)",

        "description":"In order to investigate the text structure/reading comprehension relationship, this paper reviews recent research on text representation theories. Text structure investigation--research on semantic memory as it is concerned with meaning from the word level through the inference level--follows the premise that sentences are understood in the context of their use if the comprehender has the ability to project meaning to the concept. Five models of text structure, intended to explicate the comprehension of reading, are examined in the paper: (1) Crother's logical relations model; (2) Meyer's hierarchical organization model; (3) Frederiksen's constructive model of discourse proceeding; (4) Kintsch's model of semantic memory; and (5) the Anderson and Reder encoding elaboration model.  The paper explains the analytic system of each model, in which text comprehension is assessed by comparing author intent with reader recall. The theoretical base and distinctive features of each model are detailed, and the methodology and findings of supporting research are reviewed. Other issues addressed in the paper include how text structure influences the structure created by the reader, how it reflects what is learned and retained, and how it affects information retrieval from the semantic knowledge structure of human memory.

The Dragon System Mark II Isolated Word Speech Recognizer was used in the study, which included four stages. The first phase took place in June 1984 and involved 17 kindergartners; the second phase took place in November l984 and involved 7 kindergartners and 8 first  graders; the third phase took place in late December and involved l0 kindergartners; and the fourth phase took place in August 1985 and involved 6 students who had completed kindergarten and were about to enter first grade. The results of the study indicated that speech recognition technology holds potential for such educational applications as beginning reading instruction. Findings also suggest that human factors, such as microphone handling, responses to recognition errors, responses to prompts and remarks, and need for adult supervision are crucial ingredients in the effective application of speech recognition technology in education.

The whole school day experiences of 52 second and fourth grade children (26 at each grade level) from four school districts were analyzed. The school districts varied in size and community type, and students were drawn from an array of regular education classes  and were provided instructional support services by 20 different specialist teachers (10 Chapter 1 and 10 special education teachers). In order to clarify district and school policies and instructional experiences, interviews were conducted with district and school building administrators, as well as specialist and classroom teachers. Student observational records focused on field notes, curricula materials in use and photocopies of completed student work, and instructional experiences were studied using the Student Observation Instrument (SOI). Findings were analyzed according to district and grade level, and showed that in general, the observed instructional experiences did not fulfill the expectation that remedial and mildly handicapped students had access to larger amounts of superior  instruction. Many students experienced undifferentiated instruction in both classroom and resource room and a fragmentation of curricular experiences. (Forty-five references are appended.) (MM)",

First, descriptions of 23 children's reading and writing behavior were drawn from a group of case studies of children who were participating in Reading Recovery, an early intervention program that targets first grade children at risk of failure in reading. Examination of teachers' daily records of reading and writing and of children's writing samples indicated that when given opportunities to engage in related reading and writing, children did connect those processes in a variety of ways. Second, outcome data were examined to document results of children's participating in this integrated program. Eight dependent variables were used to compare two groups of children  (133 in all) who participated in the program with a group of 37 that participated in another program. Comparisons indicated that children who were deliberately engaged in an integrated program achieved higher scores on both reading and writing measures. Children who were daily engaged in holistic lessons that included reading and writing and stories and messages achieved accelerated progress.

        "description":"Because any reading or writing research project or teaching method rests on some kind of epistemological assumptions and some models of reading and writing processes, a coherent theoretical approach to the interrelationships of the reading and writing processes is needed. In light of the post-Einsteinian scientific paradigm and Peircean semiotics, reading and writing are seen as always involving individuals, with their particular linguistic/experiential resources, in particular transactions with particular environments or contexts. Analyses of the reading and writing processes reveal parallelisms in patterns of symbolization and construction of meaning. The processes associated with &quot;literary&quot; and &quot;nonliterary&quot; reading and writing concern the reader's or writer's stance, which  can fall into different parts of the &quot;efferent/aesthetic continuum&quot;: stance is determined by the proportion of public or private linguistic activity which is admitted into the scope of selective attention--the &quot;efferent&quot; stance, which is concerned chiefly with what can be &quot;carried away&quot; or used, draws on the public aspect of sense, whereas the aesthetic stance includes proportionally more of the experiential, private aspect. Differences between these processes defeat the notion of an automatic cross-fertilization of reading and writing activities. A well-rounded humanistic education encompasses both aspects of the continuum, teaching students to differentiate the circumstances that call for a particular stance.

        "description":"A study focused on the first phase of a longitudinal program of research designed to investigate the feasibility of constructing reading tests closely articulated with specific reading curricula and consistent with the current scientific understanding of reading processes. Participants, 298 beginning third-grade students, took two types of tests developed to investigate the importance of four factors that could influence student test performance: (1) the match between test words and words in the students' instructional program; (2) the emphasis of the students' instructional program; (3) the frequency of occurrence of each word; and (4) the decodability of each word. The tests were developed, first to investigate the importance of these factors in determining the validity of  measures of decoding speed and accuracy, and next to investigate the importance of these factors on measures of speed and accuracy of recognizing word meaning. Words for both tests were presented to students using a specially prepared personal computer program. The results indicated a strong relationship between word frequency and the difficulty of the word, both for the decoding speed and accuracy test and the test of word recognition. (Eight tables of data are included; 27 references are attached; and six appendixes present data of Decoding Speed and Accuracy and Word Recognition Tests, the test administration computer program, and instructions to test administrators and students.

        "description":"As more and more students arrive at colleges increasingly unprepared, the issue of how to teach effective study skills becomes more important. Yet, research on study skills is far from conclusive. Study skills may be defined as any activity or behavior which enhances the learning and recall of new academic material, and includes such activities as note taking, underlining, and use of mnemonic devices. It has been suggested that in some cases academic problems are not a result of poor study skills per se but other factors or variables. These include: (1) poor organizational skills; (2) emotional disturbance; (3) poor coping skills; (4) unresolved identity crisis; (5) use of inappropriate study skill strategies; (6) inappropriate major or career choice; (7) inability to determine a  major or minor; and (8) poor or nonexistent academic advising. Educators must address these issues in a vigorous forthright manner. In summary, many variables in the world of &quot;study skills&quot; still need to be examined. Personality traits may play a larger role than previously believed. Future research is imperatively needed. (Twenty-two references are attached.) (ARH)",

All subjects recalled two of four counter-balanced passages, completed the Slosson Subtest of Verbal Ability, and responded to interview questions which assessed their perceptions of the frequency of home literacy experiences. Subjects' parents also completed surveys which measured the frequency of home literacy experiences. Results indicated that: (1) the amount and quality of home literacy activity affected the recall of prosodic information among kindergartners; (2) children with  higher verbal scores were less affected by passage unfamiliarity than were children with lower verbal scores; and (3) regardless of verbal ability, subjects who reported a high frequency of literacy activities in their homes were better able to cope with unfamiliar content than were their peers who reported a lower frequency of home literacy activity.

Forty-two kindergarten classes from 15 Illinois school systems were selected and observed. Interviews were also held with kindergarten teachers and their principals. With teacher behavior as the focus, it was estimated that 21.6% of the 233 hours spent in classrooms was used for reading and reading-related activities. Results showed that phonics instruction was most apparent because what was taught came directly from workbooks that were supplemented with ditto-sheet  exercises; and the subject matter in the workbooks was reflected not only in items on report cards but also in first-grade teachers' expectations for entering first graders. Differences in kindergartners' abilities had minimal effects on the content of instruction, despite the fact that interest in identifying differences was the reason cited for the use of Gesell-like developmental tests. The possibility that reliance on one methodology and whole class instruction may have combined to make some kindergartners appear to be &quot;unready&quot; was never referred to by either teachers or principals. Both the teachers and principals were interested in having transitional first grades to help kindergarten. (Four data tables and 28 references are attached.) (JK)",

The study was divided into three parts. The first part, which compared college grades, ACT scores, and high school grades between students with and without high school newspaper or yearbook experience, examined 19,249 students enrolled in 10 colleges and universities who had completed at least one year of college. Results indicated that the 4,798 students who had served on their high school  newspaper or yearbook scored higher than their counterparts without publications experience. The second part examined 1,204 students who had taken the ACT Assessment tests and the ACT COMP Prospectus Writing test segment, in order to compare the collegiate writing samples of students with and without high school newspaper/yearbook experience. Results revealed that students with publications experience scored significantly higher than those without such experience. Finally, the third part surveyed 558 students with high school publications experience to detect influences of a journalism credit course per se in relationship to all other language arts courses that students took for credit, with results indicating the importance of journalism education as a route to good writing.

In the first part of the study, subjects, 80 children (aged 4, 6, 8, and 10 years, selected from a middle socioeconomic population) who had average to high-average scholastic ability, were asked to make up individual stories about a child their own age who has a problem to solve. In the second part, the same subjects were presented with a balance beam apparatus and asked to predict and to explain the resting position of beam when weights  were placed in varying amounts. In the third part, the children were given the Mr. Cucumber Working Memory Measure. Results supported the previous notions that children's cognitive development proceeds through the same sequence of steps in a given domain and that children go through the same sequence during the same range. At the group level, performance on the three tasks was shown to be structurally equivalent and statistically indistinguishable, and, although the performance of individual subjects revealed more variation, the same general pattern held.

Early studies involved traditional experimental research instruments and looked not at the learning process but at the written product, measuring number of words, errors, number of revisions and quality of product rather than evaluating focus, organization and the ability to use arguments, details and examples effectively. When asking if student writing is instantly transformed via the computer's magic wand the more relevant question is not whether the writing is good or bad, but rather whether students have become more engaged by the writing process and acquired more  sophisticated techniques for composing, revising and editing. Better instruments for evaluating and comparing texts must be devised if research results are to be significant. Although the important relationships between context and writing have gone unexplored until fairly recently, they are increasingly recognized as an important element; context-sensitive classroom-based research can provide important information for developing teaching strategies and hopefully shed light on the relationship to the students' progress as learners.

Performance-related writing may be simplistic, but its composition is more complex--in occupational writing, context, audience assessment, attention to detail, concise clarity, message organization, and organization of relevant illustrations are more important than style and mechanics. Occupational reading seems simple, but it depends heavily on the use of prior knowledge and insightful interpretation. Given awareness of occupational competencies and the need for their instruction, teachers of most subjects can show students how to write and read task-oriented messages and how to find and use information. While work-related  writing instruction could require varied information formats, occupationally-relevant reading instruction should address identification and use of appropriate resources and references. Cooperative efforts should establish logical connections between reading, writing, and vocational applications. For example, Applied Communication, a problem-based learning curriculum which focuses on the needs of high school vocational students, is being developed through the cooperative efforts of vocational and English communication experts.

        "description":"By adopting the principles of activist education common to women's studies programs--appreciation of the heterogeneous student population and its varied writing needs; simultaneous study of theory combined with active political work; concern for the personal and the political; and a practice of democratic classroom and administrative processes--progressive changes can be made which are necessary for a truly critical literacy to emerge in society. There are two dominant perspectives in literacy research: &quot;literacy-determinant,&quot; emphasizing the important cognitive and cultural consequences resulting from the introduction of literacy into society, and &quot;context-determinant,&quot; focusing on the potentialities and restraints which the socio-political/cultural environments and institutions  impose on individual attempts to acquire literacy. A third perspective, the literacy-context dialectic, reveals how an inadequate analysis of the function of context leads to an ineffectual pedagogy. Dealing with context requires that educators go beyond the narrow confines of the classroom and recognize complex struggles of power and ideology taking place largely through language in other arenas. In composition studies, a more heterogeneous approach, such as that found in many women's studies programs, can counteract the disciplinary tendency to teach expository prose created for and by a homogeneous population of mostly white male writer-subjects living in the subject-centered world of the patriarchal status quo.

However, the technique of information transfer, which involves presentation of a visual stimulus to prompt writing, can be used effectively to practice the skills most university-level writing requires--restatement and reorganization of a given body of material. Information transfer may be used to teach the various types of academic discourse commonly encountered by college students: process descriptions, narration, physical description, comparison and contrast, categorizing and listing, cause and effect, and generalizing from numerical data. When using this technique, teachers should always present the visual  stimulus to the class in a series of instructional moves paralleling those leading up to a writing assignment in a content course.

The effects of three study conditions (review only, study questions, and analytic essay writing) on students' written products, reasoning processes, and measures of learning from text were examined. One teacher of American History and two of her 11th grade classes participated in: (1) a three month observational stage in which case study techniques were employed with six students to determine the typical approaches to American History utilized in the  general and academic courses; and (2) an experimental stage in which 22 participating students read, wrote about and took a battery of tests on prose passages excerpted from textbooks and completed a series of read-and-study tasks, while l8 of their classmates completed the same tasks while composing aloud. Results indicated analytic writing enabled the students to tap personal knowledge and use concepts in new situations, and enabled general students to recall specific information from text at least as well as the academic students. Study questions enabled students to focus on the text in a full yet more superficial way. (Six tables of data are included, and 20 references and three appendixes are included.) (NH)",

Ninety-six male subjects participated, the first group consisting of 50 college freshmen and sophomores, and the second group consisting of 46 inmates at a county prison. Subjects were administered Hogan's Empathy Scale, which assesses intraceptive versus projective thinking, and the Whitman Poetry Questionnaire, which was constructed to measure accuracy of poetry interpretation. Correct interpretations were derived from Whitman scholar Gay Allen's (1957)  illustrations of subtle mystical and pantheistic religious themes in Whitman's poetry. Incorrect interpretations were constructed to reflect either cliches from Judeo-Christian thought or common Judeo-Christian religious sentiments or emotional reactions. Subjects scoring high on the Empathy Scale (intraceptive thinkers) tended to perceive Whitman's subtle religious messages, while low scorers (projective thinkers) tended to give conventional interpretations to the poetry.

Because readers vary from being very knowledgeable in the subject of a document to lacking in knowledge, and because they process information at different rates and levels of efficiency, writers must &quot;customize&quot; their writing to fit the reader's need for information and their abilities to process that information. Cognitive psychology describes the information processing of the mind so that a writer can construct text to take advantage of this processing. Some examples of information processing structures include syntactical structures (such as  information &quot;chunking&quot;), semantic structures (or the word's denotative/connotative meaning), and contextual structures (what setting, situation, and prior text provide). When writing instructions, the writer must keep in mind these processes, along with other reader assumptions and schema. For example, knowing that the reader is concerned with many schema tells the writer to keep things simple, reducing conditionals to manageable lengths and forms.

When a story is passed along orally, it sometimes changes so much that it may not be recognizable as the same when two versions are compared. Subjects included five traditional ballad singers, whose performances on different occasions were analyzed to determine changes in recall and changes among individual singers. Recall stability over a generation was examined by comparing the current versions with versions collected between 1912 and 1944. The recall of a naive group, 27 undergraduates who learned and recalled one version of the ballad, was also assessed. Results show that  constraints present in this ballad limit the possible variations that can occur. Any variations must preserve at least the verse structure, the verse sequence, the line sequence within each verse, the rhyme scheme, and the metrical pattern. Verses that embellish the details of the story may be omitted. Constraints were preserved in versions of the ballad collected in the 70 years and to some degree by undergraduates hearing the ballad for the first time. (ARH)",

        "description":"Memorable language that delights children, makes them laugh or gasp, or causes them to ponder and wonder is the literature that will begin the process of teaching them to read and write. Literature is meant to connect, not with reason primarily, but with readers' and listeners' imaginations and emotions, and in the case of poetry, with something even more basic, their sense of rhythm. Although children may know how to read, whether they actually read or not depends on how early experiences with print have made them feel. Good stories can begin to teach children to read and to write simply because, if they are gripping enough, they will make them want to read them for themselves and eventually to write them. Good stories for children are those in which strong and interesting  characters are involved in dramatic, adventurous, or humorous action. Another way literature can teach children how to read and write is through its predictable patterns and repetitions. The predictability and repetitions confirm a child's intuitions about how language works. The best stories, poems, and informational pieces will teach children to love what words can do, and to care about words is the first step in learning to read and write.

        "description":"If the various academic disciplines are considered as cultures, with their own language, literature, behavior, and mode of discourse, then more and more the need of educated readers is to read across disciplines or multiculturally, and the goal of college writing teachers should be to encourage students' interdisciplinary reading. Respect for the structure and perspective of an unfamiliar discourse can bring readers nearer to a world view other than their own, thereby extending opportunities for interdisciplinary thinking. Since &quot;translating&quot; from one discipline into another would serve only to reinforce the biases and boundaries of a person's thinking, it is important for readers to read authentic discourse, not simplified rewrites. An analysis of the discourse of musical  theory, for example, reveals that its structural relationships have implications for critics and structural theorists in many fields of discourse. Similarly, many articles in scholarly scientific journals have immediate social implications, and all offer another model of the universe, restricted to a statement of problem, methods, results, and discussion. While some of these articles are dependent on specialized vocabulary to the extent that they are removed from the domain of a general audience--possibly authors of such works could learn flexibility of form from the humanist, exploration of alternatives form the philosopher. The writings of Oliver Sacks provide an excellent example of interdisciplinary thinking: he transforms the scientific case study into an interpretive, humanistic  essay--without &quot;translation&quot; or simplification.

Students were required to make an entry of at least three lines every day, all writing was confidential, and the journals were not graded. Punctuation skills, grammar, and sentence structure improved in most cases, the length of sentences and paragraphs improved in all cases. Ninety percent of the students indicated a positive feeling about writing, and a majority reported that they enjoyed sharing reading and writing with their classmates. Difficulties in using this teaching technique included the amount of teacher time  spent in answering the journals on a daily basis, and the problem of motivating students to write. Overall, results indicated that the dialogue journals were successful in combining the need for a culture-based learning style which emphasized group cooperation, and pragmatic learning based on experiences.

Conceptual analysis, which relates abstract concepts to the lives of students, meets this need. While focusing primarily on the composing process, the technique also encourages the use of cooperative learning strategies, critical thinking skills, and interdisciplinary teaming situations. When conducting an analysis of a specified concept, students write six &quot;cases,&quot; or stories which exemplify the concept, but without using the concept or term in question. Students writing about the concept of freedom, for example, will write stories illustrating what freedom  is, what freedom is not, what freedom may or may not be, what freedom is from a group or individual perspective, and what freedom is from a &quot;science fiction&quot; perspective. As students compose the cases, they list related terms which are later used to form a definition of the concept. Finally, the stories are published, and a presentation is prepared which applies the concept to an issue in the everyday lives of the students. (Six references are appended.) (ARH)",

For centuries, debates have existed over whether punctuation is determined by grammar, or whether its primary function is to signal the &quot;prosody&quot;--the patterns of pitch and stress and hesitations--that authors intend and that readers attribute to a piece of writing. One reason for the inconclusiveness of these debates is the fact that prosody and grammar often support each other. Much 19th-century writing included punctuation that was not in accord with grammatically based rules. However, other literature (for example, certain unpunctuated sequences in James Agee's &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;) shows how punctuation, or the  lack of punctuation, does not reflect the way the writing sounds. These styles of writing are distinguished by the degree to which their punctuation captures the prosody of the inner voice. Reading aloud can make the inner voice overt by turning written language into spoken language, but whereas reading aloud is subject to various physical and psychological constraints, the inner voice is not. In teaching writing, the importance of listening to what is written should be stressed. In addition to being sensitized to their inner voices, students can benefit from knowing the range of available punctuating options. (Five references are appended.) (MM)",

        "description":"A study investigated one way in which teachers can focus on more than children's products and writing processes by examining their social processes as well, specifically the health of the classroom communities and the individual children's comfort within those communities. Under the supervision of the same teacher, &quot;journal time&quot; in three classes (kindergarten, first/second grade, and second/third grade in an urban, socially and ethnically diverse school) was observed twice a week for 5 months during 1985 and 4 months during 1986. Although approximately 80 students were observed, the study focused closely on eight students, four kindergartners and four first-graders. Children's talk was audiotaped, observational notes on their behavior were recorded, and all journals were  photocopied. Case studies of two of the students illustrate the notion of multiple worlds, where writing could appear in the contexts of an imaginary world, a present social world, and a wider experienced world. In these contexts, writing developed as it became embedded in the children's lives, and as it became a way of understanding their own experiences and of interacting with others.

A total of 78,045 sixth-grade students wrote a clarification composition focusing on their favorite place to eat and explaining why they preferred that particular place, and 81,047 eighth-grade students wrote letters to a television producer persuading the producer, with sufficient elaboration, that where they live is the best place to live. Compositions were scored using a holistic scale of one to four, in addition to an independent score of a &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; with respect to the usage of standard English conventions. Results showed that 47.40% of the  sixth graders and 66.07% of the eighth graders wrote well enough to score at or above the mid-point of the four point scale. A majority of the students displayed a reasonable command of English conventions. Writing scores for both grades improved when clarification and persuasive writing were measured.

The study also examined the relationship between the literature children read and the stories they write, and traced the evolution of children's constructs of genre with cumulative exposure to a genre-based curriculum. Field notes were taken on the teacher's structuring of classroom curriculum, the participant formats of Language Arts  activities, and the literacy environment (books in the classroom and library, videos, audio tapes, field trips) in which the acquisition of genre was embedded. Data also included lesson transcripts, and transcripts of learners' formal and informal interviews with the teacher and a researcher. The children's stories were collected after they had read within a particular genre. Findings suggest that a combination of inter- and intra-genre exploration across different media, facilitated by context-sensitive pedagogical strategies, best promotes the extension of children's notions of genre.

        "description":"Decontextualization, referring to the abstraction of a written text from all of its contexts, is a flawed concept. Rather than viewing writing as an isolated abstraction, a text's involvement with the human world should be acknowledged. Two major questions arise when dealing with the concept of decontextualization: (1) Can written discourse be rendered meaningful context-free? and (2) Is the locus of meaning solely within the text? Several types of context are involved in written discourse--linguistic, situational, cultural, and textual. To consider language as decontextualized means to consider it removed from the totality of its contexts, a theoretically impossible isolation. In addition, the five components of written discourse--writer, content, reader, meaning, and  intertextuality--are not static in their relationship but are in continuous intermingling motion. The assumption that any one component can be isolated, even for analytical inspection, without regard for the other four leads inevitably to further related arbitrary separations in language study. Socio-political implications of decontextualization are also evident. Those who invest the written word with the power of revealing meaning to the exclusion of situational, personal renderings of meaning are upholding the authority of the printed documents of society over those who might otherwise question the traditional culture.

        "description":"In an attempt to understand what expressive writing means to themselves and to their students, teachers should explore and reflect on various questions regarding expressive writing theories and practices. For many, self-expression is the basis of all serious writing and an important stage in any act of learning, so it is essential to uncover the assumptions that different schools of expressive writing pedagogy make about the self. The psychological theories of Abraham Maslow, Sigmund Freud, and William James have contributed to American notions of self in the 20th century, and their theories present three distinct views of self, which resonate in the composition texts of Ken Macrorie and James Miller. Maslow's concept of self is a unified entity central to the person's being, and  its writing pedagogy emphasizes listening to the inner voice this self projects. Freud's view of self is structured into parts which interact with each other, and these interactions--particularly between the conscious and unconscious--form the self. Strategies employed by this pedagogy encourage the writer to free the repressed part of the self in order to find what is natural and true. The &quot;multiple&quot; view of self, as described by James, is like a fluctuating and changing stream, and multiple view pedagogies incorporate this perception of self into their teaching strategies, focusing on stream-of-consciousness writing. Teachers should question whether they are teaching self-discovery under the guise of &quot;expressive writing.&quot; (MM)",

        "description":"Voice is a useful critical concept for studying texts, and can be classified into three types: (1) audible voice--how much the reader &quot;hears&quot; the text; (2) dramatic voice--what kind of speaker or writer is implied in the text; and (3) one's own voice--the relationship of the text to the actual writer. Written language is more likely to be heard if it uses the syntax, rhythms, and word-choice characteristic of speech. Certain textual clues, such as short simple sentences or sentences which give the sense of mental activity, also call attention to the audibility of a text. The dramatic dimension of a text can derive from the audible voice, but even in the absence of an audible voice, the voice of the implied author is present. There are three aspects to one's own, or the actual  writer's, voice: (1) a distinctive, recognizable voice; (2) &quot;having a voice&quot; or &quot;having the authority to speak&quot;; and (3) &quot;authentic voice&quot; or resonance, meaning the relationship of the text to the real author as opposed to the implied author.

In a case study, the issue of racial hatred can be objectively discussed as students gather evidence (either fictional or factual) and draw conclusions based upon it, leading to a cause and effect analysis of the event described. Literature which addresses racial hatred, such as Ernest Gaines'&quot;A Gathering of Old Men&quot; and &quot;The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,&quot; lends itself to a case study treatment because students must use the individual narratives of the novels as primary source material for deriving a &quot;factual&quot; reconstruction of  the novels' events. Various preliminary activities, including role plays and studies of character motivation, use reader responses to search for meaning in the novels which can then be related to the student's own experiences. After considering their affective responses, students can approach the issue by writing a formal case study, thereby permitting the expression of emotional and intellectual reactions.

The paper examines the rhetoric of science literature to illustrate the predominant focus and limitations of the problematic that emerged in the l970s from the &quot;Weltanschauungen&quot; perspective; discusses a new emerging synthesis based on pragmatism and realism that reshapes the problematic; and sketches an outline of a new realist methodology specifically designed for the newly focused problematic and suggests how it might be employed to arrive at improved  insights into the rhetoric of science. Four general regulatory rules for method selection and application which appear to be consistent with concerns raised in a review of the literature on the rhetoric and philosophy of science are: (1) methods for study of internal science communication should be consistent with the most evolved understanding of the philosophy of science; (2) some of the methods should serve to reveal perceptions and understandings of science and rhetoric that scientists have as individuals; (3) methods should be specifically appropriate to an understanding of internal scientific communication; and (4) applications of methods should distinguish between the physical/natural sciences and the social/behavioral sciences.

Faculty development workshops can teach colleagues these skills, using consultations with faculty members who can tell how they applied what they learned in earlier workshops, practicing the assessment of sample student performances provided on tape or in person, and providing follow-up sessions periodically after the formal workshop is over. Fundamental issues involved include (1) whether form and content are related; (2) how much communication depends on its context; and (3) whether evaluation should be analytic or holistic. Classroom  assignments--oral reports, debates, and role-playing--can incorporate speech communication into different disciplines. However, using a wide variety of speaking and listening assignments requires a broad range of methods for assessing student performance, including rating scales, which translate easily into numerical scores; check lists, based on the completion of specified behavioral objectives; holistic evaluation, where judgment is seen as a contextual adaptation; and peer evaluation. Problems faced by faculty seeking to implement speaking skills include how to evaluate listening, and how to deal with students who never speak in class, or who demonstrate a high level of anxiety.

Differences among the three groups of students were assessed from the perspective of Mehrabian's theory of emotion. Predictors of anxiety about a nursing career were investigated for the overall sample and for the three groups separately. Findings indicated that baccalaureate  students were the least apprehensive about communication and felt most dominant in their setting. Associate degree students were most anxious about nursing if they did not feel dominant, while diploma students were most anxious if they did not feel dominant or were apprehensive about communication, and baccalaureate students were most anxious if they were generally unhappy.

Indepth telephone interviews were conducted with spokespersons for 13 companies responsible for an advertisement portraying violence against women during the past decade. Respondents were asked questions concerning target audience, type of response expected, presence of implied violence against women in their advertisements, impact of the advertisement on sales, and use of market research.  The discussion focuses on 12 print ads and one television commercial appearing between 1975-1985. Results showed that over twice as many of the ads targeted women as men. As to impact on sales and use of market research, all representatives said that the effect of one ad could not be measured, and vehemently denied that the choice of advertisement depicting violence toward women was supported by market research. In addition, eight of the representatives were aware of the suggested violence against women in their advertisements, but justified it as being humorous or artistic. Most of the ads had resulted in public outcries. The fact that many women tolerate being abused in the media could indicate that women have been socialized to view themselves as victims.

The first of these peace films, &quot;If You Love This Planet,&quot; consists of words and images from a speech by Dr. Helen Caldicott, author and spokesperson for Physicians for Social Responsibility, which questions the industrial nations' increasing stocks of nuclear arms. &quot;Speaking Our Peace&quot; follows Muriel Duckworth, a Canadian peace activist, through a series of conversations with women in Canada and the Soviet Union which introduce the breadth of women's involvement in peace efforts. Three spin-off films resulted  from &quot;Speaking Our Peace&quot;: &quot;A Writer in the Nuclear Age: A Conversation with Margaret Laurence&quot;; &quot;Nuclear Addiction: Dr. Rosalie Bertell on the Cost of Deterrence&quot;; and &quot;A Love Affair with Politics: A Portrait of Marion Dewar.&quot; All three spin-off films are relatively short (10-27 minutes) and would lend themselves to use in classes or club meetings, and, like the other films, develop the theme that despair is not an appropriate response to a nuclear world, action is, and &quot;ordinary&quot; people can make a difference.

If this trend continues, words will cease to have precise meanings, and thus cease to be conveyors of thought, expression, and philosophies. It is up to educators to reverse this trend and redouble their energies in the area of verbal training. The back to basics movement (teaching vocabulary, for example) is a good beginning, but it does not go far enough; communication skills ought to be a priority in school systems and ought to be taught in a systematic way, so that the need for offering remedial English courses in college and in business organizations would diminish.

        "description":"The German sociologist and communication theorist Jurgen Habermas' theory of communication as it applies to the problems of developing nations takes into account both the structural factors that hinder indigenous development as well as the individual psychology of the citizens of the less-developed countries (LDC). This paper details the application of that theory. Following the introduction which discusses various models that have attempted to both explain and predict the process of &quot;progress&quot; in the less-developed countries since the late l950s, the paper presents the first component of Habermas' model, critical theory, which attempts to combine the transcendental spiritualism of Kant and Hegel and the materialism of Marxism. Next the paper examines Habermas' position that  psychoanalysis is the avenue by which individual persons and the society methodologically achieve &quot;self-reflection,&quot; a prerequisite for the emancipation of individuals from unnecessary domination. The paper then discusses Habermas' theory of communicative competence which has two parts: (1) universal pragmatics, and (2) ideal speech situation. The paper closes with a discussion of the specific area of communication rights where Habermas' thought has been paralleled most closely, and a critique which suggests a major weakness of Habermas' theory of communication and governance; that is, his assumption that all people at all times are able to offer and accept only rationally argued, bias-free claims.

        "description":"Argumentation courses, which emphasize the theories of argumentation, and debate courses, which teach competitive debate, can effectively teach critical thinking, training students to see situations from a variety of perspectives and then to evaluate those perspectives for their relative merit. William G. Perry maps out nine stages by which college students move from uncritical acceptance of &quot;Authority&quot; to being independent critical thinkers. Debate lends itself to the development of stages One through Six, whereby students move closer to apprehending knowledge as relative and truth as subjective through the processes of defending opposite viewpoints and researching controversial topics. Argumentation is best suited for stages Six through Nine, as it examines how the student's  point of view can best be supported through logic, reasoning, and evidence. For this purpose, Stephen Toulmin's Model of Argumentation provides a method for revealing the interrelatedness of arguments and suggesting the extensive reach of argumentation into students' decision-making lives. Fallacies of reasoning and tests of evidence provide two practical ways for exploring that decision-making process.

        "description":"The image of the family as a secure refuge against a threatening outside world has persisted in the television sitcom since its inception in the early 1950s. Although some television programs have dealt with major problems directly, most, including the sitcom, have completely ignored them. Harnessing hysteria over the possibility of a nuclear attack, early sitcoms made a politically charged point about the status and importance of the nuclear family. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, for example, &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; confirmed the sanctity and security of the borders of the nuclear family and its household--any trouble was always generated by someone on the outside. The placing of the symbolic locus of safety in the nuclear family has occurred at the expense of other social  movements in the United States; anything short of a traditional family is often portrayed as dangerous. The hardships that come to two-career couples, women over the age of 35 who want to give birth, and couples who send their children to daycare are emphasized in &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; and &quot;St. Elsewhere.&quot; These negative images of nontraditional approaches to family are buttressed by the positive images of the old-fashioned way of doing things, as presented in &quot;The Cosby Show.&quot; Although recently there are some exceptions, such as &quot;The Young Ones,&quot; which reverses the customary roles of &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside,&quot; in general even the seemingly innovative sitcoms are a return to the stable, safely defined parameters of the genre.

By reviewing research focusing on family climate, dynamics, communication patterns, role conflict and inconsistency, cohesion, conflict and abuse, attitudes, family rituals, characteristics of children of alcoholics, role models, emotional and psychological disorders in children of alcoholics, defense mechanisms, relationships,  performance in school, and qualities of resilient children of alcoholics, the paper concludes that children of alcoholics are different in many ways from children of nonalcoholics.

        "description":"A study examined the phenomenon of burnout in social service agencies, approaching burnout as a symptom of organizational communication patterns rather than a characteristic inherent in or developed within a particular individual. Sixteen working teams (defined as three or more people in a person-oriented service, who are perceived as a team by their common function within the organization or by their institutional role) participated in the study--eight teams from northern Italy, and eight teams from the northeastern United States. Systemic interviews were conducted, and each team member completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The alternative research method used for this study of social systems integrated two systemic models of interaction--the Milan model, and Pearce and  Cronen's communication theory. The content of the interview questions focused on the various relationships and hierarchical levels within the social service organization, and team responses were required. The study analyzed individual episode questionnaires, and then made an intersystemic comparative analysis of the teams in an attempt to recognize connecting patterns of logic. The application of this method shifted the study of social change (via the study of burnout) from an individually oriented focus to a focus on interactive patterns (i.e. what people do together).

        "description":"The Milan model of systemic family therapy, developed in Italy and based on G. Bateson's cybernetic epistemology, can help meet the goals of a feminist/systemic epistemology in research by accepting data in its &quot;traditional&quot; form yet also connecting it to the act of researching, itself, thereby merging a feminist perspective with the domain of social scientific research. The systemic ideas of hypothesizing, circularity, and neutrality can serve as useful guides for researchers as well as clinicians. Employing these principles in research on communication means continuing an awareness of the researcher's role in choosing the methods and analytical techniques used, and this awareness alters the interpretations of social scientific work. The goal of systemic therapy is to facilitate  change in dysfunctional family systems. By asking questions about various observed or perceived connections between behavior and influences on behavior, a researcher is able to facilitate a change in the way people think about these connections. The use of the Milan systemic ideas helps to celebrate the goals of feminist scholarship and reorient research. This reorientation means rejecting the male tradition of positivistic science which necessarily includes a frame of objectivity where the male norm becomes the observer's perspective.

Section 315 of The Communications Act requires that if a station grants use of the broadcasting station to a legally qualified candidate, then all other qualified candidates for that office shall have equal access. It appears that qualified, minor party candidates no longer have equal access to airwaves, and interviews conducted with television news managements at five western New York commercial television stations confirm this fact. All news personnel agreed that they chose the most hotly contested race of that particular season for a debate, and  that if a minor party candidate did not pose much of a threat to an incumbent, that race was not considered for coverage in a debate format. Selection of a particular race for a debate was based on what kind of television would result, while at the same time serving broad public interest. Minor party candidates were covered by all of the stations interviewed only within the forum of the daily newscasts. The choice of having only major party candidates in a televised debate is not solely based on public interest--production value, convenience of format, and minimizing revenue losses are other considerations.

Most stations preferred live debate, the selection of the panel of questions varied, and all stations except one presented 60-minute programs with live audiences. Some stations included third party sponsorships, such as the League of Women Voters, and usually limited local election debates to those races  which generated significant local interest, such as hotly contested races, or serious challenges to an incumbent. Minor party candidates were rarely included in the debates, unless they appeared to have a chance of winning. The debate schedules of 1987 for these stations were similar to the schedules of 1986, paying heed to the need to get out information to the public while at the same time recognizing the &quot;glitz factor&quot; in producing an interesting product.

Falwell nor Rev. Jackson represented the realistic policy alternatives which might have found some emergent political consensus. In fact, the position Rev. Falwell advocated created a paradox for him (for he began his remarks with the statement that morally wrong), and in addition, those whose impression of Falwell was contaminated by his  association with the Moral Majority were unlikely to be converted to his position because of who he is. As for Jackson, his departure from his initially stated reliance on argument from definition (i.e., principle) to argument from circumstance (i.e., expediency) during the course of the debate signals both a substantive as well as symbolic shift. Although the selection of controversial personalities and issues clearly enhances viewership even for &quot;Nightline,&quot; in the debate on South African apartheid, neither of the positions advocated by Falwell or Jackson represented the middle range of alternatives actively considered by the Reagan administration or by the Democratic Party.

Results showed that the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; contained the most column inches of campaign coverage, and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; featured the most exclusive stories. In addition, analysis showed little difference in topics covered on the Jackson campaign among  the various newspapers, and that all emphasized Jackson's problems with Jewish voters. With the exception of the &quot;Tribune&quot; (which displayed a negative bias), the tone of the Jackson coverage was judged to be generally fair and straightforward. The mediated image throughout the months reflected a gradual evolution in coverage from &quot;black civil rights leader&quot; to &quot;Democratic candidate for president.&quot; It was also noted that the coverage of the campaign followed the &quot;confirmation&quot; paradigm of press coverage (going through the phases of announcement, definition, judgment, debunking, and conversion), and that Jackson's campaign was characterized by an intense debunking period.

The first part of the book provides an overview of the issue of political legitimacy and the administration of education. Topics covered include the relationship between education and the state; the effect on the state of expanded conflicts in education; the relationship between privatized and public politics; critical election periods--a third level of politics; the effects of U.S. reform politics on education; the role of educational measurement;  and the recent politicization of education.

The Gaston System consists of three key components: analyzing problems systematically, developing processes to increase citizen involvement in decisionmaking, and using innovative leadership techniques to facilitate these processes. The Gaston County School Board took the lead in drawing many groups and individuals together to build consensus for policy decisions. As a result of this participatory, consensus-building model for decisionmaking, a wide range  of innovative ideas for school and community improvement have emerged, and a new positive community attitude is developing. Notable improvements in the last 7 years include reduction in school dropouts, innovative educational enrichment programs, a community forum to survey public opinion on essential issues, reduced unemployment and crime rates, and passage by 69 percent of the electorate of a $28 million bond for high technology solid waste disposal cogeneration plants. The process has also brought the educational, commercial, and municipal sectors of the community closer together in pursuing common goals. (TE)",

Successful programs for helping at-risk students provide a broad range of special services to assist in raising these students' low self-esteem through frequent personal contact with a qualified, caring staff. During a period of federal cutbacks in education (11 percent between 1980 and 1987), there has been a 20 percent increase in the numbers of disadvantaged students.

        "description":"Because contemporary society accepts inequalities in income and social privilege, its tolerance for the varied and divergent educational consumption of its citizens is understandable. However, the acceptance of a dual educational system by parents, local authorities, and governments has implications for government involvement and educational finance. Any shift of pupils from the public to the private school sector will generate fewer dollars per pupil for public education, with associated repercussions for staffing and programming. This paper examines the &quot;riffling&quot; effect within a publicly supported dual school system in Canada and in Australia in relation to (1) financial assistance; (2) enrollment shifts; (3) staffing patterns; and (4) programmatic considerations. Recently  there has been a mounting provision of support to both public and private school sectors and an enrollment shift favoring private schools in both countries. Regarding staffing patterns, Canada has shown an increase in private school teacher employment and a decrease in public school teacher employment, while Australia's teaching population has steadily risen in both sectors, but with a sharper rate of increase in the private sector. Programmatic and ideological elements are linked to three factors (funding sources, funding stability, and established spending patterns) and raise many unresolved questions. The support of both public and private school systems from the diminishing pool of funds potentially moves both systems toward mere survival. The apparently healthy compromise between  parental choice and government responsibility may further disperse available educational resources. Appended are 2 tables and 11 references. (MLH)",

        "description":"To address the problem of increasing professional isolation of building administrators, the Principals' Inservice Project helps establish principals' collegial support groups across the nation. The groups are typically composed of 6 to 10 principals who meet at least once each month over a 2-year period. One collegial support group of seven principals underwent onsite analysis to determine the extent of the collaborative arrangement. The review of the group included individual interviews with each principal and the facilitator and observations of group meetings. All principals indicated that the collegial support group allowed members to share common problems with other administrators and to use suggestions from the group to generate possible solutions. Newer principals viewed  the group as a learning experience; experienced principals saw the collegial arrangement as a way to keep them focused on their present roles. The principals were unanimous in stating that they wanted structure in group meetings, though the facilitator felt that the group relied on him too much. The third issue explored dealt with the demonstrable results in the schools of principals participating in the project. All the principals agreed that their involvement with the project had already paid some dividends to their schools and district. (MLF)",

        "description":"To help policymakers plan for higher quality education despite increased productivity demands and decreased financial support, this paper briefly reviews trends and issues related to three important areas: school size, grade level organization, and school management practices. Research has yet to discover the perfect school size. Arguments are presented for large schools' ability to provide instructional, extracurricular, and athletic diversity and for small schools' concentration on the basics and the individual student. Various grade level groupings are discussed: middle schools, elementary schools divided into primary (grades 1-3) and higher elementary (grades 4 and 5), and high schools divided into separated units for grades 9-10 and grades 11-12. The various groupings work  best if all students remain together as they move from one building to another--to avoid disruption or massive readjustments every two or three years. High school students can be limited in course selections if the separated high school buildings are not on the same campus. Emerging school management trends are centered in two directions: (1) a shift toward instructional leadership responsibility of administrators and (2) an expectation of increased administrator accountability. Another promising development is schools' increasing reliance on shared decision-making by administrative management teams. Complex school issues will need hard work, not ready-made solutions.

        "description":"In response to ongoing needs for improved preservice field experiences for prospective administrators, more stringent state certification standards, and technical support for practitioners, mutually beneficial alliances are being formed between universities and local schools. This paper describes part of a continuing University Council for Educational Administration (UCEA) research project to collect and disseminate university field relations data. Specifically, this paper studies how universities interact with field practitioners in the design and conduct of administrator training programs. During the study's first phase, UCEA institutions in the United States and Canada were asked to provide descriptive information about field experiences, internships, and other learning  activities associated with their administrator training programs. Thirty-five of the universities or 78% provided program descriptions. Findings showed that most field relations programs are (1) designed to meet external mandates or standards; (2) the responsibility of an adjunct or clinical instructor; (3) &quot;add-on&quot; features of universities' training programs; (4) presented as not totally satisfactory; and (5) remarkably similar as to structure and requirements. These findings have several implications. While states will expect future administrators to gain more field experience, frustration arises as to implementation approaches and inadequate conceptual or material support for these expectations. Another issue concerns the extent of universities' commitment to effective field-based  programs. At present, these programs are not central features, but afterthoughts. Solid programs require enormous faculty commitment, legislative support, and true joint-sponsorship by universities and school districts. (MLH)",

More than 400 articles from 23 professional journals and 507 doctoral dissertations were analyzed. For each study, the research design and procedures, purposes and objectives, and major findings were determined. Methodologically, the research is heavily based on descriptive surveys of the desired content and procedures for the delivery of staff development and inservice, as described by survey respondents. Most research is not theoretical and tends to make use of only one data-collection technique, the questionnaire. Substantively, as determined through responses to the descriptive surveys, the  skills sought most frequently by professional educators are knowledge-level skills. A research agenda, based on gaps found in existing studies, suggests that future research should (1) engage in the synthesis of some of what is already known about the nature of effective training design; (2) carry out continuous review and modification of a theoretical conceptualization of effective staff development and inservice education; and (3) define what is the ultimate goal of any training and learning experience.

The major finding of this second assessment is that the Chicago Board of Education has not adequately implemented either component of PA 84-126 and gives little indication that it has any intention of doing so in the future. The second  budget hearings were a sham in 1986 and they were a sham in 1987. The administration continues to obstruct the LSICs' ability to function as intended by the legislation. The central recommendation of this assessment is that the Illinois Legislature must hold the board fully accountable to see that this legislation is implemented.

Section I introduces and provides an overview of key issues raised in the study. Section II examines the evolution of financial incentives for teachers, from approximately 1910 to the present, focusing particularly on the appeal of economic rewards to different constituencies. Section III analyzes changes in the social origins and  composition of the teaching force, focusing on gender, social class, and academic preparation and qualifications. Finally, section IV selectively reviews recent developments and elaborates on some of their policy implications for raising professional standards and overcoming the developing teacher shortage.

There is little evidence to suggest that much of current inservice activity contributes to significant improvement in administrators' knowledge and skill. The present study involved the development and testing of a model for group and individual inservice learning within &quot;a learning community&quot; of administrators in one British Columbia school district. Responses from participants in the initial large-group activity indicated a high level of early satisfaction with the model. The second phase of research is monitoring the progress of small learning groups, formed during  the initial learning activity to pursue commonly held learning interests, to determine the effectiveness of the model as perceived by group members and other school district personnel. The present paper reviews the context and background of the project, outlines the approach to and preliminary results of the study, and notes implications for practice in the field of principals' inservice training.

It addressed student financial assistance under a vocational rehabilitation program for tuition at a sectarian postsecondary institution in Washington; it also decided a case challenging a state finance program. Cases were heard by other courts in an attempt to follow recent U.S. Supreme Court cases in areas of public school personnel working in parochial schools and the recovery of improperly spent federal funds. Some cases represent attempts by state legislatures to implement, and by courts to interpret, taxpayer revolt legislation and other efforts to curb the growth of government spending. Several challenges to the use of funds for programs for handicapped children were presented to the  Department of Education. And there was continued litigation on the taxing and spending authority of school districts. These cases, discussed in this chapter, fall under three major topics: public funds for private schools, sources and allocations of public funds, and school tax issues. (TE)",

This paper examines the role of the chief state school officer and explains how that role is influenced by the selection process. Four selection models are described, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each: (1) the governor appoints the board of education, which appoints the CSSO; (2) the elected state board of education appoints the CSSO; (3) the governor appoints the state board of education and the CSSO is elected by the public; and (4) the governor appoints the state board of education and the CSSO. Accountability, the relationship of elected officials to the constituents and public bureaucracies to elected  officials, varies for each model, as does policymaking power. Specific qualifications and responsibilities of the office are also described as well as the chief state school officer's relationship to other state policymakers. (Author/TE)",

        "description":"Minimum competency testing (MCT) programs for students are growing in popularity and being adopted by many states. In order to determine the extent of the MCT movement, researchers at North Carolina State University surveyed state departments of education in all 50 states. In updating these data for 1986-1987, it was found that 64 percent of the 47 responding states had statewide MCT programs. Two thirds of these programs were initiated by state legislatures and most of the rest were initiated by state education agencies. The most frequent grade levels tested were third (57 percent), sixth (43 percent), and eighth and ninth (47 percent each). One third of all states require a statewide MCT as a requirement for graduation, and half of the states implementing MCT programs have  modified the basic curriculum on account of test results. Summaries of nine states' testing programs are included in the report, and 10 policy issues are described: state control, student learning, determining the purposes of minimum competency testing, remediation response, curriculum development response, political response, judicial response, costs, technical qualities of MCTs, and effects on instruction. Special sections focus on remediation and legal issues associated with MCT programs, and tables are included. (Author/TE)",

Section 2 reviews the research literature on merit pay in and outside education, concentrating on what is known about the most and least effective ways to design and operate merit pay plans. In section 3, the policy positions of the major professional educational organizations are analyzed to identify points of agreement and disagreement that influence the negotiation of state and local merit pay  policies and plans. Finally, the current actions being taken and discussed at the state level are examined. The state proposals have not been in effect long enough to produce evaluative data, but they can be assessed against the research literature and the experience of local education association and professional organizations.

Included is a discussion of how textbooks are used in the classroom, how selection is influenced by diverse curricular requirements, and how testing requirements, availability of funding, sales and promotional costs, market conditions, readability formulas, physical standards, and collective authorship  complicate the process of textbook improvement. The third section discusses pitfalls of the textbook adoption process at state and local levels. Political influences in the appointment of textbook review committees are discussed, along with the problems that arise with textbook selection criteria. The final section addresses \"the real cost of poor textbooks\" in light of their long-range effects on teachers and students.

This monograph accordingly discusses four basic issues that should be considered prior to selecting an instrument to measure school climate: purpose, choice of variables, seeking opinions about climate, and data gathering and reporting. First, five reasons are presented for collecting data on school climate: to identify strengths and weaknesses, to evaluate school programs, to describe and compare schools, to open up communication, and to identify groups for special treatment. Second, climate variables must be determined. Based on Tagiuri's (1968) taxonomy, these include ecology, milieu,  social system, and culture. Third, opinion data should be gathered from representatives of all school constituencies. Finally, considerations in gathering and reporting data include understandability of scores, appropriateness of summary statistics, ease of comparison across variables, use of a normed referent group in making comparisons across schools, costs, and availability of special services.

Focusing mainly on preferential hiring, the book explicitly and extensively addresses the law and the institutional context of the issues. Examination of the types of arguments used in defense of preferential hiring and of such concepts as compensatory justice, rights, social utility, distributive justice, and equal opportunity leads up to a detailed discussion of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 11246 (1965), which established affirmative action programs. The book also examines the Supreme Court's approach to the \"equal protection\" clause of the 14th Amendment and  shows how the Court's doctrine can make room for constitutionally permissible uses of race, including racially preferential hiring. The final part of the book presents a moral theory of constitutional equality that accommodates much of the Supreme Court's doctrine and justifies the occasional use of race in social policy. The conclusion reached is that there is no absolute principled (constitutional) bar to some kinds of reverse discrimination, but that such practices may still be morally undesirable. (TE)",

        "description":"The management team concept, which developed in response to increasingly complex problems facing schools, is not only compatible with democratic concepts but has also proved responsive to teacher and parent pressure to redistribute power, broaden decision-making participation, and improve administrative efficiency. The school management team, comprising a cross-section of central office and building level administrators, requires sound leadership from the superintendent, endorsement by the board, and a strong commitment to problem-solving and building trust among all participants. Despite good intentions, obstacles to participatory decision-making can result from incomplete information-sharing and misconceptions concerning levels of participation. Several districts illustrate  effective team management practices. The management team approach can be strengthened and diversified by (1) including more women and minority administrators and (2) extending the collaborative work mode to department heads and regular teaching staff. The &quot;second wave&quot; of educational reform aims to restructure schools and reshape teachers' roles towards increased collegiality and decision-making responsibility. As administrator roles are reshaped to allow nonthreatening power-sharing with other staff, the entire school community will benefit from a collaborative learning and working environment. Included are nine references. (MLH)",

        "description":"Meta-analysis was used to conduct an integrative review of the research on modifying attitudes toward persons with disabilities. Prior reviews, using small samples and lacking systematic data collection and analysis, were unable to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of attitude modification techniques. In the hope of correcting these deficiencies, an exhaustive search of all English-language research reports in the United States and Canada was undertaken that identified 667 potentially relevant items. Screening for relevance and adequacy of information reduced the accessible population for the integrative review to 273 reports describing a total of 644 treatment groups. A coding instrument containing some 162 categories was used and extensive quantitative analysis  undertaken, but no clear-cut findings emerged. The major conclusion was that there had been a great deal of variety in the conditions under which the effectiveness of the various attitude modification techniques was investigated, that the variations were not systematically controlled, and that this confounded efforts to draw conclusions about treatment effectiveness. The consistent conclusion that research findings are equivocal may also reflect a reality that social-psychological phenomena are not amenable to systematization. Thirteen tables provide a detailed breakdown of study characteristics and effect sizes. (VW)",

It reviews progress, since 1900, in Latin teaching methods in Great Britain and the Netherlands and describes more recent work in South Africa, including the development of new curricula for teaching Latin as well as the annual reading competitions, linguistic and historical quizzes, and art competitions sponsored by the Classical Association of South Africa. A project is described in which 20 gifted students (aged 13-17) were asked to review new juvenile classical books and teaching packets. It spawned a range of other projects which are summarized. The students produced a slide-tape show, the full script of which is appended to  the paper. The book and teaching packet reviews were edited by a student and reworked by the teacher in a review article which is also appended. Conclusions drawn from the project confirm that the classics have much to offer the gifted and that they also offer a new awareness that even random dipping into the classical world is a rewarding experience for both average and gifted pupils.

Subjects were obtained from the total standard 10 Afrikaans speaking cohort in the Orange Free State (Republic of South Africa). Ability/achievement discrepancy scores were calculated for the entire cohort, and students with the highest positive discrepancy scores were compared with students with the highest negative discrepancy scores. Also examined were academic achievement, study habits and attitudes, personality, school affect and academic self-concept, and a bibliographic self-report. Among findings were the following: gifted underachievers were more quilt prone and less self-assured, more casual, socially less controlled, emotionally  less stable, more submissive, and less assertive than gifted achievers. Both average groups were more timid and less venturesome than the gifted groups with both groups of underachievers being more timid and less venturesome than achievers. Substantial differences between achieving and underachieving gifted pupils were found in all study habit and attitude variables except study time, suggesting less efficient study methods by underachieving students. Work methods of both gifted groups were superior to those of average students. Gifted underachievers had a less favorable attitude toward school and a poorer academic self-concept. (DB)",

The first factor, teacher training, involves the right of gifted children to be educated by specially qualified teachers. A teacher training model leading to certification for teachers of the gifted is described. The second factor, gifted identification, requires that giftedness and characteristics of the gifted be clearly defined. Delivery models are another contributing factor. As an alternative to the regular classroom, program prototypes for the gifted are listed, including acceleration programs, enrichment programs, and guidance programs. The use of community resources is also a factor, and a mentor program can be used to fill the gap of needs unmet in the classroom.  The final factor is the importance of evaluating the gifted program. Throughout the paper, it is emphasized that the regular education teacher must undertake responsibility to ensure that the needs of gifted students are met. (Author)",

The program was based on principles extracted from the psychological and educational research literature and included the need to: (1) use symbols that catch children's attention; (2) match content to readiness level; (3) match methods to cognitive style; (4) adapt to uneven rates of learning; (5) match materials to gestalt scanning preferences; (6) match methods to vertical discrimination preferences; (7) incorporate motor reinforcement activities; (8) isolate hands and coordinate mirror movements; (9) plan for inhibitory motor movements; (10) distribute practice into short sessions at frequent  intervals; (11) match timing to information processing speed; (12) match repetitions to students' practice needs; (13) avoid perceptual overloading; (14) teach self-verbalization as a learning strategy; (15) enhance motivation by use of individualized incentives; and (16) involve parents. The paper stresses the importance of encouraging instrumental instruction for handicapped children, in order to provide them with opportunities for self-expression and self-satisfaction, to avoid social isolation, and for integration with their culture's aesthetic experiences.

A proposed situational model of creativity defines creativity as a meaningful response to open-problem, open-solution situations. The model explains relationships between different types of thinking skills and explains why creativity and intelligence are not highly correlated. Based on this model, a new test of creativity is being developed, using the blank card of the Thematic Apperception Test and blank cards in divergent-thinking measures that use pattern and line meanings. No one current measure of creativity is adequate, but combinations of  intelligence tests, problem-solving tests, personality tests, and occupational interest inventories can provide multiple criteria for decisions on special program admission. Psychometric data should not be the only data on which admissions decisions are based. Peer or teacher nominations or juried evaluations of creative performances need to be considered.

Special classes for emotionally disturbed children began in Japan in 1969 with a rapid increase to over 2000 classes by the 1980's. However, most of the children attending such classes were autistic rather than emotionally disturbed. The American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (III) proposed the classification of autism under the heading &quot;Pervasive Developmental Disorders.&quot; Appropriate educational treatment is different for autistic and emotionally disturbed children. Although practical reasons originally led to naming the special class group &quot;emotionally disturbed,&quot; the differences between  emotionally disturbed and autistic children need to be recognized and appropriate services provided to each group.

Intervention consisted of the therapist and mother engaging the child in cognitive training activities, physical games, and pretend play activities designed to elicit language behaviors. Cognitive training stressed such skills as distinguishing between the signified and signifier in daily experiences, language training in the names and functions of familiar objects, and pretend playing in the imitative use of objects, with and without the objects present. The subject demonstrated an increase in spontaneous vocal utterances and acquisition of a few meaningful words. In his play behavior he showed a developmental sequence  similar to that of non-retarded subjects. The article is followed by an abstract written in Japanese. (DB)",

        "description":"The Mainstream Assistance Team (MAT) project is a 3-year research program designed to develop, implement, and validate a prereferral intervention model. The model is a least-restrictive, preventative, ecologically-based, problem-solving approach, using a multidisciplinary team composed of a school psychologist, special educator, and general educator. The program's rationale focuses on the increasing numbers of identified mildly handicapped students and the importance of prereferral assessment and intervention in general education classrooms. The social, political, and bureaucratic dimensions of the Tennessee school district setting for which the MAT was developed are considered in the program's design. Major dimensions of the MAT include: behavioral consultation; component  analyses of three increasingly inclusive versions of the stages of behavioral consultation (problem identification, problem analysis, plan implementation, and problem evaluation); written scripts to guide consultants' verbal behavior during interviews or meetings; and outcome measures. The implementation process involves selecting schools, consultants, teachers, and pupils; training the consultants; assigning teachers and scripts to consultants; and developing specific procedures. Evaluative data show apparent inconsistency between teacher ratings and classroom observations, and three explanations for this are discussed. Future directions for the MAT project focus on strengthening project-related interventions by requiring use of contingency contracts and data-based monitoring procedures.  (JDD)",

        "description":"Several models have been developed to aid in selecting appropriate educational content for special needs students. These include the developmental model, behavioral model, categorical model, and environmental or ecological model. The ecological model involves determining the skills that a fully functioning member of society normally performs in the environments that the learner inhabits, analyzing the discrepancies between those skills and the learner's current performance, and making those discrepancies the learner's curricular objectives. The ecological inventory of skills involves five levels: domains, environments, subenvironments, activities, and critical functions. The central focus of an environmental approach to curriculum is the individual's adaptation to transitions, or  changes in environmental requirements that an individual experiences. Transitions may be predictable age-appropriate transitions, normalizing transitions, or backward transitions. Steps are outlined for using transitions in program planning, focusing on: 3-year plans; types of potential transitions; use of a least restrictive environment; and teaching of critical skills as well as additional skills that may enhance adjustment, such as social skills. Instructional methods emphasize social integration and behavioral teaching strategies. (JDD)",

Speech and or/language handicapped LEP Hispanic students (n=124) in grades 2-5 in three  large urban school districts in central Texas provided the sample. Descriptive statistical procedures were used to analyze data on student demography, referral, eligibility, speech and language evaluations, and placement. Results indicated that the procedures used by speech and language pathologists in the identification and diagnosis of communication disorders virtually ignored students' LEP status. Analysis of school district policies showed that little information was provided concerning safeguards to protect LEP students from being inappropriately placed in special education.

It emphasizes the different qualities of the characteristics as well as the fact that such characteristics exist in degrees or levels, thus helping to avoid thinking of giftedness or its components as being either wholly present or wholly absent in any individual. The model, visualized as a cube, incorporates the three characteristics that are important to achieve a high level of performance: (1) \"aptitudes\" comprising the vertical dimension; (2) \"specific knowledge and skills\" the horizontal dimension; and (3) \"affective characteristics\" the front-to-back dimension. Traits on any of the three dimensions are assumed to be distributed somewhat normally  throughout the population, therefore creating a cluster comprising the majority of people in the center of the cube. People with extremely high or low \"scores\" would be found at the extremes, especially the corners of the cube. The four top corners would contain the identifiably gifted. The combinations of high characteristics represented by each corner present varying challenges for program planning. The model acknowledges that gifted students may be deficient in some areas but includes them and addresses their deficiencies. (VW)",

A four-phase system of identification is based on a multifaceted and expanded definition of giftedness. In designing the program, developers examined models of creativity, characteristics of the creative personality, criteria for determining creative thinking ability, and specific teaching models. Among desirable teacher characteristics are a willingness to risk, acceptance of the uniqueness of others, and the ability to be structured in a flexible way  in response to the students' experience and motivation. Procedures for screening and placement, selection criteria, the curriculum outline, and evaluation procedures are described. Program options include core courses (e.g., Creative Thinking, Effective Thinking, Body Language, Study Skills), workshops in language, visual, performing, and cultural arts, and integrated arts/creativity workshops at primary and secondary levels.

In contrast, bare verb forms (BVs) (i.e., the absence of &quot;no&quot;) indicate that the speaker, as an individual, is committed to the knowledge in question. These two forms are contrasted with other evidential markers such as those of reported speech and &quot;territory of information&quot; that concern whether the evidence lies with the speaker or with another. The data used in the study are drawn from 14 hours of audiotaped family conversation. The data reveal that while BVs frequently encode knowledge the Japanese consider inaccessible, such as psychological states, &quot;no&quot; frequently encodes knowledge it  considers accessible. The proposed analysis accounts for data used to support previous analyses of &quot;no,&quot; and also accounts for why &quot;no&quot; is used in particular conversational contexts. It concludes with a discussion of this analysis of &quot;no&quot; within a theory of social meaning. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study investigated time factors in two-person telephone conversations, in which visual clues were absent. The lengths and occurrences of vocalizations, pauses, turns, switching pauses, and simultaneous speech were measured with the aid of a computer program. The timing patterns of three conversation types were compared: two Finns speaking in Finnish; two Americans speaking in English; and a Finn and an American speaking in English. Clear differences were found between the two kinds of same-culture conversation: Finns allowed more numerous and longer switching pauses and thereby tolerated more silence, whereas Americans vocalized more and used shorter switching pauses. The differences diminished in the intercultural conversation, with adaptation more obvious for the Finns than  the Americans. Simultaneous speech was very common in the two-culture conversations, with Finns speaking during the Americans' turns. This is interpreted as a possible symptom of a malfunctioning turn-taking mechanism and also a possible result of increased use of mistimed back-channel. It was also concluded that the computer analysis method can be useful in examining conversation timing. (MSE)",

The adjustment has been facilitated by CO training in several areas. In general, the employers praised their Eastern European employees highly, and the voluntary agencies agreed that despite conflicts between the refugees' expectations and the agencies' goals, their clients were able to adjust fairly well within 6-12 months. All groups viewed the CO training favorably, and  requested that the curriculum topics be augmented with more practical information and English language instruction and that the course time be lengthened.

The program had three target populations, Spanish-illiterate Hispanics, nonliterate English-speaking adults, and nonliterate speakers of Haitian Creole; its components include: (1) training for literacy teachers and teachers of English as a second language (ESL), and (2) community literacy/ESL classes. It is noted that a key factor in the program's success has been the active interest of the college  administration. Five conclusions about program effectiveness are made that: (1) although clarity about goals is necessary, flexibility is also important; (2) community leaders and students should be involved in all stages of planning and execution; (3) internal institutional support must be assured; (4) resources must be carefully identified and the danger of over-extension must be heeded; and (5) identification with divisive partisan issues must be avoided.

It provides a theoretical framework, an analytical method, and a vocabulary for communicating its insights--all designed to serve concerns other than literary interpretation and evaluation, but all useful for determining how a work of literature achieves its effect. Through the varied perspectives of grammar, discourse analysis, phonology, syntax, semantics, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and pragmatics, linguistics becomes an independent point of entry into the literary work. Linguistic analysis imposes a measure of objectivity on the reader's initial intuition, provides a means for articulating that intuition, and suggests directions to  explore. (MSE)",

Linguistics is particularly well-suited for teaching about the process of &quot;doing&quot; science because the methodology appropriate to the study of language from a generative viewpoint is, in fact, scientific methodology. Scientific methodology provides an orderly arrangement for, and analysis of, data and a means to search for relationships that explain and predict the behavior of the observed phenomena. The discipline has other practical advantages for teaching the scientific method: it has inherent interest, requires little advanced mathematics because it relies on forms of formal reasoning more easily accessible to  many students, requires no expensive laboratories or equipment, has all the relevant data readily available to anyone who has acquired a language, has an immediate connection to computer science, and is central to cognitive science as the study of the human mind.

In the last half century, fundamental changes have occurred in perceptions of how the human species relates to the rest of the universe, due to developments in science and the creation of the cognitive sciences. There is now the danger that even the best liberal education will focus too narrowly on the humanities and ignore science as irrelevant. The cognitive sciences could help create a new curriculum in which natural science plays an essential role because cognitive sciences: (1) have numerous deep ties with both the natural sciences and the humanities; (2) are young enough to be more easily influenced to play an important educational role than other, more  established sciences; and (3) demand significantly less specialization and are more accessible to undergraduates than the traditional sciences. Linguistics already has a theoretical framework more sophisticated than any other cognitive science and has a highly articulated, well-defined subject area in language. Imaginatively conceived courses on language and linguistic theory could begin and sustain necessary changes in our conception of what is normal in a liberal education. (Author/MSE)",

Its goal is to bring the theoretical and methodological resources of the contributing disciplines to bear on an integrated investigation of thought, meaning, language, perception, and mentally guided action. The contributing disciplines have begun to converge on a common paradigm, the computational or information processing view. If conceived of and taught as a broad, integrative area of study, cognitive science deserves a prominent place in the liberal arts curriculum, and linguistics merits a central place because language is the most prominent marker of human intelligence. Interdisciplinary cognitive science  programs are in various stages of development at about 40 higher education institutions in the United States, most drawing on the resources of previously existing departments and faculty. The study of language provides a testing ground for broad questions about the nature and structure of the mind, and can enrich pedagogical and intellectual work in other disciplines with or without an organized program in cognitive science.

Linguistic theory can be presented as an experimental science in which it is particularly easy to do experiments. In addition, it is a field so new that, in an introductory course, areas about which little is known can be reached in some detail, with students themselves providing crucial evidence. An argument that has received less attention is that linguistics provides important evidence about human nature as exemplified in language. When this approach is taken in the classroom, the student gains a much greater respect for the complexity and richness of the human mind and learns to question the simple-minded views that underlie much contemporary psychological, economic, and political  reasoning.

The major points of contact between English and linguistics are the areas of stylistics and poetics. In the study of English, linguistics can enrich descriptions of texture (stylistics) and constrain theoretical claims (poetics). Through stylistics and poetics, linguistics can influence the undergraduate English curriculum from freshman composition to the senior seminar. The influence will increase to the extent that linguists do not make exaggerated claims of superior validity for the facts their theoretical analyses of texts uncover, and that English scholars resist the temptation to impute &quot;scientism&quot; to  linguistics.

Experience has shown that undergraduate linguistics has not come far since then. In the experimental, interdisciplinary program at the State University of New York, College at Old Westbury, students were found to be unprepared to cope with the curriculum because they lacked appropriate skills in hierarchical organization, generalization, and categorization, and did not know how to structure a problem to solve it. This suggests that the aims of the undergraduate linguistics course should be different from those of the graduate curriculum, with the greatest barrier to be  overcome being the students' resistance to the challenges and responsibilities of thinking for themselves. In addition, the theoretical and technical aspects of the discipline, following the Bloomfieldian emphasis on methodology and analytical technique, may be unsuitable for undergraduate study. Linguists' bias toward the theoretical should not be allowed to control the curriculum to the exclusion of other valuable approaches to integrating other disciplines such as psychology and sociology, which may be more appropriate for the undergraduate level.

This is due in part to the number of students that struggle through linguistic theory that they will forget once the examination or course is over. However, instructors can make linguistics courses serving primarily nonmajors more attractive by omitting certain topics and incorporating others that may be less central to the concerns of linguistic theory but are more interesting and useful to the nonspecialist. Since linguistics overlaps a number of disciplines, it both broadens and strengthens the background of students in linguistics-related fields. In addition, the practice of viewing language phenomena analytically transfers well to unrelated disciplines that require the same type of thinking, such  as mathematics or computer science. Linguistics courses tailored to the nonmajor can be just as challenging as those that are not. (Author/MSE)",

The program goal is to teach undergraduates to engage in investigation and analysis of linguistic structures, based on the four principles of focus, professionalism, rigor, and fun. It offers 8 lower division and 27 upper division courses, and the major is built around three basic course sequences focusing on syntax, semantics, and phonology. Special program features include opportunities  for students to assist in teaching courses, a research seminar, and publication of student papers.

        "description":"While foreign language instruction for elementary school children is gaining attention, poor articulation is a problem that has become more complex because of the variety of foreign language program models being developed. Five main types are in use: total immersion, partial immersion, foreign languages in the elementary school (FLES), content-enriched FLES, and foreign language experience or exploratory (FLEX). As different as the models are, one principle applies to all: no elementary school foreign language program graduate should be placed with beginners in middle or junior high school. However, each of the program models has different implications for the subsequent curriculum. Successful articulation between elementary and secondary schools requires ongoing communication  and close cooperation among language teachers at all levels. Elementary school foreign language programs must be considered part of the total foreign language program, not a mere prelude unrelated to the goals and activities of the secondary curriculum. The elementary school language teacher will have to be able to describe the communicative and cultural outcomes of instruction very specifically. Articulation will be smooth only if students are achieving predictable outcomes consistent across grade levels. Successful elementary programs will necessitate secondary curriculum changes and careful placement procedures. (MSE)",

The particular concern is that articulation is targeted toward programs and not toward learners. Specific language teaching methods, and use of more-uniform teaching materials and testing have been used to cope with the problem. However, a broader definition of articulation emphasizes the interconnectedness of content, curriculum, and instruction as they facilitate student learning. The interrelationships of the three elements are vital to resolutions of the issue. Several principles help resolve the problem: careful curriculum development, feedback to students that relates to their learning, monitoring at all levels and by a variety of methods, use of carefully chosen and appropriate  materials, less emphasis on grammar, teacher preparation that focuses on these interrelationships and, most important, communication and cooperation for the student's benefit.

        "description":"Two years of language study is a requirement in most colleges and universities for many degree programs and, at the high school level, an expectation for college-bound students. However, some very capable students with specific learning disabilities (SLD) have difficulty learning a second language. Recent research has identified characteristics of students with language-based learning disabilities and of students who are successful language learners. It has also identified some of the problems the former group of students may encounter in the second-language classroom. The characteristics of the disabilities are diverse and do not fit a single profile, but some typical patterns have emerged. Colleges and universities have begun to develop formalized procedures to provide these  students with needed services and course alternatives. Students can be taught adaptive cognitive strategies to apply to foreign language learning, in effect teaching the students how to learn language-related skills. This, along with the provision of academic options for SLD students having difficulty with language requirements, is a logical direction for foreign language education to take. (MSE)",

However, in some sentences these morphemes appear to be infixed rather than cliticized. True infixes are a rare phenomenon, and infixation of a morpheme that normally functions as a clitic is doubly suspect. There is significant evidence for an interpretation of apparent endoclitics (infixed clitics) in Alsea as sequences of clitics, if not synchronically, at least historically. The infixation appears to be a feature of the morpheme that is split and not of the infix. There is a limited set of single morphemes that due to the circumstances of their historical development, are  sometimes split into two discontinuous parts. The second-position clitics are only incidentally involved in creating the discontinuity. (MSE)",

Features of schools that influence the most appropriate forms of assessment include mission, curricula, and faculty  roles. Efforts to develop more systematic assessment procedures at the state level in New Jersey include the Basic Skills Assessment Program and the College Outcomes Evaluation Program.

The concept of permanency planning (through the provision of in-home services to help the child remain in his/her biological home or the removal of the child and placement in an adoptive home) is discussed briefly, together with the background of the 1983 consent decree in New Mexico requiring the restructuring of the state's foster care and adoption system. In 1984 a study was conducted to describe the foster care system in New Mexico. Findings revealed problems in: recruitment and maintenance of foster families, emancipation training for older children, identification of incest and sexually abusive families,  dealing with attorneys, special needs children, number of past workers for each child, and legal consultation. The study identified some areas that need more integration into the curriculum, such as the importance of legal consultation and the necessity of professional training for child welfare workers. The ways in which this has been done in the human behavior and social environment courses, the social work research course, policy courses, field internships, special topics courses, and the three practice courses in the Bachelor of Social Work curriculum at New Mexico State University are described. Through case examples, students learn critical aspects of permanency planning in the practice courses.

Curriculum and service changes that social work programs can implement to accommodate some of the special needs of nontraditional students are also discussed. All female junior and senior social work students (N=42) at a state university were administered a questionnaire that included questions relating to demographics, possible problem areas, and service changes. The sample included 17 nontraditional students and 25 traditional students. Results included the following: (1) ethnically the groups were comparable, but the nontraditional students were more likely to be divorced or married and  have children; (2) the nontraditional students experienced more difficulties with child care and social isolation; and (3) the majority in both groups had problems with financial aid, scheduling, personal finances, and handling employee/student roles. Data are provided in three tables. These results are compared to those of other studies of nontraditional students and found to be similar. Recommendations that social work programs could implement in order to address the needs of returning students in the areas of curriculum and teaching, advisement, class scheduling, extracurricular activities, and credit for life and work experience are discussed.

A total of 9,204 faculty in 142 colleges received the survey, and 4,271 responded. In addition, case studies were prepared for 10 colleges (College of Notre Dame of Maryland, College of St. Scholastica, Eastern Mennonite College, Gordon College, Greenville College, Lenoir-Rhyne College, Nebraska Wesleyan College, Simpson College, Smith College, and William Jewell College) which placed in the top third of surveyed institutions in terms of both faculty morale and  satisfaction. The following preliminary findings are discussed: (1) degree of faculty satisfaction and morale is higher than expected at many liberal arts colleges; (2) high-morale colleges have congruent cultures and a strong sense of community; (3) institutional leadership practices are critical ingredients in forging strong communities and enhancing faculty morale; (4) the importance of a different conception of faculty scholarship, which emphasizes quality teaching, is growing; and (5) faculty career expectations appear different at liberal arts colleges. Three analyses are presented: &quot;Comparison of Faculty Perceptions of the Workplace at Low and High Morale Colleges,&quot; by Ann E. Austin; &quot;High Morale and Satisfaction among Faculty: Ten Exemplary Colleges,&quot; by R. Eugene Rice; and a  tabulation of faculty responses to the survey (summary data and selected highlights and interpretations).

Alaska's State Tuition Equalization Program was ruled unconstitutional in 1976; currently there are no grants programs for students wanting to attend public and private institutions of higher education. The importance of federal and state programs affecting public and private institutions is discussed, with statistics from Sheldon Jackson College in Sitka, Alaska, used as examples. A study was undertaken to determine how other states handle aid to private higher education and to review other types of aid in relation to Alaska law. Related data from published literature is mentioned (political, legal, and economic issues). States were polled to identify other state  funding programs that would be legal in Alaska; 41 states responded, with 5 states indicating no aid for students in private colleges. A summary of the funding programs was presented to the President of Sheldon Jackson College. The programs that seemed most relevant under Alaska's constitution were those made directly to students in public or private institutions, and fell into two categories: need-based and achievement-based. Rationale statements from various colleges are listed. Six state programs (those of Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Wisconsin) and their constitutional provisions were reviewed. Recommendations include looking into New Jersey's Tuition Aid Grants Program, Oregon's Need Grant Program, Pennsylvania's Scholars in Education Program, New  Jersey's Distinguished Scholars Program, and Oregon's Cash Award Program. Suggestions are made for ways to define terms and to draft and promote legislation. Appendices include a list of state programs of aid, a summary of constitutional provisions and legislative programs in key states, and reprints of the Oregon Need Grant and Cash Award Program. A table on state programs of aid to private education is included. (SM)",

In studio courses, groups of students are assigned to a studio teacher called a critic or crit who oversees the students' work both individually and in groups. From studio observations conducted in four varied U.S. architecture schools, data about desk crits were identified and the observer's notes condensed to yield eight discrete categories of teaching: philosophies/views manifest in teaching, ideas about teaching and learning, student preparation, time, teachers' responses to students, two-way communication, student talk, and teacher guidance based on student work. While all these categories describe important aspects of teacher-student  exchanges, the last is the most complex, requiring further analysis and interpretation from such theoretical perspectives as cognitive psychology and adult cognitive development. Examples are provided for each of the eight categories. Included is a review of the contexts for the research such as education in architecture and architecture's critical traditions.

Attention is directed to the merits and drawbacks of six possible approaches to increasing higher education's contributions to economic development without spending large additional sums of state tax dollars. Emphasis is given to two types of approaches used in Washington State: additional investments in technology transfer of university research and development and additional support for campus-based technical and management assistance to firms. Two types of technology transfer investment strategies were studied. The applicability of the approaches to colleges and universities  seeking to enhance their contributions to rural economic development are assessed. It is concluded that programs with this objective need to have some special emphases designed for the contemporary rural context, and that expectations for their impact should be modest. It is recommended that attention be directed to objective data-gathering and independent assessment of the impacts of campus-based economic development efforts. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"Formal structures of higher education that evolved in Islamic culture are discussed, along with parallels to the rise of universities in Medieval Europe. Both Islamic communities and Western Christianity founded colleges through endowments. The structural form of higher education in Islamic education in Islamic regions developed from the efforts of the schools to educate students in a particular world view. A dedication and loyalty of students to one professor and his approach to the subject matter distinguished the Islamic college from its Latin counterpart. In Medieval Europe, the college supported several professors and a number of students bound together largely by a mutually shared dedication to a religious rule. In the Latin West, colleges drew support not from a single  patron, but from a great number of benefactors. Islam offered no means of incorporation that would allow a group to ban together as a legal identity so that it could replenish funds or add to the original endowment. Islamic higher learning institutions have continued to emphasize religious sciences, mainly jurisprudence, and exclude the advanced knowledge in the sciences and social sciences.

        "description":"Work values of faculty members in small liberal arts colleges that belonged to the Council of Independent Colleges were investigated. Questionnaires were sent to 719 faculty members and 353 usable responses were received: 215 from church-related colleges and 138 from independent colleges. Super's Work Values Inventory was used to measure 15 work values, including creativity, management, achievement, surroundings, supervisory relations, independence, and economic return. Data were also gathered on faculty demographic variables. Data were analyzed with the Statistical Analysis System. Teaching disciplines were grouped as hard-soft, life-nonlife, and pure-applied according to Biglan's Model. Mutually exclusive categories were also used to provide eight disciplinary categories.  Significant differences were found between the work value mean scores of faculty when they were categorized according to type of institution, teaching discipline, age, years at the institution, and sex. Findings include: a work value that permits one to live the kind of life desired and to be the type of person desired received the highest mean score, followed by altruism and independence; and the work values of management and esthetics received the lowest mean scores.

The presidents had been in office for 3 years or less at the time they were interviewed. Of concern were the presidents' initial impressions of the institution, the actions they took when they first arrived, the most important problems they had to address immediately, and their recommendations for what new presidents should do during the first few months in office. Most presidents used both passive and active approaches as they employed four routes to discovery: presidents  read to obtain information; they learned about the college from senior faculty and other staff; they talked to as many people on campus as possible; and they quickly became familiar with the budget. Circumstances that modified the workings of the discovery process included: institutions in crisis, presidents who had already been employed by the college before assuming this top post, and presidents who had previously served in this post elsewhere.

Four concerns were examined: the expressed goals of college presidents; the extent of agreement (goal consistency) or disagreement (goal diversity) between presidents and other campus leaders; organizational characteristics that are related to goal consistency or diversity; and how campus constituents see and experience their presidents as creating and/or communicating goals and how this perception is related to goal consistency or diversity.

A total of 12 to 20 institutions provided data on faculty retirement ages and age distributions and fields of full-time faculty. These data were used to make projections of faculty retirements for 1987 through 1994 and 1994 through the year 2000. Twenty-four institutions provided information on recently initiated changes in personnel policies. Three modal years of retirement were found:  ages 65, 66, and 70. Across the 5-year period, about two-thirds of the faculty had retired by age 66. The data suggest that factors other than the age of mandatory retirement seem to be more instrumental in determining the average age of retirement.

It was found that the master's degree is a professional, practice-oriented degree for those interested in entry and midlevel positions in higher education institutions. Administration/management and student affairs specialties dominate this degree, providing a balance of theoretical knowledge and practical skills for both predoctoral and terminal degree candidates. Affiliated master's degrees place more emphasis on theory and research than master's only programs, which tend to emphasize methodology, practice, and job-related course content. While the master's degree is not a  prerequisite for the doctorate in higher education, there is growing interest in its usefulness as a credential for nonacademic positions and in community colleges. Public universities are more likely to offer the master's degree in higher education and to provide more incentives to students through low tuition, assistantships, and campus employment (SW)",

Included in the framework are the socializing impacts of: student background,  the normative influences exerted by the academic and social structure of the college through interpersonal and intrapersonal processes, and the mediating impacts of both parental socialization and noncollege reference groups during college.

A database search was conducted of all federal court  decisions published between 1972 and June 1987. Over 300 cases involving faculty challenges to tenure or promotion under federal antidiscrimination laws were analyzed. Of these cases, about 5% addressed explicitly the issue of how the plaintiff was to persuade the trial judge that he or she was &quot;qualified&quot; for tenure.

The roots of the &quot;Education Governor&quot; idea are traced to four turn of the century governors, one from North Carolina, two from Virginia, and one from Alabama, all of whom held office between 1901 and 1911. The 20 recent governors and their states are as follows:. Jerry Apodaca (New  Mexico); Reubin Askew (Florida); Edmund G. Brown, Sr. (California); John Chafee (Rhode Island); Bill Clinton (Arkansas); Winfield Dunn (Tennessee); Pierre S. duPont, IV (Delaware); Robert D. Graham (Florida); Clifford T.

        "description":"The literature on the development of college students is discussed, and recommendations are offered for developing a course on student development theory and research. The following observations about the literature are considered: (1) the literature on the college student is actually two separate literatures, one focused on outcomes and the other on development, and there are few links to guide meaningful synthesis; (2) the literature is largely monocultural, focusing on white upper and middle class students at large residential research universities; and (3) there is a lack of process models that tie directly to specific theory and that can be used to guide practice on college campuses. The outcomes approach is more sociological and uses demographic data to assess broadly  defined groups of students. The student development approach takes a more psychological approach and uses theories to identify developmental levels or tasks of students. It is suggested that in courses on college student development both bodies of literature be used. To locate readings on students who are not part of the dominant culture, readings from other disciplines such as counseling may need to be tapped. Included are 28 references. (SW)",

Within the Tinto model, LISREL was used to examine: (1) the influence of academic integration on social integration and vice versa; and (2) the effect of goal commitment on institutional commitment and vice versa. Survey data were collected at a major public university at the beginning of and 10 weeks into the fall 1984 semester and at the beginning of the 1985 spring semester. A total of 323 students were administered the Motivational Orientation Scale and the Institutional Integration Scales and data were collected on student grade point average, hours earned, and registration status the following semester. Consideration was given to five key constructs of Tinto's model that are  linked causally to persistence: background characteristics, initial commitments, academic integration, social integration, and later commitments. It was found that the more academically integrated a student, the more likely he/she was to be socially well integrated. Majority students were more likely to have higher academic integration scores.

Results of a study of presidential perceptions of leadership are also examined in order to uncover the symbolic forms that leaders use to accomplish their goals. Organizational symbolism and interpretations of leadership are considered. Topics include: how organizational participants create meaning within a dynamic system; the way that symbolism enhances and helps define leadership; and constraints that the organization imposes on a leader's use of symbols. Data from a national sample of 32 presidents were obtained from the Institutional Leadership Project of the National Center for Postsecondary Governance and Finance. The sample included 16 presidents who had served 3 years or less and  16 presidents who had served 5 years or more. Interviews with the college presidents resulted in six categories that symbols may take: metaphorical, physical, communicative, structural, personification, and ideational. Three ideas concerning the symbolic aspects of leadership are addressed: symbols demand corroboration; symbols should be used consistently with the organization's culture; and presidents should use all symbolic forms.

The reform is intended to link higher education more directly to the economy through joint research projects, work experiences for students and faculty, and industrial participation in refitting universities with technologically advanced equipment. It is also designed to improve the quality and quantity of scientific research that universities do, to tighten admissions requirements and to improve the ways students are introduced to research, and to centralize the administrative structure of the postsecondary education system. Some of the foundations of the reform are considered, including demographic changes, shifts in technology and in popular attitudes about education, and the need to enhance  economic output. Attention is also directed to public discussion of the reform proposal. While newspapers and journals articles during the period between the draft and final decree generally supported the planned changes, difficulties in bringing the reform into action were noted. The long-term fate of the reform is linked to other changes now underway in Soviet society. Efforts to rethink the relationship between higher education and scientific research in the USSR and the United States are compared. Thirty-nine references are provided. (Author/SW)",

The source of the theory that is analyzed is the organizational leadership literature. Research traditions in organizational leadership are grouped into five major categories: trait theories, power and influence theories, behavioral theories, contingency theories, and symbolic theories. To identify presidential definitions of leadership, interview data were obtained from 32 college and university presidents as part of the Institutional Leadership Project sponsored by the National Center for Postsecondary Governance and Finance. Two of five implied theoretical orientations of the  presidents appeared to predominate. The first orientation is the presidential perception that leadership is a process of influence; the second is that leadership behavior is seen as emphasizing goals. The sample of presidents identified leadership, at least in part, in terms of roles and behaviors. Presidential definitions did not appear to be systematically related to factors such as institutional type, control, or presidential tenure. Sixteen references are included. (SW)",

After defining organizational behavior, conventional models and nonorthodox perspectives on organizing are contrasted. Implications of nonorthodox perspectives for leadership are also considered. Suggestions are offered of how organizational theory can be incorporated into student affairs preparation and research. Organizational theory is an eclectic discipline and incorporates concepts from sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. Organizational behavior is used to refer to relationships among actors, actors' attitudes and behaviors, and events in the college. Identifying the actors and their roles is difficult since colleges are  increasingly influenced by external agencies and constituent groups. Conventional models consider organizational behavior to be goal-directed and generally portray the institution of a &quot;closed&quot; system. Emergent organizational perspectives, on the other hand, share the following qualities: (1) each institutional context is believed to be unique; (2) there is a recognition that people construct reality for themselves; and it is assumed that all members of an organization have expertise, power, and respponsibility.

After briefly discussing the character of professional work and the role of theory and research, attention is directed to problems inherent to the nature of applied educational fields and issues related to the imperfect correspondence between theory and practice. Strategies are recommended concerning professional preparation and successfully connecting theory and practice in the course of graduate education. While many of the examples are specific to student affairs, the assumptions and general processes outlined are presumed to be applicable to the task of applied professional preparation in general. The suggestions for professional  preparation include: encourage the role of &quot;personal theorist;&quot; move from the concrete to the abstract, from practice to theory; and move from the abstract to the concrete, from theory to practice. It is suggested that the best place to present theory is with the concrete experience of students, and that inductive methods that move from particulars to general principles are more effective. Strategies to move from the abstract to the concrete might include using a particular theoretical model to critique current campus policies or practices. Included are 15 references. (SW)",

The following criteria were used: institutional mission and policy, institutional planning, physical plant, financial support and management, board membership, board organization, board/chief executive relations, and board/faculty relations. The efficacy of self-evaluation was evaluated by studying trustee responses to an AGB evaluation instrument. Of concern was whether trustees tended to rate their board's performance differently or similarly on the eight criteria. For each criterion, the extent to which trustee assessments varied  across 61 institutions was also examined. It is concluded that too often trustees bypass the stages of organizational conceptualization and definitions of performance and move directly to evaluation.

Four frames for conceptual maps for understanding organizations and effective leadership behavior were used: the bureaucratic frame, the collegial frame, the political frame, and the symbolic frame. The cognitive frames of 32 presidents were identified by examining interview data that reflected their espoused theories of leadership. Of concern in the analysis of frames were  leadership as the process of providing direction to a group or an institution, and the leadership tactics used to provide direction. Content analysis was used to code references to elements of the four frames in an interview passage. Frame analysis resulted in a three-part classification: presidents who espoused a single-frame theory, those who combined two frames, and those with multi-frame orientations.

Matched groups of students who attended and who did not attend college were compared on the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal over a 1 year period. Secondary school level of thinking and other covariates (e.g., aptitude, socioeconomic status, educational aspirations) were assessed. Students with 1 year of college had significantly higher total critical thinking scores and significantly higher scores on the interpretation and evaluation of arguments subscales. The advantages accruing to college attendance were modest. These effects appeared to be the same for all students, irrespective of individual differences in gender, race, and secondary school levels of critical thinking,  aptitude, grades, socioeconomic status, and educational aspirations. Additional analyses suggests that net of the study covariates college selectivity, curricular emphasis, and individual measures of intellectual and social involvement during college had no significant associations with critical thinking.

        "description":"This General Accounting Office (GAO) testimony before the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education, Committee on Education and Labor, House of Representatives, concerns the findings of the task force that addressed the increasing costs of student loan defaults. The task force report is considered, generally, to provide additional incentives and tools for program participants to use to better manage their programs and control defaults and to complement recent legislative and regulatory changes. The following topics are discussed: (1) characteristics of defaulters; (2) task force proposals; (3) lender risk sharing; and (4) origination fees for other loan programs. The task force proposal to substantially increase Pell Grant funding is not considered advisable, due to its cost in  comparison to the much smaller default savings it would realize. Two proposals are offered that were not proposed in the task force report: (1) lender risk sharing (providing a stronger incentive to avoid defaults and improve their collections efforts); and (2) charging loan origination fees for loans guaranteed under the Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) and the Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) programs.

The study found that key accounting and related internal control systems operated by the Department and its fund-receiving schools have serious weaknesses. Consequently, billions of dollars in financial resources are not adequately protected from fraud, waste and mismanagement. In addition, the Department's financial reports were found to be unreliable and not derived from its accounting system. Principal findings were: (1) loan records for the Higher Education Facilities and College  Housing loan portfolios were inadequate; approximately $75 million would be required to bring the files up to commercial standards in order to sell them to the public; (2) the property accounting system is insufficient for proper Departmental control; (3) accounting weaknesses result in erroneous Pell Grant disbursements; and (4) the Department's general ledger system contains unreliable data because of inadequate and inefficient computer systems. Appendix I consists of a financial management profile of the Department in five tables that provide data on budget requests, estimated loan account balances, statements of financial condition for fiscal years 1982, 1984 and 1985, and the purposes of the Department's 29 accounting systems.

Procedures for deciding on appropriate audiovisual media are then considered, with an emphasis on the context of the decision, e.g., the training needs of a large manufacturer vs. those of a service industry. Criteria for this decision-making process are discussed, including the issues of access, i.e., when and where the employee will learn; costs for the production and delivery of instructional materials in various media formats; the presentational characteristics of audiovisual media as they relate to  teaching strategies; the control over the medium that is available to the learner, e.g., broadcasts vs. cassettes; and the policies and structures within a training organization that can support or hinder the use of audiovisual media for training. Some general recommendations for the design of a training system using audiovisual media conclude the paper. The text is supplemented by four tables. (EW)",

The main theses of the paper are that television is an important component of high quality open and distance education, but only when its unique teaching characteristics are exploited, and that the effectiveness of television depends to some extent on how the material is structured and to some extent on the technology available to the student. Discussion of the presentational characteristics of television presents five examples of ways in which it can bring unique teaching resources to students. How such material actually influences the learning process is emphasized, e.g., the usefulness of documentary-style programs in  encouraging the skills of analysis and application of knowledge. The advantages of using videotape cassettes as opposed to live broadcasts are also discussed, including student control over viewing and increased learning effectiveness. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of interactive television and Tutored Video Instruction are considered.

Experiences that teachers are having with the medium in the mid-1980s are described, and their exploitation of video technology is attributed to three essential elements--equipment, programming, and support--as well as the total control of programming at its point of use which has been made possible by the introduction of the videocassette recorder. The use of suitable programming for all curriculum areas and grade levels is also chronicled, with emphasis on its use to strengthen existing  instruction, foster change, and promote equal access to educational opportunities. The report concludes with a discussion of the support given to teachers by their principals, media coordinators, and others who work directly with them, which underscores the critical importance of such support in realizing video's promise.

        "author":["Benko de Rotaeche, Anne"],
        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether the variables found to influence learning in laboratory settings were able to produce effective student achievement when utilized in Venezuelan distance education. Three versions of the same instructional content were employed, and 42 volunteer college students were randomly assigned to three experimental groups. Group 1 received a text in which such instructional aids as objectives, advance organizers, and exercises were interspersed with the reading material; Group 2 received the same content, but the text and aids were separated; and Group 3 received only the text materials. A posttest-only design was employed. It was found that Group 1 performed at a significantly higher level in the posttest than Group 3. Organization,  condensation, and content that meets the needs of an adult learner were found to be the factors in the study materials that were most effective for these students. There was also evidence that different versions stimulated different learning activities and that higher achievement was obtained when the instructional aids were taken into account. Although all students obtained the lowest scores on items requiring deep processing, Groups 1 and 2 obtained higher mean scores than Group 3; the deepest levels were attained by subjects who reported that they had applied the study techniques recommended in the instructional material. The text is supplemented by 14 tables, 1 figure, and 80 references. Three appendices provide copies of materials used in the study, and a fourth presents a commentary  on the study's methodology by R. Schuemer together with a reply by the author. (Author/EW)",

        "description":"This comparison of students' learning from reading books and from watching television uses Gavriel Salomon's model of learning effects, which is based on the amount of mental effort invested (AIME) in a medium as determining how deeply the information from that medium is processed. Mental effort, in turn, is predicted to depend on two perceptions with respect to the medium: perceived demand characteristics, and perceived self-efficacy. The subjects were 140 Dutch eighth graders whose test results were compared with those of a study done in the United States. The data showed that Dutch children, like American children, invest more mental effort in reading books than in watching television, and have lower perceived demand characteristics for television than for books. In contrast  to American children, Dutch children did not perceive themselves to be more efficacious in learning from television. When measuring mental effort and perceived self-efficacy, the data for the Dutch children produced nonsignificant (negative) correlations for both media, while the data for American children correlated positively for books and negatively for television, which they regarded as the &quot;easy medium.&quot; The results from both studies are also compared to a similar study undertaken in Israel. The text is supplemented with three tables, four figures, and a 10-item bibliography. (EW)",

        "description":"This review of recent empirical research on the effects of television on children and teenagers begins by examining the results of two surveys which were conducted to determine the opinions of experts in the field. A brief statement of the findings indicates that experts generally agree that television harms formal scholastic achievement while providing general knowledge; that it has contributed to misperceptions about sex roles, ethnic groups, and politics; that it has increased aggressive behavior; and that it has increased the degree to which children behave as consumers. Empirical evidence is then examined to determine whether or not this evidence supports what the experts say. Seven areas are considered: (1) time use (the time children spend watching television); (2) the  viewing experience; (3) knowledge, beliefs, and perceptions (defined as a wide range of cognitions that television may influence among children and teenagers); (4) viewing's impact on violence and sex roles; (5) scholastic achievement; (6) advertising; and (7) behavior (the physical actions and sequences of physical action that arguably could be said to be influenced by television). It is noted that there is a large, if varied, body of empirical evidence now available on this topic which variously supports, qualifies, calls into question, or has little to say about the opinions of the experts. On the whole, it is concluded that, although the research to date is highly informative in many respects, it is only moderately informative about the accuracy of the experts.

Identifiable spatial requirements to be assessed include space for collections, user seating, staff work, meetings, special use, and nonassignable space. These space needs are based on what must be housed in a library in order to serve its community adequately. Guidelines are then given for projecting future needs based on space requirements, and for translating the results of service assumptions into space needs. Examination of the library structure also reveals other areas of need/concern, such as improvement of energy efficiency; condition of the heating,  ventilating, and air-conditioning system; accessibility to the handicapped; adaptability to future library technologies; and overall effectiveness of the work flow. Work space is provided throughout the text for calculations and notes, as well as sample floor plans and examples which illustrate how to make certain calculations.

        "description":"The fine and performing arts have long been a part of the two-year college curriculum, though the organizational structures of the colleges have afforded these courses limited visibility and widely varying roles within the curriculum. In 1987, a study was conducted by the Center for the Study of Community Colleges to determine the goals and characteristics of the students who participate in the fine and performing arts at community colleges. Study findings, based on responses from 1,079 students, included the following: (1) half of the arts students were aged 21 or younger; (2) 38% were employed for more than 20 hours per week; (3) 7.1% of the students were Hispanic, 4.0% were Black, and 3.3% were Asian; (4) 52% of the students were attending the community college &quot;to prepare for  transfer,&quot; 18% &quot;to gain skills necessary to enter a new occupation,&quot; and 22% &quot;to satisfy a personal interest&quot;; (5) in comparison to a national sample of students taking all types of courses, the arts students were younger, more likely to be attending college to prepare for transfer or for their own personal interest, considerably less likely to be Black, and more likely to indicate that their experiences at college had affected them positively; and (6) though only a small percentage of students had been involved professionally with the arts before college, 38% expected that they would be deriving a significant portion of their income from a career in the arts within 5 years.

The first section describes the state's two-year college system and its legislatively mandated mission. The next section reviews the 70-year history of the area schools, focusing on legislative influences, enrollment trends, fiscal considerations, changes in mission, and cooperative and economic development activities. After examining the governance structure of the system and outlining the role and responsibilities of the local boards of directors and the State Board of Education, the report offers information on the four major sources of revenue for the system:  tuition and fees, local taxes, state general aid, and reimbursement programs. In addition, expenditures by function and category are reviewed for fiscal year 1987, and the new foundation formula for funding area colleges is explained. The next section looks at the comprehensive curricula offered by the colleges in the areas of adult basic education and high school completion courses, continuing and general education courses, supplementary vocational courses, college-parallel arts and sciences courses, preparatory vocational programs, special needs programs, customized training programs, programs for secondary school students, avocational and recreational courses, and programs for institutionalized individuals. This section also reviews the degrees and awards offered by the colleges. The  final section offers a breakdown of enrollments in area colleges, reported as headcounts and full-time equivalents.

The first sections of the report cover counseling activities, transfer patterns, College Fairs, individual student recruitment, conference attendance, transfer workshops, TOP articulation and cross-registration programs with other postsecondary institutions, the TOP Scholars Program, and graduate follow-up research. Next, implications of these findings for program development are discussed, indicating that: (1) the high proportion of students who failed to complete degree requirements prior to transfer might be addressed by making a more accurate determination of the number of students who actually  intend to obtain an associate degree, developing more specific as well as generic transfer articulation agreements with colleges and universities, and strengthening the faculty advising system; (2) over the past 3 years, a majority of RCC students chose to remain in the Boston area to pursue their baccalaureate education, pointing to a need for further articulation with colleges in the immediate area; (3) faculty identification of potential transfer students appeared to be the most viable method of recruiting students for transfer workshops; and (4) the TOP programs have resulted in a 10% increase in RCC's transfer rate.

Part II offers an overview of the development of the community college curriculum and the numerous reform movements which affected it. The important contributions of the Yale Report of 1828, the Morrill Act of 1862, and post-Civil War expansion and reconstruction efforts are  reviewed. Part III presents the fictitious letters, representing the views of Francis Wayland, President of Brown University; Henry P.

        "description":"The information that is currently collected on the nation's postsecondary institutions focuses primarily on quantity, addressing the need for descriptive information on students, faculty, and finances. This type of research, though necessary, is not sufficient for an understanding of the broader accountability issues emerging in the 1980's. Available data, when they do provide indices of student flow and outcomes, may grossly underestimate the institutional effectiveness of community, technical, and junior colleges. Many community colleges are attempting to gain a better understanding of their students by assessing: student educational objectives; the causes of student attrition and the extent to which it signifies student failure; and occupational and transfer outcomes. Sample  research efforts in these four areas are briefly described in this review, including: (1) studies to determine student goals and intentions conducted at Glendale Community College (Glendale, Arizona) and Vista College (Berkeley, California); (2) follow-up studies of college dropouts conducted in the Los Rios Community College District (Sacramento, California) and at Butler County Community College (Butler, Pennsylvania) designed to disaggregate those who attained their goals from those who did not; (3) vocational follow-up research conducted at William Rainey Harper College (Palatine, Illinois) to determine vocational students' job attainment and the economic \"rate of return\" on vocational studies; and (4) transfer outcome assessments conducted in the San Mateo County Community College  District (San Mateo, California) and at Piedmont Virginia Community College (Charlottesville, Virginia).

The Doheny Campus has consistently developed innovative programs to enable students to successfully complete associate in arts degrees and also baccalaureate degrees at the main campus. The success of MSMC's efforts to retain its ethnically diverse student population is attributed to a coordinated program of academic development and support services. The program involves the following components: (1) admissions and testing to identify students with potential for success and their skill levels; (2) required classes to develop skills in areas where testing shows students are weak;  (3) an extended, semester-long orientation course; (4) required work with a tutor at the Learning Resource Center; (5) an early warning system to notify students and their advisors of any difficulties the students are having; (6) a residence program capable of housing up to 170 students; (7) availability of courses in the baccalaureate program; (8) career counseling and internships; (9) community outreach; (10) English as a Second Language courses; and (11) multicultural tools and services. The MSMC program is based on the belief that students can succeed in college if placed in a supportive environment where there is individual attention, intervention when difficulties appear, and much feedback from the faculty and administration.

The report begins with a brief discussion of the major points of difference between the funding mechanisms for the community colleges and for the state's two public university systems. These differences include the community colleges' place in the budget process, their lack of statewide faculty salary scales, their block budget allocations, their lack of state expenditure controls, their Board of Governor's lack of budgetary flexibility, and their governance structure. An overview of the different systems of finance under which the California community colleges have operated since 1975 is followed by a summary of the major  defects of the current funding system (e.g., enrollment-driven budgets, lack of enrollment planning or management, limited local decision making, lack of state accountability and control, emphasis on legislative liaison, and disagreement over state priorities). After summarizing the key elements of current proposals to fund the colleges on a program budget basis, the report concludes with a re-iteration of the California Postsecondary Education Commission's policy on college finance. The executive summary of the recent report on community college finance by the Task Force on Assembly Bill 3409 is appended. (UCM)",

        "description":"Prior to registration at the Community College of Philadelphia (CCP), most potential new students are given a battery of tests to place them into appropriate courses, specific areas of study, or special support programs. Most students are tested on one day and then asked to return on a subsequent day for counseling and registration. Between October 1984 and September 1985, 7,891 potential students were tested in math, writing, and reading. Of these, 1,090 (14%) had not registered for classes by the fall 1985 semester. A comparison of the test scores of the registrants and non-registrants who spoke English as a native language revealed the following: (1) 40.2% of the registrants and 39.9% of the non-registrants had scores placing them into college-level math courses; (2) 40.1% of  the registrants and 27.1% of the non-registrants had scores placing them into college-level writing courses; and (3) 35.7% of the registrants and 24% of the non-registrants performed at college-level on the reading test. Among the potential students for whom English was a second language, there were no significant differences in the placement test scores of registrants and non-registrants. Though, in general, the students who registered had slightly higher scores than those who did not register, many of the students who did not register performed at college-level on the placement tests, suggesting that CCP might consider additional strategies to encourage enrollment when a potential student is tested.

Measures of success, therefore, must take into account the diversity of students' objectives for enrollment and permit the college to distinguish between students who have achieved a satisfactory level of progress and those who have not. Five categories of student success/outcomes can be established: (1) successful students, including graduates and students who drop out with 30 or more credits and a grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or greater; (2) probably successful students, including those who are enrolled full- or part-time or in remedial programs, those who withdraw with a GPA of 2.0 or greater, and those who drop out with less than 30 credits and a GPA of 2.0 or  greater (3) unsuccessful students, including those who drop out with a GPA less than 2.0, those who drop out with no GPA, and those who are dropped by the college for poor scholarship or inadequate progress; (4) probably unsuccessful students, who withdraw with a GPA of less than 2.0; and (5) unclassifiable students, including those who stop out and those who withdraw with no GPA. The application of these categories to students who entered the Community College of Philadelphia in fall 1983 shows that, as of spring 1987, 15.0% were successful, 39.6% were probably successful, and 45.2% were unsuccessful. The categories were also applied to determine success rates by age, gender, race, area of study, and college-readiness at admission. (UCM)",

        "description":"These two research summaries examine transfer outcomes of former Community College of Philadelphia (CCP) students at Temple University. The first report examines the extent to which the CCP credits earned by 1,644 CCP transfers were accepted at Temple University over several semesters between fall 1979 and fall 1985. Among the highlighted findings are: (1) the average number of CCP credits earned was 47.14, though students leaving CCP in spring and fall 1985 showed a slight tendency to transfer with fewer credits than previous student groups; (2) the average number of credits lost in transfer to Temple was 9.67, representing 20.5% of the students' total accumulated CCP credits; and (3) credit hour losses amounted to an average financial liability of $95.06 for students who earned  fewer than 24 CCP credits, and of $574.28 for students who earned more than 23 CCP credits. Temple University transfer guidelines for CCP courses are appended. The second research brief offers a profile of CCP students who applied for admission to Temple University in 1980, 1981, 1984, and 1985, based on data provided by Temple's admissions office. The report traces trends in numbers of applicants, age, credits earned at CCP, grade point average (GPA), placement test scores, student majors, and student gender and race. The report indicates that the total number of students applying to Temple dropped from 750 in 1980 to 607 in 1985. The transfer students had enrolled at CCP for an average of six semesters, and had earned higher GPA's than the CCP student population as a whole.  (UCM)",

Interview teams, pairing RRHA and JSRCC staff members, surveyed a random sample of 10% of all 790 apartments in the two housing developments. Study findings included the following: (1) of the 79 persons interviewed, 99% were black and 89% were female; (2) 77% had not graduated from high school, and 76% were not employed; (3) though only 25% of the respondents stated that lack of  education or training had ever been a stumbling block to a better job, 96% felt that if they had more education they could earn more money; (4) of the 89% of the respondents who expressed an interest in more education, 53% were interested in studying to pass the General Educational Development exam, 64% wanted to take special courses to learn a skill, and 38% were interested in earning a college certificate or associate degree; (5) 79% said they would take classes if they were offered at the housing development; (6) respondents expressed the greatest interest in courses in nursing, child care, computer operations, and data entry, though nearly 50% of the programs selected were from the \"Personal Care\" category; and (7) problems related to child care and transportation were the major  barriers to class attendance.

Survey instruments were mailed to the chief instructional administrators at 93 two-year colleges, requesting information on program size, credits offered, numbers of full- and part-time music teachers, numbers of students enrolled in fall 1986 in various music courses, the availability of an associate degree with an emphasis or major in music, enrollment patterns, fees, and planned curricular changes. Study findings, based on responses from 56 administrators, included the following: (1) of the responding colleges, 53 offered music courses, 39 offered a planned two-year music degree program, 42 offered music theory, and 30 considered  enrollments in their music programs to be satisfactory; (2) among the Alabama colleges, 3 had bands with an average enrollment of 20.3 students, 7 had choruses, 1 had an orchestra, 3 had show choirs, and 6 had stage bands; (3) the anticipated number of performances ranged from a low of 1 and 2 performances per term to a high of 51 performances per year for a Mississippi community college country/western ensemble; (4) a course in the fundamentals of music was required by many institutions as a prerequisite for enrollment in music theory; (5) average enrollments in fundamentals of music courses were highest (26.4 students) in Alabama colleges and lowest (10.8 students) in Tennessee colleges; and (6) special fees for music instruction ranged from zero for the Alabama community college system  to a high at one Florida college of $90 per one credit/half-hour lesson per week.

Section I offers a brief analysis of the status of community college financing in 1988, highlighting several changes in resource allocation methods. The report notes that funds are directed to institutions on the basis of individual and/or system negotiation instead of by full-time student equivalent (FTE); that the political influence of the system/institution has increasingly become a major factor in determining allocations; and that states are increasingly computing allocations based on a \"cost to continue\" with an increased number of instances of funding for defined categorical aid. Section II presents  tables showing, for each state: (1) operating funds by source; (2) sources of state appropriations by percent for general operating and unrestricted funds; (3) mean expenditures of operating costs for credit programs; (4) rank order of states by reported expenditure per FTE student; (5) states reporting or anticipating changes in methods of financial support; (6) state funds which are categorical or for limited use; (7) sources of funds for capital outlay; (8) sources of funding for noncredit courses; (9) tuition/fee changes; (10) financial aid changes; (11) state provisions for colleges experiencing enrollment declines; and (12) state financial problems. Section III offers brief case studies of the financial situation in each state, grouped by type of funding method. Finally, section IV  suggests revised criteria for financing community colleges.

        "description":"In response to a statewide economic crisis resulting in a 9% funding cut for Texas community colleges, the presidents of nine Houston area community colleges formed a consortium to pool their resources and aggressively market the colleges. Since 1986, the Gulf Coast Consortium has mounted late-summer television and radio advertising campaigns to raise the image of the community colleges and hence public interest in individual institutions, and to increase awareness of community colleges as a viable alternative to higher-priced senior institutions. The advertising campaigns, which target the traditional student age group and women re-entering the workforce, are designed to dispel the negative perceptions held by area adults about the prestige, educational quality, and student  caliber of the community colleges, while underscoring the benefits of a community college education. The consortium's first campaign resulted in a gain of more than 473,000 contact hours, for a minimal investment of $150,000. A revised campaign the following year delivered another 3.5% increase in contact hours. Rather than utilize the services of an advertising agency as in previous years, the 1988 campaign is being researched, written, produced, and placed on the air by in-house professionals at a great reduction in cost.

        "description":"This report examines the estimated costs of implementing H.R. 925, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1987, as amended. This bill permits employees to take up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave over a 2-year period upon the birth or adoption of a child or serious illness of a child or parent and up to 15 weeks every 2 years for their own illness. Upon returning to work an employee is guaranteed the same, or an equivalent, job. In the first 3 years after enactment, firms employing 50 or more people are subject to the legislation, and thereafter firms employing 35 or more people must provide these benefits. Employers would be required to continue health benefits for a worker on unpaid leave on the same basis as if the employee were working. The GAO research entailed the review of studies  of employer parental leave policies and practices in the United States and elsewhere to identify: (1) the extent that firms currently offer unpaid leave similar to this legislation; (2) the likely number of users of unpaid leave and the expected length of absence, and (3) how companies cope with the absence of workers taking such a leave. Study results indicate that for leave to care for new children the estimated cost to employers will be about $90 to $102 million annually. Estimated cost of leave to care for seriously ill children is between $10 and $11 million annually; estimated cost of leave to care for seriously ill parents is $35 to $38 million annually; and health insurance cost to employers for temporary medical leave is estimated to be about $53 to $61 million annually. The  lower figures in these estimates are for firms having 50 or more employees while the higher figures include firms with between 35 and 49 employees. (RWB)",

        "description":"The Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families of the House of Representatives, 100th Congress, held a hearing to review financial pressures likely to confront American families in the future. Experts' testimony first focused on: (1) recent trends in the economic status of children; (2) the issue of whether the growth of the service sector of the economy contributes to the decline of the status of the middle class; and (3) changes in job policies that have resulted in declines in income and the middle class, increases in poverty, and the basic inability of families to meet financial needs. Discussion identified the need for specific information on why people work part-time, how many would work full-time if possible, and how day care affects the ability to work full-time or  part-time. (Such information is provided in the text in reprints of articles and survey data.) Subsequent testimony reported trends in the demand for and supply of child care, cost of child care between 1975 and 1985, college costs and ability to pay for college, and health insurance coverage among children and families with children. Testimony also reported on historical changes in housing policy and what can be done to help families who are inadequately housed. Concluding testimony concerned the role of the federal government in addressing family problems. (RH)",

        "description":"Six groups of children 2- to 4-years-old were videotaped and interviewed during five 30-minute free play sessions for the purpose of investigating the evolution of children's conceptions of the process of cooperation. Children's answers were organized into six themes, each of which described some aspect of cooperative activity. For each theme, children's answers were classified according to a hierarchy of four levels. Themes included: (1) group participation; (2) activity within the group; (3) objects used in the activity; (4) rules governing the activity; (5) roles associated with the activity; and (6) coordination of actions. Findings indicate that there is no sudden appearance of a higher level of conceptualization at a given age, but rather a process of maturation of  potentialities. In addition, because children's levels of conceptualization were not equivalent for each theme, an analysis of a child's conception of cooperation necessitated the use of more than a single criterion. The children's representation of cooperation was dependent on the way they organized their conceptions of the different themes, and the articulation of these themes would undergo adjustments depending on the interrelations the children were involved in.

        "description":"This paper reviews research on the relationship between infant temperament and maternal caregiving, and discusses conflicting findings. After emphasizing the central importance of independent measures in tests of interactions between temperament and caregiving, the paper reports two studies designed to clarify the relationship. In Study One, 48 mothers and infants participated in an investigation of the extent to which maternal sensitivity at the end of the infant's first year could be predicted from prenatal maternal attitudes, infant irritability during the neonatal period, or an interaction between both. Findings were consistent with the view that the impact of infant temperament on caregiving depends on caregiver characteristics, such as developmental history, personality,  experience, and stress. An association between infant irritability and maternal insensitivity appeared to evolve over time. In Study Two, conducted from infants' 3rd to 24th month, 40 mothers and their infants participated in an investigation of the antecedents of angry and punitive maternal behavior and the predictors of child anger, noncompliance, low confidence, and social withdrawal. Findings suggested that the origins of anger, noncompliance, and low confidence in children cannot be attributed solely to patterns of maternal care. Concluding discussion explores implications of the findings for studies of attachment and recommends directions for future research. (RH)",

These findings strongly support the notion of a cross-cultural universality of maternal melodies, and indicate a primary biological determination. At the same time, significant differences were found with regard to the extent of speech adjustments. Chinese mothers raised their overall pitch less and expanded pitch excursions less than did American mothers. This finding reflects certain constraints on pitch modulation which may be  explained linguistically and culturally. Chinese mothers compensated for such constraints through a high proportion of unconstrained modeling sounds. (PCB)",

Several questions were addressed: (1) Does maternal employment status influence adolescents' perceptions of child rearing? (2) Does maternal employment influence adjustment as a function of perceptions of mothers' or fathers' perceived child rearing? and (3) Does maternal employment influence perceptions of child rearing and adjustment differentially across age or sex? Findings revealed that maternal employment was not related to adjustment, either directly or in interaction with perceptions of maternal or paternal child rearing  practices. Maternal employment interacted with developmental level in perceptions of child rearing. Parents were perceived by adolescents in grades 7 and 8 as being more accepting when mother did not work or worked only part-time; the same perception was held by adolescents in grades 9 and 10 when mother did not work, and by those in grades 11 and 12 when mother worked full-time. The same trend was found for perceptions of parents allowing psychological autonomy. Higher perceived acceptance and lower perceived use of psychological control by both parents were related to better adjustment among adolescents. (RH)",

The paper defines the problem of latchkey children; reviews related literature and programmatic responses to the problem; reports responses of four southern states; and points out implications for policy initiatives. The term &quot;latchkey children&quot; refers to children in self-care or sibling-care during a significant portion of their out-of-school hours. The literature review focuses on the number of latchkey children, origins of the trend, research findings on risks of self-care, children's fears, boredom and other emotional effects, television as surrogate parent, self-esteem and susceptibility to peer pressure, school performance, sexual  experimentation, and depression. The review of programmatic responses to the problem discusses attempts to get children into SACC and attempts to reduce risks to latchkey children. Qualities of good SACC programs are pointed out. Seven implications for policy initiatives are discussed, including the responsibility of educators, the need to involve many community sectors, sharing costs of interventions, needed state and federal legislation, use of existing professional expertise and community resources, diversity of solutions, and the relation between primary and back-up solutions.

        "description":"This is the second in a series of three reports addressing issues, problems, and potential solutions critical to the development of accessible, affordable, and quality day care in Oregon. At present, the majority of Oregon households have two or more wage earners, and the majority of Oregon children need child care on a daily basis. Priority issues discussed include: (1) quality in child care programs; (2) state regulation of child care services; (3) making child care affordable; (4) establishment of an Office of Child Care; (5) encouraging employer and corporate involvement; (6) parental leave; (7) infant and toddler care; (8) school age day care; (9) day care for special needs children; (10) child care information and referral services; and (11) liability insurance. Emerging  issues discussed include teen-parent child care, ill child care, community planning, and national child care issues that affect Oregon. The concluding section of the report reviews 1987's accomplishments: legislation acted upon, seven community meetings sponsored by the Oregon Commission on Child Care, and a statewide conference sponsored by the commission. References cite literature concerning child care in other states, Oregon studies and reports, major books and reports, and periodicals and articles. (RH)",

Although existing migrant and seasonal farmworker health data is incomplete, general statements can be made about the health risks faced by this population. The migrant population suffers health problems related to poor sanitation and overcrowded living conditions at rates much higher than the nonmigrant population. Provision, maintenance, and use of field sanitation facilities such as toilets and potable drinking water at the worksite would substantially decrease the incidence of sanitation related health problems among farmworkers. Most migrants seek medical  treatment for acute ailments rather than chronic conditions or preventive services. Parasitic infections afflict migrants an average of 20 times more than the general population. The full extent of pesticide poisoning is not known and needs further study. The dangers of agricultural labor on women and on the development of farmworker children are poorly documented. Agriculture is the second most dangerous occupation in the United States, yet farmworkers are rarely offered or able to afford health insurance, and in 20 states are not covered by workers' compensation of any kind.

        "description":"A model was developed to explore the relationship between the personal characteristics of rural community residents, their social involvement, and their social awareness. Specific personal characteristic variables were educational level, gender, gross family income, and marital status. Social involvement variables were personal impact of farm financial strain, knowledge of a financially strained farm operator, and number of voluntary association memberships. Of the 527 rural community residents surveyed, 12.3% were not involved in any voluntary association, and 41% were members of only one voluntary association. Personal characteristic variables weighed heavily in determining the total number of voluntary association memberships. Education and gross family income were  significantly related to the total number of voluntary association memberships, while gender and marital status were not significantly related. Of greatest importance in determining awareness of social issues was the degree to which the farm crisis had an impact on the residents personally. Based on this study, community change agents need to consider the use of relationship networks when attempting to disseminate information and advance social change. Change agents must also take into account the fact that persons with less education or with lower gross family incomes will be less likely to hold voluntary association memberships. (JHZ)",

        "description":"Since the 1970s, Outward Bound (OB) has borrowed psychological language and models to articulate its educational objectives and methods in terms accessible to mainstream educators. This report claims that OB's uncritical adoption of psychological language and models will undermine its commitment to certain core values of its tradition. This is supported by analyses of three attempts to explain some aspect of OB's educational objectives and methods. In each case, it is shown how the adoption of psychological language and models is accompanied by the de-emphasis or omission of a traditional value and the traditional value is de-emphasized or omitted because it is incompatible with the views of the world and human nature reflected in the language and models. Assuming that the  language and models used to describe objectives and methods influence educational practice, the de-emphasis or omission of traditional values in descriptions of OB will undermine commitment to them at the level of practice. Recommendations of how OB might strengthen its commitment to its traditional values are presented, and it is suggested that OB make explicit the views which are implicit in its tradition and then develop their implications for conceiving, designing, instructing, staffing, administering and evaluating its courses.

Nearly 63% were under 25 years of age; 53.6% of these between 5 and 17. The median age was 19.1 years, nearly 10 years younger than the state median of 28.3 years. Almost 44% of men and 34.7% of women were single. Fertility levels for Native American women were much higher than for North Dakota women in general. The crude death rate mirrored that of whites (8.7 deaths per thousand), but infant mortality was greater among Native Americans. In 1980, 28.7% of all Native Americans in North Dakota aged 25 or over had  completed fewer than 9 years of formal education. The labor force participation (52.5%) was lower than the 61.4% statewide for persons aged 16 and over, with 19.2% unemployed, or four times the state rate. The largest proportion (26.2%) of Native Americans were employed in service occupations, with the average income, in 1979, $12,975, compared with $20,473 for all families. Almost 40% of all Native Americans were impoverished in 1979, more than three times the level of impoverishment for North Dakota in general. Statistical data are appended. (JMM)",

The first two sections of the report describe rural populations and communities, paying particular attention to changes since 1970 and to regional differences in growth rate, economic base, and racial/ethnic composition. Using national figures supplemented with regional or local data, Section III examines the \"conventional wisdom\" assumptions that the 50-year trend to consolidate schools is abating. Section IV focuses on the lag of the nonmetropolitan population as a whole, and all racial and ethnic groups in particular, behind the metropolitan population on measures of college attainment, high school attainment, and literacy rates during the  1970s. Section V reports how high school seniors answered questions about their classes, teachers, and schools in the 1981 \"High School and Beyond\" study. A final summary and conclusion section suggests a need for educators and policy makers to consider three elements of education as it occurs in the nation's rural schools: equity, curriculum, and planning around regional differences within a national context.

It is organized around four major sections that reflect the process of teaching, learning, and schooling including: (1) &quot;Teaching and the Teacher&quot; (studies of teacher attitudes, perceptions, practices, repertoires and performance); (2) &quot;Learning and the Learner&quot; (the nature of learning and characteristics of the learner); (3) &quot;Curriculum and Instruction&quot; (the nature of curricula, instructional variables, and characteristics of exemplary science programs); and (4) &quot;Instrument Development and Analysis&quot; (efforts to develop and/or validate  instruments to measure the process of teaching, learning and schooling). Each major section begins with an overview of the research summarized and a context for review, and ends with a reference list appropriate to that section. No effort to conduct an in-depth analysis of each research area was made. A discussion of the significance of the studies and implication for practice and future research is included in each major section. Three imperatives that were noted were the need for research to have a greater impact upon classroom procedures, greater teacher interaction, and teacher collaboration on research teams. (CW)",

        "description":"A very diverse population of students choose nursing as a profession in Israel. Although chemistry is basic for studying nursing, most of these students have not studied chemistry in school for longer than a single year--usually in grade 10. A chemistry curriculum for nursing schools was developed, implemented, and evaluated. This curriculum was designed to meet goals identified in a preliminary needs assessment including: (1) the need for a chemistry base for advanced nursing courses, such as biochemistry and pharmacology; (2) the need for content to be applied to students with different backgrounds in science; and (3) the need to increase the usual lack of interest of nursing students in studying chemistry. During the academic year of 1985, the &quot;Chemistry for Nursing Schools&quot;  course was studied by 400 student nurses, in 10 nursing schools. The implementation of this course included discussions with teachers employing the new curriculum, the development of teaching aids, and an evaluation using pre- and post-achievement and attitude tests. Both teachers and student nurses indicated that the new curriculum fulfilled a need for a chemistry course for nursing schools, contributed significantly to the improvement of the image of chemistry, and diminished the anxiety often caused by the study of chemistry.

        "description":"This paper presents research designed to study the West African Examination Council's (WAEC) policy and its impact on teaching chemistry in Nigerian secondary schools. Five knowledgeable public figures in Nigeria and Great Britain were interviewed concerning policy formulation and implementation. Five pertinent documents were analyzed. Ethnographic methods were used to develop the case study. A database was developed from field-notes, data from interviews, and questionnaires administered to education officials, chemistry teachers, school administrators, and students. The interview data yielded salient information about the operation of WAEC in West Africa and Nigeria, compared with that of the University of London School Examinations Board (ULSEB) in England. Two main differences  were observed: (1) the strong influence of the African government on WAEC's operation, whereas, the ULSEB is not influenced by the British government; and (2) the issue of security, which has led to examination leakages in African states. Implications and conclusions drawn from the study include the need to: develop strategies to improve organizational communication in the Nigerian centralized educational system; and (2) improve preservice training of chemistry teachers to make them more effective communicators of scientific information.

        "description":"This study was part of a continuing exploration of the naive misconceptions of students in the physical sciences conducted within the context of current literature in alternative frameworks. The sample was selected from among those students registered for a liberal education physical science class at a small private college. The method used was a clinical interview, beginning with very open-ended questions, moving to that of &quot;interview-about-instances,&quot; and ending with a paper-and-pencil test. During interviews about the nature of the solar system, the subject invariably turned to gravity. This appeared to be an exceptionally salient topic to the students and one about which they were very uncertain. Most subjects had some grasp of the concept that the mass and gravity of an  object were related. A common interpretation was that, since the gravitational force acted from a point at the center of the planet, it was diminished at the surface as a planet became larger. The presence of the sun appeared to be a major factor in the judgments made by most students. The most salient relationship was between the sun and planets. The results indicated most had a reasonable concept of gravity. It was anticipated that the observed misconceptions could be corrected by an appropriately designed intervention. (Author/CW)",

The report includes a description of the sample design, instrument development, data collection, file preparation, analysis procedures, and survey forms. Topics covered in the report include science and mathematics courses; use of textbooks in science and mathematics classes; instructional objectives and activities; science and mathematics teachers; professional development; and factors which affect instruction in science and mathematics education. Among the findings were: (1) many science teachers lack adequate training; (2) half or more of the science and mathematics teachers felt unprepared to use computers as an instructional tool; (3) a large  proportion of teachers have not taken a course for college credit in the last 10 years; (4) though many teachers attend conferences and meetings, the amount of time devoted to inservice education was typically less than 6 hours per year; and (5) the percentage of classes using hands-on activities has dropped since 1977. The report also stressed that the majority of science and mathematics teachers are somewhat isolated from facilities and resources needed to effectively teach their classes. (CW)",

        "description":"Children who have difficulty reading content materials are sometimes found to read fiction quite well. These children may not have the conceptual knowledge they need to relate the text material to their own lives. Children may experience difficulty reading content texts because they do not actively try to relate to and build knowledge from one situation to the next. Because of the shallow presentation and disorganization of content in some texts, children are required to make inferences and contribute all the meaning. This themed approach helps address these concerns in that it builds the learner's background for the print by giving real experiences which capture the child's interest in learning, facilitates independence in learning and active involvement, and provides well  written texts. This approach also uses a variety of materials and activities to develop skills, strategies, and interest in reading. These include charts, poems, recipes, and games. An example of such an approach is included. Strategies and activities demonstrated are: (1) a cloze activity; (2) charting questions; (3) reading strategies; (4) non-print resources; (5) semantic webbing; and (6) a recipe. All involving a unit on bats as an example. Activities stress that readers need to use the semantic, syntactic, and graphophonic cueing systems in a balanced and effective way. Risk taking, like effective use of strategies, is modeled, guided, and reinforced whenever possible. (CW)",

This paper reports on a study of conceptual change in mechanics with particular concern with the nature of student awareness of any conceptual change. Metacognition and constructivist views of learning were considered. This study focused on three purposes: (1) to investigate the impact on student performance on related content in the following year of any conceptual exchange; (2) student perception in the subsequent year of the nature, purpose and value of the instruction aimed at conceptual change; and (3) the effect of laboratory strategies used in more usual educational  contexts to promote conceptual change. The study involved 46 year 10 students one year, and 110 year 11 students the next year, including 28 from the previous year's group, in Victoria, Australia. The study concludes that: the approaches used in year 10 to promote conceptual exchange had some utility; year 10 instruction has an effect on year 11 performance; and year 11 perceptions of the value of the year 10 experience varied. This reinforces the need to explicitly help students understand and control their own learning as a major contributor to developing their own understanding. (CW)",

        "description":"In considering implications for teaching and learning found in research, a number of writers have urged teachers to probe students conceptions before teaching a concept. The purpose of this probing is to allow the teacher to begin instruction from the conceptual position or positions of the students. This approach carries with it the assumption that teachers themselves have an understanding of the concept which is congruent with the view of science. The fundamental purpose of this study was to explore the validity of this assumption about the nature of the understanding of high school teachers in Nigeria. It was based on a constructivist view of learning. Practicing high school teachers (N=251) took a written test on concepts that they had been teaching and 45 agreed to be  interviewed following the test. Another group of 157 trainees was also given the test. Examples of questions and response patterns were given. The study concluded that teachers exhibit the same range of misconceptions as students. Teachers tend to use more sophisticated terminology and have a generally lower frequency of misconceptions. There were no systematic trends by teacher qualifications. Tertiary science teaching is suggested as the appropriate source of the problem. (CW)",

The problems selected were based upon a phenomenon about which every individual has some general awareness and common understanding. The problem series presented a sequence of phases, each of which builds upon the previous one. The sequence required the subject to restructure the problem elements previously used  in a new and extended environment. Problem sequences were presented to individual subjects via a clinical interview. Once the subject had presented his or her view of the problem phase, it was graphically simulated on the computer screen. The subject then compared his or her interpretations of events with that generated by the computer. This study involved 10 graduate students in a master's level program for elementary education.

These include connections and applications, attitudes, creativity, process, and information. Some of the results demonstrating the advantages of an S/T/S focus for school science from an assessment of 300 Iowa classrooms, grades four through nine, are shown and discussed. Included are differences in: (1) student abilities; (2) attitudes; (3) student behaviors  judged to indicate degree of creativity; (4) student ability with selected science processes; and (5) acquisition of science information.

The PYI awards represent a partnership between the investigators, their institutions, private industry and the Federal Government. The NSF provides each awardee with an annual base grant of $25,000 for up to five years. It will also provide up to $37,500 in additional funds each year on a dollar-for-dollar matching basis to funds made available to the awardee from the industrial sector. The grantee institution guarantees the academic-year salary of awardees at that  institution. Altogether, this five-year package provides a significant start to an academic teaching and research career. The principal purpose of this booklet is to provide information to facilitate the interaction between PYI awardees and potential industrial sponsors. Section I outlines the major terms and conditions of the awards, and highlights those areas which are likely to be of interest in awardee-industry interactions. Section II contains the research interests and other information for the awardees of 1986. This information was provided by the awardees. Sections III and IV list the active 1985 and 1984 PYIs, their institutions, and fields of research. The research interest statements included were provided by the awardees. In Section V, NSF acknowledged those industrial  organizations that have provided matching support for the awardees. (TW)",

Forty-six students enrolled in general biology classes at a rural high school volunteered to participate in the study. These students were administered instruments to assess the level of cognitive development and line graphing ability. Twenty students were chosen to participate in the study. Experimental students experienced four laboratory exercises that used a microcomputer to gather, display, and graph experimental data. Contrast students experienced the same four laboratory exercises using conventional laboratory equipment and produced line graphs by hand. Effects due to instructional  method were found on the assessment of the students' graph construction and interpretation abilities. Students experiencing MBL exercises outperformed the contrast students on graph interpretation tasks. Students experiencing conventional laboratory exercises outperformed the experimental students on graph construction tasks. Effects due to cognitive development were indicated, with those students classified as high cognitive development outscoring those classified as low. Interview data revealed that students applied prior knowledge and experience to the conditions presented by the graph and were led to erroneous conclusions about what the graph actually represented. The students also reached improper conclusions about the interpretation of graphs when they improperly scaled axes.  (TW)",

This paper explains the tentative model in detail and presents the results of a pilot test of the model, which project staff conducted during the first year of the project. The goals for the project are: (1) to develop and test a model of implementing educational computing in school science; (2) to train 260 science teachers and administrators in the Pikes Peak region of Colorado to use microcomputers to enhance science learning and teaching; (3) to establish a network in the Pikes Peak region to implement educational computing in school science; and (4) to disseminate a  model of implementation for educational computing in school science. The project met its first year objectives and was successful at increasing science teachers' use of microcomputers. Project staff defined and measured implementation according to the Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM). Results from pre- and posttests using the Stages of Concern Questionnaire from CBAM indicated that the participants changed from a profile typical of non-users of an innovation toward one typical of users. Project staff developed an Innovation Configuration checklist to describe participants' use of microcomputers. Most of the participants were using microcomputers in several ways by the end of the year.

The project's goals were to develop science and mathematics curricula based on the principles of systems dynamics. The course was a test of materials intended to provide students with methods for problem solving by introducing them to modeling software and concepts of systems thinking. Students engaged in a study of levels and rates, causal-loop diagrams, feedback, exponential growth, exponential decay, goal-seeking behavior, s-shaped behavior, and oscillating behavior by modeling real-life problems. Some of the problems that students worked on dealt with population growth, bank balances, temperature  cooling, capacitor discharging, city growth, and predator-prey relationships. Nine boys and six girls volunteered to participate in the project. Evaluation of the course consisted of pre- and posttesting, observations, administration of a student background questionnaire, and interviews with students at the conclusion of the course. All questions in the categories tested showed a significant gain in correct responses from the pretest to the posttest. It was concluded that some transfer of skills was shown. (CW)",

The dependent variables for investigating the effects on achievement were the overall score and the knowledge and critical thinking subscores on an investigator-made achievement test given at the conclusion of the unit of study. Significant differences favoring the 4MAT group were found for overall achievement and on critical  thinking questions. No significant differences were found on knowledge-level questions. The dependent variables for investigating the instructional effect on attitudes were the ratings on unit-specific statements and statements about science in general.

This component often includes items designed to measure process skill ability. The purpose of this study was to examine the performance of high school students on four types of multiple choice items used to assess student's ability to identify manipulated and responding variables. Items differed only in the stimulus material presented to students. Stimulus material was either a question focusing on the relationship between two variables, a hypothesis, a description of an experiment, or a description of results of an experiment. Student performance on these item types was compared to their performance on a standard  Piagetian interview task of variable identification. The results of the study included: (1) the &quot;question&quot; format was the most difficult, while the &quot;results&quot; format appeared to be the easiest; (2) the &quot;description&quot; item type had a higher correlation with the total interview than any other item type. Among conclusions reached in this study was that although all four item types operate similarly, they did not correlate very highly with the interview/observation task. (CW)",

The results show that most countries have a large proportion of their students in school and generally taking the same mathematics course during the first year of secondary school. By the terminal year, however, the number of mathematics options has increased in all countries while the  proportional number of students enrolled in such courses has decreased with equal proportions of males and females in only two of the six countries studied.

This study examines the respective and combined effects of feedback and review on students' achievement, retention, and level of cognitive development. A total of 55 ninth-grade students comprised five treatment groups which received an interactive slide/sound computer earth science lesson on &quot;The History of the Earth.&quot; All groups received 26 self-test questions throughout the program. The control group received no feedback to their responses to the self-test questions and no reviews for each of the seven sections of the program. One group received non-content feedback for the responses and no reviews, a second  group received content feedback and no reviews, a third group received non-content feedback and reviews; and the fourth group received content feedback and reviews. All subjects were given a 28-item achievement test immediately following the computer treatment and the same achievement test one week later. The study concluded that providing students with feedback produced significant increases in achievement, retention, and higher-order learning while a review produced significant improvement only in higher-order learning.

        "description":"The mental representations used by experts and novices for organizing their knowledge of a discipline have been studied by observing the categorization schemes these subjects produce when presented with a diverse group of problems. In this study, seven biology faculty, eight certified genetic counselors, and 26 students were asked to organize a set of 28 genetics problems based on how the person would solve them and to describe their schemes in writing. Subjects were categorized according to their success on four moderately difficult genetics problems. Successful faculty and student subjects organized problems according to genetic concepts which might form the chapter headings in a standard genetics text. The organizational schemes of genetic counselors were not similar to those  of the faculty subjects. Both the counselors and the students placed greater emphasis on the knowns and unknowns in the problems. In addition, the counselors emphasized the solution techniques to be used. Based on these findings, it does not appear that the mental schemes used by different sorts of experts in a given discipline to organize their knowledge of content and procedures in that discipline are necessarily designed along abstract/conceptual lines.

The courses were offered as part of the Summer Institute in Science, an Education for Economic Security Act Title II program funded by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Behavioral intention, attitude toward the behavior (and its determinants, behavioral beliefs and outcome evaluations), subjective norm (and its determinants, normative beliefs and motivations to comply) were determined using the method described by Ajzen and Fishbein (1980). The functional dependence of behavioral intention on attitude and subjective norm was examined. The purpose of this study was to explore the utility of the Theory of Reasoned Action for understanding and  predicting science teaching behavior. In particular, the study investigated the cognitive foundations and social support for the physical science teachers' decision to engage in a specific teaching behavior, using investigative methods to teach physical science in a yearlong, general education, high school course consisting of one semester each of introduction to physics and introduction to chemistry. Intent to use investigative methods to teach physical science appears to be the result of a teacher's personal decision to do so, without regard to social pressures. (CW)",

The sample for the study involved 24 junior high school mathematics teachers, 119 mathematics classes, and more than 2,500 students. Classes were tested using a 10 item problem-solving test at the beginning of the school year and at the end of the school year and increases in problem-solving performance were computed. Classes differed substantially in the amount of increases in performance. The five teachers with the largest class mean gains (highs) were compared with the five teachers with the lowest mean gains (lows). The high teachers taught 22 classes and 100 percent of these classes gained more than was  statistically predicted from pretest scores. For the low teachers, 75 percent of their classes gained less than was predicted. Thus, the teacher, and indirectly teaching behavior, seems to be an important factor in increasing student performance in the domain of mathematical problem-solving. (Author/PK)",

Although instructional practices were not prescribed, experimental teachers taught problem solving significantly more and number facts significantly less than control teachers. Experimental teachers encouraged students to use a variety of problem solving strategies, and they listened to  processes their students used significantly more than did control teachers. They believed that instruction should build upon students' existing knowledge more than did control teachers, and they knew more about individual students' problem-solving processes.

In this paper, it is argued that artificial data sets should be eliminated from the curriculum and that they should be replaced with real data sets. Towards this end, a rationale for using real data sets and the characteristics that make data sets particularly good for instructional use are described. The difficulties encountered when using real data and strategies for compensating for these drawbacks are also discussed.

        "author":["Wier, Elizabeth A."],
        "description":"This study was designed to determine whether a summer institute for elementary teachers could reduce or eliminate obstacles to teaching science. During summer, 1986, 10 primary teachers (K-3) participated in a month-long training session designed to help them improve their background knowledge of light and shadows and develop, teach, and revise a unit on the topic. During the following school year they taught the unit to their classes under the guidance of the institute director. The teachers' logs, final reports, and post-institute interviews were analyzed and compared with their pre-institute interviews to determine how they felt barriers to science teaching changed during the year. Pre-institute interviews indicated that the greatest obstacles were lack of time to teach  science, lack of materials and equipment, lack of assistance in terms of support personnel and the teachers' lack of background knowledge, skills and confidence. The teachers reported that their participation in the institute had helped them improve their science teaching, especially in the areas of how to teach and how to manage a class while teaching science. Several reported a transfer of strategies learned in the institute to other subjects. (CW)",

The underlying theoretical framework of this investigation was a constructivist view of learning, but more specifically it was based on Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning. The findings of this investigation were: (1) students did undergo qualitative changes in their knowledge, but some students more so than others; (2) these changes were related to the students' learning approach, i.e., positively related to the adoption of a meaningful learning set (a predisposition to learn meaningfully); and to the nature (quality and quantity) of their prior knowledge; and (3) evidence suggested that at least one of the subjects changed from  essentially a rote learner to a more meaningful learner. In addition, this study explored Ausubel's condition of adopting a meaningful learning set for meaningful learning to occur. (CW)",

Susan Parkes and Ann FitzGibbon introduce autobiography as a methodology for illuminating professional concerns in pre-service teacher education programs. Three papers, written by Declan Irvine, Yvonne O'Reilly, and Kevin Williams and Gerry McNamara, focus on concerns about inservice education and the coherence of youth education programs. An experimental teaching supervision program is considered by Maire Ui Chathain, while  papers by Mary Meany and Maire O Murehada describe various aspects of music education curricula. Anthony Motherway stresses the role and status of textbooks in teaching history and English, and John McMahon considers broadcast-based teaching as a concept in open learning systems. (JHP)",

Part 1 indicates that the LDP has governed Japan since 1955 and controls 445 seats in the 764 seat parliament. The selection of the prime minister, chosen from within the ruling party, is seen as vital to U.S. interests. For example U.S.-Japanese trade totaled 109 billion dollars in 1986. The last prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, presided over major changes in both politics and Japanese society. The primary concern for the United States is whether the new prime minister can reduce the current tension in U.S.--Japanese relations. Part 2 of the report describes the selection process for the prime ministers by the party members. Part 3 provides profiles of the  four candidates and describes the legacy of Nakasone. Part 4 outlines the key issues and implications of the election for the United States. The new prime minister will face several key tasks that include restructuring the economy, stabilizing the yen, and maintaining a base of support. Party support comes from farmers and rural residents, and the electoral process is candidate centered rather than party centered. LDP is the most conservative party but is perceived as flexible and responsive to public pressure. Party power is limited, and the bureaucracy plays a greater role in drafting legislation than in the United States. Appended are an economic fact sheet, a genealogy chart of LPD's five major factions from 1965-87, and a list of Japan's prime ministers from 1946-1987.  (NL)",

Informal logic teaches students to understand and analyze arguments which are fallacious, to determine what is valid and invalid, and to evaluate non-deductive arguments. John McPeck and Richard Paul questioned whether informal logic can teach critical thinking, since it varies from discipline to discipline. They believed that a background knowledge of relevant subject matter was vital for an assessment of truth or falsity of arguments and that there were methodological differences among disciplines. Paul challenged the assumption that critical thinking could be taught as a battery of technical skills as though each argument were an  individual unit outside its overall context. This approach he labeled &quot;atomistic,&quot; arguing that instead, critical thinking must focus on world, not segmental views. (NL)",

        "description":"Instructional models are distinct sets of sequenced teaching actions created to promote student achievement of selected learning outcomes. They identify: (1) the type of information to be presented to students; (2) the sequence in which it should be presented; (3) the teaching tactics that stimulate necessary cognitive learning processes; and (4) the tasks students must perform successfully to apply what they have learned. The study of instructional models helps preservice teachers develop a cognitive framework for making teaching decisions. An instructional models approach rests upon two basic assumptions: (1) the classroom situations, content goals, and students differ so widely that no single teaching method will ever be universally effective; and (2) a wide range of  instructional options exist, and teachers can adopt and adapt these models to their unique situations. The two families of models most appropriate to social studies teachers are the information processing models and the social interaction models. A models approach in a methods course is a powerful means to help preservice teachers become effective social studies teachers. It provides a cognitive framework for understanding instruction and a basis for responding appropriately to different curriculum goals. A models approach ensures that preservice teachers have the knowledge and technical skills needed to make a significant contribution to the education of citizens. (SM)",

Computer technology is viewed as a serious threat to privacy, electronic bugging devices are available to everyone, and the United States government is the largest user of electronic surveillance. The fact that databases are pervasive is evidenced by the realization that the U.S. government has three billion personal computer files that are sources of potential exploitation. Is it possible for the 200-year-old U.S. Constitution to adapt to the new technology? Can courts and laws change rapidly enough to protect citizens from what is now technologically possible? A social studies lesson plan presents three issues for classroom use: (1) changes in technology are accompanied by changes in the social  institutions; (2) technology makes possible new threats to basic freedoms; and (3) there is constant tension between what technology makes possible and what should be allowed when more than one basic freedom is threatened. Suggestions are provided for classroom activities that encourage discussion of the social implications of technological change. (NL)",

The success of the educational system is linked to various factors, such as the state of the national health, the excellence of the transportation system, a common language, and other cultural attitudes and values. Parents are considered responsible for their children's school work, and children attend school for longer hours and spend more hours studying than do U.S. children. Group goals take precedence over individual goals. Entrance to preferred schools is heavily competitive, as is entrance to higher educational institutions. Topography is a factor, because the Japanese population is concentrated in the coastal areas and in large cities. There is a 98 percent literacy rate.  Education has been the instrument of change in Japan, accomplishing national goals and attaining an effective world image. (NL)",

        "description":"This paper examines the concept of human completion, as applied to both the African and the Afro-American experience, and how the search for completion by the individual influences the collective society. The theoretical concepts of Paulo Freire and Albert Memmi are applied to both groups. Both groups have been denied equal opportunity for education and self-realization. Voting has been used as a means to achieve social and educational goals but has been ineffective when it was not combined with the education necessary to provide critical analytical skills. The search for self-liberation has led to social conflict, as the power structure has prevented the minority from achieving its goals. The conclusions drawn include: (1) that collective action is not possible without  individual action, which in turn depends upon the education of individuals; (2) that affirmative action programs are vital in assisting blacks in achieving education; (3) that collective action appears to be fading in the face of uncertain hope for individual achievement; and (4) that colonization still exists in the continued denial of equal opportunity. The problems inhibiting black progress in both groups are: (1) lack of meaningful employment; (2) shortage of housing; (3) breakdown of the family; (4) poverty; and (5) the resurgence of racism.

A discussion of the different content areas and approaches associated with citizenship education is presented in chapter 3. State mandates and the place of citizenship education in the elementary, junior high, and high school curricula are outlined in chapter 4. Methods of providing hands-on experience to students through  youth participation programs are outlined in chapter 5. The concluding chapter discusses ways to use the bicentennial celebration to revitalize citizenship education.

Denouncing secular humanism, these groups have initiated steps to obtain federal funding for private religious schools. Over the last 100 years public school textbooks have been revised to reflect various public criticisms, and this has resulted in changes in the treatment of history, literature, and religion in the classroom. The Scopes Trial of 1925 was one of the many forces that shaped textbook content. The market has responded to pressures from activist groups, and the result has been the production of textbooks for public schools that are written and designed to comply with perceived areas of future controversy. To prepare for  censorship conflicts parents, educators, and legislators need to study the published procedures for textbook selection, course content design, and the establishment of educational goals.

The criteria used were that the textbooks should be for the sixth grade level and that the children's literature should be used as supplementary materials. The results showed that of 94 textbook terms which were rated, 60 percent were viewed as favorable, 36 percent unfavorable, and 4 percent neutral. In the children's literature, 70 percent of the  17 terms evaluated were favorable and 30 percent were unfavorable, with 1 percent neutral.

After World War II ended, the United States had a series of decisions to make regarding a new Japanese government. General Douglas MacArthur asked the Japanese to write a new constitution and when it was not forthcoming, had a team of military officers on his staff trained in law and government prepare it. The result was the establishment of a successful  democracy in Japan. South Korea has a constitutional government modeled on western democratic values but has not had peaceful and democratic elections since its adoption in 1948. Between 1972 and 1982 the Philippines was under martial law and only recently has adopted a new constitution.

Two major orientations have guided studies in fertility behavior among working women. One is sociological, the other economic. The sociological hypothesis maintains that the more incompatible the role of mother and worker are, the more negative the relationship between employment and fertility. The economic hypothesis argues that an increase in labor force participation increases the opportunity cost of children, resulting in fertility reduction. However,  research findings from the Nigeria Fertility Survey 1981-82 showed that the relationship between work and fertility is not consistent with the role incompatibility and opportunity cost hypotheses. Women who had worked before and since marriage had the highest fertility rate, followed by women who worked since but not before marriage. Research findings indicate a need for a sound model specification to guide further research. An adequate model for the understanding of fertility-employment relationship must place the impact of culture at the center of analysis. Inconsistent findings with regard to the relationship between fertility and female labor force participation leaves policymakers without an adequate theoretical framework to guide policy action aimed at fertility reduction. A  substantial decline in fertility could be attained under a number of conditions affecting the ideal and structural realms of the society. (SM)",

Ideas of &quot;The Federalist&quot; are essential elements of education for citizenship in the U.S. constitutional democracy, and they are keys to understanding how U.S. government works. Ideas of &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; are congruent with the content of standard secondary social studies courses and can be infused into those courses. They can be used to teach core concepts of U.S. constitutional  government, and excerpts from selected essays can be utilized to explicate these civic concepts. Ideas of &quot;The Federalist&quot; can be used to encourage deliberation, reflection, and rational decision-making. Teachers can abbreviate, annotate, and otherwise edit selections from the documents to aid comprehension and interpretation of main ideas by students. References and ERIC resources are given. (SM)",

        "description":"This research indicates that art education can help develop visual perceptual abilities which can be applied to all areas of learning. Skills in visual perception developed through the study of art will help integrate subject areas. The study organized research and information that emphasized the redefinition of art in the elementary school curriculum, connecting art with visual perception and cognition, and stressing art's expanding role in general education. The study includes an annotated bibliography which is divided into four sections. Section 1 includes six annotated books and articles that describe the beginning of perception as vision and indicate the relationship between the senses and visual perception. Section 2 contains 18 books and articles that discuss the  connection between perception and cognition and the role of art in cognition. Section 3, containing 8 annotated books and articles, establishes that skills in visual perception can be taught. Section 4 includes annotations of 11 books and articles that examine visual literacy and its connection to the study of art. The research reveals that instruction in visual perception and thinking has increased the performance of children in mathematics and increased intelligence quotient test scores and perceptual discrimination skills. The paper also provides a glossary. (SM)",

        "description":"The early women college students were pioneers. They had a difficult time obtaining an opportunity for a college education, because college was not thought to be necessary for the women of the 19th century. By overcoming many obstacles, these early college graduates were able to reap the rewards of an intellectually stimulating career. This study of women's struggle for equal education: (1) outlines the historical background of women's education in the United States; (2) provides a chronology of educational opportunities; (3) profiles early women college students; (4) delineates the objectives of early women college educators; and (5) discusses the careers of college graduates. Female seminaries were the earliest opportunities for formal education. In 1839, the Georgia Female  College opened in Macon, Georgia as the first college for women to award the bachelor's degree. With the opening of this school, opportunities for women continued to grow. The women who were founders of colleges and the professors in early women's colleges provided the necessary role models and encouragement for women college students. Highly motivated pioneer women college students completed their college education and attained greater accomplishments. Today's college educators should know that pioneer college students from different ethnic groups are struggling for a college education and need the same kind of encouragement that early women pioneers had. Four pages of references are included. (SM)",

Using the Motivation-Hygiene Theory (Herzberg et al.) as a theoretical framework, each program was analyzed from the perspective of how it worked as a motivator and source of satisfaction or dissatisfaction for teachers in their work. Evidence from the research was sufficient to warrant a number of general conclusions about the two programs: (1) business imposed its model of merit pay (the Florida Master Teacher Program) on the educational system; (2) QUIIP was implemented in response to the perceived limitations of the Florida Master Teacher Program; (3) merit pay became a confusing phenomenon for both  those experiencing it and evaluating it, with two different programs being imposed on teachers at the same time; (4) the two models of merit pay functioned, in part, in different ways; and (5) merit pay in either the form of school based merit pay or individual level merit pay does not provide a solution to the general problem of low teacher salaries. Policy recommendations are suggested based on these conclusions. (JD)",

This paper examines these arguments for professionalizing teaching, and raises doubts that the goals set forth in the reports would be realized by the forms of professionalization proposed. The particular forms of the professionalization of teaching proposed in the Carnegie Commission and Holmes Group reports are examined. Questions are raised on the effects these forms might have on schools and their students, and on the possibility of other ways to help teachers become experts without the potentially adverse effects of proposed structural changes in  teaching. These questions are answered by examining the key characteristics of the Holmes Group and Carnegie proposals and the grounds upon which they are based. It is suggested that the particular forms of professionalization offered in these reports may neither be desirable nor necessary to the restructuring of teacher education programs. Alternatives that are more likely to succeed in achieving the larger goals in these reports are discussed. (JD)",

The 5-year program is structured on the triad model for supervision. In this model, the unversity supervisor observes the graduate student teaching intern during the academic year, using a clinical supervision strategy in which the  supervisor meets with the intern for pre-conference, observation, and post-conference sessions. Meetings often involve the cooperating teacher as well, thus forming a &quot;triad.&quot; This paper describes the role and responsibilities of each of the participants in the program. The training of the cooperating teacher for supervisory responsibilities is also discussed, as well as the organization and structure of the collaborating team and the relationships between its members.

The evaluation team consisted of four individuals with different disciplinary perspectives, coming from the fields of: health and medicine, developmental psychology, community and youth education, and communications and media. In addition to identifying developmental trends in health behavior, the team was committed to conducting ongoing research with every project they  introduced into the schools. A detailed description is given of the team's activities. Because the team was composed of four individuals with multiple roles, simultaneously involved in promoting research and development goals, the collaboration frequently involved conflicting goals and compromises as well as creative development. Nevertheless, their experience spoke to the importance of involving an interdisciplinary evaluation team if schools are to develop, implement, and institutionalize cost-effective health promotion programs.

Criterion performances were the frequency and quality of the supervisory conference behavior used on two separate microsupervision sessions and on five observational instruments. Results showed: (1) experimental microsupervision did not yield significantly higher nor more varied performance frequencies than the control group; (2) the reliability trial results for the conference and teaching category systems were considered highly satisfactory; and (3) a high positive and negative  relationship between teaching and supervisory conference behavior in the experimental group was attained. A discussion is presented on the findings, and on the linear relationship between personal and professional characteristics of teachers. A stepwise multiple regression analysis of a teaching behavior by supervisory conference ratio factors indicated that the teaching behavior, &quot;Data Recall,&quot; was significantly predicted by several supervision ratio factors.

The institutional survey solicited data characterizing the institutions and their teacher education programs, mission and structure, and areas of accreditation for the institutions. Data specific to teacher education were collected on number and types of programs, enrollments, level of accreditation and/or state approval, faculty and student demographics in relation to program type, program  requirements for admission and exit, and faculty salaries and tenure. Following an introduction, four sections elaborate on the data collected. Section one presents the context for teacher education by examining data from the institutions as a whole and from the education unit. Section two concentrates on the anatomy of a program with a focus on secondary education. The third section looks at the education professoriate and section four looks at the students.

        "description":"This paper examines the area of teachers' practical arguments (arugments consisting in the search for a plan of action), considering questions such as: How does rationality manifest itself in practice, and in specific human practices like teaching? Is practical reasoning in teaching moral? Do values of theoretical reasoning, such as universality, logical order, explicitness, and completeness translate to the practical domain? It is argued that relying on practical arguments for the improvement of teaching ignores the extent to which teaching is an act of wisdom and belongs to the contemplative life. It is contended, also, that--in representing teachers' arguments for purposes of analysis and improvement--the distinction must be maintained between simplication and  misrepresentation, guarding especially against the conversion of methodological moves into stipulations about reality or appropriateness. Finally, some major philosophical difficulties in the analysis of practical reasoning are considered. It is essential to keep such difficulties in mind if work is to continue, with good purpose, in this area of practical arguments in teacher education and teaching-thinking research. (Author/JD)",

The survey is the second in a series carried out by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. The first report found that fitness has declined for 10- to 17-year-olds. In an effort to better understand why adolescents' fitness levels have declined, this national study was undertaken to learn the fitness status of younger children. The study shows that young children in America are fatter than children 20 years ago, are not getting the right kinds of exercise, and spend more time watching television than in physical activity. The better performers on the fitness tests participate in more vigorous and organized community-based  activities, watch less television, and have a higher activity level. The research process and results are described in articles which include: an introduction (J. M. McGinnis); a summary of findings (James G. Ross and Russell R.

A number of nonprint learning resources are available, including internships, in-class campaigns, and national competitions. Public relations internships are essentially one-on-one teaching situations that offer real-world work experience while allowing students to integrate theoretical material with the development of practical skills. Many campuses or communication departments already have internship programs that could be expanded to include public relations. An alternate resource is an in-class public relations campaign, which can also help prepare students for their internships. This would involve  dividing the class into public relations \"firms,\" which would then compete to provide the best campaign for the designated client. The national competitions are an additional way to offer students practical public relations experience. Dependent upon each contest's regulations, it is possible to use the national competition as the in-class campaign assignment. Such competitions include the Philip Morris Marketing/Communications Competition, the Levi-Strauss Public Relations Challenge, and the Bateman Case Competition. (HTH)",

        "description":"A need exists for focusing on the development of social interaction skills across the college curriculum. Eight basic assumptions should be followed when attempting to develop students' skills: social interaction (1) is a major vehicle for learning; (2) assists students in developing a flexible range of effective behavior; (3) requires abilities that can be learned; (4) can be taught in and out of the classroom; (5) requires abilities that develop interdependently with abilities in communication, analysis, problem-solving, and valuing; (6) is enhanced by a shared framework of interaction concepts; (7) requires skills that are learned developmentally; and (8) requires skills that are learned and developed in context. These assumptions guided the development of a model of social  interaction behavior in college students, by an interdisciplinary faculty team, with input from the entire faculty, at a small liberal arts college. Intended to help faculty understand the responses of students at different levels and to support student growth, particularly at transition points, the model is based on two primary individual skills--receiving information and responding to it--and six group skills, including defining roles, developing solutions, and managing conflict. This model has helped college students develop social interaction skills. (Tables illustrating the model are included. (DF)",

        "description":"Education professors are being attacked for the way they prepare people to teach. This criticism is not well founded; teacher preparation programs are being made scapegoats so that the public can avoid facing the hard facts that constitute the core of the problems within the teaching profession. Nowhere has the attack on teacher education been more sustained and yielded more drastic proposals than in the state of New Jersey. Much of this criticism has been motivated by politicians seeking to benefit from the publicity surrounding educational reform. National commission reports have focused nationwide attention on education, and the new Republican leadership in New Jersey has been eager to upstage the reforms set in motion by the previous Democratic administration. A panel  established by the new education commissioner to determine the skills needed by beginning teachers was rigged to reflect the administration's position. An instate commission appointed to figure out how the panel's recommendations should be incorporated was also loaded in the commissioner's favor. The state eventually adopted a teacher education program that provided an alternative to the college programs. Even though this is an easier and cheaper way to train teachers, the commissioner may regret his victory. His program will be scrutinized and any evidence of deficiencies will be broadcast vigorously. (GJ)",

        "description":"The system used in Illinois for financing public education underwent major reform in 1973. At that time four alternative formulas for determining equalization aid levels were established. In 1980 three of these formulas were eliminated and only a modified version of the Resource Equalizer formula remains in use. This report provides an overview of some of the changes that have been made in this formula since its introduction in 1973. Six concerns that the Illinois financing reforms have attempted to address are noted, including student equity, taxpayer equity, local control, areas of high poverty, equitable treatment for districts of different types, and adequate dollar levels for state funding. Three factors built into the Resource Equalizer formula are also clarified: pupil  attendance, assessed valuation, and tax rate. The formula itself is presented, and the three alternative formulas available prior to 1980, including the Strayer-Haig Equalization Formula, are also shown. Appendixes include a display of the impact of the grant-in-aid system on state educational finance from 1977 to 1986, amendments to formulas as of 1980, and a selected bibliography. (PGD)",

The first part of the report provides a brief review of RBS's history of working with state educational leaders, highlighting its goals and some of the ways it has conducted its activities. The second part describes eight case studies selected to reflect educational improvement priorities to which RBS has contributed over the past three years. These descriptions  illustrate how state educational improvement priorities came into being; how a laboratory can contribute to the design, development, implementation, and institutionalization of programs that address those priorities; and what the outcomes of such collaboration can be for state and local educational agencies. The third part summarizes some of the understandings that RBS has developed about states, about RBS itself, and about the conditions that allow laboratories to contribute constructively to state educational improvement priorities. The last part presents several recommendations based on these understandings. Two appendixes are included: (1) a five-part summary of the information provided in the 1983 and 1984 annual reports and the 1985 quarterly reports; and (2) a summary of the RBS  pilot project to help local education agencies assess current practice in light of educational research and development.

These trends include (1) the shift from an either/or society to one where multiple options are the rule; (2) the change from a centralized to a decentralized society; (3) the move from the family to the individual as the basic unit of society; (4) the trend from representative to participatory democracy; (5) the shift from short-term to long-term thinking; and (6) the change from a national to a global economy. A review of these trends is followed by a discussion of the current  public concern over the quality of education and an evaluation of some of the more popular proposals for school improvement, including merit pay, teacher testing, differentiated staffing, and partnerships with business. In conclusion, five general suggestions for school improvement are offered: (1) tougher academic standards, (2) instruction geared to individual learning styles, (3) expanded counseling programs, (4) professionalization of teaching, and (5) responsibility training for students.

This report is presented in the form of summary responses to six specific questions from the subcommittee regarding NIE's procurement activities. The questions concern (1) how often NIE has revealed the number of proposals received, prices, cost ranges, or government cost estimates to bidders; (2) how often NIE has awarded contracts to other  than lowest-priced bidders; (3) how often the Director of NIE has made the award decision; (4) what percentage of NIE contracts were awarded competitively; (5) how many contracts NIE awarded at the end of the fiscal year; and (6) how many Department of Education personnel have been employed by NIE contractors. A lengthy appendix assesses NIE's contract award processes in detail, covering (1) its scope and methodology; (2) competitive contract awards, with specific attention to requests for proposals (RFPs), awards to other than lowest offeror, and contract awards decided by NIE Director; (3) four noncompetitive contract awards deemed unjustifiable; (4) contracts awarded at year-end; and (5) employment relationships between Education Department employees and NIE contractors.

Content analysis of three drafts of the state educational policy, &quot;Standards for Approving Vermont's Public Schools,&quot; demonstrated the presence of three types of policy language: philosophical (which describes a goal), professional (which describes the desired output of an activity), and prescriptive (which mandates an activity or stipulates certain conditions). During the policy making process, individuals and interest groups attempted to influence policy by shifting statements from one language category to another. Content analysis revealed random discrepancies between the approved  policy and regulatory guidelines. Policy language type had minimal impact during policy implementation by school personnel, unless significant implementation conditions were present. For external evaluators, however, policy language type evoked differential responses. The study concludes that policy detached from the conditions for implementation is not likely to be reflected in school practice. (TE)",

The flexible framework incorporates an adapted version of Stafford Beer's model of recursive systems to illustrate the hierarchical but interdependent levels or groups of people involved in a statewide or provincial educational system, where policy is often initiated at one level to be carried out by representatives at another level. Not only does such a framework assist in the communication of policy, but also it is  developed to encourage the ongoing evaluation of policy at different levels of the system.

A brief introductory chapter discusses the context and rationale for the work on ADL, whose major purpose was to help school districts to understand, install, implement, and sustain practices that research suggests are conducive to effective instruction. The second chapter gives a brief overview of ADL, describing its major objectives: (1) to identify from the research a manageable number of variables that educators can influence and that are critical to student achievement; (2) to develop methods and materials to help  educators monitor those variables; (3) to develop a plan for district-wide training and implementation of the monitoring and management processes; (4) to develop a means to support wide scale dissemination; and (5) to contribute to knowledge. The third chapter discusses the pros and cons of some of major issues related to instructional improvement through ADL, local use of ADL, and wider dissemination of ADL. The concluding chapter presents a closing statement on the instructional effectiveness issues, touching on the need for reflection on the ADL experience and summarizing its major messages as they relate to the creation of optimal classroom conditions and to maximizing the effectiveness of teachers' inservice. It is pointed out that the persistent, appropriate use of such innovations  as ADL are likely to develop the needed understandings, images, intuitions and skills. References are included, along with appendixes listing (1) ADL-related reports, papers, and presentations, and (2) student achievement data from the three field test districts in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.

        "description":"This paper approaches the concept of curriculum design from a philosophical perspective, arguing that the concept of \"design\" in curriculum is fundamentally misleading. The paper begins with a series of comments questioning the assumption that curriculum design involves a set of discrete skills or procedures in which one may attain expertise, like skating, welding, or filling out a tax return. The concept of curriculum design is equivocal on the distinction between the intrinsic value and the practical success of a curriculum, with the result that questions of evaluation and implementation are often allowed to determine content, without adequate consideration of what is educationally worthwhile. Curriculum design is an open and flexible domain due to uncertainty and disagreement  over ends, definitions, and cause and effect. Counterarguments are offered to four of the most commonly accepted assumptions behind the curriculum design concept: (1) that the ultimate aims of education are not the direct responsibility of the curriculum designer; (2) that curriculum design is an applied science; (3) that designing curriculum is a skill or set of skills; and (4) that there is a determinate list of things that a curriculum design should include. The most important omission from all curriculum textbooks is a rigorous examination of the aims and nature of schooling and education. (TE)",

Among  the conclusions drawn are that (1) administrators should understand and be capable of performing the roles of those under them, and should occasionally perform those roles; (2) new personnel should receive careful supervision and training in the procedures of the organization; (3) operational units should be given responsibility for and held accountable for their own specific functions; (4) an effort should be made to draw personnel into the organizational culture and obtain their commitment to it; (5) personnel should be kept well informaed of developments affecting the organization; (6) continued professional development is essential; (7) opportunities for career growth should be made available; and (8) the motivation of personnel is very important.

        "description":"The types of teacher evaluation instruments used in Tennessee's public school systems during 1982-83 were reviewed to determine how they related to other district characteristics. Districts were categorized according to whether they (1) negotiated teacher contracts, (2) spent above the state median per pupil, (3) paid teachers above the state median salary, (4) elected or appointed their superintendents, (5) were county or city/special districts, and (6) reported average daily attendance above the state median. Instruments were categorized as using rating scales, checklists, performance objectives, anecdotal records, a combination of scales and objectives, or other methods. Evaluation criteria were grouped into four content types: personal qualities, professional qualities,  instructional skills, and classroom management and discipline skills. The study found that 57.4 percent of the districts used rating scales and 34.9 percent combined rating scales with performance objectives. The tendency to use rating scales alone was lower among districts paying higher salaries, appointing superintendents, and operating as city/special districts. The most frequently cited evaluation criteria related to professional cooperation, effective planning, and student control. Systems paying higher salaries considered more instructional skills items, as did city/special systems. The mean number of items evaluated was 30. (PGD)",

The U. S. Supreme Court has not addressed this precise issue, but an analysis of other courts' decisions, and related Supreme Court precedents, may help educators to assess the factors involved in assessing the constitutionality of this widespread practice. Arguments against prayer at graduation ceremonies are based on the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment that reads: &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion....&quot; An examination of the cases cited indicates that the outcome of a commencement  exercise challenge appears to hinge on the evidence of school district involvement designed to advance religious purposes. Without aggravating circumstances, a court would seem to be unlikely to find an Establishment Clause violation in the context of the traditional ceremonial nature of commencement exercises.

Scores were disaggregated by student ethnicity and student free lunch status as a surrogate measure of socioeconomic status (SES). Data pertaining to teacher perceptions of the principal as instructional leader were obtained through the Staff Assessment Questionnaire, and specific attention was given to four general aspects of principal behavior: (1) mobilizing resources, (2) communicating, (3) serving as instructional resource, and (4) being a visible presence. These data  were then correlated with school means for aggregated student improvement on Total Reading and Total Mathematics of the California Achievement Test (CAT). Individual gains for students were computed and aggregated for four groups: white, black, free lunch, and non-free lunch. Regression analyses were used to assess the relationships between the leadership of the principal and other effective school characteristics, while analysis of variance was used to assess the effects of leadership on student gain scores. The findings of this study suggest that teachers' perceptions of the principal as instructional leader are critical to the reading and mathematics achievement of students, particularly among historically low-achieving groups of students.

Another writer cites being a counselor and a mediator as probably the most humane and challenging aspect of the assistant principal's role. The professional development of assistant principals, according to two other articles, depends on the school principals involving them in responsibilities. One assistant  principal, writing under the pseudonymn \"Lee Marsh,\" recounts the wide range of duties and input from six principals during her career. Dealing with social problems existing in schools is a large part of an assistant principal's function. Ways to diffuse this stress are discussed in another entry.

Responses from 44 administrators of exemplary vocational education programs gave the highest rating for dropout prevention to students' self-concept development. Beck and Muia summarized the literature on dropouts and found the key factor to be the student's socioeconomic class. Programs that work in preventing dropouts are described in three publications. O'Connor studied 3 effective dropout programs and  highlights 10 characteristics of effective programs, emphasizing such points as identifying potential dropouts earlier, and encouraging, rather than coercing, students to participate in special programs. Wehlage presents a set of guidelines for the marginal student. Mahood summarizes the cost to society of dropouts and recommends inschool suspension for disruptive students. The Sarasons report on an experiment in social skills training.

First, only one copy of the master copy of a piece of software may be legally duplicated--the backup copy made by the owner for archival purposes. Second, the only other legal copy of the master copy owned by the user is that copy reproduced by inputting the software into the computer in order to utilize the program. The amendment clearly prohibits the unauthorized duplication of copies of a computer program for distribution and use by other than the owner of the master copy. However, it does not directly address (1) using a single-loading master copy to boot up sequentially two or more microcomputers or (2) using a slightly modified master copy in a  network of microcomputers. There are at least four other sources or tests for assessing the legality of these software uses: (1) the market effect test, (2) the intended use test, (3) the simultaneous/sequential users test, and (4) the fair use test. However, the otherwise harsh implications of copyright restrictions for the schools are mitigated by (1) licensing agreements that may provide financially beneficial options to schools, (2) technological advances making duplications of tangible copies increasingly difficult, (3) software producers designing programs specifically for use in networks, and (4) greater amounts of high quality/low cost software by nonprofit producers. Until these conditions become more prevalent, educators need to know and abide by the restrictions placed on the  use of instructional software by the copyright law. (MLF)",

State laws regarding construction management are placed in categories according to whether construction management is authorized, apparently authorized, not authorized, or not addressed. An examination of the status of construction management for public school districts throughout the country reveals a mixed picture. The construction of educational facilities is clearly within the purview of the state legislatures.  Generally, this state responsibility is delegated to the local school districts. While the responsibility is delegated, so too is the observance of public bid statutes. Within the past few years, many states have moved toward more flexible approaches to how school districts may construct educational facilities.

In 12 cases during the past decade examined in this chapter, students won 5 and lost 7. In challenges of school board policies that assess academic penalties for truancy, students won in three and lost in four cases. In challenges of policies that include grade reduction with suspensions, students won in two and lost in three cases. Despite the lack of congruency between court opinions, some observations can be made. Courts are loath to intrude in matters that are purely academic; when academic sanctions are used as a disciplinary response, they are subject to legal challenges as violative of substantive or procedural due  process. Most courts require a rational connection (nexus) between the academic sanction and the conduct of the student. In addition, school rules that impose academic sanctions for student misconduct are most likely to be upheld if they incorporate the following guidelines: (1) explicit policies should be made known to the students; (2) the policy should permit students to take final examinations; (3) academic penalties should be limited to those serious offenses that also result in suspension from school; and (4) school policies shoud meet minimum standards of due process.

When teachers have been notified that their employment contracts will not be renewed, they are responsible for initiating a review of the decision. If the school has a procedure for internal review, the employee must request this review before seeking judicial review. Cases are cited that show that the courts have found a nonrenewal \"arbitrary and capricious\" if it is made in bad faith, is based on the teacher's exercise of First Amendment or other constitutionally protected rights, is unrelated to the educational process or to a reasonable educational objective, is justified by reasons that are  wholly unsupported in fact, or is found to be an abuse of discretion. The states' statutes (sometimes board policy) establish the school board's basis for teacher renewal. To define the issue, both cases in which the board decision was found to be arbitrary and cases in which the claim was rejected are reviewed. When the school board has acted in good faith for reasons it thinks probably will improve the instructional programs--which includes not renewing an \"average\" teacher in order to look for a better teacher--its decision will generally stand.

        "description":"This paper contains an overview of selected school finance cases litigated in local, state, and federal courts. The first section contains a review of state school finance cases. Constitutional challenges to states' school finance systems were affirmed by the Connecticut Supreme Court, defeated by the Michigan Court of Appeals, and returned to a lower court by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire; in addition, seven property-poor school districts have filed suit in Texas. School districts in Michigan challenged the state's right to reduce school aid. The next section of the paper examines local fiscal issues including litigation prompted by school board decisions affecting areas such as property tax exemption, disposition of interest earned on school funds, extracurricular program  fees, transportation, and school district residency requirements. A federal district ruled in Philadelphia that school districts may file a class action suit against 55 manufacturers to recover the cost of asbestos removal. The third section of the paper addresses controversial issues at the federal level: (1) the authority of the federal government to recover misspent Title I funds; (2) school lunch regulations involving soft drinks; and (3) the government's financial responsibility for the Chicago Board of Education's desegregation plan under the terms of a 1980 consent decree. The fourth section addresses the issue of public financial support for nonpublic schools. (MLF)",

Bell,&quot; ruled that federal regulation and enforcement activities designed to eliminate discrimination based on sex are triggered by indirect federal aid and are program specific. The Court's program-specific conclusion was immediately applied to federal statutory language that limits discrimination against the handicapped. The proposed Civil Rights Act of 1984, introduced to mitigate the effect of the Court's program-specific interpretation in &quot;Grove City,&quot; was not passed by the 98th Congress. The effects of the case on administrative enforcement--at least 22 sex discrimination cases under investigation by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights--indicate that the Education Department had previously interpreted  the scope of its jurisdiction with regard to the investigation of discrimination more broadly than is currently permissible. It can be predicted that the present administration will continue to oppose broad-based institutional coverage for antidiscrimination provisions, that a new civil rights measure will be drafted, and that the Office of Civil Rights will proceed cautiously pending congressional clarification of intent and would reopen closed cases if the Supreme Court's program-specific conclusions were legislatively reversed.

This pilot study examined test and questionnaire response data for 177 former students out of 1,809 who had received a B.Ed. degree since 1972. Of these respondents, 21 submitted to telephone interviews including questions concerning attitudes toward career success. The researchers used statistical analysis to seek variables discriminating between teachers and non-teachers. Of those teaching, 78 percent planned to continue teaching. Half of the non-teachers indicated interest in returning to teaching. The findings suggested that women were more likely to leave teaching temporarily but that  neither sex was more likely to leave permanently. The reasons for leaving did differ by sex: women cited staying home and men cited career or job changes as major reasons. The academic abilities of teachers and non-teachers were similar. Personality characteristics accounted for only a small percentage of the variance between the groups. Measures of attitudes toward career success showed the teachers more concerned with salaries and autonomy and less with personal satisfaction and opportunities for advancement than non-teachers.

        "description":"In 1980 the Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) Public Schools recognized needs for significant improvement in staff evaluation, student achievement, individual school effectiveness, and the clarification of systemwide objectives and expectations. The instructional leadership committee appointed to establish a unified approach to effective instruction reviewed the literature and created a staff development team committed to developing principals as instructional leaders. The training that the principals received increased their confidence and enhanced school effectiveness, leading to higher student achievement. The case of John A. Brashear High School is illustrative of the principal's role. The principal formed an &quot;instructional cabinet&quot; to assess the school's needs and develop action  plans. This team decided to focus on reducing the ninth-grade failure rate by implementing a plan involving tutorial assistance, student achievement recognition, inservice training for teachers using the Madeline Hunter teaching model, and peer development assistance among teachers. The program cut the ninth-grade failure rate by over 50 percent in 2 years. Such examples indicate that the principal's role in encouraging local school program development to meet district objectives is central, and involves setting clear expectations, utilizing lead teachers effectively, establishing structures for professional interaction, and differentiating among supervisory functions.

The report first outlines the organizational features typically found in American school systems and individual schools. Administrator's roles and responsibilities, their selection and training, and their typical activities are described next. The report then looks at trends in school improvement and considers the administrator's role in educational change and the social and professional expectations affecting the administrator's involvement.  The second contribution, by Sheila C. Murphy and Shirley M. Hord, reports on the findings of a case study of an administrator's process for reawakening school pride in an urban Pennsylvania high school. Entitled &quot;New Light from an Old Lamp: Castleton High School,&quot; the report does not cover the study methodoloy, but instead describes the school's characteristics and the administrator's management techniques. These techniques included interpreting district policies creatively, involving supportive staff members in specific projects, avoiding direct confrontations with those in formal authority roles, using persuasion rather than confrontation, and maintaining a constant vision.

Analyses of variance were performed with cluster membership as the independent variable and various measures from Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and Wide Range Achievement Test as the dependent measures.  Essentially all findings were statistically significant, thereby supporting the external validity of the cluster solution. It was suggested that the first subgroup had its difficulties primarily in the language development area, while the second subgroup had its major difficulties in perceptual, attentional and motor skills that support language development. The third subgroup did not appear to have a clearly identifiable neuropsychological basis for its relatively mildly deficient academic performance levels.

Gardner's perspective citing six types of intelligence is also discussed. An attempt at meta-analysis of these perspectives is offered, and it is concluded that gifted students process information more quickly, more expediently, and more insightfully than others, and that they are highly perceptive and insightful in their combining, comparing, and encoding of information. Domains in which gifted students can be distinguished from non-gifted students are identified. (CL)",

All raters viewed the same children although not necessarily in the same condition. Each videotaped sequence showed a child responding to a randomized set of questions while involved in a conversation with two adults. A mixed design, one between-one within-subjects design, was employed to assess the main effects of the one factor which was randomized (the  videotape viewing groups), and the one factor which involved repeated measures (Condition 1--pre-training skill level video sequences, and Condition 2--post-training skill level video sequences). Analyses revealed that when children manifested proper gaze direction they were evaluated as having higher social competence, as being more intelligent, and as having a greater ability to compete in the sighted world as an adult.

Thirty-four siblings of handicapped children (2-15 years old) from the United States and Canada completed a children's self-concept scale while their parents filled out two questionnaires: one on parental attitudes and stress regarding the presence of the handicapped child and the other on the family's social support. The results showed the siblings displaying as high a self-concept as norms. The sex of the handicapped child emerged as a predictor for the self-concept of their siblings: a handicapped brother had more negative impact on a sibling, male or female. Parental attitudes and stress due to parent and child problems in caring for the  handicapped child were related to the siblings' self-concept regarding their personal happiness and satisfaction. Parental pessimism showed the same trend. Support from grandparents and relatives assuaged anxiety in the siblings but excessive support tended to lower their self-confidence in their physical appearance and academic competence.

The Conners Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaire and the Aggressive Behavior Scale assessed the self management level of each child. The Classroom Behavior Inventory was used to assess the levels of competence, and Teacher Adjustment Ratings provided global ratings for the children's classroom situation. The results demonstrated that boys with conduct disorders are distinctive from their control peers on several aspects of social adjustment and academic competence, even at the first stages  of their academic experience. The significant maturational change that occurred in the older age groups, of boys without conduct disorders, was not evident in the conduct disordered group, suggesting a developmental arrest in the abilities for controlling and inhibiting behavior. The academic distinction was evident through adolescence, although different developmental processes were demonstrated in the social aspects. The implications for theoretical understanding of the developmental aspects of the syndrome, family perspectives, and psychological interventions in the school are discussed. (Author/CL)]",

Possible topics for the slide presentations include famous or interesting places, aspects of daily life, ceremonies, and other visually interesting aspects of another country. Background reading should be interesting and relate to the slides, but it need only overlap, not correspond exactly to the narration. Vocabulary lists are developed from the text, possibly with the spelling-check feature  of a computer program. Some useful learning activities are skimming, charting, organization, cloze, outline, dictation, correction, and pause and intonation exercises to be used with the readings and narration. A wide variety of followup activities can be used, such as student-prepared slide presentations, visits to famous places in the students' own country, or photograph albums. (MSE)",

The focus was the adjustments mothers make to fit their behavior to their child's linguistic skills and development. Samples of interactions between mothers and children videotaped in their homes when the children were 16, 21, 24, and 30 months old were analyzed. Mother utterances eliciting child verbalizations were coded for utterance type (specific form, information option seeking, clarification, or modeling), level of cue or amount of support provided by the utterance, and complexity of the expected child response. Child responses were coded according to  their degree of correctness. The results suggest that mother expectations for child responses clearly change over time in relation to development in the child's skills, with decreasing cue support for the child's response, increasing interaction frequency, decrease in likelihood of mothers letting their questions go unanswered, and increasing use of repetition when the child does not respond. Modeling was used most frequently as a first elicitation tactic at 21 months, secondarily at 24 months, and infrequently later. (MSE)",

Results indicated that the standard English speaker scored higher on all 10 statements on the semantic differential scale, strongly supporting the commonly-held idea  that most standard-English-speaking teachers prefer similar speech behavior from their students and that standard English usage is equated with being well educated.

Luria's approach to designing comprehension test tasks. The investigation required patients, with lesions of varying size and location, to determine whether a sentence expressing temporal or spatial relations or a physical comparison corresponded to a picture presented with it. It was found that comparatives were easiest for the patients to understand, while spatial relations were more difficult, and the temporal relations expressed in the items were almost impossible for the patients to handle. It is concluded that Luria's writings about semantic aphasia and the processing of sentences expressing relationships  should be modified, because in this study all aphasics, regardless of lesion site, were especially impaired on sentences where grammar governs syntax and grammatical markers are clearly abstract. According to Luria's theory, the patients' responses should have varied according to lesion site. It is suggested that Luria comes close to contradicting himself in proposing that one brain region should be more important than others in processing relatively complex sentences. (MSE)",

The typical lexical difficulties clustered around open class words such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. In such patients phonological paraphasias make up 60 percent of the errors. The results of this study show that posterior aphasia patients exhibit more errors toward the end of words, peaking around the 4th to 6th phoneme. In addition, the data suggest that paraphasias tend to occur after word formation rules have been applied and that neologisms are probably formed before application of word  formation rules. The patterns of morphosyntactic marker errors also suggest that surface case marking carries some consistent deviations. The limited usefulness of the traditional one-component view of phonology is emphasized, and it is proposed that the formal aspect of words can be maltreated at various stages of language production.

So far, the discussion has been limited to the advantages and disadvantages of both methods, with the assumption that neurolinguists pursue a single goal attainable by one or the other method. Practical considerations determine the substance and methodologies of research, and they often influence and constrain the questions asked, contrary to a popular myth that the research question comes first. A historical review of case and group studies and their contributions to the development of neurolinguistics, and of some work in progress or recently completed, including some studies using a hybrid design, reveals a wide range of options between  the pure case study and ideal large group study, with specific benefits found in each. There is a logical progression to the kinds of studies the behavioral scientist can do: first, a phenomenological study, either case or group, to describe what may be pertinent to the topic; then, examination of the phenomenon's frequency of occurrence, its elements, and perhaps their interactions; studies of different subgroups; and finally descriptive or theory-driven group studies of the phenomenon's universality.

Medicine views syndromes as dichotomous (present or not present) and necessarily indicative of an underlying pathognomic state or process, and psychometrics sees performances as varying along a continuum. The issues of the pragmatic value of syndromes, or their correctness versus their fruitfulness, and the procedures for identifying syndromes are discussed in the context of recent research. The use of distinctive recovery patterns as a means of classifying aphasics and determining the appropriate therapeutic approach for each is proposed and illustrated with a model. (MSE)",

The subjects were six normal and four retarded children, matched for general language skills, and their mothers. Mother-child interactions videotaped at home were coded for the potential teaching functions of the mother utterances and the pragmatic functions of the child behaviors. It was found that the mothers of retarded and normal children were similar in terms of general language usage and number of utterances but that the tactics the mothers used to elicit verbal behavior were different. Both groups used all four defined tactics, but mothers of retarded children relied significantly more on  modeling, and mothers of normal children showed a more balanced use of strategies. Analysis of child responsiveness showed that normal children were generally more responsive, but not significantly. The correctness of child responses was analyzed as well as the relationship between frequency of mother use of a tactic and frequency of spontaneous speech. Further research on the differential interaction between mothers of normal and handicapped children is recommended. Several tables and graphs are included. (MSE)",

A modification of the Total Physical Response method was used to orient the students, and at four weeks the emphasis was shifted to the primary objective of reading comprehension. Standardized reading and listening comprehension test scores for the group indicated that the students performed above the national norms; student motivation, attrition, and course preregistration rates were found to have improved significantly. The program has been extended into two third semester courses, one emphasizing aural comprehension and the other focusing on oral discussion of  German literature. Research on the optimal schedule for introducing vocabulary and grammar concepts and for requiring production of morphologically correct forms in the first two semesters continues.

Specific grammatical objectives and appropriate classroom techniques and activities are described for these areas of grammar: use of appropriate pronoun and verb forms to describe actions as they are performed, giving commands that can be acted out, shifting verb tense or voice to give a more precise description of an action being performed, negating sentences, using the appropriate case of objects  of verbs and prepositions, producing possessive adjectives and pronouns, using the correct plural forms of familiar nouns, and changing word order when elements are deleted from or added to a sentence.

The research consisted of a pilot study with White students to test the appropriateness of the instruments and methodology developed, and a full-scale study with 72 Black high school speech students who were divided into three groups. Two 12-minute audiotapes providing instructional material in both standard English and Black dialect, spoken by the same individual, were presented to two of the student groups as a normal classroom exercise, with the third group maintained as a control group. Following the tapes, the two experimental groups were asked  to complete an information test and semantic differential scales concerning the expertise, dynamism, and friendliness of the speaker; the third group completed only the information test. Analysis of the results suggested that there was a difference in comprehension between the two treatments, but that it was statistically insignificant. It also suggested that there was a perceived difference in credibility, with the Black students rating the Black speech as more credible, but that this difference also was statistically insignificant.

Learning activities, both in and outside of class, concentrate on writing. The students keep logs and diaries, which force them to be aware of their surroundings and to participate more actively in the life around them. With the diaries as a basis, class discussion progresses through the events of an ordinary day, beginning with the alarm going off in the morning, and expands into less routine events and activities. The logs or diaries are submitted and corrected daily, with mistakes counted only if they are repeated after initial correction. Another writing exercise requires that students paraphrase or report on information found in newspapers, magazines, and  advertising, and make cultural comparisons. A third assignment involves critiques of films seen at local theaters. A fourth approach uses a game in which students draw three pieces of paper from each of five piles containing nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbial phrases, and miscellaneous forms (pronouns, verbs, exclamations, proper names, etc.) in German. The students use what they drew to write a half-page story that is mysterious, dramatic, or funny. The exercises develop language and writing skills as well as cultural awareness, all of which are an essential part of complete language learning. (MSE)",

The subjects were one group of 11 Hispanic and four groups of Anglo students, with 15 in each Anglo group. Thirty-two logically complex sentences containing one, two, or three negations each and certain consistent elements (quantifiers, groups of similar objects, verb, etc.) were constructed, with four or five possible answer sentences corresponding to each sentence. Four sets of sentences were constructed, each containing the 32 basic sentences with portions of the sentences in different positions. One set was administered to the Hispanic group and to one  of the Anglo groups; the other three sentence sets were administered to the other three Anglo groups. The subjects were to read the complex sentences and choose a less complex sentence that most closely corresponded to the meaning in the complex sentence. The results indicated that the subjects comprehended best the sentences with discrete rather than continuous descriptive information, and that sentences containing three negations were not well understood. The only difference between the Anglo and Hispanic groups was in the latency of response, a fact possibly explained by their acquisition of English as a first or second language.

To use it, the teacher selects a video recording, divides it into learning segments, orders the segments, selects a method of  presentation for each segment, devises the appropriate interactive routine in which to embed each segment, and decides how to move from segment to segment.

In addition, the classes most concerned with communication (i.e., language classes) are those the most empty of material about which to communicate. This experience with language learning may diminish students' perception of other languages as relevant. While it is commonly held among language teachers that they should associate language with situations outside the classroom, it is difficult to do this authentically. One way of turning language into an asset is to use the target language for classroom management, which provides a rich source of communication needs, but this effort can be lost in the hours between language classes. The isolation  of the language class can be counteracted by introducing language lessons into other areas of the curriculum, linking language and subject matter. Studies of partial and full immersion courses show that performance in the target language is positively affected and achievement in the content areas does not suffer. If subject matter is covered both in the language course and in its own course, the subject matter and language learning are both reinforced. (MSE)",

It is useful for teaching culture and civilization, but equally useful for teaching basic elements of language: grammar, vocabulary, rhythms, and registers. Literary skills are also widely used in everyday situations, with sophisticated literary techniques used in such a pervasive medium as advertising. Exercises in grouping words or grammatical categories in literary works, as in a poem, are easily undertaken in the language class and can uncover hidden layers of meaning. Other techniques include removing words or the title or jumbling the order of a poem's lines and asking students to supply the missing parts. Stylistic variation can be examined by using different means of comparing the  same thing or person, as in a newspaper article versus a poem. Teachers must consider what kinds of texts to use, the best type of exercise for the medium, the kinds of introductory or comparative materials to use, specific advantages of the genres, and the placement of literature in the language syllabus. Variation in quality and register is desirable in choosing literary texts for the classroom. (MSE)",

        "description":"A self-instructional program in German for undergraduate students of engineering at Trinity College, Dublin, was developed based on a questionnaire of student needs, language experience, and preferred instructional methods. The course design and instructional materials for the program emphasized oral/aural skills; moreover, counseling and academic advising were provided. Small-group interviews were conducted both at the beginning of and during the instructional program to assess student needs and attitudes about their instruction. Academic assessment was provided at two levels, beginning and intermediate, at the students' option, and consisted of oral and written components. Nine students completed the first program cycle and performed adequately or better on the final test. The  independent study aspect of the program was found to respond adequately to the individual needs, levels, and learning styles of the students. It was also found that the counseling structure should cover a wide range of therapeutic and pedagogic functions, even in a very small group, but that some students function and achieve well with little or no support.

Changes in mathematics content, scope, and applications have implications for the college curriculum. Problems and challenges are posed by: increased enrollments in elementary courses and decreasing numbers of mathematics majors; inadequate access by faculty to computing resources; and providing mathematical courses appropriate for liberal education. The curriculum is largely elementary and out of date at most two- and four-year colleges, excluding research universities and selective liberal arts colleges. While there is a shortage of math teachers, industrial demand for mathematics  graduates is high. Faculty involvement in scholarship and professional development, not only traditional research, is important to revitalizing collegiate mathematics. Recommendations include: providing a competitive system of NSF Faculty Fellowships in areas such as curriculum development, student projects, and research support; providing each mathematics faculty a high-powered computer work station; utilizing the expertise and outreach of existing professional organizations to increase leverage of limited NSF resources; and making sure that NSF staff are selected to provide balanced, informed advice.

One promising approach is the Personalized System of Instruction, which emphasizes student involvement, high expectations, and assessment and feedback. Some faculty members now focus on recall and comprehension and do not require students to develop skills in analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. A problem exists when colleges whose mission is primarily teaching and student development turn to faculty publishing as the route to academic distinction. Good teaching is the first ingredient of quality education, and colleges need to find ways to encourage and reward good teaching. Research on student evaluations of teacher performance consistently  indicates that: there is general agreement among students and faculty on the effectiveness of teachers; judgments by students about teachers persist and are replicated years after they graduate; and students' ratings positively correlate with the amount of student learning. It is proposed that research on teaching and learning be done by classroom teachers (classroom researchers), especially at teaching institutions. Advantages of this proposal are discussed, and external factors that have focused attention on the quality of instruction are also identified. (SW)",

Nineteen percent of students reported that their most important educational objective was to learn as much as they could about several fields of study. Thirteen percent reported that deciding on a career goal was most important. Twenty-six percent strongly agreed that they expect to have a hard time  adjusting to their academic work, while 36% were neutral on this item. In discussing their main reason for deciding to attend UMCP, 34% reported that UMCP offered the kind of academic program they wanted; 24% reported that they wanted to be close to home, and 14% reported that they wanted to attend an inexpensive university. Also investigated were: activities that interested students, career interests, study habits, library use, interest in educational/vocational counseling, and social/political attitudes. (Author/SW)",

The literature is reviewed to identify research perspectives on decline. Variables consistent with each perspective are identified and measured on a sample of 56 small- to medium-sized colleges and universities that experienced decline. Path analysis (LISREL V.) was used to compare perspectives and predictor variables. The literature indicated two major perspectives concerning organizational elements: (1) they are objective and measurable or (2) they are subjective, contextual, and knowable via interpretation. An initial assumption was that both the objective and interpretive approaches to studying decline are useful in  describing organizational responses to decline. While the interpretive approach was superior to the objective measure for predicting responses to decline, both perspectives were important to understanding responses. It is suggested that the way organizational members perceive decline is important, along with the level of agreement on institutional mission, and managers' interpretations of external events to staff. A four-page list of references concludes the report. (SW)",

Analysis of the National Longitudinal Study (NLS) of the High School Class of 1972 and the High School and Beyond (HSB) surveys revealed that 46.4% of the NLS subsample attended two- or four-year colleges in the fall of 1973, compared to 46.0% of the HSB subsample. The data suggest that high school seniors decided whether to enter college in 1980 much as they had in 1972, which means that the Middle Income Student Assistance Act and the end of U.S. involvement in Vietnam had no substantial effect on students' decisions. The effect on college attendance of the following high school  graduate attributes were assessed: race (Black/Hispanic), sex, geographic region, local cost in 1980 dollars, parents' education, family income in 1980 dollars, test scores, grades, academic programs, college-going peers, and receipt of financial aid. The strongest zero-order correlates of college entry in both 1972 and 1980 were academic track placement, test score, college-going peers, and grades. Bivariate regression coefficients corresponding to the correlations were also determined. (SW)",

Power was defined as the ability of a person to have access to and control over information and individuals. A questionnaire was developed that covered the following factors: expert knowledge of lower participants, effort and interest in attaining complex work skills, dependency of superordinates on subordinates to do routine and nonroutine tasks, and control over access to persons, information, and instrumental equipment. Questionnaires completed by 50 chairpersons and 50 departmental secretaries at a major public research institution resulted in 94 usable responses. The results partially  support Mechanic's model. The longer on the job, the more control the secretary had over access to persons, information, and instrumentalities. Expert knowledge and perceived power were also linked. It is recommended that a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods be used to better understand these power relationships. Questionnaire development, achievement of construct and content validity, and test reliability are briefly described. (SW)",

The way each institution tried to create and project its public image is considered, along with the internal discourse of each institution in relation to academic quality. In addition to reviewing perceptions of institutional image, the rhetoric and reality of academic excellence involved in institutional image building are addressed. For example, the images set forth in catalogs as well as the policies enacted by faculty and  administrators are described. Also considered are institutional strategies developed to manage the institution's image by controlling academic deficiencies among students and by limiting instruction in subcollegiate areas. While Vassar reorganized its curriculum and provided needed preparatory studies, Cornell did not offer preparatory studies but dealt with academically deficient students on a case by case basis. Both colleges expanded educational opportunities to a broader base of students than had previously been served. (SW)",

Analysis was undertaken for 1,195 Kansas public university undergraduates who took the Pre-Professional Skills Tests in Math and English and the Nelson-Denny Reading Achievement Test. Information from transcripts was obtained on American College Testing Program scores, general education enrollment patterns, student classification, grade  point average, and major.

The study instrument consisted of 59 financial and nonfinancial indicators, most of which were developed by Kevin J. Gilmartin. To determine the impact of the AIDP grant on the indicators, administrators responding to the survey assessed the institution for the year that the institution's grant began and changes occurring by the year after the grant ended. The AIDP grant had a moderate impact on changes in institutional viability for each of the seven institutions. As perceived by the administrators, curriculum improvement activities had the most impact on  measures of institutional viability, followed by administrative improvement. Four of the institutions reported an increase in: government appropriations per full-time equivalent student, tuition and fees per student, full-time equivalent enrollment, and number of faculty. Five of the institutions reported an increased in instructional expenditures per full-time equivalent student, while six institutions reported an increase in total current fund expenditure per full-time equivalent student.

The analysis is based on a causal model derived from the sociological status attainment and conflict paradigms and from Tinto's model of college persistence/withdrawal. Statistical analysis involved Joreskog and Sorbom's technique for maximum likelihood estimation of models with multiple indicators of  latent constructs: LISREL (linear structural relationships). Analyses were conducted separately for males and females who entered college in academic programs in fall 1972. Results show significant effects of students' social and academic background, institutional characteristics, integration and performance in college, and goal commitment after college entrance. Findings indicate the importance of examining dimensions of institutions other than the commonly used selectivity or quality dimension. (Author/SW)",

Data are based on the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation Guaranteed Student Loan database and responses to a questionnaire mailed in spring 1984 to a sample of New York State student loan borrowers. The study population consists of 175,204 borrowers who graduated or left school during fiscal year 1982 and who were due to enter repayment in 1983. Six percent of the sample were in repayment and 11 percent in default. Findings include: there was a strong relationship between default and the number of years spent in school; there was a strong inverse relationship between default and the level of school attended; the graduation rate  for repayers was only slightly higher than for defaulters; borrowers who were employed when their loans became due were more likely to begin repayment; students who worked while in school were more likely to repay than nonworking students; repayers were three times as likely to receive family assistance in repaying loans. Eight recommendations are offered, including: extending deferments during periods of unemployment; discouraging students from excessive borrowing; and graduated repayment plans.

        "description":"A new typology for faculty is proposed, based on their expressed priorities toward activities in which research universities engage. Responses of 617 faculty to a survey of 66 statements about university activities were factor analyzed, and scores on eight factors obtained were used in a cluster analysis that produced three clusters of faculty. When coded into disciplinary groupings, the faculty clustered along lines defined by their political description and gender. Items included in the following eight factors and their loadings are identified: (1) concerns about minorities and women; (2) liberal arts, liberal education; (3) nontraditional education; (4) intercollegiate athletics; (5) concerns about quality and research; (6) health care and training; (7) professional education;  and (8) concerns about student health. The primary strength of this approach involves the effort to relate faculty groupings to institutional priorities as well as the assumption of heterogeneity rather than homogeneity among faculty members belonging to a specific department. The results are compared to Biglan's (1973) typology; some correspondence is found with his &quot;hard-soft&quot; axis, or applied-pure and life-non-life dimensions, which were used to classify departments.

Growth in corporate gifts are compared with changes occurring simultaneously in tax-generated corporate support. Also considered are differences in corporate funding patterns between public and private institutions, growth of corporate gift support to public institutions, and changes in the share of corporate funding that goes to higher education indirectly through state and local government funding. Policy implications related to the rise of corporate support to higher education are also addressed. Findings indicate that corporate gifts are growing at a quicker pace than either corporate tax of foundation  gift support. At the same time, taxes still make up the largest share (about 89%) of total corporate support. Of the total $4.7 billion in voluntary gift support to colleges and universities in 1983-1984, $1.1 billion, or 22.7%, was corporate giving. In 1983-1984, corporate gifts surpassed foundation gifts for the first time.

Except for presidents, the administrators came from various types of positions. Two-year college presidents largely came from top executive positions or chief academic officer positions.  Positions that appeared frequently in the careers of chief student affairs officers were directors of counseling and financial aid, associate/assistant chief student affairs, and counselors. Chief business officers came most often from outside sources (business and industry and school administration). Comparisons to previous research are made.

The focuses on college presidents, chief academic officers, chief student affairs officers, and chief business officers. Findings are interpreted within the context of internal labor market theory, which offers a framework for explaining administrator mobility. Data were obtained from a 1984 national study of two-year college administrators' careers. Results indicate that the labor markets for presidents, chief academic officers, and chief student affairs officers were relatively closed to individuals from external positions and from four-year institutions. These boundaries  were more open at earlier stages of careers. The position of chief business officer, however, was much more open to administrators from external sources. It appears that one way in which two-year colleges protect their employees, and perhaps induce organizational commitment, is by holding out top-level positions for those from within the two-year college labor market. Boundaries of an administrative labor market can have important implications for individuals, the two-year college, and for postsecondary education. (SW)",

The situation in Washington State is briefly described as an illustration. It is proposed that interests of the state, college, and student can be enhanced by allowing colleges more operational independence. At the same time, the state's financial liability can be controlled by refocusing the budgetary decisions to the amount of state tax funds to be provided and eliminating or minimizing the effect of local decisions on the level of investment of public resources. The four alternative models for state financing range from a high degree of state control and little institutional flexibility to one of maximum  institutional flexibility and little direct control by the state. Characteristics of the models are illustrated by a checklist consisting of eight major components: budgeting; expenditure oversight; accountability expectations; tuition, fees, and pricing policy; financing options; salary administration; enrollment policy; and program review/approval. The checklist can be used to develop a profile of the financing relationship with a state. (SW)",

Antecedents of program review include: the development of specialized study programs, the emergence of regional and specialized accreditation and efforts to assess program quality, and the development of improved evaluation techniques. A shift has occurred from reviews primarily undertaken as self-assessment of a program by its faculty to a largely external evaluation for the purpose of institution-wide decision-making concerning planning priorities and budgeting. The demand for accountability requires that the evaluations be undertaken through an objective process. Six outstanding characteristics of  program review today are as follows: the use of reviews is widespread; it has become more comprehensive; it is more systematic and formal; its purpose has shifted from formative to summative; it is being more closely tied to other decision-making processes; and attitudes about program review are changing. Myths include: accredited programs do not need review; identifying evaluation criteria is the most difficult step; and program review is synonymous with program discontinuance.

Based on a recent study of presidential judgment under uncertainty, data were obtained on the perceptions of 252 campus chief executive officers concerning institutional leadership and quality, and the sources of institutional improvement and change. Presidents indicated on a 100-point scale how effective they thought the average college president was as an institutional leader. They also rated themselves and their predecessors. Presidents assessed seven aspects of their campuses at the time they took office, estimated changes in them to date, and predicted their state at the time they will leave office. Finally, presidents  identified the most important incident or change at their campus during the past year or so. It was found that presidents build schemas of effectiveness that are based on previous success in their careers and on the normative expectation that presidents have critical effects on institutional life. When they encounter new and ambiguous situations they are likely to anticipate, and therefore to observe, successful outcomes, and to attribute these to their own efforts. Presidents are also subject to errors induced by cognitive distortion. (SW)",

Reviews were moved from a process of reacting to quantitative self-studies to a procedure that involved: intensive interviews, solicitation of alumni judgments on the merit and worth of their experiences (as opposed to collecting only limited-response surveys), and solicitation of reviews by external consultants who are disciplinary specialists. Results of the expanded reviews included development of qualitative data collection procedures, increased desire for narratives and case studies that contribute to greater appreciation of departmental and  program constraints, understanding of where flexibility might exist and where resources are strained, and the development of a &quot;member check&quot; process. This process verifies the accuracy of reports, checks for reliability, assesses the extent of assent with the findings and interpretations, and assures that all parties to the program review are fully informed of the report that is filed. Problems involved the training of faculty interviewers, commitment to the review, and coordinating with statewide reviews. (Author/SW)",

Currently, program evaluation is characterized by negotiation because of three powerful concepts: the nature of multiple constructions and multiple realities; the influence of power distributions throughout higher education institutions; and the role of politics. The theory of multiple realities proposes that participants in organizations create realities about the organization that are based on multiple and often conflicting value systems. Evaluators must take each construction into account and recognize that no single reality exists for the organization. Power is not limited to those who have the funds of authority to commission  evaluations, since others can give or withhold information or sway opinion. Since organizational politics is integral to the group's functioning, evaluations cannot avoid politics. Implications and recommendations include: evaluators must understand that evaluation is not research but a teaching/learning process; evaluation is a continuous and divergent process; evaluation not only uncovers various reality constructions but creates realities; evaluation is an emergent process; and program evaluation is a collaborative process between equals.

The 301 recommendations are grouped into 18 categories, of which those most represented in the reports are: program review, finances, governance, size and scope, and economic  development. For each of the 18 categories, tables indicate the frequency of the recommendations found in the six reports, and the distribution of the categories by state. The following conclusions are offered: many of the issues affecting statewide governance have persisted over time; new issues are found; both increased centralization and decentralization are recommended; flagship universities are likely to benefit from recommendations aimed at differentiation; and governors are becoming more active in higher education issues.

The program review process of the University of Kansas School of Education was assessed and compared with processes at the Emporia State University and Kansas State University. Specific objectives were to: determine whether discrepencies existed between policy-in-intention and policy-in-experience; identify factors in the implementation process that produced discrepancies; and recommend interventions that would reduce the  discrepancy between the processes of intention, implementation, and experience. In addition to examining documents and records of the colleges, interviews were conducted with staff members. It was found that Guba's policy types were helpful in viewing the program review process. Of four policy intentions for conducting the program review, only one, strengthening the role of the Board of Regents, was not accomplished as desired.

Persistence was defined as completing the bachelor's degree within a 9-year period, or actively working toward the degree as of 1980. The model was estimated on a national sample of 825 students who initially enrolled in 85 two-year institutions in fall 1971. Although there were differences in the factors associated with persistence for men and women, the results tend to confirm the importance of person-environment fit as a salient influence on degree persistence/completion. Measures of academic and social integration had the most consistent pattern of positive direct effects, while much of the influence of  student pre-college traits was indirect. That is, the student's experience of college may have an important, unique influence on persistence beyond that of differences in family background, secondary school experiences, individual attributes, and initial commitments on college entry. Subsequent institutional commitment had a significantly stronger positive influence on persistence for men than for women.

Secondary analyses were completed on the following surveys: the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education Survey (1969) and the Survey of the American Professoriate (1975 and 1977). The sample consisted of white males with appointments in humanities, social science, and natural science departments at Carnegie I institutions. Influences on faculty role performance were determined by testing 11 propositions concerning the changes that could be attributed to age, cohort socialization, environment, and life course. Areas of study included: mean hours devoted to instruction at each time of data  collection; measures of service to the department and university; age-related changes in interest that might account for faculty role performance; the effect of socialization experiences (e.g., graduate education, promotion) on the behavior of faculty of the same career age who are evaluated at different times; the effect of the recency of appointment on preference for research and acquisition of grant support; and the effect of tenure and rank on research interest and funding acquisition.

Different purposes of research include conceptual and theoretical development, relating theory and practice, and improving practice. Higher education as a field has not yet given much attention explicitly to the role of research in conceptual or theoretical development. Research can help in translating concepts and theory and showing their fit with practice. Most of the published articles in higher education currently place research in some theoretical or conceptual context. If research is directed to improve practice, the focus is real issues and the effort is likely to be organized around functional categories, such  as teaching and learning and financial affairs. Different research purposes suggest various research strategies and methods. In considering topics for research, two criteria are important: significance and interest. Seven suggestions for higher education research are offered, including: identifying significant conceptual, issue, and functionally-based research topics; promoting integrative research efforts that combine varied strategies and methods; and initiating more professional discussions and publication activities to examine the applicability of new approaches.

The objective was to understand the evolution of the program review process as it occurred over time. A case study approach involved document review over an 11-month period; nonparticipant observation; and interviews with 48 university staff, Kansas Board of Regents members, and legislative staff who had  participated in program review. Problems included: people holding positions in the universities changed over the period of the education review; school of education faculty, staff, and administrators tended to have a negative view about the review process, while university administrators, board members, and legislative staff tended to have positive views; participants were anxious about the review and reluctant to share information about the review process, and the political nature of the program review.

After a brief discussion of the probable changes in the occupational distribution of new entrants by occupation, attention is directed to likely trends in wages of younger workers. Also considered are projections concerning underemployment of college graduates and competition between the sexes. The possible impact on college enrollments of the deteriorating job opportunities for postsecondary graduates is also addressed, and information on financial aid/subsidies for students by income level are included. It is concluded that career prospects will likely be more limited than in previous years for those who attend or complete college. It is suggested that persons who fail to  complete college will gain little economic advantage from their brief postsecondary education. However, college graduates, and especially those who obtain a graduate degree in a professional field, will continue to gain a significant, but diminishing, economic advantage, as well as better access to good jobs. It is doubtful that the number of persons who enroll in higher education will decline as a result of these unattractive job prospects. However, students may tend to enroll part-time or attend low-cost schools. (SW)",

The potential use of NLS-LM, TALENT, and PSID as alternatives for or complements to NLS-HS is also addressed. After describing the data collected by each survey, attention is directed to the possible relevance of the survey to research tracing the progress of youths after high school. The surveys are compared concerning information content, sample sizes, sampling, and the problem of data obsolescence. It is suggested that researchers have ignored much of  the policy-relevant information available in these four databases by relying chiefly on static analysis and a fairly narrow range of topics: who goes to college or what kind of college, occupational/earnings outcomes, and factors affecting educational attainment. Ways of expanding the scope of research and analysis are suggested. Technical features and peculiarities of content that are likely to affect the use of the surveys for policy research are also identified. (SW)",

The subsidies are assessed in light of stated government objectives, and especially the objectives of efficiency and equity. Profiles of the countries includes information on: financing public and private institutions, free education vs. tuition and fee charges, organizational body responsible for budget development; sources of university income; types of student aid and their distribution; maximum award per student, December 1974; tax relief or  family allowances for students' parents; indirect student aid (housing, food subsidies, health); interest rate on loans; and loan repayment. Implications of alternative patterns of subsidy are analyzed in depth, with attention to the optimum levels of subsidy, the case for aiding students by means of grants, whether the subsidy system creates equality of educational opportunity, and how costs of education should be shared between high and low income taxpayers. An ideal student aid package is proposed. (SW)",

Attention was directed to the following concerns: the types of jobs available to young college-educated workers in the 1970s compared to the situation for their peers in the 1950s and 1960s; the effect of increased numbers of young college-educated workers on promotion opportunities for older persons with the same level of education; the labor market experience of college graduates compared to persons with some college but less than four years; and work opportunities for college-educated workers resulting from newly-created jobs or openings due to deaths and retirements. Fourteen major occupational groups were divided into four categories based on  average total money earnings in 1975: (1) good, (2) intermediate, (3) crafts for men, clerical for women, and (4) low-level. It is concluded that although college graduates in the 1970s have more difficulty obtaining good entry-level jobs than their counterparts during 1950-1970, they have better outcomes than those who completed less than four years of college.

College officials attributed the enrollment stability to improvements in academic programs, increased enrollment of graduate students, and stepped-up recruitment of both traditional and nontraditional students. Some officials who reported enrollment declines cited higher tuition as a factor. Additional findings include: full-time enrollment was down 2% overall, but was stable among private institutions; community colleges showed an estimated  4% decrease in full-time enrollment; for public institutions, part-time enrollment increased by 1.7%; overall enrollment of first-time full-time freshmen increased by about 1%, while at four-year public institutions, it increased by 2%; enrollment for first professional degrees dropped by 2%, but graduate enrollment increased by an estimated 3.5%; in all, 27% of institutions reported significant decreases in full-time enrollment; and another 14.8% of institutions reported significantly increased full-time enrollment.

Workshop participants' teaching assumptions about each of these issues are also listed. Social  control is considered to be the management of student behaviors, which is a factor of importance in the large class. Student behavioral concerns include: getting and maintaining students' attention, students' reading school newspapers in class, chattering, seating patterns, and cheating. To promote classroom discussion, it is suggested that an atmosphere encouraging student comments be created, physical obstacles be overcome, and all students be involved.

To assess whether requirements were being met, GAO reviewed patients' medical records for randomly selected samples of Medicare patients from 10 hospitals and 9 states and additional information provided by hospitals. The review covered 8,917 services provided to 1,165 patients. GAO reviewed fee-for-service billings by teaching physicians for inpatient and outpatient services.  Documentation for about half of the services, representing about 25% of the amount Medicare allowed, did not show whether the physicians had provided a personal and identifiable service.

        "description":"A comparative budget analysis approach employed by British universities is discussed. The British funding system analyzes in detail unit costs and marginal costs and undertakes comparative assessments of expenditure patterns and priorities for a group of 95 institutions with similar objectives, in which each has autonomy in resource allocation. Categories of expenditures are listed, and equipment expenditures are used as an example. For 16 institutions, 1981-1982 equipment expenditures for business management departments are identified for full-time equivalent students (undergraduates, teaching postgraduates, and research postgraduates). Included are the formulas and calculations used for departmental equipment expenditures, as well as a discussion of the statistical measures  employed. Consideration is given to: differential costs associated with different levels of study and different disciplines, partial regression analysis, empirical weighting for different categories of students, use of an iterative computer program to test the suitability of partial regression for every expenditure heading, and evaluating the expenditure patterns of all universities with the computer. An example of comparative expenditures for 1982-1983 salaries and wages in British university libraries is included. (SW)",

For 1970, 1971, and 1972 entrants, educational attainments were measured through 1984. Attention was directed to: rates of graduation for undergraduate degrees after 12 or more years; how students accumulated credentials at various time intervals; the success of community college entrants in earning bachelor's degrees; and the proportions earning masters and professional degrees. Open-admissions students were compared with regular students who did not need the program to qualify for a place at CUNY. Since CUNY's policy was designed to expand educational opportunity for disadvantaged minority groups, data were assessed for the major  ethnic constituencies of CUNY's entering classes (White, Black, and Hispanic students). Data were examined separately for CUNY's senior and community colleges. The effects of changes in financial aid on educational attainments were also considered. It was found that about 20% of regular students needed more than 5 years to earn the bachelor's degree, while among the open-admissions students, 40% needed more than 5 years to finish. (SW)",

Clark outlines points about the American higher education system that strongly affect institutional behavior, and considers excellence in different types of colleges, as well as different emphases and values within higher education, and the question of whether excellence can be pursued in all of them simultaneously. Excellence for the system as a whole is also addressed, in view of decentralization and diversification, and the localization of the  search for excellence. James A. Ogilvy's paper, &quot;The Changing Environment: Challenges for Higher Education,&quot; considers the effects of new technologies on higher education, and specifically the metaphysics of information and the relationship between information technologies and values.

Qualities students want in a supervisor include: being supportive and friendly, listening actively, and possessing professional knowledge and good judgment. The supervisory process begins with getting acquainted, providing orientation materials, a guided tour, working out the learning contract, and scheduling meeting times. Skills in ongoing supervision  include: demonstration and observation, teaching through feedback, using negative feedback (assertion and confrontation), and group supervision. Special problem areas for supervisors may involve student stress, the unassertive student, and dealing with difficult students. Concerns in evaluation/grading include objectivity vs. subjectivity, preparing for the final evaluation, performance assessment, and measuring change and growth.

A total of 14 faculty, 12 students, and 12 alumni reported their perceptions of the quality of their doctoral programs on 16 dimensions. The questionnaire consisted of about 60 statements concerning characteristics of the program, with agree-to-disagree or poor-to-excellent ratings as response options, along with demographic items, such as academic rank, tenure, and years teaching. The findings suggest that, while doctoral programs have experienced a  significant growth, they have maintained a quality environment. Faculty demonstrated an increased commitment to scholarly activities as evidenced by an increase in publications, presentations, and perceptions of time spent on scholarly activities. Students in 1984 were better prepared than students in 1979 and pursued their graduate education more on a part-time basis. The evidence documents a growing scholarly maturity among nursing doctoral programs. Descriptions of the 16 GPSA summary scales are appended. (SW)",

The paper details the evolution of the acceptance of microcomputers by faculty, students, and the community until the fall of 1984, when there were 15 computers in use in the school. In a 5-year period, the school had gone from being totally untouched by computer technology to having a reputation as one of the leading rural users of microcomputers in the state of California. This assessment of the conditions which  led to the expansion of computer technology in Scotia provides insight into that process as it might occur in other rural settings. The case study includes discussions of the community setting; the growth of computer usage in Scotia; its impact on teaching and learning; and future prospects. (THC)",

        "description":"The first of two reports in this document details the use of a trial teletext service in residential Washington, D.C. during the second half of 1981. It is emphasized that caution must be exercised in interpreting the results since the trial was designed as a pilot with a sample of only 40 households. In addition, there were significant technical problems, as is often the case with trials of new services. The primary objectives of the pilot field trial were to refine the research hypotheses and develop the research design for a larger field trial. The introductory chapter summarizes features important to the context of the results reported: characteristics of the residential sample; terminal equipment; content of the service; survey and measuring instruments; and consequent  limits to the generality of the results. Three additional chapters are devoted to use of the service as measured by meters; residential users' attitudes toward the service as determined by interviews; and a summary of the implications. The second report is concerned with the same population of residential viewers' use of the teletext service broadcast in collaboration with WETA-TV during the first half of 1982 after substantial revisions had been made in the original system. This report focuses on the content of the service, the measuring instruments used, and limits to the generality of the findings. Two topics are covered that were not addressed in the previous report: use of index pages and respondents' willingness to pay for teletext. A concluding statement reviews the implications of  the findings for the design of a teletext service, the technical design, and research methodology, and offers some tentative conclusions based on the initial analysis of the data.

Both the elementary and  secondary computer education curriculum guides are organized around the topics of computer operation, computer application, problem solving, and computers in society. The elementary education curriculum guide is divided into three sections: grades 1-3; 4-6; and 7-8. The secondary education curriculum guide is intended for grades 9-12. (THC)",

The first section covers the physical attributes of computer hardware and describes changes in memory, operating systems, storage capacity, and input output devices between 1970 and 1985. The decrease in cost of computing power is also described. The paper then examines software developments and asserts that although improvement in instructional software is slow, it is real and can be expected to continue. Characteristics of software are divided into three categories--subject matter content,  instructional process or pedagogy, and technical characteristics--and advances in each of the areas are examined.

        "description":"This paper describes how audiovisual media have influenced the way students have learned--or failed to learn--at the Open University at Walton Hall. The paper is based in part on results from a large body of research that has repeatedly demonstrated the interrelatedness of a wide range of factors in determining how or what students learn from audiovisual media. For instance, the administration's policy toward the assessment of broadcast material will affect not only the way many students approach the programs, but may determine whether or not a student will watch at all; the benefit a student obtains from a program will be affected by how much he has read in the correspondence texts; and that in turn will be influenced by the timing of the TMAs (tutor marked assignments).  Primarily a literature review, this paper discusses the following topics: general theory and research relevant to the Open University; the roles of audiovisual media in Open University learning; case studies and documentaries; television as reinforcement; delivery of instruction; students' prior experience with learning from television and radio; student control over audiovisual media; relevance of program material; individual differences; and the need for broadcast notes.

        "description":"This position paper explores the potential of new technology to radically alter both distance education and conventional higher education. It hypothesizes that technological developments could even lead to the demise of the conventional campus-based higher education institution by the year 2000. Instead, people of all ages would be able to study at any period of their life through a mixture of home learning, study at work, and occasional visits to &quot;old&quot; campuses, whose primary function by then would be research and curriculum development. It is predicted that the determining factors for the materialization of this scenario will be political and institutional, not technological or even financial. The following sections are discussed in the context of this hypothesis: Print,  Television and Culture; New Communications Technologies (Cable Television and Video-Cassettes, Computer Conferencing, and Computer-Based Audio-Graphic Systems); New Institutional Models; and Political and Institutional Barriers.

The study was undertaken as a response to the lack of systematic documentation on distance teaching institutions, and the creation of a databank that would allow easy access to the information was an important goal. The questionnaire was comprehensive and asked for statistical information of a sensitive nature, as well as information on organization, teaching, learning, counselling, examining, student service, and media applications. Useful replies received from 203 institutions included 37 from the  United States, 23 from the United Kingdom, 22 from Australia, 16 from Canada, and 15 from the Federal Republic of Germany. The responses were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analysis and the findings reported in this document provide information on: (1) the organization of distance teaching schools and universities; (2) the media used; (3) general principles of teaching and learning with special reference to the degree of independence expected of distant students or developed by distance education; and (4) student support and examinations.

This discussion shows that, while these principles have influenced course development, they have not gained universal acceptance. Rather, the OU course teams have followed the principles where common sense dictated, and have abandoned them where the positive-rational philosophy underlying the principles appeared to cut across the interests of students.

Data for the evaluation of the training package were collected from experimental (N=10) and control groups (N=10) consisting of CMI instructors at Naval and Air Force technical training centers. Navy and Air Force instructors in the experimental groups first participated in a 20-hour training program which comprised the 12-module CMI instructor role training package and six group discussions. Air Force instructors in the experimental group also received a 10-hour  student motivational skill training package. Following the training sessions, instructors in the experimental groups returned to their CMI learning centers and data were collected on a number of measures during a 3- to 5-month evaluation period. Both quantitative and qualitative findings indicated that the training package met the goal of providing relevant and needed training in Navy and Air Force settings. Instructor training in theoretically-based CMI roles also contributed to more positive student attitudes toward CMI and their CMI instructors, and to generally lower student elimination rates. It is recommended that Navy CMI schools continue to use the training materials as part of their inservice instructor training. A list of references is provided as well as four appendices, which  include a description of the CMI instructor role training package, copies of the CMI instructor survey and student attitude questionnaires, and additional group discussion topics for the training package.

Eighty students were selected as the treatment group and received instruction in the understanding and application of microcomputers; 42 students served as the control group and received no direct instruction in the use of microcomputers. A non-equivalent control group pretest/posttest design was used, and analysis of variance was undertaken to interpret the differences in standardized test results between the two groups. Qualitative analysis involved use of questionnaires, focused interviews, and data gathered by external  project evaluators. Results indicate: (1) the treatment group (gifted and regular project students) showed more instances of creative thinking on all sub-tests of the Test of Divergent Thinking (TDT) and scored higher on the reading comprehension sub-test of the Canadian Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) than the control group; (2) the computer literacy questionnaire showed major trends toward enhanced literacy for both groups; (3) gifted students in the treatment group learned a greater number of mathematics concepts and expressed a greater degree of satisfaction with programming and graphics activities than did regular students; and (4) teacher inservice programs were judged to be relatively successful. A list of references is provided and copies of questionnaires used; additional information  about the study and descriptive statistics are appended. (JB)",

        "description":"To follow up an initial statewide computer survey (1983-84), the State Department of Education conducted an investigation of microcomputers and their use in elementary, middle, and secondary schools in South Carolina. The survey was conducted in two phases: an inventory of computer equipment was taken as a component of the Statewide Basic Educational Data System (BEDS) Survey, and a questionnaire, dealing with questions on instructional and administrative uses of computers, funding, and software inventory, was distributed to the 1,120 schools and 92 school districts that participated in the first survey. A total of 1,082 school and 88 district forms were received for a response rate of 97% and 96% respectively. The survey showed that: (1) the total number of computers in schools  increased from 4,054 to 6,400 (58%), with 25 brands and 63 models of computers represented; (2) a total of 911 schools now have computers; (3) the student-to-computer ratio improved to 1:94 from 1:149 for the previous year; (4) 54% of the schools have one or two computers, and 14% report having 10 or more computers; (5) Apple remains the most popular computer for instructional purposes, with 3,290 distributed throughout the schools; (6) total funds spent for computer hardware and software almost equaled that spent over the 4 previous years; and (7) the Department of Education Basic Skills Assessment Program (BSAP) Correlation Mathematics Software listing was considered by a majority of schools (62%) in making software purchases. Additional data are provided on the instructional and  administrative uses for which computers are employed in the schools of 88 of the state's 92 districts by grade and brand and model of equipment.

The specific variables considered were: (1) the manner in which this approach may affect cognitive development; (2) academic learning; (3) attitudes towards and interest in academic subjects; and (4) teacher attitudes towards such students. Subjects included 56 Native Cree Indian adolescents who were assigned to experimental (N=38) and control (N=18) groups based on their need for remedial or regular instruction respectively. Pretests were administered to identify underdeveloped cognitive functions and computer literacy was assessed via a computer awareness questionnaire. The experimental group received the  intervention program, which comprised an introductory LOGO computer language component; an extended computer component; and reading, writing, and mathematics components. Posttests were then administered to both groups and an analysis of variance was conducted to determine the significance of any differences between the experimental and control groups. Results indicated that involvement in the intervention program did positively affect the experimental subjects' cognitive functioning abilities and improve their achievement in reading and writing; however, teaching for transfer of cognitive functions neither affected the students' attitudes toward academic subjects nor improved their achievement in mathematics.

Specific issues addressed included: (1) student social patterns in microcomputer interactions; (2) cultural and sex differences in microcomputer interactions; and (3) student affective responses to microcomputers. Observational study occurred in beginning programming classes and free computer lab periods (before and after school and during lunch) for a period of one semester; student interviews were also used to collect data. Results substantiate previously reported gender differences in enrollment in advanced classes and use of the microcomputer lab outside class time, with the males predominating in those  areas. Although female enrollment equaled that of the males in the introductory level of programming classes, they did exhibit less interest in computer classes, computer use, and computer careers than the males. In addition, the males in gender-mixed groups tended to dominate the keyboard for both typing and input of data. There was a great deal of interaction, primarily academic in nature, related to microcomputers: student-to-student, student-to-teacher, and student-to-microcomputer. Generally, the interaction was open in the classes, but in the noon lab, student-to-student interaction was more evident between/among the \"regulars.\" It is noted that the computer itself is an interactive medium, and that the class structure and student preference for working in pairs/groups further  stimulated interactive behavior.

Data were analyzed from an earlier study which described how teachers believed to be \"successful\" microcomputer users used computers for instruction of mathematics or science at the elementary or secondary level. The final sample consisted of 65 teachers in 49 schools and 25 districts; two-thirds of the teachers taught sixth grade or lower and 52% were female. Results indicate that adequate technical support is  the most important determinant of increased integration of microcomputers into regular instruction; in addition, more varied microcomputer use was found when the teacher had a voice in selecting courseware for acquisition by the district. Preliminary findings also suggest that policies and incentives other than technical support play an influential role in stimulating teacher participation, e.g., \"intrinsic\" incentives, (a computer set aside for teacher experimentation), and \"extrinsic\" incentives (the possibility of a promotion and a pay raise). Finally, few significant relationships were found between teacher and student variables with support and incentives, on the one hand, and with teaching practices, on the other.

Results indicate 80% of these districts currently provide inservice computer training to teachers; the median amount available is 25 hours. Most also provide technical assistance to teachers with hardware problems (95%), locating and evaluating courseware (80%), and integrating the microcomputer into the curriculum (65%). The median number of microcomputers found in these districts is 35, or a ratio of two microcomputers per five teachers and three microcomputers per 100 students. Incentives for participation in computer inservice training  are not common: the most common are commendations or publicity (47%), release time for classes (41%), salary credit (36%), and guaranteed access to microcomputers (35%). The most important incentive was among those least commonly found in this sample--a guarantee of computer access. It was found that traditional incentives dispensed by administrators to teachers have little effect in fostering teacher involvement with computers and distinctions between \"extrinsic\" incentives such as salary credit and \"intrinsic\" incentives such as professional recognition did not prove to be conceptually or empirically important.

A formative evaluation of Math Works programs (9 and 25) was conducted to assess the instructional effectiveness and general appeal of these and other programs in the Math Works series. For Math Works Program 9 (\"The Difference between Perimeter and Area\"), the sample consisted of more than 400 children, principally fifth graders, in ten schools. For Program 25 (\"Dividing Regions into Subregions for Finding Area\"), the sample consisted of 107 boys and 83 girls, principally fifth graders from eight schools. Both samples included rural, suburban, and innercity  schools. Qualitative data were used primarily to assess the appeal of the programs and to determine needed instructional enhancement; pre- and posttests were used to measure the instructional effectiveness of the programs. T-tests were performed to determine whether student performance significantly increased from the pretest to the posttest. Results indicate: (1) after each program, students' feelings toward mathematics were virtually unchanged; (2) students liked both programs slightly more than they liked mathematics; (3) students fared well on items related only to story line (91.8% correct), although their performance declined on items which asked them to recall the application of a concept within a story (41% correct); (4) results of analysis of variance for sex were inconclusive;  and (5) students could identify with the characters in the story, but felt that some dramatic segments were confusing or unrealistic.

The task force used six primary sources of information in generating this report: descriptions of exemplary programs, commissioned papers, letters from educators and private citizens, existing research documents, site visits, and local public meetings. The report consists of eight major sections: (1) Transforming Education; (2) Observations on the Status of Technology in Education; (3) Technology in Education--the Potential; (4) Educational Applications of Technology;  (5) Effects on Education; (6) Beginning the Transformation; (7) Recommendations; and (8) Concluding Remarks. Issues addressed include needed reform in pre- and in-service teacher education programs; negative and positive aspects of the use of technology in education; and the potential of such technological devices as personal computers, databases, and expert systems. Five broad uses for technology in education are then identified and discussed, and recommendations are presented to various constituencies (e.g., schools, school districts, state agencies, parents) for implementing strategies regarding planning; financing; teacher education; curriculum and instructional practice; research, development, evaluation and dissemination; and demonstration schools. Conclusions call for the creation  of a system in which an individual learning plan permits each learner to proceed at a rate and pace that is challenging but achievable, makes no unjust comparisons with the progress of others, prevents students from becoming passive, and assures positive reinforcement and steady progress. A bibliography and list of the task force members are included. (JB)",

Shared areas of interest include reading skills (the problem of illiteracy) and reading motivation (the problem of aliteracy); the state of the book industry; books and technology; the potential complementarity of books and the media; censorship; the history of books; and the international role of the book.

Since all culture belongs to all people, books and ideas create a boundless world, and librarians of the world are servants of an indivisible world. To keep that world indivisible is the most urgent and most difficult task for librarians. Political, economic, or military chauvinists who would like to make libraries narrowly national, and ideologues who try to sanitize the books that are published, are the enemies and saboteurs of the work of the world's librarians. The Library of  Congress (LC) is attempting to serve an indivisible world of culture and books and ideas: only about one-quarter of the library's books are in English, while three-quarters are in the other languages of the world. In collecting and preserving other cultural objects--photographs, graphic art, motion pictures, music, and maps, LC tries to display the full spectrum of the cultures of mankind. Despite the cost and time-consuming nature of this effort, LC does not allow itself to be confined by the cultures of Europe and the West. (THC)",

        "description":"An overview is provided of the historical development, organizational structure, and programs and services of the Nebraska Technical Community College (TCC) System. First, statutory provisions establishing the TCC system and defining its priorities are cited, explaining that the system was established to create locally governed and supported technical community college areas with the major educational emphasis on occupational education. Next, the historical development of the TCC system is traced, explaining the present system's evolution from three separate sources: two-year junior colleges, state vocational/technical colleges, and area vocational/technical schools. The next section focuses on the TCC's organizational structure, noting that the organizing principle of the system  is local control and that the six TCC Areas are independent political subdivisions responsible directly to the State Legislature. This section also explains the role of the State Board for Technical Community Colleges and the Nebraska Technical Community College Association in providing statewide coordination. Finally, the paper examines the programs and services of the TCC system. The three major roles of the system (i.e., vocational technical programs and non-degree occupational education; general academic transfer programs; and avocational recreational courses) are highlighted, along with other special roles (i.e., remedial programming, including adult basic education and general educational development; general education; economic development activities, such as customized job  training, retraining, and upgrading; and in-depth academic and career assessment and counseling).

        "description":"Two of the essential ingredients of institutional quality are the recruitment of quality staff and the systematic evaluation of all staff. To be effective, evaluation must be supported by the governing board, must be conducted by competent administrators with histories as superior teachers, and must be based on clearly defined personnel policies and procedures. Illinois Valley Community College (IVCC) offers an example of an effective evaluation system, which since implemented at the college more than a decade ago, has been steadily refined. The system has significantly enhanced the quality of instruction through the termination of ineffective faculty and staff and through the promotion of quality performance by the staff who remain. The IVCC system involves the following  characteristics: (1) all tenured and non-tenured, full-time and part-time faculty are evaluated; (2) the board sets evaluation policy; (3) faculty evaluation begins when new persons are hired; (4) faculty are evaluated through direct classroom observation; (5) evaluation is conducted at the beginning of the term; (6) faculty are evaluated only by administrators, rather than by students, peers, or themselves; and (7) merit recognition of outstanding faculty efforts is a part of the administrative evaluation system. By removing poor instructors and rewarding excellent instructors, IVCC has improved its total faculty and instruction for its students.

The study's findings, based on questionnaire responses from all institutions, included the following: (1) all colleges, except one, tested over 90% of their incoming students; (2) statewide, the colleges tested an average of 90% of the full-time students and 85% of the part-time students; (3) every college met or exceeded the  Council's minimum placement standards in verbal skills, and almost all exceeded minimum placement standards in computation; (4) the colleges reported that increased percentages of students were identified as needing remediation in reading (37% in 1984 vs. 34% in 1983), writing (32% in 1984 vs. 28% in 1983), and computation (35% in 1984 vs. 30% in 1983); and (5) compared to 1983 responses, the colleges enrolled more of their skills deficient full-time students in appropriate courses in reading (93%), writing (95%), computation (90%), and elementary algebra (74%), but no increase was seen for part-time students. The report includes extensive data tables, along with the the questionnaire, institutional profile form, a description of NJBSC proficiency levels, policy statements, a list of  problems encountered in testing, placing, and instructing students in basic skills, and supplementary part-time student data.

The NJCBSPT was taken by 44,344 students from March through December 1985. Test results revealed the following: (1) 26% were proficient in verbal skills, 32% in computation skills, and 12% in elementary algebra; (2) 34% of the students lacked proficiency in verbal skills, 44% in computation skills, and 59% in elementary algebra; (3) higher percentages of the recent high school graduates appeared to be proficient in each area than the test group as a whole; (4) the four-year state colleges and the university sectors traditionally enrolled better prepared students than the  open-admission county colleges; and (5) over the past several years, while NJCBSPT results have remained fairly constant, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores have begun to increase after declining for two decades. While efforts have been initiated in New Jersey to strengthen the preparation of new high school graduates, two demographic factors will have a negative effect on the basic skills problem in the more immediate future. First, colleges are increasingly recruiting students from an older, nontraditional population, who typically have greater remediation needs than recent high school freshmen. Second, an increase is anticipated in the proportion of linguistically diverse students in future freshman classes. (AYC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to investigate the instrumental (e.g., Ambitious, Broadminded, Capable, Imaginative, Intellectual, Loving, and Responsibile) and terminal (e.g., A Comfortable Life, A Sense of Accomplishment, Equality, Health, National Security, Mature Love, and Salvation) life values of community college faculty in Oregon using the Rokeach Value Survey. A stratified (by full-/part-time teaching status and teaching assignment) proportional (by college) random sample of 984 instructors was surveyed. Study findings, based on a 51% response rate, included the following: (1) with regard to terminal values, faculty placed greater value on Health, Self-respect, Family Security, and Freedom, and less value on Salvation, Pleasure, National Security, and Social Recognition; (2) with  respect to instrumental values, faculty placed greater value on Honest, Reliable, Capable, and Loving, and less value on Self-controlled, Polite, Clean, and Obedient; (3) English composition instructors placed greater value on A World of Beauty than did auto/industrial mechanic, secretarial science, and health occupations instructors; and (4) part-time social science instructors placed grater value on Courageous than did part-time health occupations instructors; and (5) males placed greater value on A Comfortable Life and An Exciting Life while females placed greater value on Self-respect and True Friendship. Based on study findings, it was concluded that community college instructors differ in life values and that these differences are related to teaching assignment and, to a lesser  extent, the sex and faculty status of the instructor.

        "description":"Fulfilling the role of the community college president requires that a balance be maintained between internal constituents (e.g., students, faculty, administrators, and support staff) and external constituents (e.g., politicians, members of coordinating agencies, business leaders, trustees, alumni, and special interest groups). When the president sees that this balance has been lost, he/she must apply the proper amount of pressure and exert a positive and countervailing force to right the balance as quickly, as efficiently, and as painlessly as possible. The president must also keep in mind that imbalance between internal and external constituents may be caused by positive activities, as well as negative ones. Potential dangers to institutional balance include: (1) lack of an  environment in which routine matters and minor problems are handled efficiently; (2) complacency on campus as reflected by a prolonged state of institutional inactivity in areas such as governance, construction, and teaching and learning improvement; (3) the tendency of groups on either side to band together to increase their influence, thereby presenting the president with continually shifting coalitions to either pacify or render less powerful; and (4) the possibility that various constituencies will crossover to other categories or otherwise act in an unexpected manner. A classic example of the president's role in maintaining balance relates to the issue of quality versus open access, which involves not only educational questions, but political, social, and economic factors as well. In  this case, as in all others, the president must ensure balance, for without it, the college can never reach its full potential. (EJV)",

Section 1 provides a national overview, covering U.S. colleges with the largest foreign enrollments and foreign student enrollments by state, field of study, and country of origin. Section 2 deals with MDCC foreign enrollments, indicating that Miami-Dade matriculated more foreign visa and refugee students (N=4,316) in 1984-85 than any other U.S. college. Tables profile foreign students by country of origin, immigration status, degree program, and campus, native language, place of residence, full-/part-time  status, credits taken, and grade point average (GPA). Finally, section 3 provides program completion data for MDCC's foreign students by citizenship status, ethnicity, degree type, age at graduation, year of first admission, and miscellaneous student factors. Highlighted findings include the following: (1) the largest numbers of foreign students at MDCC come from the Caribbean Islands, Central America, and northern South America; (2) in the past 20 years, the number of foreign students enrolled at MDCC increased dramatically from 800 to 9,795 students; (3) visa students had the highest mean GPA and mean cumulative credits, resident aliens had mean GPA's that nearly equaled those of U.S. citizens, and refugees had somewhat lower GPA's than the other citizenship cohorts; (4) foreign  students had higher mean hours earned and mean hours attempted than the MDCC student population as a whole; and (5) between 1980-81 and 1984-85, declines were seen in U.S. citizen and visa graduates in both numbers and percentages, while increases occurred in both resident alien and refugee graduation proportions.

The target population for the study consisted of 70 Appalachia region community college students, ranging in age from 22 to 57, who had no prior postsecondary educational experience and were enrolled in at least two major-related courses. Data collection involved in-depth interviews with all students in the sample, observations of a sample of classes in which target students were commonly enrolled, and daily logs filled out by the enrolled  students for 1 week during the second month of the semester. The study found that students' attempts to manage the learning process were affected by issues related to finances, home and family, transportation, unique personal factors, goals and commitment, academic adjustment, the classroom, and the institution. Based on study findings, a number of interventions were suggested to AEL region schools to: (1) help adult students with their problems outside of school (e.g., college-sponsored child-care centers, adult student support groups, and in-service training to sensitize student personnel workers to adult students' problems); (2) improve the classroom experience (e.g., in-service teacher training to promote course organization around a detailed syllabus, thorough explanation and review  in class, in-class dialog, and heightened sensitivity to the special needs of adults); and (3) improve academic services at the institutional level (e.g., more thorough counseling at time of enrollment, provision of more information about majors and careers in introductory courses, more mandatory advising sessions, and closer assessment of skill levels).

        "author":["Needham, Robbie Lee"],
        "description":"Communications technologies have the potential to transform the educational process. In the community college context, these technologies have the power to change the the roles of faculty. On one hand, these changes might mean a reduction in the number and status of teachers. On the other hand, communications technologies may afford teachers greater opportunities for role differentiation and specialization. Another change made possible by the introduction of new technologies has been an upset of traditional power relationships in the learning process, with teachers relinquishing authority and students assuming more control over their own learning. Communications technologies also allow for much greater individualization of learning, permitting students to progress at their own  speed and freeing teachers from repetitious analysis and prescription. As educators realize the potential of computers for innovation in education, many possibilities for enhancing student learning arise: (1) computers can create realistic models and involve students in real-world computer applications; (2) throughout the college, students are using the computer as a tool to analyze data, draft and revise sketches, perform laboratory experiments, or draft and revise reports; and (3) individualized instruction is available via computers in public libraries, video outlets, and electronic universities, diffusing higher education's monopoly on learning beyond high school. A final area in which communications technologies can affect the educational process lies in their potential for  furthering the professional development of faculty. Realizing this potential requires that administrators and policymakers help faculty develop new skills through planning and allocating adequate resources for computer skills and courseware development. Perhaps technology's primary gift to community college faculty is the demand that they look again at the essentials of teaching and learning. (RO)",

        "description":"Community colleges, because of their late arrival in the development of American education, have suffered from an image and identity problem since their inception. To deal with this problem, community colleges should position themselves as unique community-based service-oriented colleges and market a specific focus to the general public. The first and most important step in the positive positioning of a college involves a commitment from top administration to a strategic marketing process that includes a clear focus of institutional mission, a clear understanding of whom the college serves, and precise knowledge of what makes its services unique. Throughout this positive positioning process, community colleges must view themselves as part of the mainstream of their communities  and develop programs and services to meet the identified needs of their external publics. One fundamental and natural connection between colleges and their communities is in the local economy. This connection should be used as a major vehicle for positioning community colleges in the public's mind as a respected and integral part of society. A positioning strategy related to economic development would involve the following steps: (1) the college president must believe in and gain acceptance for the marketing mission; (2) a strategic action plan must be developed with input from internal and external publics; (3) the college must get involved with its community's economic development and chamber of commerce activities by, for example, developing a small business assistance center,  assisting in visitation teams to compete for relocating industry, customizing industry-specific training programs, and publicizing the college's role in these activities; and (4) the college must follow through with its commitment and develop a reputation for integrity, responsiveness, and cooperation.

        "author":["Alfred, Richard L."],
        "description":"A large number of students enrolling in community colleges do not aspire to or complete the associate degree. Instead, they attend community colleges for a multitude of reasons, including job training or retraining, licensure, preparation for transfer, and avocational pursuits. Given the preponderant pattern of part-time attendance and diversity of student objectives, it stands to reason that questions would arise as to the relevance of the associate degree as a student outcomes measure. These questions differ depending upon the perspective from which student outcomes are viewed. For community college administrators, a college is \"effective\" when student outcomes are produced at a level sufficient to balance the costs of instruction. For educational policy makers, college  effectiveness may be measured in terms of nondegree outcomes related to economic development and public service programs. Teaching faculty may have still yet another perspective on outcomes, arguing that the college is effective when it implements academic policies that restrict the distribution of rewards to students who successfully meet standards. Within the broader context of social and educational change, additional questions arise about the utility of the associate degree as an outcomes measure; e.g., In a labor market marked by increased emphasis on service and technological jobs, is the degree undereducation for some jobs and overeducation for others? Do constraints on faculty technological skill and knowledge undermine the perceived value of an associate degree? As societal  conditions change, the associate degree may diminish in importance, and non-degree, short-term courses developed for specific constituencies on an \"as need\" basis may represent a better strategy for achieving socially desirable student outcomes.

Given the need for positive relations with state officials, community college leaders face a complex of four interrelated problems: (1) limited preparation in the area of inter-leader, inter-level relations in education and professional development; (2) limited information about trends outside their state; (3) a paucity of information about the forces that mold state-level decisions and patterns of policy formation; and (4) lack of knowledge about the theory and practice of effecting change in public policy directions.

Sponsored by the Latin American Civic Association (LACA) in Los Angeles, the 14-month intervention was implemented and assessed on three levels: (1) staff training and consultation; (2) parent education and involvement; and (3) in-house mental health treatment services, including short-term psychotherapy. A comprehensive needs assessment survey was conducted to provide a profile of the Head Start families served by LACA. Out of 960 children and families in the program, 845 survey questionnaires were completed and returned. A follow-up questionnaire was completed later in the year on a  sample of 220 families. Head Start teachers were trained to promote children's emotional development and social competence and to identify problems with the potential for long-range damaging effects. Bilingual parent education provided training to support parents as the primary educators of their children and to increase parent involvement in LACA Head Start activities. A team approach to mental health treatment encouraged parent involvement and teacher participation. Concluding remarks suggest that the success of the MHP/IP model warrants replication in other Head Start settings. Related materials are appended, including instruments and samples of treatment case summaries. (RH)",

        "description":"Written for child caregivers, this booklet provides very basic information about child abuse and neglect, discusses early warnings that signal when a family is in trouble or when a child is at risk, and indicates how caregivers can helpfully intervene. Also suggested are ways caregivers might protect themselves against the charge of child abuse. Sections of the booklet concern: (1) recognizing child abuse; (2) interviewing and screening prospective employees and ongoing assessment of staff; (3) discipline and touch; (4) creating a written discipline and touch policy; (5) caring for a child who has been abused; and (6) a short program of self-defense for young children. The booklet contains numerous suggestions, such as teaching a very young child to memorize his or her telephone  number by singing it to the tune of &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.&quot; (RH)",

The questions centered on three main areas of concern: (1) How are children's extreme behaviors to be interpreted? (2) What is the teacher's role? and (3) What can teachers do to promote more appropriate behaviors? This booklet provides a responses to these questions. The left-hand column of each page lists personal, interpersonal, cognitive, and emotional issues likely to confront abused children. Such issues include boundaries, trust, role reversals, safety, self-esteem/self-identity, authority/power/control, shame/guilt/anger, loyalty/denial, and confusion. The middle column of each page specifies  problematic behaviors related to each of the listed issues. The right-hand column offers suggestions for dealing with the behaviors in ways that control negative behaviors and give special attention to needs of abused children. To use this booklet effectively, a teacher must recognize that interventions require time and consistent application and that children under stress who have not been abused may behave in ways characteristic of abused children.

Common concerns children write about include getting along with family members and friends, problems at school, and social and personal problems. Only a tiny percentage write of grave problems such as abuse, suicide, or drugs. Frequently letters concern teasing and other unkind behaviors by friends and classmates, with teasing by classmates being the largest school-related concern. Other school-related concerns involve problems understanding schoolwork or keeping up with the class, classmates who talk in class and distract others from their work, disruptive class members who cause the entire class to lose privileges, and --rarely--difficulties getting along with the teacher  or complaints about teacher behavior. Each letter received is answered, and the &quot;Highlights&quot; staff relies very much on parents, teachers, and other adults to be sensitive and responsive listeners to children who may contact them. Children writing about personal and social concerns evidently know their shortcomings but find it difficult to change long-established behaviors and do think and care about &quot;adult&quot; issues, even though research indicates that parents do not think of their children as having such concerns.

        "description":"Employing a new procedure for measuring peer concepts, this study investigated the development of differentiation and accuracy of children's concepts of their peers' attributes. Subjects, 18 second-graders, 23 fourth-graders, and 18 sixth-graders, were asked to rate characteristics of their peers in mathematics, athletics (running), and in two social areas - anger and shyness. To compare methods, the attribute questions were also asked in a paired-comparisons picture sociometric procedure. To assess response accuracy, measures of each child's actual skills or characteristics were obtained by using mathematics grades, a running speed measure, and teachers' ratings of anger, shyness, and popularity. In general, analyses indicated that differentiation and accuracy of children's  concepts of their peers' attributes increased with age. While second-graders viewed many of the attributes as being related, they did show some differentiation. Fourth-graders differentiated more than second-graders, but saw running ability as related to popularity and shyness as negatively related to running ability. By sixth grade, the attributes are seen as distinct except that children who angered easily were seen as unpopular. In comparison with the paired-comparison task, the rating-scale method revealed differentiation and accuracy at an earlier age. It is concluded that the rating-scale technique appears to be a viable method for the assessment of children's -- especially young children's -- concepts of their peers. (RH)",

        "description":"The &quot;emic&quot; research method used in cultural anthropology is described and its usefulness in developmental psychology is illustrated. A distinction is made in cultural anthropology between &quot;etic&quot; and &quot;emic&quot; research methods. In etic research observers employ established categories, such as prior definitions of constructs and variables, to interpret data. In contrast, researchers using an emic approach record behaviors and &quot;work through&quot; protocols until they discover what the observations mean to the persons who are observed. Participant observation, cultural anthropology's emic method, involves the: (1) collection of descriptive field notes and derivation of tentative categories; (2) refinement of tentative categories; and (3) testing hypotheses about refined categories in  controlled research. The emic method was used in a study of classes of 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds in a day care center. Observations of 127 behavioral events that seemed to involve &quot;memory&quot; were recorded. Memory instances were found to be classifiable in a taxonomical matrix of 2 sources by 10 categories: child or adult initiator across naming, rhymes and songs, what happened before, anticipation, appropriate behavior, forms/functions/sounds, persons, place memory, academic, and answering requests. Memory was found to be embedded in behavioral events that rarely had memory as a major goal. Thus, the study of memory may require a holistic theoretical approach, such as those of Piaget and Jenkins. (RH)",

Presentation of group data may be enhanced by (1) describing the number of subjects that  resemble the group data; (2) showing the range, mean, and standard deviations of scores; and (3) presenting individual data graphically so that profiles deviating from the group data are immediately apparent.

It points out that (1) verbalization can enhance children's attention to task-relevant features; (2) as a type of rehearsal, verbalization may improve coding, storage, and retention of material, and thereby facilitate subsequent retrieval and use; (3) verbalization can help children maintain a positive task outlook and cope with difficulties; (4) because verbalization makes salient a systematic approach for improving learning and children's ability to apply it, verbalization also can raise self-efficacy (perceived capabilities). Research is summarized that assesses the effects on children's learning of verbalizing information to be remembered, modeled  actions, and strategies. Collectively these findings support the notion that verbalization is a key process that can help develop self-regulated learning among children. Concluding remarks suggest that future research should explore maintenance and generalization of systematic approaches to learning, verbalization of task-specific and general statements, and uses of verbalization in classrooms.

The sample consisted of 18 Japanese firstborn nonretarded children from middle-class families who were individually tested at 11, 12, 14, 16, 22, and 24 months. At each test session, each subject received 2 trials at a task in which an object disappeared at a tunnel entrance and reappeared at an exit. The child's visual fixation toward the object and the entrance, the exit, and other zones of the tunnel was measured and the entire procedure was videotaped. Visual search during occlusion of the object was assigned to five levels of anticipation. Findings indicated a developmental  sequence from level I to level III and a transition period of 14 months. Within level III, change occurred from level III-1 to level III-3 across a period of 22 months. Level II and level III-2 were regarded as transitional levels despite their limted emergence due to the decrement of their occurrence at later months. Such development was interpreted as the reflection of the process of coordination between spatial and temporal information in object permanence. (RH)",

Each child was scored for his or  her average RT and variance of RT in each condition. No significantly different RT patterns to stimuli with and without distractors were observed among the younger or older LD, H, or US children.

Each section contains learning objectives, key generalizations, and an outline of the activities described in the section. Many of the activities are designed for the immediate use of students, and both teacher and student directions are included. Activities described should be appropriate for students in schools that serve economically depressed areas. Chapter 1 focuses on knowing oneself and relating to others. Chapter 2 discusses parenting  roles and health decisions. Chapter 3 concerns differences and similarities among families and family changes and coping with such changes. Family roles and structure, family interaction, and family support systems are the subjects of chapter 4. Parenting skills, the general topic of chapter 5, is divided into sections dealing with prenatal development, birth options, children's developmental stages, parenting techniques, learning experiences for young children, activities with children, health and safety, types of child care centers, and careers in child care. Concerning family challenges and turning points, chapter 6 focuses on coping and various challenges. Chapter 7 takes up the topic of the younger generation parenting their parents. Chapter 8 concerns community resources available  to help individuals and families. (RH)",

Calculations with data from the 17 studies produced 217 effect size measures, most of which were measures of differences in reading and mathematics achievement. Some measures of differences in social adjustment, behavior, and attitude toward school were included in the sample of studies. Results provided support for the conclusions of an earlier study revealing that research evidence consistently points to negative effects of nonpromotion and arguing that proponents of retention plans are thereby obligated to show how their retentions plans will be successful when so many other plans have failed. Whereas some studies included in the meta-analysis showed  positive outcomes of retention on academic achievement, the positive results appear to be found among middle-class, suburban, predominantly white samples and to be due to program characteristics related to the provision of individualized remedial help. It is concluded that such help can be provided through part-time pull-out programs, thereby avoiding the multi-billion dollar yearly expense of grade retention. (RH)",

(2) When is retention most effective among students who fail to meet prescribed minimum performance standards at each grade level? (3) How do students who have not attained minimum skills required at their grade level but who are promoted perform on the next level? (4) Does early identification and skill-specific intervention prevent later difficulties? Data was obtained from elementary school students whose scores in Louisiana's 1982 Grade 2 Basic Skills Testing  (BST) program indicated that they were qualified for compensatory education and who were tracked through 1983, 1984, and 1985. In 1983 promoted and retained subgroups emerged in the data, each of which was further divided on the same promoted/retained basis in 1984 and 1985. The report of results includes a summary of 1982-1985 BST attainment rates of initial 1982 qualifiers and a discussion of the effects of retention at various grade levels. Findings suggest that students have fewer difficulties attaining grade-level basic skills when they are both retained and promptly provided remediation. (RH)",

Subjects in the replication study were predominantly from lower-class, rural homes, differing from the suburban, middle-class sample of the original study. In the replication, 30 fourth-grade, 71 fifth-grade, and 80 sixth-grade students were administered the Elementary Form of the Estes Attitude Scales and the Science Research Associates battery. Also, end of year mathematics, reading, and science grades were obtained. Results of regression analyses and one-way analyses of  variance did not replicate the findings of Richards and colleagues, as far as overachievers were concerned: at every grade level extreme underachievers displayed the most negative attitudes and extreme overacheivers displayed the most positive. The discrepancy between findings of the original and those of the replication study is speculatively attributed to demographic differences in the samples. (RH)",

Sex cleavages in naturally occurring toddler peer groups were investigated by examining playmate preferences and differential initiations and responses within activity contexts and to friends. Three types of initiations and their responses were examined during the free play of 46 toddler-age children in the three Los Angeles day care centers. The three nonspecific friendly initiations, and agonistic initiations. The findings replicate the results of earlier studies suggesting that toddler-age children prefer same-sex playmates. Boys were more likely to  ignore or refuse girls' initiations when the initiations took the form of specific requests to play a game rather than a more general approach. These findings support the hypothesis that sex cleavages within very young peer groups are based on differential socialization experiences of boys and girls rather than on sex-linked behavior tendencies.

The areas of need identified for the questionnaire included establishment of organizational and administrative responsibilities, compliance with state law, and enhancement/sharing of current general/community education and special education offerings/practices.  Emphasis was placed upon potential expansion areas which would improve services beyond minimum mandated state requirements for curriculum, financing, staffing, scheduling, and transportation. Four separate color coded formats of the resulting questionnaire were administered to a total of 114 persons, representing superintendents (8), special education teachers (13), principals (16), counselors (8), elementary/secondary teachers (58), students (1), parents (2), school board members (7), and school psychologists (1).

The Committee recommended  preparation/adoption/implementation of a Native education policy which includes specific proposals on curriculum, teachers, parental and community involvement, and program development. The objectives of this policy should: enable Native children to reach their full potential and achieve parity within the public education system; ensure Native culture/history is adequately/accurately reflected in curricula; preserve Native languages/cultures; encourage Native participation in the education system; develop programs consistent with aspirations of Native communities and student needs; and support local initiatives in providing alternative programs to counteract high dropout rates.

The challenge for small school educators is to insure that the increased attention is properly directed so that small schools will endure when interest wanes. Information from large urban schools cannot be used as benchmarks to examine small rural schools, and established theories of administration cannot be applied to a small rural context. Small schools differ from large schools not only in size, but also in environment and community factors. Rural school staffing problems may  require certifying teachers for small schools, matching teacher characteristics with small school needs, and developing inservice activities. Development of curriculum materials for small rural settings must assume that small is unique, that more resources to buy more materials is not the only answer, and that students should receive quality materials designed for them and delivered in ways appropriate to the environment. Improvement of small school education includes placing responsibility for change upon the community with support from, but not dependency on, central educational agencies. (LFL)",

Questionnaires from 169 rural public elementary/secondary school teachers provided information on experience, certification, training, teaching conditions, and ways of staying up-to-date professionally. Questionnaires from 16 administrators addressed preparation for administering rural schools, teaching/administrative experience, staying professionally current, and acquisition and retention of certified teachers. Opinionnaires from 108 preservice  teachers addressed adequacy of teacher training for rural educators, students' perceptions of rural schools, number of credits earned in specialties, and professional development. The study found that: 98.2% of teachers and 75% of administrators were certified, rural educators tended not to be transient, certification requirements did not adversely affect rural educators, 43.8% of the respondents taught multigrade classes, and 54.4% of respondents felt teacher training prepared them for rural teaching.

        "description":"Based primarily on 1980 census data, the bulletin presents five sets of tables which describe changes in population which have occurred in South Dakota as a result of migration into and out of the state. Table 1 provides state of origin/destination, rank, number, and percentage data on migration into and out of South Dakota from 1975-80. Figures indicate 69,514 persons moved to the state and 90,019 moved out of the state during this period, with Minnesota being the leading state of both origin and destination. Table 2 shows the age, number, and rate of net migration for South Dakota from 1960-70 and 1970-80. For both decades, statistics indicate that the highest rate of migration occurred among 25-29 year-olds leaving the state. Table 3 contains net migration figures for South  Dakota by age and sex for 1970-80. Table 4 presents numbers and rates of population change by county from 1970-80, revealing that 13 of 66 counties experienced increases in population ranging from 1.7% to 23.7%, while the remaining 53 counties witnessed population decreases ranging from 1.5% to 28.5%. Table 5 enumerates numbers and rates of net migration by age group and sex for each South Dakota county from 1970-80. (NEC)",

        "description":"The papers in this monograph represent the collective comments of speakers at a January 1986 conference addressing emerging issues in the rural economy of the South. The opening paper suggests that prospects for rural southern economic development are tied to new business development, new agricultural products, automated traditional manufacturing, tourist and retirement development, growth industries, foreign investment, vocational education and retraining, financial services, defense spending, and foreign markets. Next, employment patterns in the nonmetropolitan South are presented and discussed. The third paper reviews the role of agriculture in the transformation of the national and southern economy since World War II and provides statistical data and tables illustrating  changes in unemployment, manufacturing, mining, farm debt-asset ratios, and land values. The remaining papers focus on four areas of concern: infrastructure and transportation, education, values and attitudes, and agriculture and the community resource base. These papers suggest the need for regional planning and collaboration; greater commitment to education, continuing education, and adult literacy; inclusion of racial and sex discrimination issues in economic development policy formation; and attention to issues such as farm/urban conflicts, land use, environmental regulation, local government finance, and changes in the price and/or availability of inputs.

        "description":"Third in a series on utilizing outdoor education methodologies to enhance the academic curriculum, the guide contains lesson plans and case studies for teaching grades 3-10 social studies. The lessons are designed to further student awareness of personal and social responsibility toward the environment through the use of outdoor experiences which may help students to understand abstract concepts and provide them with a sense of community, contrasting experiences, and opportunities to gain self-responsibility. The guide offers specific suggestions for planning, organizing, and conducting field experiences grouped by objectives, mechanics, site selection, direct involvement, followup/evaluation, problems, and tips for conducting lessons outdoors. Eighteen sample lesson plans  present topics such as people watching, value survey, map skills, exploring old farms, restoring native vegetation, seeing a city block, and energy costs. Each lesson plan states the problem, lists objectives, provides an introduction to the topic, describes procedure/activities, and lists evaluation questions. Four case studies illustrate using outdoor experiences to teach pioneer heritage, energy conservation, archaeological research, and local environmental problem-solving. Addresses for further information are given for each case study. Books, curriculum guides, periodicals, and organization names and addresses are given in a 69-item bibliography. (LFL)",

        "description":"Questionnaires completed by 374 teachers were used to determine differences in the instructional and noninstructional responsibilities of elementary teachers in very small, small, and medium school districts in Montana. Questions about instructional duties related to number of courses and grade levels taught, pupil/teacher ratio, teacher role in curriculum development, availability of specialists and administrative supervision, and clock hours spent in teaching and in-service training. Questions about noninstructional duties related to supervision of students and various administrative tasks. Data were analyzed using gamma to measure the association between school district size and the duty performed and were further analyzed to determine the duties performed more often by  teachers in very small school districts as compared to teachers in small school districts. A comparison of duties of teachers in small and medium school districts was also made. Teachers in very small school districts were found to perform more instructional and noninstructional duties than either small or medium district teachers. Likewise, teachers in small districts performed more of the duties than teachers in medium districts. The majority of the differences were accountable between the duties reported to be performed by teachers in the very small and small districts. (JHZ)",

        "description":"A 1983 survey of Texas homebuyers reveals a high degree of mismatch between the preferred and actual residence of homebuyers. Such mismatch is examined using social/psychological, life-cycle, racial, socioeconomic, and occupational factors as possible explanations. Questionnaires mailed to a stratified random sample of 960 homebuyers across 12 geographical areas of the state yielded 432 usable responses. Their analysis indicates that the logic of fulfilling residential preference is largely determined by the types of areas in which one prefers to live, neighborhood satisfaction, and the age of homebuyers. Preferred and actual residence mismatch is most common among homebuyers who prefer a suburban location, less so for people who prefer nonmetropolitan residences, and is lowest  among people who prefer to live in central cities. The psychological argument that people tend to modify their preference in congruence with their neighborhood living experience is also supported; the proportion of fulfilled persons is highest among those who are highly satisfied with their current neighborhood. Finally, younger persons suffer a higher degree of residence mismatch than older persons. Such findings corroborate theoretical arguments advanced by students of population mobility. Some possible reasons are suggested to explain the failure to find evidence to support racial and socioeconomic arguments. (Author/NEC)",

Data from census reports and 374 usable responses to a questionnaire mailed to a random sample of property owners drawn from 1982 county tax assessment rolls were used to test competing hypotheses about rural development consequences: economic infusion (or positive economic impact); economic overload (or negative impact on unemployment and increased competition for jobs); and a contingent eclectic model in which the balance of positive/negative impacts differ depending on the socioeconomic composition of the reverse migration stream and the receiving region. Data indicated that population growth in the region was associated with substantial increases  in unemployment compared with the statewide average. Findings supported elements of all hypotheses. The major finding that blue collar persons (both newcomers and long-term residents) experienced higher unemployment rates than white collar persons provided greatest support for the contingent eclectic model. To the extent that retirees (44% of sample) stimulated demand for goods and services, without increasing competition in labor markets, partial support was found for the economic infusion theory. For white collar strata, economic infusion was supported; for blue collar strata, economic overload theory was supported. References and tables are appended. (Author/NEC)",

Four off-campus, experience-based learning modules are explained: (1) stress/challenge courses adapted from Outward Bound; (2) service learning courses based on the work of the National Commission of Resources for Youth and the National Student Volunteer Program; (3) adventure learning courses combining active experiences with traditional subject areas; and (4) community based learning that combines  intensive study of one topic area while interacting in the community. The overall treatment program is illustrated through the example of a fictitious student named Rich whose experiences are used to demonstrate the integration of academic and vocational skills with experiential learning. The final part of the paper reports preliminary findings of the project evaluation, which show significant changes in both drug use and legal involvement following the treatment program. Pre- and post-treatment results are discussed for frequency of drug use, number of arrests, interpersonal maturity, family roles, self-esteem, and school problems.

        "description":"Researchers explored farm women's economic contributions to the family farm--an economic contribution traditionally underestimated or ignored--employing use value production as an indicator of labor. Active labor, usually defined as commodity production, was broadened to include value production, or all activity contributing to making a living. Household and farm task performance was measured (controlling for time of season and size and type of operation), comparataive labor inputs were investigated, and off-farm employment motives and earnings were explored. Questionnaires returned in 1983 by 88 farm families in the eastern half of North Dakota provided data. Women were found to contribute more labor to farm tasks in the fall, on smaller farms, and on livestock farms,  contributing at least 40 hours a week on the average to farm tasks. Women also performed 80% of the household tasks which consumed 80 hours a week on the average. Nearly one in three women reported off-farm employment; non-farm expenses and maintaining their careers were major reasons given. Distance and lack of available employment were found to pose the most difficulties for farm women in off-farm employment. Tables and figures present survey data by farm size and type and illustrate off-farm employment; an appendix lists farm and household tasks used in the survey. A short list of references concludes the document. (LFL)",

        "description":"With much to offer rural girls as well as much to learn from them, Girl Scouting is trying to reach more girls and adults in rural areas. The challenges include economic setbacks for farming, unemployment, isolated populations, and changing rural culture. Along with the challenges are the many resources of rural areas and the congruence between Girl Scout beliefs and principles and the outlooks of persons in rural areas. To expand rural Girl Scouting it has been helpful to recruit and train indigenous leadership and to establish support systems to meet local needs. The variety of innovative Girl Scout models for rural areas has included establishment of consolidated schools committees, community troop committees, hot line leaders, neighborhood learning centers, and library  resource centers. Alternative models focus on meeting patterns, including designs for Girl Scout range/farm troops and Girl Scout troops where the program is delivered through the mail. Programs for rural areas include those focused on health and safety, the out-of-doors, and opportunities for the rural girl within and beyond her local area. Girl Scouting is committed to addressing the needs of rural girls and to collaboration with related groups such as the Rural Education Association. (JHZ)",

Four essential steps appear necessary for forming a rural school cluster: identification of similar sized schools within reasonable driving distance of each other, commitment of technical expertise from neighboring higher educational institutions, contact with key persons in the state's educational agency, and development of an agenda for the cluster by participating districts. Clustering is a strategy that can be implemented in a wide variety of settings and that can address a  range of diverse needs. A 5-district Colorado cluster is improving rural science instruction through inservice training, adoption of a common philosophy of science teaching, and sharing of successful classroom strategies. A Kansas consortium is conducting professional development seminars on challenging gifted students, &quot;effective schools research,&quot; and teacher evaluation. Three Missouri rural cooperatives are focusing on staff training in instructional and administrataive microcomputer use. Nebraska schools are participating in a joint K-12 curriculum development program. North Dakota cluster activity is exploring the role of rural schools in community and economic development. (NEC)",

        "description":"A research strategy is presented which enables the development of science and mathematics curriculums for American Indian and Alaska Native children of diverse cultures based on existing subsistence knowledge and skills. This strategy assumes that American Indian and Alaska Native adults implicitly make use of many formal science and mathematics principles while engaging in subsistence activities, and that their children acquire a latent ability to understand these formal concepts by observing and participating in these activities. Recent studies in cross-cultural psychology and psychological anthropology are cited in support of the position that children learn complex cognitive skills based on participation in common cultural activities. Ethnographic and Piagetian research  methods are proposed for a 2-year study to assess the existing science and mathematics knowledge among the Tlingit Indians of southeast Alaska where a pilot project is now underway. Discussion is limited to an analysis of the ways of researching indigenous physics knowledge. However, the research design can be adapted to any cultural group and be utilized to develop procedures for teaching the formal aspects of any subset of Western physical science or mathematics knowledge in classroom situations.

Validation data collected from a total sample of 499 students and 20 instructors supported each scale's internal consistency,  reliability and discriminant validity. Potentially useful applications of the instrument for research purposes and for improving teaching in higher education are considered. (A copy of CUCEI is included in an appendix.) (Author/JN)",

Although the WES was designed for use in any work milieu, its 10 dimensions of work environment (involvement, peer cohesion, staff support, autonomy, task orientation, work pressure, clarity, control, innovation, and physical comfort) seem well suited to describing salient features of the teacher's school environment. The second part of the paper considers the validity of the WES when used for the first time specifically with school teachers. For example, administration of a slightly reworded version to 114 science teachers in 35 high schools revealed KR-20 reliability coefficients ranging from 0.60 to 0.85. The WES has now been  cross-validated with larger samples of elementary and high school teachers responding to both an actual form (N=599) and a preferred form (N=543). Data analyses attest to the internal consistency, reliability and discriminant validity of both WES forms. The third part of the paper considers applications of the WES in science education and, in particular, presents profiles depicting interesting differences in the environments of elementary schools and high schools. For example, high school teachers (compared to elementary teachers) characterized their school environments as involving less work pressure. (Author/JN)",

These six areas are: (1) nature of science and science education; (2) nature of the reading process (outlining Holliday's 10 rules for designing effective science texts); (3) nature of science text; (4) nature of the reader; (5) teachers' attitudes toward and knowledge about science reading; and (6) instructional uses and strategies related to science reading. Research needs related to each of these areas are addressed. For example, it is noted that research is needed to more clearly describe the nature of science, its influences on science education, and the role textual materials and print  processing play in science and science education. Other research needs to focus on new assessment techniques that more closely reflect the interactive-constructive reading process that critically involves both the text and the reader, on the teacher's personal attitudes toward and knowledge about science reading, and on whether the science textbook is used as the initial source of data or if it is used as an instructional supplement to reinforce and enrich concepts initiated by concrete experience, demonstration, or lecture.

The objectives were to: (1) identify areas of mathematics in which the children had recognizable strengths and weaknesses, (2) classify characteristic areas according to information-processing theory, and (3) relate the errors made by third graders in l980 with errors made by the same children as sixth graders in l983. Approximately 25,000 children in each grade were tested for each year using data from the Survey of Basic Skills in the California Assessment Program. The tests and population are first briefly discussed, followed by the results of the analyses.  For each grade level, discussion focuses on: correct performance by categories --computation, counting/number property, word problems (using operations), visual problems, geometry/measurement problems, and nontraditional story problems; the most difficult items; scores on matched items (computation and applications); and errors. Then the longitudinal analysis is dicussed. Girls appear stronger than boys in grade 3 and boys were stronger than girls in grade 6. References and sample items are included in the appendix. (MNS)",

This handbook provides a detailed and integrated basic course of study for the revised curriculum in mathematics for grades K-12. The philosophy and rationale for the entire curriculum are first discussed, followed by sections on thinking skills and on programs for exceptional children. How to use the handbook is described. Mathematics is then considered including course of study and learning outcomes. The bulk of the document expands on the goals for each grade level, with objectives and suggested measures listed by mathematical skill. Numeration, whole numbers, fractions, measurement, geometry, probability and statistics are outlined for kindergarten. Decimals  are added in grade 2; ratio, proportion, and percent and integers are added in grade 7; and real numbers and algebra are added in grade 8. For the secondary school, both non-college preparatory courses (General Mathematics, Consumer Mathematics, Technical Mathematics, and Introductory Algebra Parts I and II) and college preparatory courses (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Advanced Mathematics and Calculus) are outlined. Appendices present background information and requirements. (MNS)",

        "description":"Pretests and posttests on the topic of evolution through natural selection were administered to students in a college nonmajors' biology course. Analysis of test responses revealed that most students understood evolution as a process in which species respond to environmental conditions by changing gradually over time. Student thinking differed from accepted biological theory in that: (1) changes in traits were attributed to a need-driven adaptative process rather than a random genetic mutation and sexual recombination; (2) no role was assigned to variation within a population or differences in reproductive success; and (3) traits were seen as gradually changing in all members of population. Although students had taken an average of 1.9 years of previous biology courses,  performance on the pretest was uniformly low; there was no relationship between the amount of previous biology taken and either pretest or posttest performance. Belief in the truthfulness of evolutionary theory was also unrelated to pretest or posttest performance. Course instruction using specially designed materials was moderately successfully in improving students' understanding of the evolutionary process. (Author)",

In the status reports, gender-stereotyped career expectations and the differential treatment of women in the work force were identified as major impediments to participation in science and technology related fields. The differential treatment of women was believed to be the most serious violation of the principle of equality of opportunity. Two major intervention programs have been designed and are being monitored by the National Science Foundation (NSF). These are: (l) the &quot;Research Opportunities for  Women Scientists and Engineers&quot; (ROW) program which awards grants to women who have not previously been principal investigators on NSF grants, or who are reentering the research community after a period of absence; and (2) the &quot;Visiting Professorships for Women&quot; (VPW) program which enables the scientist to conduct advanced research at a host institution and also undertake lecturing, counseling and other activities to increase visibility and to provide encouragement for other women.

The independent variable, overt verbalization, was manipulated following the procedure used by Pereira (l973) which involved an experimenter questioning subjects during and after instruction. Instruction was carried out using semi-programmed materials developed by Frayer (l970) concerning terms and concepts related to geometric figures. The sample was 40 sixth-grade girls drawn randomly from 76 volunteers in three Wisconsin parochial schools. The results on both a terminal test and a retention test failed to indicate a significant main effect for either type of verbalization (during or after  instruction). In retrospect, a different study with a more adequate instructional program is warranted to test the hypotheses under investigation. Appendices contain the instructional materials. (Author/MNS)",

Frequencies of teacher and pupil behaviors observed in each of five classrooms during a period of three months in l980 are reported, as well as a brief discussion of results. From these data, it can be concluded that variations in allocated time are due not to differences in cognitive level of children but to difference in the actions of teachers, school policy and procedures, or grade level of instruction.

Classroom observations and examnations of student assignments related to a genetics unit were made. Factors affecting the teacher's management of the work system and the apparent consequences for student learning were explored. Particular attention was given to elements of the system that focused on higher order cognitive skills, that is, work that required application of knowledge to novel situations. Specific questions explored included: (1) how was the genetics content translated into student assignments; (2) how were assignments organized into a classroom work system and how was this system managed; and (3)  what were the consequences in terms of learning opportunities for students. A summary is provided of the work systems including consideration of the number and nature of assigned tasks, how time was allocated among classroom activities, and how tasks related to the grading system. A description of the genetics content strands is included. It was found that students experienced difficulties with the genetics content and that explicit instructions along with sufficient novel problem-solving applications appear to be essential for an accurate understanding of genetics.

The General Accounting Office (GAO) study focused on five universities that had reputed improvement in program quality. The GAO study concentrated primarily on what funding and other strategies these universities used to improve selected departments and how these departments were able to finance their improvement initiatives. Specific questions examined were whether particular funding mechanisms played a role in helping universities improve program quality and whether two funding mechanisms, i.e., individual project grants and center grants had different effects on the performance of research. It was found that at the five universities  GAO visited, the common element in improvement was an explicit commitment from the university to improve quality through increases in internal and/or external funding and personnel changes. Initial funding was necessary for building quality, although it came from a variety of sources. An appendix contains a summary of scientists' responses to selected questions on research funding.

        "description":"This paper outlines seven assumptions about teaching conditions that best facilitate critical thinking in the undergraduate psychology curriculum; the main ideas proposed in a model of critical thinking developed by a network of psychologists across the nation; and the application of this critical thinking model to the undergraduate curriculum. Beginning with students'\"knowledge bases\" (facts, beliefs, assumptions, and values), the model is based on tension-reduction theories in which the restoration of a sense of balance is the core idea. Once critical thinking is engaged, a student is likely to go through the following identifiable stages in the resolution of discrepancy: (1) motivating factors, involving whether or not the student is alert, engaged, and willing to take risks;  (2) information-seeking skills, involving ways in which the student organizes information; (3) information-relating skills, in which students make connections between original discrepancies and other ideas, culminating in the construction of a revised, tentative, personal theory; (4) an evaluation phase, in which students purposefully examine their personal theories to determine the adequacy or sufficiency of their resolution; (5) an expressing phase in which students put forth their new position for external feedback; and (6) the integrating phase, resulting when external feedback is supportive and students both revise their personal theories and expand their knowledge bases. Following the evaluation of the implementation of this model at Alverno College in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, insights  about the various components of the model, including remaining discrepancies are presented. A sample assignment is appended. (LH)",

        "description":"From a base in military models, computer simulation has evolved to provide a wide variety of applications in social science. General purpose simulation packages and languages such as FIRM, DYNAMO, and others have made significant contributions toward policy discussion in the social sciences and have well-documented efficacy in instructional settings compared to traditional settings. With the microcomputer revolution has come a revival of computer simulation, first in pre-collegiate education, then in a variety of other areas including urban policy, social processes, and research methodology. In spite of the significant body of research and software in social science it is striking that (1) this research and teaching tradition exists almost entirely outside the &quot;mainstream&quot; of  social science journals and textbooks, and (2) the impact of computer simulation has had a relatively greater impact on teaching than research. These findings reflect the state of the social sciences. Attempts at simulation in research-poor environments inevitably lead to models characterized by low reliability, oversimplification, and neglect of causal factors. These three obstacles are the reason why computer simulation has remained a specialized area within social science and is removed from the mainstream practice of social scientists. It is concluded that computer simulation in social science, though a positive way of accumulating knowledge, is apt to remain the step-child it has always been. Over 90 related references conclude the publication. (LH)",

Organized into two major sections, &quot;Alleged Soviet Distortions&quot; and &quot;Alleged USA Distortions,&quot; examples of major distortions and factual errors presented in U.S. and Soviet textbooks are given. For example, Soviet textbooks focus on American poverty, unemployment, inflation, crime, social inequality, racism, hedonism, and militarism; Soviet textbook reviewers hold that U.S. textbooks discredit the political system in the Soviet Union and the role of the Marxist-Leninist  ideology, and undercut the achievements of the first socialist state in the world. It is concluded that if nuclear holocaust is to be avoided and peace be maintained, textbooks in the United States and the Soviet Union need to depict each other more honestly, less aggressively, and with fewer distortions. Moreover, the U.S./USSR Textbook Study Project, a step in the right direction, needs to be revived, enlarged, and ultimately to involve and affect more teachers and students in both countries. (LH)",

In the second section, it is argued that inclusion of economics understanding in &quot;core&quot; curriculum would be too overwhelming, based on the rationale that it is only through an economics perspective that students can achieve sufficient objectivity to ensure realistic scrutiny and evaluation of  economic issues, problem experiences, and policies that confront individuals and nations.

Field research (participant observation, interviews, and surveys) and a review of the literature were employed to study the conflict resolution attempts within the co-op. Results of the study indicated the co-op conflict resolution communication attempts exemplify dominant culture attempts. The co-op presented itself as using a consensus process (formal situations) and practicing egalitarian ideals (informal situations), but  analysis found it did not consistently practice either.

Ecopolitical issues arise from human manipulation of the natural environment and include problems resulting from the limited capacity of the environment to satisfy human needs. High school courses that treat ecopolitical issues should emphasize a basic conceptual framework for understanding, interpreting, and making and judging decisions about these issues. This framework should help students to organize, interpret, and appraise information and ideas about the limits to growth debate. In addition, it should help students understand the sociopolitical context of these issues and develop a global perspective on them. Finally, students should have  opportunities to develop skills in making and evaluating decisions about ecopolitical issues. Ten propositions are clarified and justified as guides to selection and emphasis of subject matter in secondary school courses in the social studies that include ecopolitical issues. These propositions can also be used as criteria for evaluating treatment of ecopolitical issues in curriculum materials. (JP)",

These assumptions hold whether we see the community primarily as an audience, as a support system, or as a curriculum resource for education on world affairs. The concept of international system should be used to help students organize and interpret phenomena that connect local communities and world affairs. This concept can help students to understand and appraise the consequences of their actions on others, near and far, and the  effects of others' actions on them. Finally, students can learn how citizenship may be exercised similarly and differently with respect to individual and community interests that pertain to local, national, and international levels of activity. By forging local linkages with the global community, social studies educators can teach students that they are involved in the world, that the world affects their lives, and that interdependence is a fact of life. This perspective is critical if students are to understand the relationship between global interdependence and systems and their personal exercise of citizenship. If global education is to have a meaningful citizenship dimension, then the use of community based curriculum materials is essential. (JP)",

Each simulation follows a standard format emphasizing student skills of information processing, problem solving and group decision making. Students are divided into groups representing a decision-making body and pro, con, and compromise positions on a  given issue. Students research their position using provided data and library resources, ultimately using their findings to support their group's position in a simulated public or agency hearing on the subject. Each activity contains step-by-step instructions and student handouts. Each simulation takes approximately two weeks. (LP)",

        "description":"Art criticism has not been incorporated into the curriculum despite support of this proposal by major art educators. The traditional art program consists only of studio instruction to the exclusion of art criticism and art history. The studio background of most art educators coupled with the limited availability of art criticism curriculum options has perpetuated the status quo. The curriculum is a sociopolitical document which provides a lens to the subject, tempered by the dominant culture. The lack of curriculum options is a result of many factors including the weak or non-existent theoretical and research foundations of art criticism and the lack of consensus in any of the areas of art study. Art criticism formats cited include: Feldman's method consisting of analysis,  interpretation, and evaluation, and Brandy's aesthetic scanning method. Fourteen other approaches exist but have not been collected in a comprehensive compilation of formats. Theoretical and research foundations of art criticism curricula include format-model parallels and format validity. Areas requiring further investigation and research include individual differences in cognitive style, social content, and the very foundations of art criticism. Four pages of references conclude the report. (BZ)",

Motivation of band members was tested by asking them if they had ever challenged and how frequently. Additionally, they were asked if they felt that they were correctly placed in their instrument category, what they believed their performance expectancy would be in three months, their degree of satisfaction and feeling of success with their current performance level, and to what degree they enjoyed playing their instrument. Members (N=234) of three comparable size bands representing urban, suburban, and rural areas filled out an anonymous questionnaire. The results supported the hypothesis that perceived success and  satisfaction with current level of performance were related to increased numbers of challenges for higher levels and attribution for that success to internal factors. Failure and lack of satisfaction with one's current level of performance resulted in fewer challenges and external attributions. (CFR)",

The Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery featured an exhibit of Grant portraiture, which covered his life, from its humble beginnings to military and political triumphs and to failures and disappointment. The exhibit included pictures, artifacts, and momentos from various times in Grant's life. His military service and two terms as President were emphasized. Grant's changing features were portrayed in photographs, paintings, and engravings from different times in his life span. These portraits seem to show an impassive and lackluster man, a rather ordinary person with little hint of greatness. Yet Grant's seeming ordinariness was a mask for keen intelligence and uncommon military leadership ability.  His common ways appealed to masses of common men and enabled General Ulysses S. Grant to lead them to victory in the Civil War. A chronology of main events in Grant's life appears at the end of this essay. (JP)",

        "description":"General Ulysses S. Grant reflected the prevailing views of his community and times concerning social attitudes. Although opposed to slavery, he was not a strong advocate of liberties and rights for black people. Like President Lincoln, Grant at first opposed use of black troops in the Civil War. On July 17, 1862 black recruitment was approved and black military units, led by white officers, were organized. The black soldiers performed admirably in several battles. General Grant enthusiastically endorsed participation by blacks in the wartime Army, but expressed reservations about encouraging their continuation as regulars in the full-time Army. When military necessity faded, Grant's enthusiasm for black military units declined. At the end of the war, General Grant advised against  using black troops in the occupation of the defeated southland. He did support strongly passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which gave black males the right to vote. As President, Grant wavered in support of Reconstruction laws that protected the rights of black people in the former Confederate states. In this, President Grant believed he was following the will of the majority. In racial matters, Ulysses S. Grant was primarily a reflector of public opinion, not a leader of it. A chronology of main events in Grant's life is appended. (JP)",

        "description":"In the summer of 1884, Ulysses S. Grant wrote his &quot;Memoirs,&quot; which were published and promoted by the great American writer, Mark Twain, who encouraged and aided Grant in his literary work. Grant was fatally ill with cancer of the throat and raced against time to complete his manuscript. He was motivated by the desire to provide financial support for his family, which had been impoverished by his business failures. The book that emerged from Grant's courageous efforts is a masterpiece, which literary experts and historians have compared to Caeser's &quot;Commentaries.&quot;&quot;The Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant&quot; treats his childhood slightly, expands to detail his Mexican War experiences, skims over his inter-war activities, and concludes with a major emphasis on his participation in the  Civil War. Grant's clear, concise, treatment of Civil War experiences have made his book a classic of military history, which is studied in military academies throughout the world. Mark Twain's relationship to Grant is highlighted in two &quot;Sidebars&quot; that are appended to this essay. &quot;Sidebar Number One&quot; is a brief excerpt from &quot;The Private History of a Campaign That Failed&quot; by Mark Twain, in which Twain describes his fleeting encounter with Grant during the Civil War. &quot;Sidebar Number Two&quot; discusses a pamphlet titled, &quot;How to Introduce the Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant,&quot; which is addressed to salesmen of Grant's &quot;Memoirs&quot; and may have been written by Mark Twain. A chronology of main events in Grant's life is also appended. (JP)",

        "description":"A free and pluralistic society is maintained by constitutional guarantees and an educated populace. Nigeria, like other nations in West Africa, spent billions of dollars and embarked on a program of mass educational improvement in the 1960's and 1970's. While secondary school enrollment increased eleven times between 1962 and 1975, over half the candidates on the West African Examinations Council secondary test failed. This indicates a failure of the Nigerian educational policy of &quot;developmentalism,&quot; which states that centralized educational reform is the quickest and surest way to bring about modernization and an improved standard of living. While Nigerian school facilities and teacher training methods are often poor, they must not bear the full blame. Early mission schools and  traditional Islamic schools had poor facilities and ill-trained teachers, yet they succeeded in providing effective basic education. Reasons for these more recent failures include the application of factory or industrial plant improvement strategies to education and the use of utilitarian (or purely quantitative) measures of success.

        "description":"Data analyses and interpretations presented in this report were obtained from a national data set collected for \"A Study of Schooling.\" Elementary teachers (N=286) responded to a questionnaire asking them to indicate the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with 12 statements of educational beliefs concerning teacher control and student participation. A typology of educational beliefs was developed. Teacher groups were described as \"autocrats,\"\"strategists,\"\"laissez-faires,\" and \"democrats.\" Classroom process variables were selected for comparison with the four teacher belief types from perspectives representing three domains of the classroom curriculum --the instructional (teacher perspective), operational (observer perspective), and experiential (student perspective). The  investigation focused on how teacher belief types differed in the preactive behaviors (i.e., goals, intentions, decisions) and their interactive behaviors (i.e., instructional methods, grouping arrangements, use of time, classroom leadership, and affective behavior). Student perceptions were used to assess the classroom learning environment. The findings support the notion that teachers' educational beliefs have a distinct bearing on their teaching behaviors and thereby on their teaching effectiveness. Questions are raised concerning teacher beliefs and their relationship to methods of teacher selection, education, and evaluation. Implications are discussed. Ten pages of references conclude the report. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"Data collected on teacher, classroom, and school characteristics from 38 schools participating in \"A Study of Schooling\" were analyzed to determine some of the cultural variables that separate schools that are more renewing from those which are less renewing. The following constructs emerged: (1) authority and decision making structures; (2) informal organizations; (3) professionalism; (4) climate; (5) support and resources; (6) communication; (7) leadership; (8) goals; (9) roles and status; (10) rewards; (11) participation; (12) problem-solving orientation; and (13) values and beliefs. A subsample of 18 schools was selected for defining a school as \"more\" or \"less\" renewing. A cluster analyses produced three sets of variables: personal/demographic focused; school focused; and  class/curriculum focused. Discriminant analysis was used to assess the extent to which the sets of contextual variables thought to be the most important in effecting school renewal differentiated among teachers in \"more\" as compared to those in \"less\" renewing schools. Findings indicated that school-level variables, more than individual teacher characteristics, are more critical for school change. Seven pages of references conclude the report. (Author/JD)",

The fundamental focus is on the location of teacher education in the educational system, and what effect this has on teacher education programs. First considered is the organizational setting in which secondary school teachers are trained, and in what sorts of institutions the training takes place. In this area, the following questions are asked: (1) does training take place in research universities, comprehensive state colleges and universities, polytechnics, monotechnic teachers colleges, or in school-based institutions? and (2) in what sorts of units within these institutions are teachers trained--separate professional schools, departments of education within colleges of letters,  or mainstream disciplinary departments? The second dimension of location considered is the normative setting in which secondary school teachers are trained, to what extent a traditional academic ideology prevails in the institutions, and the basic units in which they are trained. Reference is made to the values and beliefs typical of academics in the mainstream college of letters and science departments: beliefs about what type of educational content and work has value, what should be taught, how students should be trained, and what students should be encouraged to do.

One group of students received the CDC curriculum, one control group received the school's present STD unit, another control group received no STD instruction. Attitudes and knowledge were chosen to be the dependent variables assessed in the project. The treatment length was five class sessions or about 250 minutes. Findings, based on pre- and post-tests and delayed tests, indicated: (1) in general, the CDC sponsored STD curriculum was effective in  changing students' STD-related attitudes; (2) the CDC curriculum increased most students' STD-related knowledge; (3) the CDC curriculum was more effective in changing belief and attitude than \"intention to act\"; (4) the CDC curriculum had less impact on the rural school than the urban and suburban schools; (5) the CDC curriculum was effective with both males and females; (6) the CDC curriculum was more effective than the schools' present STD education; and (7) participants viewed the CDC curriculum positively. The report recommends that the curriculum should be adopted by secondary schools, that it should be taught more than once in the early, middle, and upper secondary school grades, and that the STD scales, particularly the attitude scale (appended to this report), should be used for  future research.

Weaknesses have been noted in this approach, and recommendations have been made which call for a theoretical and empirical reorientation to the study of teacher socialization which considers the process of socialization and the relationship of variables within the particular context of socialization. This paper offers a critique of the functionist approach to the study of teacher socialization. An alternative theoretical and empirical orientation to teacher socialization is presented. A brief review of teacher socialization literature provides supportive documentation for a reorientation of theory and research  with an emphasis on the role and contribution of the preservice teacher in the socialization process. The design of an ethnographic study of a teacher education program is outlined and preliminary findings on this ethnographic investigation are reported. Implications of the study are discussed along with possible considerations for future teacher education programs. (JD)",

Three ethical criteria commonly used in social research--informed consent, avoidance of harm to participants, and confidentiality--are identified and applied to a particular case of educational criticism in a study conducted on teacher coping strategies. The paper argues that the conventional ethics of social research fail to provide an adequate ethical basis for the practice of educational criticism. Alternative ethical guidelines for criticism and for qualitative research in general are suggested. (CB)",

Responses indicated that four out of ten teachers are seriously considering leaving the profession; three-fourths balk at recommending teaching as a career at a time of severe teacher shortages; and almost one-fourth of the teachers moonlight to supplement their salaries. Males are scarce at all levels, especially in the elementary schools. An analysis of the data shows that males and single teachers moonlight at twice the rate of females and married teachers. Teachers are dissatisfied with the career ladder, and the most common reason for leaving is now working conditions rather than salary as found in three previous studies. Two-thirds of the teachers support  mandated negotiations with the local school board. The one bright spot in the study is the increase in teacher salaries. A sample questionnaire is included.

The developers of this conceptual framework examined  a broad range of popular, professional, and scholarly publications; consulted widely with policymakers and pracitioners; and undertook a survey of representatives of various education interest groups. The central issues that the Center should be engaged in are listed and discussed, including: (1) to attract and retain teachers; (2) to continuously enhance the competence of teachers who are recruited and who are currently in the profession in ways that increase their effectiveness; (3) to establish conditions in the workplace that facilitate the effective use of that competence; and (4) to motivate teachers to do their best and improve their practice.

The portrait of the tracking programs at the Catholic schools was not too different from that observed in public schools. Catholic schools had as many subject areas and ability grouped courses and were just as constrained in placement decisions. Catholic schools did not seem to avoid the racial differentiation endemic in  tracking. Where the organizational differences emerged was in the curriculum and quality of instruction, and a challenging learning environment was prevalent in all levels of the Catholic school tracking programs.

It defines student motivation to learn as both a generalized trait and a situation specific state, and distinguishes it from related but different motivational conceptions that have less direct bearing on issues surrounding motivating student learning in classroom situations. It then reviews research indicating that little evidence of motivation to learn is observed in most classrooms and that this may be because teachers have not been made aware of the need to stimulate such motivation to learn through systematic socializing of their students, nor have they been armed with strategies for doing so. Finally, it describes the rationale and design of an ongoing experiment on this topic  and presents the 13 strategies for stimulating student motivation to learn and 11 strategies for capitalizing on students' existing intrinsic motivation that are being recommended to teachers and that form the treatment in this experiment.

In each case the student was considered as a &quot;problem&quot; in the classroom. It is noted that teachers appear to include in their judgements of children not only such attributes of student status as academic ability socially constructed, but also such attributes as social class, race, gender, and family normality. The main aim of this research was to discover how different teachers in the primary grades learn to observe and make practical sense of what happens in their classroom from day to day. The first case study focuses on interaction between a teacher and a second grade student,  and of the subsequent shaping of that student's social and personal identities in the class. The second study is of a boy who became a social pariah in the course of his second grade experience. In the final study, the process is traced of a teacher making a decision to identify a student as in need of special education. Brief analytic discussions accompany each case study. (JD)",

The effects of various economic incentives to attract more able people into the profession and maintain them as teachers are discussed, including scholarship and loan programs, raising teacher salaries, and performance-based pay. Projections of future demand, in addition to using enrollment forecasts, must make estimates of teacher attrition and possible educational  improvements that may call for additional teachers. Problems concerning estimates of supply have to do with uncertainties regarding the makeup and quality of the current teaching pool, the number of individuals expected to enter teaching in the future, and the number that can be expected to return to teaching from the large pool of trained, but presently inactive teachers.

Although the elementary education majors showed a significant decline in PCI scores during the first stage of the field experience, PCI scores  for this group rose significantly by the end of the field experience. At any time during the field experience, secondary education majors had higher PCI scores than the elementary education majors.
