        "description":"This booklet on the metric system and its presentation in the foreign language class has three main sections: (1) background material, including a brief history of the metric system and a rationale for teaching it in the foreign language class; (2) information for the teacher; and (3) learning activities. The second section includes terminology, an explanation of the decimal nature of the metric system, a metric style guide, suggested equipment, and classmade learning aids. The third section presents some techniques for beginning to teach the metric system and a metric awareness quiz. In addition to these items, there are: learning activities for length, mass, temperature, and volume/capacity; metric games; and a post-test self-quiz. The class activities are in French, German,  and Spanish. The appendices include a list by state of metric-conversion educators and a list of some metric conversions. A bibliography completes the volume. (AMH)",

        "description":"Three hundred and forty-two students of English, engineering, and commerce in India were surveyed to obtain data on five major topics: (1) their English language background, (2) their present and planned future use of English, (3) their reasons for studying English, (4) the English skills they desired, and (5) their attitudes toward English. All groups, especially the English majors, had been encouraged by parents to study English. While all expressed a desire to have speaking as their best skill, they reported reading to be currently higher than other skills. English majors reported the highest current frequency of English use; the other two groups reported a higher increase in expected future use. The two most common reasons for studying English were for use in future work and  out of compliance with the system. All expressed a desire to be able to speak with native English speakers. Integration, however, was low on the list of motivation. All said they would try to learn English if it were not taught in the schools. English majors felt the British standard of English should be the one learned, while the other students preferred the variety of English unique to India. Finally, all said the variety unique to India was the English spoken by educated people of India. (PJM)",

        "author":["Blum-Kulka, Shoshana"],
        "description":"Adult native speakers of Hebrew, English-speaking learners of Hebrew, and an additional group of native English speakers were administered a discourse-completion test. Results indicate that to some extent speech-act realization in interlanguage benefits from the activation of a non language-specific pragmatic competence. Conformity to the conventions of use in the native or target language was not necessarily in evidence, and subjects often realized a speech act in the target language by a strategy that differed from both conventions. Learners were shown to violate social norms in the target language by deviating from the preferred speech acts of native speakers, often by choosing less direct formulations. An analysis of deviations reveals that pragmatic competence and the level  of linguistic competence interact with second language acquisition processes in determining speech-act realization in the interlanguage. This research supports the position that comparable speech act strategies across languages differ on several dimensions, such as speech act procedure, linguistic realization, potential pragmatic force, and social appropriateness rules. As a result, second language learners often fail to realize their communicative act in the target language both in terms of social appropriateness and pragmatic effectiveness. (JB)",

After the initial step of evaluating educational materials in modular learning in accounting, learning objectives for introductory level accounting were developed. The overall learning objectives for the unit were also stated in operational terms, and a subject outline was constructed to reflect the logical flow of topics and interrelationships among topics. The next step was to select units that were constructed relatively small so that the student would not attempt to cover too much material without mastering one area. Finally, learning objectives were developed for the total number of modules and stated in specific performance terms. This  course emphasized the application of bookkeeping principles along with business problems and decisions. Appended is a flow chart indicating the study/testing sequence the student will use with the self-paced learning modules. The nine modules are included. (SW)",

Background information about both student loan bond programs and student loans is presented, along with an explanation of how issuers of student loan bonds are able to accumulate surpluses. The magnitudes of the surpluses are estimated. The legislative history of the provisions making the profits possible is traced, and pending proposals to restructure the federal student loan program and the probable effect of these proposals on student loan bonds are also considered. Options for congressional consideration that would reduce the profitability of student loan bonds are examined. It is concluded that  except for the option of taking no action, each option would restrict either the profitability of student loan bonds or the uses to which states could put profits. Because each option would reduce one of the federal subsidies of student loan bonds, each would cut federal costs. The other main consideration in weighing the options is the degree to which each would decrease student loan availability. (SW)",

Among the findings are the following: increases in S/E professional employment in academe have been concentrated in recent years in doctorate-granting institutions; increased research and development funding from both  federal and nonfederal sources seems to be the principal factor responsible for recent growth in employment of academic S/E; research is being increasingly emphasized as a means of attracting support for S/E professional staff; research emphasis is influencing the types of positions offered to applicants for S/E jobs; institutions in the lower quartiles of research performance are expected to be relatively vulnerable to financial adversity resulting from high rates of inflation and demographic shifts caused by anticipated declines in the college-age population; and S/E personnel on short-term renewable research contracts, including many newly recruited women scientists, are expected to be especially vulnerable to any future reductions in force.

Basic considerations involved in cost studies include: direct and indirect costs, breaking costs down by field, allocating costs by level of instruction, relating costs per student credit hours to costs per student per quarter, and relating costs per student credit hours to the cost of degrees. Other items, such as whether to  include vocational or continuing education courses and costs, will arise depending on the type of institution being studied and the purpose of the study. Variations in local accounting methods, administrative organization, and program emphasis preclude easy comparisons of costs among institutions. Some philosophical considerations often raised concerning cost studies are noted. It is concluded that with the pressures of inflation and changing enrollment, cost studies will continue to play an increasing role in administrative decisions. (SW)",

The purpose of the guide is to sensitize administrators to the central issues involved in each regulation and to provide a desk-top reference that will permit judgments as to whether the matter should be pursued. In regard to the regulations on the protection of human subjects, institutions are directed to establish an Institutional Review Committee to determine subject risks, and noncompliance may result in termination of the federal grant or contract. The regulations pertaining to the Educational  Amendments of 1972 (prohibiting discrimination in federally-aided educational programs) include the areas of coverage, admission of students, treatment of students, employment, and procedures. In regard to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, public colleges and universities are excluded from the federal requirements and are only subject to work safety requirements if their states have approved plans. The regulations set extensive standards for programs, materials, and facilities. The purpose of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act was to eliminate widespread discrimination against blacks and other minorities. A bibliography is included. (SW)",

The target groups were high-risk students, especially representatives of minority groups from traditionally nonacademic populations. The college mounted a pilot education program (PEP) comprising three parallel but distinct packages to serve American Indians, Chicano/Latinos, and Blacks. The PEP packages, which were specifically designed to be relevant to the characteristics of the students enrolled, contained interdisciplinary modules consisting of the following components: skills development courses, subject matter courses focusing on the cultural values of each ethnic group; support seminars offering tutorial assistance and survival  information (economic, social, and educational); career planning sessions; and individual advice and counseling. In order to coordinate efforts, instructors and counselors in each of the PEP packages met weekly during the year to discuss mutual problems, policies, and procedures for the conduct of teaching and support service activities. Information is presented on evaluation of the program, student characteristics, evaluation of students by traditional measures of academic success, retention rates for PEP students, and program costs. Reports on the Chicano/Latino package and on the overall program are published separately. (SW)",

The results show that compared to other GC students, the PEP students came to the college with weaker academic skills, and had different personal characteristics. While the PEP students achieved and were retained at levels comparable to other GC students during the fall quarter, as the year progressed, they tended to perform more poorly than the students in the comparison groups. A profile of the more successful PEP students shows them to be younger, have high educational aspirations, and come from families where the father has post-high school training. Recommendations are made to continue skill  development and counseling activities for the students throughout the year, but to fully incorporate these activities into regular course offerings by altering the credit, timing, and sequencing of the courses.

The process has three major steps: (1) conducting a preplanning assessment, (2) describing the context for planning, and (3) implementing and operating the process. For each institution, background information is presented about its size, mission, and governance structure; past planning practices; and current institutional planning activities. Each  institution's current planning practices are then evaluated. The emphasis on the case study of Willamette's experience is directed to preimplementation and initial implementation activities. In addition to developing a process similar to the one described in the &quot;Handbook,&quot; LCCC integrated the planning process with management-by-objective procedures used by the college since 1973. Ohio University has a relatively complex planning process, initiated in 1976, that evolved simultaneously with the process set forth in the &quot;Handbook.&quot; Sample questionnaire progress reports, excerpts from planning documents, and other descriptive materials are appended.

It is suggested that a change in a college or university's mission may be an instrument for enabling a particular institution to meet unusual problems of declining resources. The elimination and consolidation of courses can protect against the inefficiencies of the generalized decline in the size of classes. Changes in program arrays, including the elimination or consolidation of marginal programs, are another tactic. The idea of enrollment targets was instituted whereby all institutions were told that they would not receive funding for enrollments beyond a level they defined in terms of maintaining quality instruction. The development of the Composite  Support Index to aid in fiscal targeting and enrollment reallocating procedures is noted. Special procedures that would be undertaken for institutions facing serious difficulties are outlined, as is the nature of two presidential task force studies of the University of Wisconsin-Superior and the two-year, liberal arts transfer centers.

Revision of the campus master plan set as a primary goal the development of a new and comprehensive general education program. An administrative reorganization reduced the faculties from five to two by combining humanities, social science, and science and mathematics into a single faculty of Arts and Science and by joining professional and general studies. The reorganization also extended to the central  administration of the college. A new model forecasts enrollments by academic program, and a five-year plan forecasts both enrollments and staffing levels for current and projected academic programs.

All findings are confounded by effects that may be due to either CAI or CMI in comparison to conventional instruction, or to the revisions in course materials needed to modify a course from conventional to computer-based instruction. Analysis of these data indicate that, while CAI and CMI save about 30 percent (median) of the time required by students to complete the same courses given by conventional instruction, student attrition appears to increase with CAI or CMI as compared to conventional instruction; changes in student quality  may account for this increase. It was concluded that students prefer CAI or CMI to conventional instruction, attitudes of instructors are unfavorable to CAI and CMI, individualized instruction (without computer support) saves student time, and little additional student time is saved when the same courses are given by CAI or CMI. Cost savings attributed to CAI and CMI are based on estimates of pay and allowances of students for time saved by these methods. (Author/MER)",

        "description":"An examination of task analysis from several perspectives in order to identify some of its purposes and advantages reveals that, as the interest in learning theory has shifted from a predominately behavioral perspective to a more cognitive orientation, the purpose of task analysis has also shifted. Formerly the purpose of task analysis was to aid in instructional design by identifying and classifying component behaviors which could accumulate into a terminal performance. However, cognitive and information processing theorists have not been so interested in the component behaviors as in the cognitive activity that occurs between these behaviors. Thus the emphasis on task analysis has shifted from behavioral outcomes to the analysis of cognitive processes. Three cognitive  approaches to task analysis are (1) the optimal content structure approach, (2) the learner-content match approach, and (3) the optimal content presentation approach. Although task analysis has been approached from several perspectives, there is agreement among all the theorists on at least one point: Task analysis, at a minimum, assists the instructor or designer to understand the content to be taught. This alone is a sufficient reason for recommending task analysis. (Author/LLS)",

To test this model, participants were randomly assigned to groups of high or low formal structure for four weekly sessions to assess the performance of group behaviors, \"ownership\" of group functioning, and group cohesion. The results show that the processes of group development in mutual-aid groups parallel those in therapy groups. Formal  structuring by the group leader can have both positive and negative effects, and must be used judiciously.

        "description":"Title IX has significant implications for overcoming generations of inequality in the educational opportunities that have been afforded to females. The sex-desegregation of industrial arts and home economics was examined to measure the impact of Title IX on the occupational potential of seventh-grade girls and boys. In the experimental condition, 60 girls and 80 boys in one school were required to take six coed modular units: metal, wood/drafting, electric, graphic arts, cooking and sewing. In the comparison condition, the girls (N=56) took a semester of cooking and a semester of sewing, while the boys (N=63) took a four-quarter sequence of shops. While experimental girls felt more competent than comparison girls in traditionally male domains and perceived fewer differences  between men and women at the beginning and end of the year, the differences between the experimental and comparison girls' scores at the end of the year could be almost entirely accounted for in test results at the beginning of the year. Teachers interacted more with boys than with girls in the coed modules and manifested sex-role stereotyped attitudes. Parents' occupational expectations were strongly based in sex-role stereotyping and were strongly associated with their children's own assessments. Thus, sex-desegregation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for promoting girls' occupational potential. Sex-stereotyped expectations on the part of students, parents, and teachers all need to be dealt with to overcome the cultural forces that continue to place limits on women's  occupational attainment.

The poor post-prison employment experiences of ex-offenders was investigated to determine whether their problems arose from being inexperienced low-skilled workers or from being ex-offenders. The sample was drawn from the Baltimore Life Insurance for Ex-Prisoners experiment, specifically males who had low financial resources, were repeat offenders, had no known history of alcohol or narcotic abuse, and had not been on work release for more than three months. Analyses of demographic data and employment patterns for one year following release from prison found a significant amount of covariance between experimental measures, making the isolation of the separate effects formidable. Previous employment  experience was found to affect post-prison employment, but exhibited a weaker effect than experiences after prison. Criminal history was found to have a weak effect on post-prison performance. More recent unemployment consistently led to higher joblessness after prison. The finding that post-prison experiences were the most important determinates of employment success suggests that in-prison manpower programs may prove ineffective if the net result is continued confinement of inmates.

Academic achievement was significantly related to locus of control only for normal adolescents, while intelligence test scores were significantly related to locus of control for both normal and delinquent groups, suggesting that locus of control is a function of intelligence rather than achievement.

Only children exhibited a stronger internal locus of control and scored higher on the self-centeredness item than other groups. No relationship was found between sibling status and loneliness. In terms of achievement, first- and middle-borns  scored more competitively than last-borns. Only and first-borns had higher aspirations than later-borns.

An overview is given of financial assistance that has been made available through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 to assist educators working with school dropouts. Two different pilot projects were set up to develop innovative educational programs in target schools that would encourage potential dropouts to stay in school and increase their capacity to be productive citizens upon graduation from high school. The programs deal with a broad range of topics, including career exploration, improvement of overall attitude of  potential dropouts, and involvement of parents of dropout prone students. Brief descriptions of Dropout Prevention Projects funded in nine states are provided. Conclusions from study data indicate that these programs were instrumental in reducing the number of school dropouts in the target schools by 52%. (Author)",

The subjects were 161 sixth grade students from a middle class suburban Long Island, New York, public school district, classified as high-, average-, or low-achieving readers. Two passages were selected from a sixth grade social studies text, from which three key words were chosen as memory probes for free association. Twenty multiple choice questions were prepared for each passage as comprehension criteria. The subjects were divided into four experimental conditions, with different combinations of free association, PReP, motivation,  distractor, text, and questioning activities. Findings indicated that the PReP activity significantly raised the prior knowledge level, and may also have had some generalized effect on comprehension.

Many of the prereading strategies currently used to assist reading comprehension do not help teachers identify what students already know about a topic. In an effort to integrate instructional assessment with prereading instruction, the Pre-Reading Plan (PReP) was designed. PReP is a three-step procedure for teachers to use before assigning textbook readings. In the first phase, a key word or concept is given, and students tell what ideas freely come to mind. In the second phase, students are asked what made them think of their first responses. They listen to each other's explanations and interact. Phase three allows students to verbalize associations that have been  elaborated or changed through the previous discussion. During phases one and three, three levels of prior knowledge are visible: much, some, and little prior knowledge. Based on responses during phase three, the teacher will be able to judge whether the students' concepts are sufficiently close to those presented in the text to permit comprehension and learning of the material.

        "description":"Two teachers from very diverse backgrounds combined their resources in the College of Public and Community Service at the University of Massachusetts to set up an adult literacy program. Based on the assumptions that instruction should be based on the needs of the learners, that reading is a cognitive rather than a mechanical process, and that reading is inseparable from other linguistic processes, they experimented with different forms of literacy instruction. The first form was an adjunct course that complemented a content course, in which most of the students were human service workers with inadequate communication skills for their jobs. A later model was developed by the students themselves. Their planning the program, deciding on the texts they needed and wanted, and using  faculty as facilitators gave them competence and confidence. The texts in this and later models were regulations, manuals, handbooks, reports, and technical textbooks required by the students' jobs. Unlike traditional texts in reading programs, the content is perceived by the learner as vitally important, while at the same time being both familiar and immediately applicable to his or her needs. It is material that enables the learner to change his or her life in some recognizable way--feeling more competent, gaining skills for job advancement, and becoming more in control of the work environment.

In the area of children and texts, research focused on how children learn from texts, and the resulting data suggest that children can and do teach themselves to read, learning from their mistakes. The complexity of the classroom environment and the effects of stressful situations were factors in research on teacher involvement in learning to read. The high proportion of non-European students with reading difficulties in New Zealand was the subject of research on language and cultural influences on learning to read. Research in the area of reading programs designed to intervene in the learning process varied from the effects of progress rewards in reading  to massive book experiences to parent training. Field research on approaches to teaching reading has been very limited in New Zealand, but there has been considerable effort in survey testing. These data indicate that the reading achievement of New Zealand students ranks highly in comparison with that of other developed nations. There is a need, however, for a radical reassessment of evaluation procedures and objectives. Although some very good reading research has been done in New Zealand, there are gaps at the secondary and preschool levels and in the area of adult reading. (HTH)",

In each experiment, discourse context reduced identification latencies for less skilled as well as skilled readers. This was true both when context was heard and when it was read. The general relationship between word predictability and latency was the same for skilled readers and for less skilled readers, but only less skilled readers' identification latencies were affected by word length and word frequency when the word appeared in context. When subjects predicted the word before identifying it, correctly predicted words were identified more quickly than words not predicted correctly, and skilled readers were more accurate in  prediction than were less skilled readers. The results suggest that the use of context in identifying words is not a major source of reading difficulty. (Author/MKM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted that used three formats for spelling practice, two multiple-choice or recognition conditions based on the Simon model and one production or recall condition. (The Simon generate-and-test model of spelling suggests that spellings can be learned from reading or visual exposure to the correct spelling.) The multiple-choice formats contained distractors that were either plausible graphemic variations of the target word or misspellings of different words. Fifth and sixth grade students learned 15 words whose spellings they had missed on a pretest in a small group instructional setting in which words had been practiced for either three or six trials. Students were blocked into high and low ability groups and the effects of variations in training, degree of  learning, and ability were assessed on an immediate and delayed generate-and-test measure and on a delayed recognition test. Results showed that all training groups learned more spelling than did the control group. However, the recall condition was superior to each recognition condition on each test. High ability students outperformed low ability students on all three tests. (Author/MKM)",

        "description":"Four experiments involving 54 adults were performed to examine the relationship between the effects of story grammar categories and content centrality on subjects' importance ratings, summaries, immediate recall, and delayed recall. Results of the studies indicated that central content units were judged as more important and were better recalled over time than noncentral content units. Central content was also found to enhance the salience of identical statements contained in internal response and reaction categories and to account for a large portion of the overall story category effect in each experiment, suggesting that the effects of centrality on story content exist independently of the story category in which it is contained. However, reliable story category effects  remained after centrality was partialed out in an analysis of covariance, suggesting that the effects of story categories also exist independently of the centrality of the content. These results suggest that both data-driven processing assumed by content centrality and schema-driven processing assumed by story grammars occur during story comprehension. (Author/MKM)",

        "description":"Much of the current research in reading processes has been aided by movements in experimental psychology known as information processing psychology, cognitive psychology, and cognitive science. The information processing movement has contributed three important ideas: (1) Logogen theory of a cognitive response unit that is sensitive to the set of auditory, visual, and semantic features associated with a given word; (2) the idea of a limit on the amount of conscious mental processing in which a person can engage at one time; and (3) the cascade theory, which holds that there are two or more levels of processing that have several properties, each operating continuously on outputs at the next lower level. Separately, a methodology has developed of trying to understand acquisition of  a skill by studying differences between people of greater or lesser expertise. The newly emerging cognitive science movement has contributed ideas derived from the work on speech understanding and the distinction between event-driven and goal-driven (bottom up versus top down) processing.

A binary topic-comment structure is assigned to each FSP sentence. For most English sentences, the topic is associated with the subject or the left-most noun phrase, and the comment is associated with the predicate phrase or carries particular stress. Eight experiments were conducted to determine whether an English discourse that is consistent with FSP has cognitive advantages over one with the same content but contradictory to FSP. The results indicated that subjects added new information to an anchor of old information in memory. If composition teachers taught both the principles of FSP and the ways in  which their students could reconcile these principles with English syntax, it would enable the teacher to discuss cohesion of paragraphs and larger stretches of discourse with terms that are much more explicit than many of those used now and also improve upon the students' writing. Preliminary studies also indicate that FSP may increase enable the reading comprehension. (HOD)",

There has been little evidence, however, to prove that students are writing more poorly than comparable students wrote 20 or 40 years ago. Teachers can hardly assert this decline until the question of a definition of ability to write at the college level is resolved. As to the second complaint, the subject matter of composition is language--students' effective use of language, not  grammar or literature. Finally, the rhetorical tradition is 2,500 years old. Works by both historical and contemporary scholars have contributed much understanding of how people learn to write and why they do not. As long as faculty members believe that teaching composition is demeaning, they will continue to lose sight of their objectives and suffer a loss of professional prestige. The respect the profession deserves can be restored by changing these attitudes and by remembering that the use of language is the foundation of all learning. (HTH)",

As a result of the new world order, courses should pull evidence and thought together to provide the learner with a balanced view of today's world in which communication is a two-way process. In order to expand the teaching of intercultural communication in the 1980s, consideration must be given to the type of student that can be taught (including the nontraditional) and the end goals for teaching intercultural communication.

The surveys seek to reflect the current conditions of the course in terms of instructional practices, staffing, administration, and course content. While these surveys are of some value, they could be much more helpful with revision in data gathering and reporting methods. At present the survey does not assure geographic, economic, or enrollment representation. Further, there appears to be no effort to balance the proportion of church, state, and privately supported institutions. The 1980 report, for example, does not report data for particular types of institutions nor is it comparable to previous studies. The  instrument has a public speaking orientation, especially as it seeks identification of the type of topics and activities that characterize the course. Attention to data gathering and detailed reporting are two necessary steps in improving the 1985 report so it may provide a more precise reflection of national tendencies (tendencies for particular types of institutions) and lay the groundwork for future comparisons.

The experiment was designed to follow an experimental group drawn carefully from the 15% of college freshmen with the lowest scores on the American College Test. The sample was carefully balanced to match both a typical statewide population and a control group that did not receive the treatment. While the complete data will not be available until the graduation of the students, after one year all the experimental students were still in school and showed improvement in grades, as well as in their writing, speaking, and reading abilities. They also experienced great  growth in personal confidence and grade expectation. As a result of the pilot program's success, two more years of larger experimental samples were funded. As the work proceeds, it becomes clear that strong training in speech communication skills, especially when organized into the first year of college, greatly improves the academic prospects of the high risk student.

In support of this argument, the paper examines several key periods in United States regulatory history. It then discusses various rationales for regulation in the face of market failure or monopolization and examines the market for telefilm. Focusing on the market for television programs, it argues that American telefilm exporters, primarily members of the Motion Picture Export Association, act as discriminating monopolists and, through their ability to manage demand by setting standards and prices, maintain their domination of the world market.  Using published estimates of program costs, population, and television set ownership statistics for 73 nations, the paper offers an analysis showing how the relationship between costs and set ownership lends support to the monopoly view. Contrary to the expectations of scale economies, the data suggest that as the number of television sets per capita increases, the cost of programs for those sets increases as well. (Author/FL)",

The rationale is presented around five themes: (1) the relationship between communication and law from antiquity to the establishment of the modern law school; (2) the nature and criticism of the case approach to teaching law; (3) a description of lawyering skills and a justification to include practical skills as one dimension of law school education; (4) the nature of skills training in law school today; and (5) how communication education can assist legal education in the further development of teaching lawyering skills. Among the recommendations proposed are the need  for joint research between interpersonal communication theory, public communication theory, and argumentation theory to the practice of law; the need for the communications faculty to learn more about law; the need to adapt undergraduate instruction in speech communication to the interest of prelaw students; and the need for law schools to learn what constitutes a speech communication major.

The book is designed to provide educators and researchers with guidelines for future work on oral language assessment and on curriculum development. The first section of the book provides a general discussion of oracy in theory and practice, specifically dealing with the nature and significance of oracy and the place of oracy in Australian schools. The second section reports the findings of a study that investigated what teachers were doing in the development of oracy abilities in their students. The third section discusses the oracy assessment program developed and carried out in Australian schools  in 1978, including the program's test development and administration, the student samples, listening test and speaking test results, student performance on two specific speaking tasks, the performance of two different student groups, and the identification and assessment of listening tasks.

The first study examined student perceptions of college professors' ideal traits to ascertain possible influences of sex role stereotyping. A total of 184 students participated in a three-stage process of selecting the ideal traits. Only slight differences on openness and nurturing traits were found, indicating that students seemed to be more concerned with the role of the professor than the sex of the person occupying the role. The second study investigated the terms of address that 72 college students used with their professors in public and private contexts. Few contextual differences were found; however, female professors, especially those in the  26-33 age group, were addressed by first name more often than their male colleagues. The discussion pointed to possible student perceptions of more equal status with female professors than with male professors. (Author/RL)",

Latino encounters with media systems have generally taken place on three levels: Anglo media, Spanish language media, and bilingual/bicultural media. The English language or Anglo media have portrayed the Latino with negative stereotypes and reported Latino news events and culture with white middle class bias. Latinos are underrepresented in employment by these industries. Spanish language media, particularly newspapers, have a long history dating back to 1808. Spanish language broadcasting experienced growth during the 1970s, but most radio and television broadcasting stations are owned and managed by Anglos, staffed by Latin Americans rather than local  Latinos, and depend heavily on imported programs produced and aired in Latin America. Bilingual/bicultural media are directed at the Latino audience in English or a combination of Spanish and English, and this format is becoming more apparent in traditional media. Given the current and projected growth of the Latino population, it is clear that it will continue to have an impact on existing and developing media. (HTH)",

America's cultural makeup provides for the development of controversy whenever such issues as sex, religion, politics, and economics are raised, and particularly when they are raised in the school environment. School administrators, teachers, and boards of education can take a number of actions when confronted with challenges to academic freedom. Most useful, of course, is the formation of an adequate policy on public objections to the curriculum before the objections occur. Other actions include adopting well-advertised procedures for textbook selection; finding adequate academic justification for selection of controversial books; preparing in advance for the  defense of potentially controversial new materials; providing for alternative materials or programs for children of parents who raise objections; building an adequate internal communications network to provide for rapid response to complaints; and being aware of the reactions in other communities to materials selected for use.

Developmentally, appraisal is seen as a diagnostic, relatively non-judgmental system by which educational administrators gather data about their professional performance and growth. Evaluatively, appraisal is seen as a data gathering system by which the organization can make necessarily judgmental decisions about its educational leadership personnel. While both development and evaluation use teacher assessments of the administrator as a foundation, the two procedures are distinct and proceed independently. The development process, which remains confidential, begins with the administrator assessing the teacher data. The administrator  initiates an external observation of himself or herself by two trained individuals. The observation is followed by a developmental conference designed to create a personal program for professional growth. The evaluation process involves an assessment of the teacher data by a supervisor who initiates evaluation. Two trained individuals observe the administrator's performance, leading to an evaluation conference which offers recommendations and recognition. Implementation of systemic appraisal involves five steps: (1) decide to implement the system; (2) develop a consensus definition of performance; (3) train system participants; (4) field test the system; (5) evaluate the field test results.

The role of the school board in collective bargaining and the chief negotiator's responsibilities are explained. Reasons are given for having neither the superintendent nor board members negotiate. Some general rules for effective employment relations communication are given along with specific suggestions for school district communication with the community,  district staff, management employees, and nonmanagement employees.

These skills are not necessary when there is a competent administrator and a competent evaluator who uses his or her skills within the context of a harmonious relationship with the school staff. However, the rarity of such a relationship, coupled with growing state demands for evaluation of categorically funded programs, indicates that today's principal needs to have some knowledge of the field of evaluation. There are a minimum of ten basic areas that the administrator should have a detailed knowledge of: evaluation design, needs assessment, goal setting, objectives, sampling techniques, philosophy of evaluation, student progress, testing, computer printouts, and record  keeping. In addition to the desirability of a harmonious working relationship between evaluator and administrator, public schools would profit from those in decision-making positions having some certification that would document their ability to relate effectively on evaluation issues.

The study was limited by the lack of suitable data on teachers' salaries over an extended period of time. The data studied break down of teacher salaries by year, educational level, and sex. The author shows a series of fluctuations in relative salaries that leave secondary school teachers in 1975 at the same level as they had enjoyed in 1951 and elementary teachers at the level of 1957-58. On the other hand, median salaries are shown to have exceeded the rise in cost of living. The effect of supply and demand in the teacher work force is also demonstrated to affect teacher salaries.  Statistics on previous periods of declining enrollment indicate a very slight drop in the total number of teachers and a slight decline in salaries, followed by significant increases when teacher demand increased.

Conditions-of-employment clauses are analyzed according to their effect upon staffing needs and staffing flexibility. Such conditions include stipulation of pupil teacher ratio, class size, instructional load, leave provisions, and the flexibility with which school boards can respond to declining staff needs. Considering the declining enrollment, the author discusses the various options open to school boards in reducing the number of teachers and describes the policies most frequently followed. He perceives future bargaining as  being influenced by such factors as the lifting of wage and price controls, teachers' efforts to regain public support, the economic situation in Canada, and the activities of the Education Relations Commission. He expects teacher gains to be modest and increases in per-pupil education costs to be small. (Author/WD)",

        "description":"By comparing a large and small school board in Ontario, this paper, in part 1, seeks to draw conclusions about the effects of declining enrollment on administrative functions and labor-intensiveness and, in part 2, analyzes educators' views on curriculum services and quality programs using the Delphi technique. The data for part 1, derived from management information system studies, indicate that, on a per-pupil basis, the large board does not seem more labor-intensive except in curriculum studies. However, the large board appears to engage in more inefficient processes because of the formal accountability procedures required in a larger staff. In part 2, the author finds that in the small district the curriculum services provided by the central administration are more important  to the board than to the classroom teacher, but in the large district usefulness to the board and the classroom teacher is comparable. From data gathered on educators' views of quality education, the author concludes that the majority of educators rate primary level objectives in the highest category. Flowcharts, questionnaires, and analyses are included. (Author/WD)",

        "description":"Based on a sample of 12 representative school boards in Ontario, a normative method of analysis was utilized in addressing the major concerns of the study: the appropriate number of noncertified staff for a given school board, future demand for and supply of noncertified staff, and the resultant implications of such information. The study concludes that current staffing patterns in Ontario are reasonable, reflecting a growing equalization of services among boards. The researchers project a decline in demand for noncertified staff that is proportionate to the decline in enrollment but argue that noncertified staff form an important part of the school community and should be retained where possible, as an alternative to contracting out for services. Recommendations include that the  weighting factor for declining enrollments be reintroduced, that changes in the grant allocation formula be announced one year in advance, that revenue wealth be distributed according to need, and that agreements with noncertified staff be negotiated on a regional basis and include pension benefits for part-time employees.

The supervisory personnel in the sample identified six factors in curriculum planning that would be influenced by declining enrollment: teachers, line administrators, curriculum support staff, school facilities and organization, capital expenditures, and processes for curriculum development. The changes in these factors would in turn affect objectives, instructional strategies, and curriculum materials. Shrinking schools, nonspecialized staffing patterns, multilevel groupings, loss of professional development opportunities for teachers, job insecurity, advanced mean age of teaching staff, and reduction in  instructional materials would affect classroom interaction and curriculum implementation negatively. The authors recommend several ways to stimulate professional and curriculum development and offer ideas on organizational arrangements. (Author/WD)",

Effectiveness may be determined by high achievement on standardized tests; low rates of violence, vandalism, delinquency, and behavior problems; and high attendence. Indicators of effectiveness encompass two levels, classroom and school. Schools that are effective spend more time on task and have a principal who supports an academic focus. Research indicates that a school's social processes (consensus building, modeling, and feedback) determine whether a school will perform above expectations. When students perceived the results of faculty-administration consensus on academics and discipline to be fair, firm, and consistent, school outcomes were better than expected. The dominant  model in the school is the principal, his or her behavior will influence students. Consistent feedback which recognizes and supports success is also a significant factor in school effectiveness. The findings further suggest that two fundamental beliefs are correlated with student achievement: student belief that their actions will affect their future, and teacher belief that each child can succeed.

Using cross-section wage regressions and wage change regressions, the study shows that the union-nonunion wage differential has increased rapidly in the 1970s. Regression techniques also reveal that teachers are at least as responsive to wage differentials as other workers, although differentials between teaching and alternative jobs affect educators more than differentials between teaching jobs. The study predicts a modest decline in teacher demand into the mid-to-late 1980s, followed by a modest gain. Over a period of time, demand is  found to be fairly insensitive to real wage trends.

A two-state faculty flow model that represents both tenured and nontenured faculty is utilized and applied to elementary and secondary educators. In considering this group of educators, the importance of rank and tenure is reduced and that of turnover greatly increased. The simulation model makes possible projections on the future composition of a faculty according to demographic and  experiential variables.

The propositions tested include whether educators are responsive to wage differentials between their teaching jobs and alternative occupations, as well as within the educator labor market, and whether these wage differentials tend to be eroded over time. The researchers conclude that educators are at least as responsive to wage differentials as other workers, but are not as responsive to differentials in teaching jobs as to those between teaching and other occupations. Wage differentials are generally found to erode over time; however, positive wage differentials tend to be liquidated more readily than negative differentials.

The second chapter summarizes two National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA) surveys of practices that had some relationship to the Catholic dimension of the school, ranging from religious instruction, to faculty, student, and parent interaction.

The general and comprehensive nature of the responsibility of a pastoral council makes it virtually imperative that there be a division of responsibility and labor between the generalist body, the pastoral council, and a specialist but subsidiary body, the board of education. The essential responsibility and task of a pastoral council, diocesan or parochial, is to give direction to all programs serving pastoral need, to authorize and generally empower such programs, and to  demand accountability from them. Any attempt on the part of a pastoral council, however, to exercise control in terms of such particular functions as defining program objectives, selecting policies relating to the program, or monitoring programs (not to mention administering them) represents an inappropriate and unnecessary kind of control.

It begins with a discussion of the usefulness of a &quot;case vignette&quot; approach to training and then presents 21 case vignettes illustrating important issues emerging from the case studies. The purpose of these case vignettes is to emphasize the need for understandings, skills, and the resolution of certain issues by highlighting key events likely to occur in the early years of a project. Discussion questions and a diagnostic instrument to use in individual or group training sessions are included. The manual also presents a discussion of guidelines training and a selection of  suggested resources to which trainers, project staff, or principals themselves might turn for materials that can be used in training sessions.

The report covers four major areas of interest in the comparison of public and private schools: student composition within the public and private sectors, resources available in these schools, the functioning of these schools, and the outcomes for students in the schools. The data and the analyses presented in this report are from the first (1980) wave of a longitudinal study. The responses are from questionnaires completed by representative samples of approximately 58,000 students in 1,015 public and private secondary schools, as well as their respective school officials. Catholic schools, which constitute about two-thirds of the total private sector, and other  private schools are separately compared to public schools in the report. For some analyses, two additional sets of schools are included in the comparison. These are 11 high-performance private schools and a set of 12 high-performance public schools. Findings indicate that important factors in bringing about higher scholastic achievement in private and Catholic schools than in public schools are the greater academic demands and more ordered environment. The overall conclusion is made that the factual premises underlying policies that would facilitate use of private schools are much better supported on the whole than those underlying policies that would constrain their use.

Chapter I dicusses the benefits of early intervention for handicapped children and their families in terms of child, family, societal, and economic values; and analyzes existing policies regarding their effectiveness in assuring early intervention. Among conclusions drawn from the literature review and policy analysis are that early intervention has been documented as beneficial to society and the  number of handicapped preschoolers and families needing but not receiving appropriate services cannot be precisely determined at this time. Chapter II addrsses five major policy areas which influence the development of early intervention services: defining the population to be served, delineating the scope of the services to be provided, designating the service provider, determining the nature of the policy, and identifying funding and resource availability. Final recommendations are that a lead agency be established to coordinate services and develop a coordinated public awareness campaign, that the state should develop standardized data collection and grant application techniques and due process safeguards, and that the stage should enact mandatory early intervention legislation  granting universal access to services. Appended are position statements and a chart of ages of eligibility. (SBH)",

Results of correlational analyses are reported for five behavioral measures, two standardized measures, and the Developmental Sentence Scoring System. Considerable evidence was obtained for the validity of all behavioral measures except T-units as indices of achievement in written expression. Additional comparisons indicated that both educational status (LD resource program vs regular program) and grade level were  related to performance on the four validated behavioral measures. Two to 3 minute writing samples were of sufficient length to produce valid indices of written expression using the behavioral measures.

Chapter 1 presents a rationale for special programs for gifted and talented students by pointing out program benefits to the individual, to the school and teacher, and to society. Misconceptions and unspoken concerns regarding the gifted are responded to. A second chapter discusses the various organizational structures designed to meet the needs and to accommodate the characteristics of gifted and talented students. Three general categories of  structures (totally separate, semiseparated, and integrated) are reviewed, and three approaches to programing (acceleration, enrichment, and counseling) are highlighted. Chapter 3 examines three models to help teachers analyze and develop curriculum--Bloom's Taxonomy, Guilford's Structure of Intellect, and Renzulli's Enrichment Triad. Chapter 4 points out the characteristics of a successful teacher of the gifted and considers several methods for locating appropriate teachers. Chapter 5 focuses on the purposes of the program evaluation, the issues in evaluation of programs for gifted and talented students, and the concept of using a variety of approaches to program evaluation. A specific example of an evaluation is offered. A final summary chapter answers several questions program  developers might be asked when initiating a gifted/talented program and outlines 15 steps for developing a program for the gifted which parallel the preceeding questions. Supplementary materials include a glossary of administrative designs, a list of teacher preparation programs in gifted and talented education, reasons for denial of funding, a sample program, and selected references. Also provided are teacher activities which relate to program design and development. (SBH)",

The first section titled \"On Being Gifted and Talented\" looks at the concept of excellence, normal distribution, and motivation; a model for the growth of intellect, skills, and giftedness; myths regarding the nature of giftedness; and the problem with a narrow view of giftedness. Characteristics of the gifted and types of giftedness are considered in a second section. The teaching of science is discussed in terms of progress in science through the school years, scientific literacy and the gifted, science as \"serious business\" or \"play,\" competition and giftedness, the use of programs for the gifted as routes of change, and giftedness  and advance placement in science. Various components of the learning environment (such as curriculum materials) are examined. Science activities are presented in areas which include perception, awareness, and observation; fantasy; values and perception; and creativity. Activities are provided throughout the document which correspond to the various topics covered.

A chapter on parent and community support focuses on the use of parents as paraprofessionals and the expansion of existing models for delivering mental health services to minority language communities. Basic principles which guide the design of any staff training program are examined in a third chapter: characteristics of the instructional program,  characteristics of the students to be served, and the set of skills needed by instructional personnel working with the specified students in programs. One model for teacher training, the Diagnostic Special Education Personnel Preparation Program, is described. A fifth chapter considers four propositions which merit consideration in designing curriculum reflecting a multicultural multilingual society and offers descriptions of 18 bilingual special education programs including Acoma Early Intervention Project, Responsive Environment Program for Spanish American Children, and Comprehensive Hearing Impaired Reception Program.

Field test procedures included  four inservice training sessions, implementation of the PREP Program Instructional Model which consists of six major program phases (including assessment, prescription, and task step selection); and program evaluation. Results of the field implementation project were analyzed in terms of inservice training, pupil progress, and program evaluation. Among conclusions were that the teachers implement the PREP Program, that the program consultant provided valuable leadership and advice throughout the implementation period, and that the teachers agreed that the PREP Program helped them in what to teach as they stressed the value and effectiveness of the available task sequences and requested that more skills be task analyzed for inclusion in the program. Among appended materials are a schedule  of classes, inservice evaluation forms, a free play inventory, individual student profile, guidelines for program implementation, recommended equipment, a program consultant activity log, and interrating of teachers' answers on the questionnaire and interview results.

Data collection procedures included correspondence and discussion with state and local agencies and with individual facilities and parent clients; contact with parents through the school districts, regional program, and other facilities; and mailing out a 57 page survey questionnaire to over 400 families. Survey results were analyzed in terms of personal support networks and professional services, satisfaction with quality of professional services, parents' needs  and resources, and perceived adequacy of community resources. Among findings were that many needs of parents are met by family, friends, and other parents; that parents are highly satisfied with the quality of the services they are currently receiving; and that, though relatively few have personal needs for which services are not available, most perceive a need for expanded community services. Tables with statistical data are included. (SBH)",

The 4 week study involved a review of documents concerning the legal and administrative framework governing the administration of the two Acts and interviews with persons involved in their administration at the federal, state, and local levels as well as representatives of advocacy groups. After an introduction, the paper analyzes the relationships between the standards set out in Section 504 and Part B of EHA. The third part identifies the multiplicity of departments, offices, divisions, branches, and persons involved in the administration  of Section 504 and Part B of EHA at the federal, state, and local levels. The fourth part describes and analyzes the procedures for developing, issuing, compiling, and disseminating policy. The final part of the paper considers the procedures for initiating, investigating, and notifying persons and agencies of noncompliance; the relevant sanctions; and the procedures governing the use of particular sanctions under Section 504 and Part B of EHA. Among recommendations are that the Secretary of Education issue a comprehensive statement to explain the relationship between the specific standards set out in Section 504 and Part B of EHA, and that the Education Department consider developing a consolidated enforcement procedure under which joint actions may be brought by the Office of Civil  Rights and the office responsible for administering a grant program.

Diagnostic issues, including distinctions between autism and schizophrenia, the impact of family socioeconomic status, and current criteria for autism are reviewed. The importance of individualized assessment in different areas of mental functioning is stressed, and the role of short term goals for classroom and family priorities is considered. A discussion of four issues concludes the paper: the educability of autistic children,  expected gains, moral and legal requirements affecting placement and curriculum (including a review of considerations for placement in classes with other types of handicapped children), and teacher training. Among factors cited for teacher turnover are excessive paperwork, children's slow progress, and conflict with parents.

        "author":["Slobin, Mark"],
        "description":"This paper illustrates how the sociolinguistic concept of code switching applies to the use of different styles of music. The two bases for the analogy are Labov's definition of code-switching as \"moving from one consistent set of co-occurring rules to another,\" and the finding of sociolinguistics that code switching tends to be part of communicative strategy. At least two types of codes or styles seem to exist in music, diachronic and synchronic. Diachronic style pools exist in both classical and contemporary popular music. In many current sound recordings, both the past and present styles of music are incorporated in the same piece. Performers of contemporary music have to alternate styles to suite their audience. Another mode of code-switching is the superimposition of two  sets of words on the same musical score. Three types of \"ethnic code-switching\" are apparently close to the concern of sociolinguistics. These are: (1) accomodation of the music to ethnically mixed audiences; (2) accomodating a minority culture's traditions to a mainstream musical piece; and (3) musical change brought about by contact between cultures. While many questions are left untouched, it is indicated that the analogies could lead to joint exploration of musical material by both ethnomusicology and sociolinguistics. (AMH)",

        "author":["Eder, Donna"],
        "description":"This paper examines the effect of a teacher's management and turn-allocation acts on student performance during reading group lessons in a first grade classroom. The class was observed and videotaped for a year, and interviews were conducted with both teacher and students. The study focuses specifically on cases where management, turn-allocation, and academic activities are performed simultaneously by the teacher. It shows through a discourse analysis that one of the consequences of this practice is the disruption of students' reading turns. During the disruption, often another student provides the correct word to a student who had been hesitating over it. When this happens too often, the students who know fewer words have less chance of learning to read. The results of the study  suggest that it is crucial that management be minimized as much as possible because of its negative effects. They also indicate the importance of including non-verbal behavior in future research on turn taking. (AMH)",

        "author":["Baugh, John"],
        "description":"A corpus of Black English (BEV) data is re-examined with exclusive attention to the \"is\" form of the copula. This analysis differs from previous examinations in that more constraints have been introduced, and the Cedergren/Sankoff computer program for multivariant analysis has been employed. The analytic techniques that are used allow for a finer gradation of factors than is found in previous BEV copula research. This research has shown that NPs with determiners strongly favor both contraction and deletion rules, while NPs without determiners show no measurable impact on either rule. It is further demonstrated that, in the case of determiners, the variation must be attributed to grammatical forces. The adjective and locative categories, which were previously analyzed as a single  constraint, are also separated and examined individually. Structural parallels to Jamaican Creole English emerged, lending strong support to Fasold's recent stages for the development of present tense \"be\" deletion in Black English, as well as reinforcing the Creole origin hypothesis. Finally, this analysis further substantiates the diachronic potential of the Cedergren/Sankoff program and demonstrates that variable rules can effectively identify cases of linguistic stability.

        "description":"Recent studies have documented the importance of a variety of contextualization cues such as intonation, voice quality, volume, and pitch in conversation. The appropriate use of and response to them presupposes that one has certain kinds of linguistic and sociocultural knowledge. There remains, however, the question of how children acquire this knowledge. As a step toward understanding this acquisition process, this paper discusses how children among the Kaluli people in New Guinea learn about making and responding to requests based on a strategy of appeal. The particular type of interaction under study is called &quot;ade.&quot; The relationship denoted by &quot;ade&quot; is one of caring and nurturing, and is a most important one in the society. The correct use of the term &quot;ade&quot; is important in  evoking the &quot;ade&quot; relationship. The different aspects of the &quot;ade&quot; relationship in the contexts in which it is used in family interactions are examined. This examination includes ways in which children are taught to respond to requests based on appeal as well as the difficulties small children have in using the &quot;ade&quot; term appropriately. Finally a myth is presented which provides a larger ethnographic perspective to what the mother is trying to create in the relationship between her children. (AMH)",

        "description":"Anthropologists have indicated that the need to act politically and to avoid the appearance of such action is marked in egalitarian societies. The perils of confrontation in such societies often foster indirect and highly allusive speech. This paper invesitgates the relationship between direct and indirect speech in an Indo-Fijian community which presents a case of the association of oblique oratory with an egalitarian social order. Two varieties of public performance are analyzed: (1) the &quot;parbachan&quot; or religious speeches which ostensibly deal with sacred topics but which carry a second, political message as well; and (2) the &quot;panchayat,&quot; an ad hoc arbitration session organized to deal with a specific conflict in the community. Here issues, events, and individuals are discussed  openly. While there is a range of political performances in this community, the dominant mode of conflict communication is indirection. Public political messages are deeply buried in religious speeches, and individual speakers cannot be held responsible for the secondary meanings. This accords with the notion that oblique reference is characteristic of political talk among equals. (AMH)",

The gap between English-speaking and Spanish-speaking narrowed by the end of third grade.

Great use is made of dramatic techniques to motivate students and help them learn the language. It is suggested that the psychological rationale for the model's success may be due to the emotionally self-liberating effect of these dramatic techniques. The reported success of the model at several institutions is discussed and a plea is made for scientific experimentation and evaluation.

Children, like adults, make use of a principle of conventionality (each word has one or more conventional meanings) and one of contrast (the conventional meanings of every two words contrast). Like adults, children coin words to fill lexical gaps, and they do so according to certain principles that are reflected by apparent strategies: (1) one-to-one matches of meaning and form are easier to acquire than one-many or many-one matches (\"Look for word-formation devices that are words in their own right and use those in constructing new words.\"); (2) simpler forms are easier to acquire than more complex ones, where simplicity is measured by degree of change in form (\"Make as few changes as  possible in forming a new word from an old one.\"); (3) the paradigms of a language are regular in form (\"Use the same word-formation device everywhere to mark the same meaning in forming new words.\"); and (4) the most creative adult word-formation devices are the most productive, and the most available to children (\"Look for the commonest device that expresses the desired meaning and use that in constructing a new word-form.\" (JB)",

The children were found not to confuse markers, but to use either the appropriate one or none at all. The one exception to this rule, when analyzed, indicates that children grasp the distinction between person markers before they produce them in their own speech. Order of acquisition did not follow semantic predictability, nor did frequency order of person markers in adult speech consistently correlate with order of acquisition. Instead, perceptual saliency, as determined by interaction between forms of person markers and rules determining word stress and syllable boundaries, correlated significantly with acquisition  order. These findings support a model of language acquisition in which children first produce those parts of utterances that have the greatest degree of perceptual saliency (i.e., that require the least auditory processing), and then move on to the next degree.

These results reflect the fact that the young child is supported and encouraged to make demands for objects, and also instructed to share objects with younger siblings. The order of acquisition and frequency further reflects the fact that within the household, higher status persons generally issue directives of this type to lower status persons. The effectiveness of these sociocultural constraints is evident in the fact that a  semantic feature analysis predicts the reverse order of acquisition and frequency. (JB)",

A systematic approach to planning and managing service-learning programs is presented, management functions for supporting a service-learning system are identified, and ideas on implementing these support functions are presented. The following functions that are normally the responsibility of service-learning educators are covered: management functions (e.g., planning, organizing, coordinating); functions related to developing strong service projects in the community (e.g., assessing community needs, developing projects and placements, monitoring results); functions related to facilitating student learning (e.g., helping  students identify learning objectives, prepare service-learning agreements, and assess learning); support functions (e.g., recruiting, orienting, and transporting students); and office-related functions (e.g., budgeting, recordkeeping, and personnel management). Information is general enough to apply to programs of different size, complexity, and persuasion. Kinds of service-learning programs, characteristics of programs associated with academic affairs versus student affairs, and program management activities are briefly considered. A large selection of sample forms to aid in needs assessment, management, and evaluation of service-learning programs is included. A list of organizations supporting service-learning and references are also included. (SW)",

The WWISR survey was designed to identify, analyze, and compile information about campus efforts to improve student retention in higher education. Questionnaires on retention were analyzed for 947 institutions, along with 1,024 activity report forms from these schools. Multiple-action programs were found to be the most successful. Three general areas of concern are identified: (1) academic stimulations and assistance; (2) personal future building by helping student to clarify their goals and directions; (3) involvement experiences directed at students. Among the types of retention activities, for which examples are  provided, are the following: faculty awareness and development activities, career assistance programs, learning support centers and activities, expanded orientation activities, peer programs, and academic advising. Specific target groups to which action programs may be directed are high-risk and/or low academic performing students, new students, students who are undecided about majors and careers, and women and adult students. Suggestions are offered regarding administrative arrangements, agendas for action; research priorities, and programs for survey forms, and lists of positive and negative campus characteristics, potential dropout characteristics, and additional action program information.

The two IRFs used in the field test (one for nondegree- and one for degree-granting institutions) were based on an intensive analysis of actual cases in which institutional conditions, policies, and practices have proved abusive to students. The IRF items were designed to determine whether or not such conditions, policies, and practices exist at respondent institutions. The following outcome measures were assessed:  degree of participation by state agencies in the field test, validity of IRF field test scores, and the response of state agency and institutional representatives as revealed by followup interviews. Appendices include the 10-part IRF for degree-granting institutions, a user guide for the IRF, and a list of categories and examples of potentially abusive institutional policies and practices.

The current version of Students' Evaluation of Educational Quality (SEEQ), which is appended, was developed at the University of Southern California (USC). (The first SEEQ was developed at the University of California, Los Angeles.) The one-page evaluation instrument contains standardized questions, allows for an individual instructor or academic unit to design items, and provides for student comments to open-ended questions. Research indicates that SEEQ measures nine distinct components of teaching effectiveness that have been identified in both student ratings and faculty self-evaluations of their own teaching. Reliability is  good when based upon 10 to 15 or more student responses. The ratings have successfully been validated against the retrospective ratings of former students, student learning as measured by objective examination, affective course consequences, and faculty self-evaluations of their own teaching effectiveness. Feedback from student ratings, particularly when coupled with a candid discussion with an external consultant, produced improvement in both subsequent ratings and student learning. Data derived from factor analysis, a sample summary report returned to individual faculty and department heads, and references are included. (SW)",

The purposes of educational assessment and testing are considered, and norm-referenced testing, criterion-referenced testing, and cutting scores and standards are addressed. The developmental studies component is designed to improve basic  skills by providing individually prescribed remedial coursework and skills laboratories. It is anticipated that many of the underprepared students will require more than four years to complete their studies. Under the transitional curriculum model, developmental courses will be taught by faculty from various departments, and resources from the Student Assessment Center will be integrated into instruction.

The Endeavor Instructional Rating Form (Frey et al.) measures seven components of effective teaching that have been demonstrated with the use of factor analysis in several different settings, and ratings on this form have correlated with student learning. The SEEQ survey (Students' Evaluation of Educational Quality) by Marsh has been factor analyzed and nine factors have been identified (learning/value, enthusiasm, organization/clarity, group interaction, rapport, breadth of coverage, examinations/grading, assignments, workload/difficulty). Students were asked to evaluate one of the best and one of the worst  lecturers in their university experience, to indicate inappropriate items, and to select the most important items. Each of the 63 items was seen as appropriate by most students, each item was chosen by at least a few students as being most important, and all items, except those related to workload/difficulty, differentiated between best and worst lecturers. Separate factor analyses of the two surveys revealed the same factors that had been identified in American settings. Furthermore, there was good agreement between the factors from the two surveys that were hypothesized to measure the same components of effective teaching. It is concluded that the findings demonstrate the feasibility of evaluating effective teaching in Australian universities and the appropriateness of two American  surveys to an Australian setting. A list of the factors in each survey, the results of oblique factor analysis, and references are included. (Author/SW)",

Nine areas of basic competencies needed for college that relate to cognitive, affective, mechanical, and psychophysical skills are identified. The remedial courses are programmed in small steps, and individualized instruction is used to promote sequential skill development. Nine hierarchies of competence in higher order cognitive processes that have been proposed by investigators are presented, and theoretical issues are analyzed. The Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal was  administered to students enrolled in remedial courses and students enrolled in a general education course (social sciences and humanities) to determine the effects of programmed instruction provided in the remedial program. The general education course did not provide the incremental drills characteristic of programmed learning. Students in both groups had similar characteristics. Pretesting and posttesting with the Watson-Glaser test indicated that students enrolled in the listening and comprehension and the critical thinking remedial courses increased their mean scores more significantly than did other students. This finding is atrributed to the instructional formats of these courses. References are included. (SW)",

Demographic trends concerning the black population and their representation in higher education are examined along with implications of projections about higher education. Labor market projections are also assessed. Demographic information includes the following: black and white dropouts in selected age groups (16-19, 20-24, and 25-34 years old) in 1970 and 1975-79, black and white college enrollment, enrollment of blacks by type of institution, enrollment and degrees conferred in historically black colleges 1966-79, and representation of blacks in the professions of medicine, dentistry, and law. Implications of  projections made by major researchers are considered and include the following areas: undergraduate enrollment declines, recruitment of part-time and older students, recruitment of minority and low income groups to rectify declining enrollments, increased enrollments in the community colleges, continued expansion of middle income student aid programs, budget cuts and shrinking tax dollars, reduction in the number of faculty, and vigorous state-level higher education planning. The economic and educational implications for black America of labor market projections are considered. Goals for achieving higher education equity for blacks and recommended activities for achieving the goals are addressed. Among the areas of concern are the following: increasing black higher education enrollment,  particularly in degree programs and in scientific and technical fields; increasing opportunities for blacks to enroll in graduate and professional schools and participate in postdoctoral research, increasing black retention and graduation rates, and increasing the number of black faculty and administrators.

        "description":"Teaching styles and possible sex-typed differences in teaching approaches were studied at Ohio State University. Classroom teaching behaviors of 167 professors were observed, and interviews with a subsample of 30 professors were conducted. Additionally, student reactions to these classroom behaviors were assessed through a questionnaire administered at the end of the term. It was hypothesized that sex differences in teaching styles exist because of the role strain and status inconsistency experienced by women professors. Fairly clear and consistent sex differences were found in three kinds of teaching behaviors: those involving (1) good teaching, (2) authority management, and (3) personalizing in the classroom. While both male and female professors were equally committed to  teaching in general and both were likely to spend the majority of classroom time lecturing with a fair amount of time given to student participation, women professors seemed to take a more person-oriented, student-centered approach to teaching. They were concerned with the emotional atmosphere in the classroom, with students as total persons, and with involving students extensively in the learning process. Women's orientations were more expressive and less instrumental than the men's. This difference in orientation is clearly evident in both the interview and observational data. Although teaching styles did not appear to be strong determinants of student evaluations, differences in evaluations of male and female professors are noted. A sample student questionnaire and faculty interview  schedule and references are appended. (SW)",

Plans were developed in Nashville, Tennessee; Norfolk, Virginia; and Savannah, Georgia. In Nashville, Tennessee State University and the University of Tennessee at Nashville merged as a result of a federal court decision. In Savannah, as part of the Georgia desegregation plan, all teacher education instruction moved to Armstrong State College and all business administration courses to Savannah State College. In Norfolk, as part of the updated Virginia State Plan for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, a number of specialized areas of instruction have been assigned exclusively to one or the other  institutions, and a number of other instructional fields will be jointly administered, including interinstitutional arrangements between Norfolk State University and Tidewater Community College as well as with Old Dominion University. The rationale for each plan, the procedure by which the plan was developed, and the technique used in the first year of implementation are discussed along with the effects of each plan on the educational process and problems encountered. Observations about planning and implementation that emerged as a result of site visits to the colleges and review of pertinent documents are considered. It is suggested that planning should involve those who are directly engaged in the educational process at the institutions. (SW)",

Considerations for designing and operating a program combining academic learning with work experience is discussed by Yolaine Armand of the College for Human Services in New York City, which has combined classroom work with human service practice for inner-city, low-income adult students. Michael B. Goldstein, in reviewing the 1980 Higher Education Act, claims that student work programs, notably College Work-Study, are to be considered in the context of their educational and vocational as well as economic value. This issue of the bulletin also considers two service-learning programs in Atlanta, a program in  Detroit at Wayne State University involving labor unions and six public universities to train rank and file women and minorities for leadership roles in the community, the Grand Rapids Junior College Mentorship Program that pairs high school students with professionals for on-the-job work and observation; and the American Indian Studies program at the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, Minnesota. The two service-learning programs in Atlanta are the Atlanta Urban Corps, which arranges paid internships in Atlanta public service agencies, and Project EXCEL (Exemplary Collegiate Experiential Learning Program) at Georgia State University, which is aimed at improving accessibility to its associate of science degree program by low-income, CETA (Comprehensive Employment and Training  Act)-eligible youth in Atlanta.

        "description":"Four studies concerning the impact on students and faculty of individualized baccalaureate programs at the General College of the University of Minnesota were conducted. These studies concerned faculty perceptions of the individualized degree program; consequences of the program on faculty advising, activities, and academic load; reactions of graduates of the program; and a credit and grade point analysis of transcripts of graduates. The faculty attitude and opinion survey assessed the quality of programs and of student performance, professional development and satisfaction, and institutional, curricular, and program development and change. While expressing confidence in the quality of student-planned programs, faculty felt less confidence in students' abilities in writing,  communicating orally, and applying classroom experience to real-world problems. Results indicate that the proportion of faculty advising time required for individualized baccalaureate degree programs was double that for conventional lower-division programs. Characteristics of the 80 graduates of the program, whose average age was 33, are identified along with their goals in electing individualized study, their assessment of the program in general and how it is valued in the world of work, factors that led to employment, and the effect of the degree on admission to graduate school. Slightly more than a fourth of the graduates ahd been granted vocational-technical credit, a fifth received experiential credit, and five percent received credit by examination. Grade and numeric point averages  of students exceeded the standards set by the General College faculty for admission to, and graduation from, baccalaureate programs. Survey instruments and statistical tables are appended. (SW)",

        "author":["Novotny, Janet"],
        "description":"Mandatory retirement of college faculty, as affected by the amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), is considered in relation to the changing faculty age profile, retirement strategies to cope with ADEA, and other issues under ADEA. ADEA raised the mandatory retirement age from 65 to 70, and tenured faculty were exempted until June 1982. The majority (52 percent) of faculty are in the 30-44 age bracket, and this category constitutes 41 percent of all tenured faculty. The majority of institutions have a mandatory retirement age but are willing to extend it on a year-by-year basis. It is suggested that the ADEA will create additional financial pressures on higher education institutions and may, at the same time, impair quality, if staff size needs to be  reduced or unproductive faculty must be retained. Projections indicate that there will be a decline in junior faculty hires until 1995 with a possible increase thereafter. It is proposed that colleges and universities should create innovative policies regarding retirement, tenure, and faculty development to cope with ADEA and also to respond to longer-term issues, such as long-range staff planning, new salary structures, and second career/mid-career changes. The new legislation does not preclude retaining the concept of a normal retirement age of 65. Preretirement counseling as a means to communicate the potential benefits of a normal retirement age, reduced benefits for older workers that are allowed by the new law, and the option of early retirement are considered. Tenure proposals and  other important salary structures, the need for criteria for evaluating faculty performance, and the issue of faculty career change are addressed. A bibliography is included.

Undergraduate research projects should provide experience in generating a design, implementing the project, writing the report, and presenting it to others. Research training courses should be tailored to fit both the individual student's needs and abilities and the faculty's own personal interests and needs. The development of undergraduate research conferences, which involve research-oriented faculty and students from a variety of institutions, is considered. Such conferences have increasingly involved very bright and outstanding undergraduates. The need to attract highly qualified high school students who have potential for scientific and research endeavors is noted. The integration of  novice researchers into the larger field of psychology as a basic and applied science is shown to be promoted by the use of multi-level systems to teach research methods, such as those proposed by Carsrud and Christensen (1980), intra-departmental colloquia, undergraduate research conferences, and special sessions at regional meetings. It is concluded that undergraduates should be involved in the formation of ideas and research designs and should take part in field studies and evaluations of applied programs in industry and human service settings.

Seven major ratings of geography departments are considered. Reputational rankings were conducted by Raymond M. Hughes (1925, 1934), Hayward Keniston (1959), Allan Cartter (1966), and Roose and Andersen (1970). Studies based on more objective criteria were conducted by Peter Beaumont (1971), David E. Sopher and James S. Duncan (1975), and Richard L. Morrill (1980). Based on these seven quality rankings of geography departments, the following have been rated among the discipline's best departments: University of California at  Berkeley, University of Chicago, University of Michigan, and University of Wisconsin. In 1925, the nation's highest-ranked departments were located mostly in the Northeast and upper Midwest. By 1966, many of the best departments in the Northeast had declined or disappeared, and of the nine highest-rated schools in the Cartter survey, six were in the upper Midwest and three on the west coast. Recently, as illustrated by the three geography department rankings done since 1971, the nation's best geography departments have become relatively decentralized. A list of the ratings for each study and references are included. (SW)",

The history of staff development is traced through a review of publications on the topic, a discussion of the national conferences on staff development, and a narrative concerning the author's experiences with staff development. Next, reasons why colleges are becoming interested in staff development are enumerated, first in terms of general staff benefits, and then in terms of the benefits specific to faculty and administrators. This section concludes with a discussion of four additional antecedents to the staff development movement. The examination of the present state of staff development focuses on the  growing numbers of people becoming active in the movement, organizational patterns that have emerged, institutional provisions for staff development, persistent problems that hinder effectiveness, and elements essential for program success. The recommendations presented in the final section include the following: the increased use of packaged programs, the inclusion of staff development in performance appraisals, the institutional acceptance of program costs, the use of outside consultants, adequate program evaluations, and the pursuit of organizational as well as staff development objectives.

Meetings of community college decision-makers and CETA personnel were held to: (1) review the findings of the 1978 study, which identified for these same six institutions those factors positively or negatively impacting the CETA/college relationship; (2) update the status of the relationships; and (3) identify, through forced field analyses, those activities that could be initiated to improve the CETA/college relationship. The project confirmed a major finding of the 1978 study--that there were three main determinants of a  successful relationship: compatability of CETA and college organizational objectives, adequate exchange of information between the two parties, and recognition by each of the benefits to be derived from cooperation. The study report details findings for each institution in a series of six site visit reports, which summarize those factors influencing the CETA/college relationship since 1978, assess the current relationship, outline goals for improvement established by meeting participants, and evaluate meeting outcomes.

As background, the report first examines recent developments in strategic planning for higher education, including efforts of college consortia to extend the focus of planning from the institution to the region and various paradigms used by educational researchers to identify and assess trends in an institution's internal and external environments. The proposed model, referred to as the Trend and Environmental Impact Analysis Program, is then presented. This model entails  the cooperation of college consortia and private industries in carrying out two planning functions: (1) the monitoring of a comprehensive set of publications by professional abstractors as a means of identifying and tracking technological developments; and (2) the incorporation of an analysis of this information into strategic curricular planning.

The report's 35 recommendations are then categorized in terms of areas of impact and the Chancellor's review group's concerns about 14 of the recommendations are presented. Finally, nine companion recommendations are submitted: encourage further investigation into the redistributive effects of the new program; assure its gradual implementation in face of the uncertainty about its impact; improve accessibility to disadvantaged students; and encourage further study of an alternative which would link state and federal programs.

It goes on to describe the traditional community college clientele, and the challenge for mission development imposed by an emerging body of non-traditional students made up of unemployed youth, older adults, females, and minorities. Part II examines the inadequacy of existing funding patterns to meet the needs of these students. It includes discussions of: (1) the history of  community college financing, revealing the lag between changes in mission and in funding patterns; (2) current sources of financial support and the failure of state funding models to target resources for non-traditional students; (3) the increased use of tuition and fees; and (4) the failure of financial aid programs to meet the needs of non-traditional students. Part III outlines eight recommendations related to: clear articulation of mission, legislative approval of mission statements, program cost determination, program evaluation, alterations in funding and programming, alternative delivery systems, and residence halls.

Student records maintained at the universities were examined to provide a  demographic profile of each group and to facilitate a semester-by-semester comparison of the grade point averages, retention rates, college credits earned, and graduation rates for each group during their enrollment at the universities. Data were analyzed by high school class rank, university departmental enrollment, and, where applicable, by community college attended.

The report first presents a rationale for this mandate, based on the disproportionately high number of transfer students who drop out or earn failing grades at the Florida State Universities. After outlining the purview of the Essential Academic Skills project, the report presents four axiomatic conditions affecting community colleges. It then discusses the importance of released time, administrative support, and several other prerequisites to faculty participation in the reassessment of course goals and objectives necessitated by the basic  skills requirement. The next sections call for a total faculty effort in the setting and enforcing of college-wide entry- and exit-level skills; for the development of a valid exam to measure student competencies; for remediation to fulfill the objectives of the test; and for faculty reassignments based on individual college needs. An outline follows of 14 attitudinal and institutional barriers to faculty cooperation and of corresponding strategies to be used in combatting them. The report concludes with a discussion of the implications of the mandate for terminal students and college autonomy. (JP)",

The manual first outlines 20 factors that contribute to a successful reading program, such as the provision of student support services, the awarding of credit to students completing the program, and the provision of faculty status for program instructors. Next, the publicity efforts undertaken by UMTC to promote student awareness of the tutorial program are enumerated. These efforts included gaining the cooperation of journalism and radio students in writing ads; distributing posters and flyers; and involving student clubs and vocational classes in remodeling the reading laboratory, catering a local  reading council banquet, and performing other service projects related to the reading program. Finally, the report outlines several ways of promoting faculty and administrative involvement, including: (1) holding inservice workshops about outreach services; (2) recruiting faculty volunteers for short videotape lectures; (3) cooperating with counseling staff; (4) publishing a study of the program's effects on student retention; (5) conducting a faculty/administrator evaluation of the program; and (6) providing assistance to faculty in writing and proofing grant proposals. Sample brochures and flyers are included. (JP)",

        "description":"In the face of declining student reading abilities, content area instructors at community colleges can no longer ignore the gap that exists between student reading levels and the higher levels at which college texts are written. Indeed, these instructors have a responsibility to include reading improvement in course objectives, because: (1) the ability of public schools to teach reading is limited by the fact that most people aren't capable of assimilative comprehension until the ages of 16 to 18; (2) the provision of special reading courses at the college level deflates the self-esteem and motivation of adult students; and (3) the use of lower-level texts can be self-defeating due to the unreliable results of standard procedures for determining text reading level. One method of  assuming this responsibility is to provide for each text a section-by-section study guide composed of short-answer questions. Such Directed Reading Activities (DRA's) lead the student through a four-step process of reading comprehension: identifying the author's main point, recognizing ideas used to support this point, identifying details, and drawing conclusions from what has been read. DRA's keep students' minds focused on the reading, reinforce student learning, and enhance student motivation and self-esteem. (Illustrations of DRA questions are provided in the paper.) (JP)",

        "description":"Community college professors have a responsibility as teachers to help students learn the many new words which must be added to their high school vocabularies if they are to be successful. While some instructors provide students with a list of jargon words relevant to a particular course, most ignore the problem posed by new words encountered in reading assignments and merely assume that students will look them up in a dictionary. Yet even if students had the time to look up as many words as necessary to understand their reading assignments, few would be able to determine which of the various definitions for any given word is relevant to the passage they are reading. As a result, many words will appear to students as gibberish and render reading assignments meaningless.  Therefore, it is incumbent upon instructors to provide, where possible, paragraph-by-paragraph vocabulary guides for each text, listing short definitions for key words. In addition, instructors can improve student vocabulary by: (1) requiring students to learn 50 new words relevant to the course; (2) instruct students in the meaning of prefixes; and (3) help students use and recognize context clues, such as punctuation, definitions in context, the part of speech of a particular word, chapter titles and other visual signals, key words (i.e., \"previously\" or \"in addition\"), and footnotes.

After enumerations of the advantages and purposes of an appraisal system, three evaluation pitfalls are discussed: the evaluator's subjective judgements, incompatibility of ratings among departments, and vague evaluation criteria. Prerequisites for successful evaluations are then detailed and a list is presented of the characteristics of competent evaluators.

A sample of 72 students in grade one in a southern rural elementary school were grouped into three sections by ability and given a series of tests. Instruments used were the Children's Embedded Figures Test (CEFT), Piaget's Conservation Tasks (PCT), Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) and the First Grade Screening Test (FGST). A positive relationship between conservation category (PCT) and cognitive style (CEFT) was found. Students who were conservers tended to be field independent and high achievers. The reverse was also apparent in the data. Unexpectedly, the girls' mean score on  the CEFT was higher than the boys' mean score. White students who were more field independent and were conservers did better on achievement measures than those who were black, field dependent and/or nonconservers. It is concluded that educational experiences appropriate for the student's cognitive level and consistent with his/her processing style may help students achieve at a higher level. (Author/RH)",

Lack of formal music training can be greatly compensated for by access to quality equipment and materials. These resources include a basic accompanying instrument, toy instruments, a durable record player, records for children to sing, move, and listen to, teacher resource and music books, and posters depicting instruments. Preschools can acquire costly music materials and equipment through the implementation and development of a long-term purchase plan. Recommended accompanying instruments are, first, the piano, and, second, the portaharp. A variety of sturdy, high-quality &quot;toy&quot; instruments may be purchased for moderate  prices from numerous vendors. Heavily constructed record players intended for school use are desirable even though they rapidly wear out records. Carefully-selected and quality-controlled records produced by companies catering to the professional education market are often preferable to records purchased over the counter. Numerous song and musical activity books are available on the market. In addition, kindergarten and first grade standard textbooks can be excellent sources of a broader collection of songs and extensive teaching suggestions. (Author/JA)",

Begun in 1970, the study plan is to follow a cohort of black children, adopted as infants or toddlers, through their childhood years until the age of 20. The present report, based on descriptive and experimental data, examines the families when the children are 3 1/2 to 4 years old. Following the postulates of psychoanalytic theory, the study tests the hypotheses that black children raised by white parents would have problems forming racial identity and that black children raised by single parents would have problems forming sexual identity. Ninety-nine families comprising 27 single parents, 36 transracial and 36  traditional adoptive families were interviewed in person. Extensive telephone interviews were held with another 10 families who had moved out of Illinois. Data were obtained from three sources: (1) case records of the home study and the child's history prior to placement; (2) an assessment of family adjustment made shortly after placement; (3) interviews conducted in the home when the child was 3 1/2; and (4) a variety of tests. No evidence was found to substantiate the hypotheses. Descriptive components of the study focus on family interaction, roles, and ways of managing family life and crises, with particular emphasis on the single adoptive parent, as well as parental handling of adoption and perceived need for support groups or services.

The subjects were four children who were individually tested once a month from the age of 12 to 24 months in laboratory settings. Assessment materials consisted of three sets of miniature toys, a doll and junk objects. Each set was presented to each subject for 5 minutes and the subject's spontaneous behavior was individually observed and tested by a female experimenter in the presence of his/her mother. Results indicated that although the developmental sequence of symbolic play was almost always the same, the developmental pace varied among the subjects. Symbolic manipulative play was preceded by the relational play. Non-relational manipulative play was  dominant in general. Symbolic play went through a transition from imitative use to substitution and then to the gestural representation of absent objects, and a shift in agent use from self to passive other and then to active other. However, most symbolic play fell in the category of imitative use of self agent use. The mother, in contrast to the experimenter, was always the first passive other agent. Results further suggest a positive relationship of symbolic play to language development. As general indices for all stages in the development of symbolic play, the number of different acts was suggested to be more appropriate than the percentage of occurrence. Developmental characteristics of relational developmental play and egocentricism are discussed. (Author/RH)",

Staff from health care, education, and social service agencies met informally because of common problems. A formal organization was established when it became apparent that funding needs, program accountability requirements and a central referral system could be accomplished through incorporation. In 1977 sixteen affiliated agencies in Cincinnati began to spread the USEP concept to other cities in Ohio. Subsequently, a steering committee was formed to organize and coordinate programs for infants in the State of Ohio. The work of the steering committee from 1977 to 1978 laid the  groundwork for a statewide organization, USEP-OHIO, a non-profit corporation with a constitution, by-laws and tax exempt status. Goals of USEP-OHIO have been (1) to connect programs at the local, regional and state levels, (2) to offer consultation to the membership and the community, (3) to coordinate program services and resources, and (4) to establish local central referral sites. The statewide organization also addresses the issues of program survival, service improvement and program accountability. (Author/RH)",

Reported here were scales for Health Behavior and Health Care, constructed from items from the parent interview, from the youth questionnaire and from clinical data. Scores for males and females were examined among whites and among nonwhites. Males had higher scores for Health Behavior than females in both race groups at adolescence. The Health Behavior scale was related significantly in all sex-race groups to all scales measuring health  status. Correlations were low (r's of .08 to .35); they were consistently higher for nonwhite females than others. When the Health Care scale scores were examined, the differences in this adolescent population were between races, not sexes. In all sex-race groups, amount of health care received was related with low negative r's to measure of health status; for nonwhites most of these correlations were not significant. The measure of socioeconomic status from the HES data was the variable correlated positively in all groups with health care. (Author/MP)",

Data were examined for white boys and girls of a cohort of 300 children tested at their entrance into kindergarten in 1970, and at the end of third grade in 1974. Measurements for the children at both points included tests of cognitive ability, social-emotional variables and achievement, as well  as educational advantage level of the home environment. The analyses of the data from this sample indicated that each of the hypotheses was supported to some extent. There were indications of an even start and of decline in some measurements of boys relative to girls in achievement and adjustment during the early school years. For girls, both affective and cognitive measures at the end of third grade were positively correlated with achievement, while for boys only the cognitive measure was so related. However, it was with boys, not girls, that third grade achievement showed many positive correlations with kindergarten entrance variables. (Author/MP)",

Implemented in Project Follow Through and other school settings, the IELP gives priority to teaching basic skills and concepts needed for school performance to children in preschool and the early elementary grades. Built into the program are features such as instructional tasks, diagnostic procedures, instruments for evaluating and monitoring student learning, recommendations for the physical design of the classroom, and a learning management system. Organized into four major sections, the paper provides an overview of the IELP, discusses the process of program development, describes the field research  activities undertaken, and discusses the insights gained while developing and studying the program.

The workbook performs three basic functions for the delegates: (1) focuses attention on the themes of the WHCF; (2) provides brief background information on the issues discussed in the conference workgroups; and (3) summarizes recommendations for which there was consensus across several states. Five issue briefs provide background information in the areas of education, health, housing, child care, and handicapping conditions. The briefs are organized into four sections: Introduction; Background Information on Major Issues; Current Programs and Policies;  and Recommendations from the States. Recommendations were classified by topic and issue. Similar recommendations were grouped together and a sample recommendation was selected for purposes of illustration. Recommendations listed were taken from state reports received by May 5, l980 and are provided as starting points for discussion among delegates. (Author/RH)",

The program's successes include: (1) providing health care services to the poor; (2) effecting long-lasting educational gains for children; (3) fostering parent involvement; (4) promoting the career development of Head Start parents; and (5) influencing other community programs. Research and demonstration activities have made it possible for Head Start to respond to changing family needs and provide services beyond the original preschool target population. Despite these successes, Head Start has been confronted with the problems of inflation, uneven program quality, limited managerial resources, low staff wages, and shifts in  program administration and changing demographics. Suggestions for protecting program quality (emphasized in this report as Head Start's foremost priority) include incorporating more trained caregivers into the program, increasing program and managerial resources, and legislating Head Start's permanent status in the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families (ACYF). In addition, recommendations for the controlled expansion of Head Start, the strengthening of recruitment procedures, an increased emphasis on the family-centered orientation and the maintenance of a strong evaluation component are made.

        "description":"Research attempted to establish the existence or lack of existence of an identifiable &quot;rural culture&quot; and to establish the presence or absence of an equivalence relationship between geographic residence and rural culture. A factor analysis of a wide range of attitudinal questions from the 1977 National Opinion Research Center (NORC) General Social Survey and a subsequent constructed typology indicated that a rural culture does exist in American society, at least with regard to three dimensions of social conservatism (attitudes toward civil liberty, abortion and racial segregation). To establish whether geographic residence is a valid indicator of rurality, individuals were classified by these attitudes into two extreme monothetic cells (rural-conservatives, urban-liberals) of the  constructed typology, to see whether current residence correlated with placement in the typology. Because of the relative lack of correlation between rurality and geographic residence, the model was expanded to include occupation, personal demographic characteristics, religion, and family structure. Results of a multiple discriminant analysis suggested that, although current residence and occupation are correlated with a rural culture, place of residence at age 16 along with several personal demographic features such as religion, income, and age, are perhaps more central to understanding the broader concept.

        "description":"Clara De Coteau, a Chippewa woman who was born in 1909, wrote the story of her first 18 years of life for this unit. In the story, Mrs. De Coteau tells of many experiences which girls can relate to their life today. While some things have changed, other things have not. Mrs. De Coteau illustrates very well the patience, time and effort it takes to excel in something. Her frequent reference to her music is a good example of this. In her story, she often relates to her extended family. A discussion of this relationship should help the girls understand their family system. There is a list of questions that can be used to help the girls discuss the story. As a follow-up to the story, girls may talk to other women about their growing up years. The unit consists of the booklet,&quot;Growing Up To Be A Woman,&quot; which is for all age groups. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"Designed to help tribal girls develop good grooming habits, the unit focuses on being natural and on practicing good health habits. Attention is given to such habits as bathing, care of complexion and hair, good posture, and care of the teeth and gums. The use of makeup is deemphasized. To relate the unit to pride in Indianness, bathing customs prior to the coming of the white man can be stressed. Also, the ceremonials in which Zuni women carried pottery on their heads can be related to the concept of good posture. The activity sheets in the girls' materials can be considered commitment sheets which the girls can use to make promises to themselves regarding good grooming practices. Narrative and activity sections are included for girls from 9 to 11, 12 to 14, and 15 to 18 years  old. The information on acne may be used for girls 12 to 18 years old. The leaders' guide identifies the concepts to be taught, states the objectives, and outlines learning experiences to be used in the unit. (Author/CM)",

The following concepts are to be stressed: (1) roles in marriage have changed; (2) people marry for a variety of reasons; (3) love is not the only consideration in selecting a mate; (4) marriage is really a marriage for both persons; (5) women are likely to be employed during their marriage; (6) working mothers can be good mothers; (7) both parents can share child care; (8) couples can make a marriage contract; (9) there may be a relationship between employment and divorce; (10) teenage marriages face some serious hazards; and (11) nonmarriage is an alternative. The unit features student books for girls aged 12 to 14 and 15 to 18. These contain  self-analysis questionnaires and studies for discussion which give the girls practice in problem solving. A separate section, &quot;Map Your Future,&quot; is part of the unit; it includes a game board and a set of cards for each girl and a set of problems for the group.

It presents a history of the use of birth control by various tribal groups and data on infant birth and mortality rates among Wisconsin  Indian people. The unit is primarily designed for girls 15 to 18. The leaflet &quot;Your Life&quot; and the &quot;Ropes and Ladders&quot; game are appropriate for girls 12 to 18 years old. Five charts, illustrating birthrate by age and infant mortality rates for Wisconsin Indians, are included. Slides on birth control methods and handbooks on venereal disease and birth control are available for use with the unit.

The unit includes the following concepts: (1) there are individual attitudes toward money; (2) managing money is based on goals; (3) values are related to spending; (4) a spending record is important; (5) there are resources besides money; (6) wants and needs are not the same; (7) a spending plan helps one control money; (8) a spending record and a spending plan go together; (9) managing money is related to choices; (10) sharing is part of managing money; and (11)  saving is part of money management. The unit provides books for girls ages 9 to 11, 12 to 14, and 15 to 18. Most of the background information for the unit is in the book for 15 to 18 year olds. Exercises in the unit provide opportunities for girls to clarify their values, keep spending and saving records, and learn about the costs of living. There is also a set of quotations about money and a &quot;$ Game&quot; which includes a game board and a set of playing cards.

The unit stresses the following concepts: (1) nutrition affects a girl's health; (2) long ago tribal people probably had good diets; (3) fruits and vegetables, grains, and milk are important parts of a person's diet; (4) one must have a well balanced diet when dieting; (5) breakfast is an important meal; (6) snack foods can be healthful or they can be empty-caloried; and (7) school breakfast programs and lunch programs can help girls have good  nutrition. The unit includes books for girls 9 to 11, 12 to 14, and 15 to 18. Background information for all ages is in the book for 15 to 18 year olds. Because long ago tribal diets were probably very healthful, some of the learning activities emphasize traditional tribal foods. The game &quot;Bingo Lingo&quot; is written in the Chippewa language. It may be necessary to re-write the game if the girls speak a different tribal language. The unit also includes posters and games and directions for ordering supplemental material. The leaders' guide contains additional learning activities as well as instructions for teaching the concepts contained in the girls' books. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"The increased enrollment of women in Colleges of Agriculture has implications for the training and socializing of agriculture professionals in the future. The female students represent fundamental changes in the character of agricultural enrollment. They are more likely to be young, single, and politically moderate or liberal. They are less likely to have or want children, or to have parents who own a farm. They are a key factor in the amalgamation of agricultural education with the general society. Many female agriculture students want agricultural production jobs, especially as farmers, ranchers, horse breeders, managers, or foremen. However, judging by the conflicting sex-role attitudes of male and female agriculture students, there may be problems in placing women in the  professional agriculture jobs they desire. This will place several stresses on Colleges of Agriculture. Colleges will need women in order to maintain enrollment figures and educational programs. Deans will therefore be forced to consider women's demands for placement, counseling, and curriculum changes. However, Colleges will find themselves in an uncomfortable position between the traditional employers of their graduates and increasing numbers of women students. The new agriculture student may also be a major factor in the decision to pursue a particularistic or generalistic agricultural education philosophy. (SB)",

The second purpose is to provide some comparative notes for particular Yukon myths in the book &quot;My Stories Are My Wealth&quot; by Angela Sidney, Kitty Smith, and Rachel Dawson, published by the Council for Yukon Indians. Although that book was not specifically prepared for use in schools, it may be a source-book for teachers interested in including Yukon materials when they discuss mythology. Part 1 of this guide is a discussion of themes in northern mythology, particularly Athapaskan  mythology in the Yukon, which might be of some use to a teacher teaching mythology at an elementary or high school level. Part 2 is a more direct guide to ways in which Yukon mythology could be used in grades 1 to 7 Social Studies and grades 8 to 12 English. This section follows the British Columbia curriculum guides. Part 3 is a thematic and comparative guide to stories in &quot;My Stories Are My Wealth&quot; for teachers specifically interested in Yukon mythology. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"This 1977 study was conducted to determine the relative importance of selected variables on choice of major in home economics which distinguished black women attending southern 1890 land-grant universities from white women attending southern 1862 land-grant institutions. A 15% random sample of women with home economic majors was selected to respond to questionnaires which identified factors of social origin and family background, significant persons who influenced their choice of college major, and previous curriculum-related educational and work experiences. Eight social origin variables were examined, with parents' income, fathers' occupation, and fathers' political preference emerging as the most important discriminating variables. Of 17 choices related to significant others,  family members, home economics deans and teachers, and college friends had the greatest influence on choice of a major in home economics. Analysis of variables from five choices of curriculum-related experiences indicated that prior high school courses and FHA participation were the best discriminating factors between the groups. A combined discriminate analysis disclosed that social origin variables were the most important set of factors separating the two study populations, and revealed that black students came from significantly lower socio-economic origins than their white peers.

        "description":"A study of 25 male college students (14 Native Americans, 11 Anglo Americans) assessed the role of culturally-differing communications behavior in the dropout rate of Native American students (while the students want an education, they also wish to retain their cultural identity, and equate class participation with assimilation into non-Indian culture; this leads to a strategy of interactional avoidance, which leads to educational failure). The students were divided into five smaller groups, each with a different proportion of Native American and Anglo American students; each group was given a puzzle needing information exchange for a solution. Group interactions were videotaped; the tapes were coded and submitted to various statistical techniques. Interactional avoidance  behavior by Indian students was modified when they were placed in situations demanding communicative response; they responded, but in ways different from Anglo American students. Group interactions involving Indian students showed: (1) lower activity levels than a group containing only Anglo American students; (2) the importance of negotiation about socio-emotional and task differences; and (3) the significance of behavior change roles and compliance roles. The reasons why Native Americans fail as college students are complex and require more detailed analysis. Appendices contain the puzzle used and the coding manual. (MH)",

The policy recommendations made by the participants included proposed changes in federal rules, regulations, and legislation and emphasized the importance of women's organizations and other community-based groups. The participants recommended greater government sensitivity to rural needs and, in particular, to the needs of rural women. Recommendations primarily  advocated various types of financial assistance, tax incentives, technical assistance, and educational opportunities which federal and state governments should make available to rural residents and rural communities. Recommendations also dealt with federal policies, standards, and services applicable to rural communities. The participants stressed that rural people know what their needs are and that government and industry should respect and encourage their ability to solve problems in their own way. (Author/CM)",

In engineering, Hispanics represent only 3.2% of all full-time students, 1.2% of all masters students, and .7% of all doctoral students. Hispanic underrepresentation in engineering and science results from several factors. These include, at the high school level, recruitment and career exposure programs that do not consider minority cultures; counselors who unconsciously reinforce established Anglo and Hispanic career patterns; science curricula that inadequately prepare students for college science and engineering programs or that are too abstract; and teachers who are underutilized as resources and role models. An intervention model, such as that developed by Scott, can help provide the early corrective action necessary  to promote Hispanic representation in technical fields. Also, secondary schools should reorganize science curricula around everyday science, provide bilingual science and math instruction, and improve counseling. Colleges should support special minority programs in fields such as engineering, sciences, and math, and should actively recruit Hispanics for their programs. Graduate and professional institutions should provide adequate financial aid, develop post-baccalaureate programs for Hispanics, and include a multicultural focus in their technical programs. National-level emphasis on needs, programs and funding for Hispanic involvement in math and science is recommended. (SB)",

        "description":"According to non-Indian educators, American Indian children in public schools often pose discipline problems that cannot be handled with traditional non-Indian methods such as spanking, scolding, yelling, or isolation. The elements of Indian discipline (shaming, ridicule, threats of punishment by supernatural figures, storytelling, community pressure) are usually absent in the non-Indian classroom. Other cultural differences that may cause educational problems are the Indian emphasis on the group, concepts of time and personal freedom, and attitudes towards family and age. Because Indian and non-Indian frames of reference, life experiences, and value systems differ vastly, the Indian child may react to a non-Indian school setting with seemingly negative behaviors such as silence,  tiredness, high levels of activity, irritability, and inattentiveness. Educators must realize that such behaviors indicate that the child's needs are not being met. Educators must become more knowledgeable and accepting of Indian cultures; community members must provide the children with traditional guidance and become actively involved in education; parents must supply solid values and behavior guidelines; and children must be responsible for themselves. Together, educators, families, community and tribal members, and the children themselves share the responsibility for lessening negative classroom behavior. (SB)",

Concepts to be taught in the unit include: (1) the growing up years should include preparation for a career; (2) each girl grows at her own rate; (3) girls need to be proud of their bodies as they are; (4) women have not had equal opportunities in athletics; (5) one of the myths of society is that girls are to be successful as housewives and men are to be successful in the world of work; (6) there are  childbearing practices that affect how girls see themselves and how they act; and (7) some people label men and women with different kinds of characteristics. The learning experiences are geared to prevent girls from becoming victims of stereotypical images and roles and to encourage them to think for themselves, to have pride in themselves, and to develop their individuality.

Collaboratively taught, rural science curricula can include study of agricultural ecology, rural biology, rural science, rural studies, world food supplies, the energy crisis, and solar energy. Taken as a whole, these courses illustrate an expanded approach to teaching about food production and the life and work of the countryside in general. Such an interdisciplinary approach gives the science teacher the opportunity to help meet some of the educational needs of young people by providing practice in enquiry; calculation and  measurement; design; communication; values; and in organizing information, making decisions, and thinking critically. For such a curriculum to be successful, rural science teachers need training and continued financial and resource support as well as flexibility in scheduling.

        "description":"Major components of a study conducted in 1977 and 1978 were: (1) an examination of existing literature on migrant transportation; (2) collection of pertinent empirical data from federal, state, and migrant work camp records; and (3) vehicle counts and observation at 32 selected locations in 11 destination states in the western, midwestern, and eastern migrant streams. At the 32 locations, 5,485 migrant workers were using 1,116 vehicles (51% cars and station wagons, 37% pickup trucks and vans potentially subject to regulation under a strict interpretation of Part 398, and 2% large trucks and buses). A substantial decline in the last 10 years in the number of regulated vehicles was probably due to several factors: government regulations; high cost of insurance premiums on vehicles  carrying large numbers of migrating workers; overall decline in the numbers of workers migrating interstate; increased migrant incomes enabling purchase and maintenance of family vehicles. It was concluded that Part 398 has very limited applicability to migrant transportation today, and that even this applicability has been preempted by the laws of California, Texas, and Florida. It was also concluded that Part 398 regulations overlap with the Department of Labor's Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act regulations, which apply to any farm labor contractor who transports migrant laborers.

These provide students with the opportunity to learn basic and relevant skills, go beyond their self-perceived limitations, recognize their option to change how they deal with others, make meaningful accomplishments, begin to clarify career options, and earn credit toward a  high school diploma. Grading is based on an &quot;honors,&quot;&quot;credit,&quot; or &quot;no-credit&quot; system. The state-approved program is most applicable for average to bright students, either male or female. Interested high school juniors apply and participants are selected for the program from among the applicants. The Walkabout staff serve not only as teachers but also as friends and advisors to the students. Parent, student, and staff reactions to the program are positive. (SB)",

Several program developments of critical importance to understanding the transition occurring in PRI are highlighted in the section &quot;Major Program Developments.&quot; The section entitled &quot;Evaluation Studies&quot; describes the focal points of 1979-80 evaluation efforts. Summary observations and recommendations made by the review team are included. &quot;Illustrative Project Activity&quot; describes a number of the more than 80 projects in which PRI is currently involved. Projects described in this section have been chosen to illustrate key dimensions of transition issues; inferences  can be drawn from these projects with broad application to the underlying PRI concepts. A section on &quot;Plans for 1980-81&quot; indicates an expanded use of task forces, development of community service fellowships and internships, establishment of a community education demonstration site, and expansion to Walla Walla Community College District. The financial management and budget of PRI are described in the final section. Attention is drawn to the fact that an additional grant has been awarded by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation for continuing and expanding the work initiated in the 1976-1980 period. (CM)",

        "description":"Designed for the rural practitioner, this manual offers a description of the major developmental tasks faced by individuals during the latter part of the life span and a summary of the major implications that research holds for building community programs for the rural elderly. Section II discusses two major assumptions: (1) because human beings are members of social systems (the most important of which is the family), those systems must be considered if services are to be effective; and (2) effective social programs will take into account the fact that life is a developmental process. Although the primary focus of the manual is on the elderly, the developmental approach calls for a study of middle age. Section III discusses the changes and challenges of middle age. Section IV,  with emphasis on the rural elderly, discusses the major social-psychological developments of old age including role changes, physical and mental changes, income and housing issues, perceptions of life, and family relationships. Section V offers guidelines for delivering human services to the rural elderly. It describes the diversity found in rural communities, misconceptions held concerning the elderly, involvement of the elderly in planning meaningful activities, service delivery cooperation, and family and network oriented programming. The manual advises the study, development, and use of strong natural helping systems for the delivery of human services to the rural elderly. Section VI is an extensive bibliography, divided into the same topic sections as the text of the manual.  (CM)",

        "description":"Focusing on a broad population of Black and White rural Deep South youth of both sexes for the period 1966-1972, this monograph investigates the process through which careers and career-related preferences are developed during adolescence, how such preferences influence early adult behaviors, and what consequences these factors have upon the reformulation of new career preferences in young adulthood. While Chapter I focuses on the context of rural youth in America, Chapter II reviews social-psychological and status attainment literature and investigates the concepts of rural, rurality, race, and sex as possible constraining influences upon career decisions and career achievement. Chapter III reviews the methods of the Southern Youth Study and describes methods of data collection  and characteristics of the students and of measurement. Chapter IV features a comparison of sex-race differences in career related attitudes which are evident during adolescence and early adulthood. The chapter discusses how these attitudes are related to actual attainment. Chapter V assesses the differential abilities of youth to translate their preferences into actual behavior and discusses which sex-race groupings have the most success or social power in attaining their goals. Chapter VI investigates sex-race differences in the overall process of career decision making. Chapter VII contains an overview of the research findings and a critical assessment of the study model. It also outlines policy implications of the research. (CM)",

In the meta-analysis process, eight constructs linked to learning outcomes were used as the theoretical constructs for the literature selection. The constructs include quality and quantity of instruction; student ability; motivation; age or developmental level; and home, peer, and classroom environments. Included in this report are nine research-synthesis papers and related appendices. Five papers are focused on the dependence of science learning on one or more of the constructs used in the study, one summarizes the implications of this project for future research syntheses and for conducting future primary empirical studies, while other  papers are concerned with sex differences in science learning and the effects of the science curriculum efforts after 1958. Appendices include a discussion of the significance of research synthesis, a computer codebook for characterizing the studies, and an interim report on the project. (Author/PB)",

On the first task, the percentage of children giving judgments of equivalence differed significantly across conditions (69%, 80%, and 14%, for the count, match, and standard conditions). Furthermore, all of the children who began with the count condition sustained conservation responses when subsequently presented the task under standard conditions, while only some of the children who began with the  match condition did so. These results indicate that imposed empirical strategies different from those generally reported (visual-perceptual and Piagetian transformational strategies) will lead preoperational children to make judgments of equivalence and that, once used, the counting strategy (at least) evidently is adopted spontaneously by the children for subsequent problems of the same type.

Students were enrolled in the IPSE program during their sophomore year in high school, and most continued in the program through senior year. The goals of this evaluation were to assess the effects of participation in the program on the following variables: (1) students' attitudes toward science, (2) attitudes toward the various components of the IPSE program, (3) the number of math and science courses attempted, and (4) college attendance and  major field of study. A job interest questionnaire, interivews, and mail surveys were used to obtain data. Results of the study indicated that IPSE students had more positive attitudes toward science and scientific occupations than did control groups. They took more science and mathematics courses, and a larger proportion of IPSE students went to college. When compared to the control group, twice as many IPSE students chose science majors in college. (Author)",

        "description":"Instructors in 14 Navy electronics \"A\" schools (12 basic core and 2 advanced) were presented with a list of 70 mathematical skills and asked to indicate: (1) how important they were to successful school performance, and (2) whether they were prerequisite, reviewed, or taught in the \"A\" schools. They were also asked to state the number and type of performance aids used in the course and during the exam. Responses showed that of the 70 skills surveyed, 19 do not appear in any basic core course and 2 more do not affect performance. Although the skills rated as affecting performance are generally considered as prerequisite in all schools, many students require review in these skills for successful performance. Across all schools, the most important skills are: (1) addition,  subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers; (2) squares and square roots of positive numbers; (3) addition and subtraction of like units; (4) multiplication and division of like and/or unlike units; (5) substitution of known values into a given formula; and (6) transpositions of algebraic expressions. Performance aids are permitted in all courses but one, both during the course and during exams. (Author/MP)",

The investigation was specifically concerned with two questions: (1) Are there differences in the mathematics achievement between children with an internal or external locus of control in both open and non-open classrooms? (2) Are there differences in the mathematics achievement between pupils with a low and high self-concept in both classroom types? The study was conducted in an independent suburban school district near a midwestern metropolitan area. Students in the non-open environments appear to exhibit higher mathematics achievement scores at the upper grade levels. Analysis of the data also reveals that internal locus of control  and high self-concept are positively associated with an open classroom environment. It is suggested that the investigation needs to be replicated at lower grade levels, to examine the trends highlighted in this study. (MP)",

This research: (1) developed an operational definition of estimation; (2) created an instrument to identify exceptionally good estimators; (3) collected performance level data on 1187 subjects; (4) constructed interview problems and developed protocols to identify the thinking processes used by people doing computational estimation; (5) collected interview data from subjects; and (6) synthesized the interview data and organized them into a framework that provides a model for future researchers. Time for response per item was minimized in order to maximize the chance that estimation was measured. An Assessing Computational Estimation test was created based on guidelines gathered from a review of relevant research.  Characteristics of good estimators were hypothesized, and both student and adult subjects were selected based on this model. Three key processes, labeled translation, reformulation, and compensation, were identified that seemed closely associated with good estimation skills. Strategies intertwined with these processes included forms of rounding and truncation. Further details of the estimation process and samples of the testing and interview packets are also included.

Each activity requires students to manipulate concrete materials such as ceramic tiles, marked string, wooden cubes, and square paper. The mathematical content consists of concepts such as area, perimeter, surface area, and volume; relationships relating to growth and variability; and measuring skills such as counting and rule-governed behavior. Teachers from different types of schools and settings were selected and trained. Four were chosen to be video-taped. Data on student understanding of materials was obtained through individual assessments completed in interviews, final evaluations accomplished through written examinations, and  post evaluations administered in a one-to-one setting of student and investigator. Teachers provided descriptions of their teaching experiences and their judgments of student performance. Each activity was evaluated in terms of student and teacher performance. The report contains information on development of the units, data collection procedures, and results of the study. A list of 13 conclusions provide insight into problems encountered and possible methods for improvement. (Author)",

        "description":"The ELEXTEC project was initiated to provide better technical education to students enrolled in electronics technology. It was designed to convert a set of materials developed by the U.S. Air Force for teaching electronic principles in a form which could be utilized by civilian technical education institutions. Fourteen colleges participated in the project. The following five courses were developed with a total of 43 modules: Electronic Circuits; DC Circuits; AC Circuits; Active Devices; and Pulse and Switching Circuits. From 20% to 50% of the new printed material for these courses was originated by the project authors. The ELEXTEC staff functionally duplicated the Air Force laboratory training aids. In-house production of the aids was possible. An electronics workshop was used  to develop the laboratory aids. The project was evaluated in two principal ways: (1) A report compared student performances in conventional learning situations and the ELEXTEC method; and (2) A private consulting firm was contracted to evaluate the instructors, students, and educational materials. This project showed the cost effectiveness of purchasing Air Force or other governmental materials to be converted for use in technical education institutions. (Author/SK)",

Most modules contain computer programs which are built around a particular application of a physical process. This module is used to introduce the biology student to differential calculus, a branch of mathematics which is being used more often in recent ecological and physiological models. Since biological systems are dynamic, their mathematical models must describe rates of change of relevant variables, a process which requires calculus. The module introduces modeling in biology by reviewing differential calculus and using only examples from life sciences. A problem set reviews information in the text proper and presents  additional information not included in the text. An associated computer program, DIFF, uses graphics to check the user's own calculations and to demonstrate the validity of general solutions. (Author/CS)",

The objective is to be able to describe the types of flow, as well as the velocity and discharge of particular streams. These characteristics are used in comparisons of streams, stream classification, flood control, control of sedimentation, and gauging of available water for downstream use. A method used for determining discharge and velocity for a section of a stream, the concept of continuity, is presented. This concept also forms  the basis for understanding the relationships of aquatic organisms to running water. Basic concepts included in this module are developed and used in later modules.

During the first two years, college faculty, industrial supervisors, and training directors developed a total of 76 modules of course material in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. These modules were designed so that industries could select portions of standard science courses for use in their personnel training programs. However, an evaluation group showed that few RESIA modules directly met industry's needs. A new organizational approach was adopted for the following three years; teams developed training materials for specific industries on a contractual basis. Many  of the resulting instructional packages became important segments of university courses. This second approach successfully demonstrated that both industry and higher education can benefit from cooperative programs. (WB)",

        "description":"Described is how teachers can use the Concept Structuring Analysis Technique (ConSAT) as a diagnostic, learning, and assessment task in teaching science. In essence, ConSAT assists students in organizing concepts on paper so that they may link what they already know to what they have to learn. The technique thus applies the philosophical notion of discipline structure and the psychological notion of knowledge structure to science instruction. In addition to illustrating ConSAT's use in teacher-student interactions and in assessment, the application of ConSAT to instruction in reading science texts and in answering science problems is discussed.

The course of human development can be viewed as a consequence of technological development. If we can plot the course technology will take, then we can gain insight into the course humanity will take. The paper establishes the role technology has played in the past in defining humanity. Technology is using objects in the environment as tools. The personal attachment to or ownership of the tool so that it can be used again, the ability to improve the tool over its natural environment, and language and social institutions extending beyond the immediate family are examined. The technological world has been created and  guided by man. If technology and humanity are linked, it should be possible to use technology effectively to direct change. Since natural evolution has been disrupted by technological man, technology appears to be the best approach to a revolutionary shift to higher intelligence. The means to knowing how to create a super intelligent species have been gradually determined with increasing technical sophistication during the last two centuries. These areas of potential breakthrough include technical intervention and brain enhancement, genetic engineering, genetic planning, artificial intelligence and contact with extraterrestrials. The consequences of super intelligence appear to be good and technological transformation should be accepted and allowed to proceed. (Author/RM)",

A detoxification center is &quot;a social rehabilitation facility established for the purpose of facilitating access into care and rehabilitation by detoxifying and evaluating the person and providing entrance into the continuum of care.&quot; One hundred twenty-six clients who had been discharged from any of six detoxification centers in Minnesota were interviewed two weeks and then three months after discharge. Only clients who had signed permission slips were contacted. Results are organized into six categories: client characteristics, client reaction to chemical dependency programs, referral practices, changes in use of alcohol and other drugs, changes in clients'  lives, and benefits of the study itself. Specifically, most of the sample was involved primarily with alcohol; almost half the study was new to detoxification. Approximately 60% felt they benefited from the detoxification center. Upon leaving the center, most clients were referred to a residential treatment program; other referrals included Alcoholics Anonymous and nonresidential programs. Three months following discharge 49% of the sample claimed that they had not taken a drink in the prior month; 20% were drinking as much as or more than before. Also, 34% said that their employment situation and their emotional makeup were much better than before. Other conclusions of the study are that a high incidence of repeated use of detoxification centers exists, medical management of  detoxification varies considerably from center to center, and that there is a risk of violation of patient rights and civil liberties under current practices.

The student book, which can be used as a basic text or as a supplement to other materials, consists of nine episodes. For each episode there is a comic strip and a narrative summary which students are expected to read. Each episode ends with questions for classroom discussion. The purpose of the first episode is to give students a general idea of how production and exchange took place in ancient (pre-Captain Cook) Hawaii. Episode two gives students a general idea of the economic impact of Captain Cook's arrival in the Hawaiian Islands. The economic changes which were brought about in Hawaii as a result of sustained contact with the outside world, from  1785 to 1840, are described in the third episode. In episode four students learn about the whaling trade which flourished in the Hawaiian Islands between the 1820s and the 1860s affecting Hawaii's economic and social climate. The fifth episode touches briefly on the Great Mahele of 1848 which legally divided up all the land in Hawaii and ultimately gave fee simple ownership to chiefs, foreigners, and commoners. Students examine the problems faced by Hawaii's newly established sugar and pineapple industries in episodes six and seven respectively. The kinds of economic changes that took place in Hawaii during the war years are examined in the eighth episode. The concluding episode introduces students to the factors which led to the successful establishment of the visitor industry in Hawaii.  The teacher's guide lists objectives and answers to questions for each episode. (Author/RM)",

Intended for elementary school students, the guide is presented in three chapters. Chapter I defines goals and methods of cultural studies. Five concepts that students should understand are that we are all born into and live in culture, all cultures tend to be ethnocentric, behavior is largely an expression of cultural experience, an understanding of other's cultures helps us to understand our own, and a variety of cultural solutions exist for solving human problems. Chapter II outlines procedures for beginning a cultural study. Topics include reducing teacher ethnocentricity, selection of culture study content, helping students understand their  cultural experiences, making the transition from the study of one's own culture to another culture, and teaching/learning methods. A list of readings in cultural anthropology and education and ethnographies of modern people is included. Chapter III presents specific methods for guiding a culture study. The methods enable students to learn by exploring an environment (real or arranged), and raising questions. Students test for meanings by making and using artifacts and participating in selected life processes. Instructions for constructing a family history, interviewing techniques, observations of others' behaviors, and photograph analysis are included. The chapter concludes with instructions for setting up a unit on Hawaii. Reproducible student readings are included. Over 25 transparency  masters for a study of Hawaii are appended. (KC)",

The bibliography was compiled by a resource team who are helping teachers and elderly volunteers create classroom environments in which the strengths and uniqueness of these volunteers are recognized. The books in the first section \"Aging in Society\" describe the problems, aspirations, joys, reflections, and coping strategies of the growing elderly population. The second and third sections are concerned with gerontological literature. \"Attitudes Toward Aging and the Elderly\" cites journal articles which speak to the attitudes of the elderly as perceived by young children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly themselves. The section on \"Elderly Persons as Volunteers\" addresses the many ways the elderly can maintain  active and valued participation in society through voluntary affiliation in a variety of settings. The fourth section \"Curricula on Aging\" includes materials which discuss the role of schools in helping children develop an awareness of aging. The section \"Using Oral History in the Classroom\" provides insight into the concept and purpose of oral history. The various oral history projects described demonstrate that through oral history, students may develop communication skills, gain an appreciation of the skills and experiences of older people, and contribute to the preservation of history. The sixth section is an annotated listing of children's books on aging. The publication concludes with a listing of books and articles which review children's literature. (Author/RM)",

Although written specifically for use in Ohio schools, the lessons can easily be adapted for use in other states. Most of the lessons are self-contained and include all the data and background information which students will need to complete the activities. The activities are many and varied. Some examples follow. In the opening lesson, students compile a list of countries to which they have direct connection either by personal experience or indirect connection through the consumption of goods and services. In another lesson students are given trademarks  for various companies and then asked to identify those companies which are American owned and those which are foreign owned. In a lesson, U.S. Goods and Foreign Markets, students make a list of American products sold in other countries. They then survey foreign magazines for advertisements for American products or goods and make a collage of the advertisements. One activity from the lesson How Far Can You Go On a Gallon of Gas? involves students in calculating miles that can be driven in different makes of automobiles in various countries for $10.00. In another lesson, Your State and National Defense, students learn what Department of Defense contracts mean to the people in their and surrounding states by analyzing and discussing statistical tables. In a culminating activity, students  read and discuss an article which appeared in &quot;U.S. News and World Report&quot; on January 24, 1977, entitled &quot;What People Around the World Say.&quot; (Author/RM)",

(RBS). The report also outlines a number of issues associated with the planning and conduct of the RBS Program and addresses these issues from RBS' perspective. It is hoped that future efforts in this area will benefit from RBS' experiences. The goal of the project was to make practitioners and policy makers aware of the importance of citizenship education. The first part of the report, dealing with dissemination activities, procedures, and outcomes, is sequenced according to the four quarters in the Dissemination Phase timeline. Within this sequence, the discussion is organized  according to the five categories of program activities: product development, conferences, journal submission, cost-free distribution, and miscellaneous. Two guides were developed--&quot;Words Into Action: A Classroom Guide To Children's Citizenship Education&quot; and &quot;Words Into Action: A Home and Community Guide to Children's Citizenship Education.&quot; Articles were submitted to various journals. Three &quot;Blueprints for Citizens: Words Into Action&quot; conference were held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, St. Louis, Missouri, and Phoenix, Arizona. The section of the report examines seven issues of time frame (there could have been more time allowed); advisory panel (well worth the money spent on it); publicity and awareness techniques (conferences are very effective ways to raise awareness); printing  (difficulties encountered here); indicators of impact (a more formal assessment is needed); funder's role (funder has a great deal of influence on the project's outcomes); and overall impact (goals of project were met). The appendices, which comprise over half of the report, contain many documents including a sample conference program, evaluations from the conferences, and promotional brochure for the two guides produced.

        "author":["Diem, Richard A."],
        "description":"This paper explores problems inherent in requiring elementary and secondary school social studies teachers to teach economics and be tested with regard to their knowledge of economics without requiring any academic preparation in economic education. Information is based on test scores of 34 elementary and secondary school Texas social studies teachers who participated in a 1980 nationally administered Test of Economic Literacy (TEL). Although all teachers in the sample had taken inservice training in economics education in 1979-1980, only 59% of the group had taken formal academic course work in economics. The TEL consisted of 46 questions covering seven broad categories of economics--basic economic problems, economic systems, microeconomics, macroeconomics, the world economy,  economic institutions, and concepts for evaluating economic actions and policies. Findings from an analysis of test results indicated that the sample of Texas teachers ranked in the upper 50th percentile when compared to national norms, the mean scores for teachers without economics course work were lower than those for teachers who had economics preparation, high school teachers performed better than junior high and elementary school teachers, and preparation in economics was a more important indicator of test scores than were any other factors relating to teacher background or characteristics. The conclusion is that because teachers tend to know more about a subject in which they have received academic training, state legislatures should provide teacher preparedness in a field before  they mandate subjects of study in the elementary and secondary curriculum.

        "description":"This paper offers suggestions to help social studies teachers improve the oral and written questions they pose in class and use pre- and post-question behaviors which enhance the chances for appropriate student answers. Seven types of questions are identified as useful questioning strategies in many social studies situations. They are recollection/recall, defining, topical, relational, comparative, preferential, and emotive. Examples and specific uses of each type of question are enumerated. It is suggested that, in addition to posing clear and concise questions appropriate for given situations, teachers can improve questioning situations if they adopt positive pre-questions behaviors. Among these behaviors are planning ahead, mentally rehearsing, making sure that students have  all necessary information for answering the question, stating questions clearly and precisely, including cue words to help students focus their thinking, asking one question at a time, asking questions before calling on a student, and avoiding asking a large number of questions which require a simple yes/no response. Positive post-question behaviors are also suggested, including waiting in silence after the initial response to give the student a chance to think over what was said, refraining from continually calling on the same students, and helping students feel comfortable with periods of silent waiting and thinking.

Actual pages from the materials are reproduced. Both materials with a multiethnic approach and those which focused on particular ethnic groups are included. Section I provides classroom activities and materials for use at the elementary, middle school, and secondary levels. Materials in this section are ready for use in classrooms. A few examples follow. &quot;My Origins: Discovering and Recording Family History&quot; helps  students develop a sense of identity through looking at the origins of their ancestors and making a family tree. &quot;The Native American Experience&quot; focuses on teaching students in social studies courses about the American Indian. &quot;The Asian Indians in America&quot; is designed to teach students more about the culture, clothing, and experiences of Asian Indians. The second part of the sampler contains assessment and curriculum design materials. Assessment instruments for examining the school climate, teacher behavior, and classroom materials are included. In addition, several projects developed resources for use by educators in implementing effective multiethnic education programs. The third section contains teacher training materials. In this section, one reading offers a thorough explanation of  how a teacher training institution can modify its curriculum to ensure that prospective teachers understand and can implement multicultural education. Another sampler resource in this section is an outline of a teacher training course from a handbook designed specifically for school personnel who would be working with Indo-Chinese students.

Prior to tutoring, tutors and their pupils were tested for peer group status and liking of the tutorial partner. After twenty sessions of tutoring were completed, participants were asked to rate their partner on perceived competency and personal like or dislike of the partner. The tutor's pretutorial liking of his partner was a significant predictor of the competency rating given to the tutor by his pupil following the program. Tutorial pairs in which the tutor and pupil rated each other similarly on competency tended to spend more time learning to spell each word, while pairs in which there was a large  gap in mutual competency rating were likely to learn words in a shorter length of time. Changes in personal attitude toward a partner indicated a tendency toward increased liking as work progressed. While the tutoring resulted in the students learning to spell, it did not alter the inherent spelling ability of the participants. (JD)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of behavior disordered children in selected elementary classrooms as perceived by the regular classroom teacher. Two hundred four elementary teachers categorized students according to their perceptions of the students' needs for special services. The categories were defined as mild, moderate, or severely behavior disordered. The data were analyzed by perceived disorder and by sex and race of the students. The results are discussed, and it was found that the total mean of children thought to require special services was sixteen percent. It was concluded that the needs of behavior disordered children are not being adequately met. Implications for teacher competencies and administrative arrangements are made. Changes in three  areas are suggested: preservice teacher preparation, inservice teacher training, and the provision of self contained and resource classes for behavior disordered students. (FG)",

Information about human development, career development, teacher characteristics, and the occupation of teaching indicates the likelihood of significant teacher change during the teaching years.

        "description":"Teaching and learning processes are complex acts that take place within a complex social institution--the school. Three categories of influences on the teaching/learning process in public schools are presented: external organizations, external social forces, and internal forces in the schools. The external forces considered are: the Supreme Court and its decisions affecting education; federal and state agency regulations, policies, and funding; and teacher organizations and collective bargaining. The examples of external social forces are: drugs and alcohol usage; parental influence; the Back to Basics movement; and Proposition 13. In examining the internal forces on teaching, the interactions between principals, teachers, pupils, and organizational development are traced. For  each category, research questions are suggested for further study. The conclusion states that until researchers, practitioners, and theorists identify and agree upon specific and precisely defined variables and the functional relationships that exist among them, little progress can be made in assessing the pervasive influence of social forces on education.

Three approaches to improve CBE programs are considered. In the first approach, the perceptions of professionals are employed as the basis for competency identification. The second approach assumes that effective instruction is related to a theoretical position and holds professionals  accountable for demonstrating that position. The third approach for specifying competencies is analyzing the role of the teacher to determine the tasks actually performed by practitioners. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach is considered. (JD)",

Its context is a series of case studies of evaluations performed in Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Four essays are presented. The first conveyed, on practical grounds, the notion that reflecting upon previous experience in evaluating inservice education is valuable. Future performance will depend upon the extent of understanding of previous work. In the second essay, the point is made that, if experience in evaluation is to become valuable to future performance, sound evaluation principles must be established. The third essay related in some detail those issues that the  writers of the case studies felt were major problems in performing their evaluation studies. The final essay suggested that reflectivity is not only a preliminary activity leading to evaluation, but may be essential during the entire evaluation process. (JD)",

The report begins by examining how several writers have contributed to defining school-focused inservice and explores the various rationales they put forth which support this type of continuing education. The state of the art of school-focused inservice teacher education in various countries is also briefly reviewed. Next, several problems that appear with this type of inservice are examined along with some suggestions for their possible resolution. Some roles that each of the basic parties associated with  inservice could assume in this improvement process are noted. The roles of teacher organizers, administrators, the government, and colleges are examined. Finally, the report examines teacher centers as they contribute to the concept of inservice. (JD)",

From the stage-age perspective, Piagetian theory is seriously limiting when one considers appropriate educational experiences for a group of early adolescent learners. The time an individual spends at each level varies and may be influenced by many  factors, including: innate ability; biological maturation; experiences; social influences; equilibration; parent child relationship; peer influence; life role aspirations; academic overload; and cultural diversity.

Placing teachers in small, cooperative groups to discuss the material being presented in the inservice program provide the structure and mechanisms for them to give each other support and assistance while the material is tried out and integrated into their instructional activities. Cooperative learning experiences promote more positive attitudes toward the knowledge and skills being learned than do competitive and individualistic learning experiences. There is evidence that cooperative learning promotes higher levels of motivation and personal efficacy, and results in more positive peer  relationships. The implications of using cooperative learning activities goes beyond the successful implementation of a new set of teaching strategies. As teachers and administrators become more skillful in interacting with each other in collaborative activities, their interactions with students and parents will become more constructive and effective.

The Exemplary Center for Reading Instruction (ECRI), a validated mastery learning program, was used, requiring three one-week sessions for teachers. A fee schedule based on pupil enrollment paid the salary of the two trainers, and the school districts paid the travel and per diem costs. The trainers spent from three to 25 days on site, offering several activities:  content demonstrations, observations, conferences, mini-workshops, awareness sessions, and team teaching. Difficulties in scheduling and in trainer burnout are noted. Appendices contain a sample trainer schedule, follow-up checklists, and an onsite assessment form. (FG)",

The following reasons are given: (1) The tradition of sociology is underdeveloped in New Zealand; (2) The community of scholars is scattered and divided; (3) Not enough effort has gone into the development of graduate research and occupational opportunities; and (4) Scholars in universities are poorly supported. Using memberships in organizations, interest in and conduct of research, and active participation in the wider sociological community as indicators, it was found that 24 scholars are involved in the sociology of education in New Zealand. Also discussed are the lack of conferences, professional publications, and the dearth of research and analysis and theoretical debate. New  theoretical developments and possible future areas of research are outlined, and the responsibility of universities as research sites is noted. (FG)",

        "description":"This paper is based on 42 unstructured, tape-recorded interviews, conducted over a period of three months, with teachers who frequented a teacher bar. It was hypothesized that conversations teachers have with each other in an ambience of informal collegiality serve a cathartic function. Through their interactions, teachers helped one another by creating a secure environment for the cathartic release of emotion for those who felt they needed it. The most frequently discussed topic of conversation at these relaxed meetings was the relationship between teachers and their students. A second topic was the dichotomy between community and student attitudes and expectations of somewhat rigid and formal teacher behavior, and teachers' perceptions of themselves as typical human beings. It  is suggested that the restrictive culture of the school inhibits teachers from relating to their students and peers from a genuine humanistic base and forces them into stereotyped roles. (JD)",

        "description":"In a situation where the population distribution of latent trait scores can be estimated, the ordinary maximum likelihood estimator of latent trait scores may be improved upon by taking the estimated population distribution into account. In this paper empirical Bayes estimators are compared with the liklihood estimator for three samples of 300 cases within the context of the Rasch model. The empirical Bayes estimates varied more than the likelihood estimates, due to the fact that not only item parameters, but also population distribution parameters had to be estimated from the sample data, the largest difference being 0.09 for a score equal to 20. The results were based on a computer simulation for which the model and distributional assumptions were known to be correct. For real  data, there is a question of appropriateness of the distributional assumptions--apart from the question of fit of the Rasch Model. The normality assumption can be tested by means of the test of fit proposed by Andersen and Madsen. If the normality assumption turns out to be inadequate, other distributions may be fitted to the data using an approach similar to that proposed in this paper. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"Chicanos have been limited in their educational opportunities, as evidenced by their underrepresentation in occupations and professions requiring extended education. It is proposed that intelligence testing is one part of an educational ideology that ascribes the Chicano's unequal educational existence to the group's inability to function competently within the Anglo-American institutional environment. This paper discusses intelligence testing as an educational activity, its implicit assumptions, and the educational and social policy implications of intelligence testing for Chicanos. The hereditarian and environmentalist positions are described. The hereditarian position places greater responsibility on the person for his level of inequality, whereas, the environmentalist  position employs the aggregation of personal inequality by social group to support structured levels of social inequality. The simple observation that intelligence test scores and performance in school and at work are closely associated has too often prompted intelligence test experts to conclude that the benefits of education and occupation are distributed on the basis of intelligence. On the contrary, it has been demonstrated that one's socioeconomic origin has a closer association with economic and occupational success than level of intelligence. (Author/RL)",

(2) Will the agreement between item rating profiles vary across these different groups of judges? (3) Does either agreement across items and/or levels vary systematically by instruction/method? It was found that three out of four groups of judges arrived at significantly higher cutting score levels using the Angoff method than when using the Nedelsky procedure.

Seven scales were identified by factor analysis of the responses of 396 student teachers to 56 adjectival pairs used to rate the concepts &quot;Myself,&quot;&quot;Myself as I would like to be,&quot;&quot;Myself as a teacher,&quot; and &quot;The teacher I would like to be.&quot; The seven scales measure self perception along the dimensions of creativity, orderliness, warmth-supportiveness, satisfaction, clarity, energy-enthusiasm and non-conformity. Selection of items for the scales involved consideration of possible concept-scale and subject-scale interactions. Reliability estimates are reported. Construct validity is examined from the viewpoint of predicted systematic differences in  self perception between male and female student teachers, and primary and secondary student teachers. Examples of the uses of the scales in evaluative research in teacher education are described. Two instruments, the Original Semantic Differential and the Professional Self Perception Questionnaire, are included as appendices. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"The selection and development of six tests measuring the ability to receive and interpret nonverbal communications are described, as is an attempt to gather evidence of their value as predictors of success in two occupations requiring high levels of interpersonal skills-- psychology and counseling. The tests were: (1) Inter-Person Perception Test; (2) Test of Implied Meanings; (3) &quot;PONS-audio from the Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity; (4) &quot;PONS-visual&quot; from the Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity; (5) Photo Sequence Comprehension Test; and (6) Photo Classification Test (PCT). The 106 subjects were graduate students and had taken also the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) and the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or the Miller Analogies Test. The principal criterion measure was a  faculty rating form used to rate the student on a nine-point scale in: academic work, interpersonal relations with peers, faculty, and clients; personal qualities; and predicted effectiveness as a psychologist or counselor. Ratings were collected several months after testing. The PCT seems to have been the most effective predictor, but it was uncorrelated with the GRE and only weakly correlated with the GEFT, as were most of the other nonverbal communication tests.

A field study observed 108 students in 18 elementary classrooms. Pre and post-achievement data were also collected. The data permit simulations of different intervals, schedules, sampling methods, and definitions for determination of their effects on the outcomes of behavioral observation. Findings suggested that: (1) altering definitions of time-on-task to include momentary off-task behaviors affected the conclusions for  the importance of time-on-task; (2) sampling segments of instruction would tend to obscure the positive results for time-on-task; (3) reducing the number of days of observation also weakened the effects of time-on-task; (4) timing of the observation was not very important for the noted effects; and (5) reducing the number of students to less than six may adversely affect reliability.

As an illustration of this approach, performance on inductive reasoning tasks such as series extrapolation and analogy problems is considered in terms of the factors that contribute to item difficulty and individual differences in measured aptitude. The analysis emphasizes the development of information processing models that specify content and process factors that determine the speed and accuracy of task performance. Theoretical and empirical efforts lead to the postulation of rule complexity and representational variability as two general sources of difficulty in inductive reasoning tasks. These two factors provide a basis for the analysis of individual  differences in aptitude test performance and also for instructional experimentation designed to influence reasoning skill. In general, the paper illustrates the implications of applying theories of cognition to the field of psychometrics. (Author)",

The innovation, The New Primary Grades Reading System (NRS), was implemented in a variety of settings, and the evaluations track the implementation from the early stages of pilot testing through large-scale adoption of the program. NRS is characterized as an eclectic code-breaking approach to beginning reading instruction as opposed to a whole-word approach. It employs letter-sound correspondences, synthetic phonics, analytic phonics and linguistic techniques such as displaying differences and similarities in spelling patterns. NRS is both individualized and adaptive. Once all the students are at or above Level III and receiving instructions from audio cassettes, the teacher is free to&quot;travel&quot; around the room to diagnose, prescribe, teach and monitor student progress and to assess student performance. Many studies of the effectiveness of NRS have been conducted. A sample of seven of the 20 or more studies are reported here. There is one within-school study, five within-district across-school studies, and one across-district study. In all cases there is pre/posttest information on grade 1 students. Cumulation of evidence across settings allows for greater confidence in conclusions drawn from the evaluation. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"In studying the effectiveness of different instructional practices or programs, it is possible that an outcome measure may be biased in favor of a particular practice or program because the overlap between the test and one program is greater than for the other(s). Two basic approaches for dealing with the overlap issue are reviewed. The first approach is a systematic analysis of curricula and tests to help guide test selection. A second approach to overlap is to measure the degree of overlap directly, and incorporate such a measure into the analysis. This approach could be used in conjunction with the first, or alone. Also reviewed are two ways to directly measure overlap which have been developed. The first involves teacher interviews or questionnaires. The second involves  analyzing the curriculum to assess if information required by the test has been covered by the curriculum. The teacher interview approach reflects both informal in-class instruction and curriculum-based instruction, but it may also include the teacher's expectation about student competency. Both approaches do equally well in predicting final test performance. (Author/RL)",

For phase 1 of the study, whose results are reported here, the effects of two variables-- interview length and interview effort--upon PRB were assessed. Length was varied by using either a 25 or a 75-minute interview. The &quot;effort&quot; variable was also separated into two treatments, in which some respondents were asked to check their records for the answers to household expenditure items, and others were asked to provide estimates based on memory. Respondent attitudes were assessed via a self-administered &quot;reaction form&quot; which was handed to the respondent at the conclusion of the treatment  interview. Findings suggest that: (1) persons exposed to the longer interview were less likely to express willingness to participate in future surveys; (2) willingness to complete the interview, item response rates, and self-perceived accuracy of responses were not affected by length; and (3) varying the level of effort did not affect PRB.

All intelligence tests derived from the psychometric approach are standardized and norm-referenced. Some properties that tests do not have in common and which result in different types of intelligence tests include: (1) individually administered tests; (2) group-administered tests; (3) global versus specialized measures; and (4) measures of ability versus achievement. The distinction between aptitude and achievement is a source of controversy in the field of educational measurement that is far from being resolved. In terms of  schooling practices, the inability to distinguish between the ability and achievement components of intelligence test performance is important to recognize. A &quot;below average&quot; score on an intelligence test may reflect a lack of opportunity for a child to learn what is required on the test, or it may reflect a slow rate of picking up information from the environment due to learning difficulties of the child. The former problem is one of achievement; the latter is one of ability. (RL)",

Data from school districts that participated in a demonstration study of compensatory education were used. Under current regulations, poverty-based school selection criteria and achievement-based student selection procedures resulted in Title I services reaching a higher proportion of doubly disadvantaged (poor and low-achieving) students than any other group. However, a sizeable proportion of those with access to services remained unserved. Under an  actual alteration of school and student selection procedures, the numbers of schools and/or students served was expanded. Two simulations were performed. The first, involving the substitution of district-defined achievement criteria for poverty criteria in the school selection process, resulted in larger numbers of educationally disadvantaged students having access to services. The second simulation, a manipulation of student selection procedures, resulted in proportions of students served that were not significantly different from those found under current regulations.

        "description":"A fundamental worldwide trend of the past few decades has been the remarkable expansion of national systems of formal education. Two competing theories have been adduced to explain how this expansion affects patterns of equality of educational opportunity. The thesis of industrialization holds that educational expansion tends to increase equality of opportunity. Elite mass theories claim that we can expect no necessary trend, and that expansion may easily increase as well as diminish privilege. These competing theories are tested by examining cohort trend data that elucidate the relationship between educational attainment and sex, region, and family background in Brazil. Evidence exists to suggest that educational inequalities based on sex are breaking down. There is little  evidence, however, that regional or family background disparities are declining in Brazil. The data provide firmer support for the elite mass model than they do for the thesis of industrialization. (Author/APM)",

Chapter one discusses the attitudes and behaviors of the people who form the urban community and how they relate to and affect inequity in educational resources, curriculum, integration, and desegregation. The second chapter, on urban educational leadership, examines the current situation of public schools in relation to their basic functions and suggests that change can occur through leadership and the mobilization of resources. Chapter three discusses developing curriculum in an urban context, describes curriculum models that are being successfully used in some urban districts, and proposes a six step process to  assist educators in utilizing the city as a living curriculum. \"Financing Education in Urban Areas,\" the fourth chapter, focuses upon the property tax and the burdens it places on low-income households and suggests strategies for change. Chapter five discusses politics and the curriculum by describing relevant legislation and how the political process operates at the local level to control the educational process. The final chapter offers recommendations for using the political process to increase opportunities and equal access to quality education. (Author/MK)",

        "description":"This paper, one of a series commissioned by the Education Commission of the States to identify the educational needs of minority groups, reviews the major factors that must be considered if the educational needs of black children are to be met. An important consideration is that the majority of black parents and black children have high educational aspirations. Consequently, the relatively lower scores of black pupils on standardized tests (compared to those of white students) should not be attributed to lack of achievement orientation. More crucial determinants of lower black pupil performance are identified in this paper: poverty, discrimination, and inadequate parental involvement. More than 25 years after the Brown decision, the struggle to achieve equality of educational  opportunity is ongoing. Poverty continues to be a way of life for large numbers of black families and a major barrier to the more effective education of black children. One important resource for meeting the educational needs of black children has not yet been fully tapped--black families. Parent education and parent involvement programs, especially those that include members of the extended family, may have an unexpected and important contribution to make to educational improvement.

        "description":"The Life Enhancement Counseling Model was developed specifically for the treatment of the problems of meaninglessness and purposelessness among depressed Cuban elders. The model is based on psychosocial development and ecological theoretical orientations. A life review approach is used to help the depressed individuals complete unfinished business and resolve regrets and self-reproachments, and to identify capabilities or interests that they are not presently using. Once these strengths have been identified, the potential for reenacting them is assessed. Depending upon the assessment, directive counseling and ecological intervention strategies are carried out that may lead to the reenactment of the past strengths. Life Enhancement Counseling, as it operated in a Dade County,  Florida, clinic, was evaluated by measuring its effect on 44 Cuban elders. Data indicated that the counseling method was highly effective with depressed older adults when meaninglessness of life was a critical target problem. (Author/MK)",

The studies were conducted in an urban middle school in the northeastern United States, a school that had been advertised as a model of integrated education. The first study consisted of coded observations of classroom behavior. The patterning of peer interactions implied was then analyzed by race and sex. The second study consisted of a sociometric analysis conducted to validate the interaction patterns implied by the behavioral data. Data from both the behavioral and sociometric studies indicated the overriding importance of gender as a  grouping variable and the noticeable, though less pronounced, impact of race (or correlated variables) upon interactant choice. This paper concludes with a lengthy discussion of the implications of interaction data for the integration of schools. (GC)",

A roster rated sociometric study was also conducted, in which the students rated the desirability of each of their classmates as both social and work partners. Both the behavioral and the sociometric study showed a sharp sex division among the students, along with a lesser but significant race division. The results of the study suggest that gender clustering reflects a genuine social barrier and is not merely an incidental product of divergent gender specific interests. The results of the study suggest that greater attention should be given to gender integration as an aspect of the larger goal of social integration. (Author/APM)",

Chinatown residents were found to be two to three times more dissatisfied with the quality of their lives than are Americans in general. Ninety percent of those Chinese surveyed reported that crowding has harmful effects on them and nearly half want to leave Chinatown. In terms of physical health, 82 percent indicated that they had seen a doctor in the past year. In addition, most Chinese reported that they still prefer Chinese doctors to Caucasian doctors. Regarding their mental health, 57 percent of  those surveyed reported feeling depressed at least some of the time, though 74 percent were uninformed about existing mental health services. Nearly all respondents believed that Chinese must perform better than whites to get ahead. Regarding employment, low occupational pride and prestige characterized many of the jobs held by Chinatown residents. Language was indicated as a major barrier to better jobs by nearly all workers.

The displacement of black teachers as a result of desegregation prior to 1972 is assessed. Various court decisions in 1972-73 and the passage of the Emergency School Aid Act are cited as marking a turning point in the era of teacher displacement. Current policy and enforcement issues that affect the role of teachers and their associations in desegregation policy and planning at the local, state, and national levels are reviewed. Suggestions are also provided to assist teachers and teacher associations in more effectively planning for school desegregation. Areas covered include: (1) contracts, negotiations, and agreements; (2) faculty  desegregation; and (3) inservice education. Organizational strategies are outlined regarding the assessment of desegregation needs, community relations, policy statements, utilization of technical information, and planning. The protection of teacher and student rights, the maintenance of quality education, and the provision of equal opportunity are discussed in relation to the implementation of school desegregation plans.

The paper defines important factors contributing to the general situation of out of school youth in these countries. Out of school youth include those who have no access to education, those who dropped out before completing an expected level of schooling, and those who completed a certain stage (such as primary) but did not continue into the following stage. The factors affecting those youth were identified from literature, research, project experience and reports, practitioner input, and personal observation. Programmatic responses to employment, access to education and training resources, and  participation needs of out of school youth are reviewed. The relationships between out of school youth characteristics, needs, current responses, and trends for the future are analyzed. The final section of the paper presents recommendations for programming and research assistance for projects for out of school youth. Tables of data are included. (Author/MK)",

An extensive review of relevant literature was a first step in this investigation. Undergraduate college students were used as subjects in an initial and a followup study, both of which used experimental and control groups and a pretest/posttest experimental design. The first experiment examined the abilities of spatial scanning and flexibility of closure both for increase in the abilities as a result of training and for transfer of training to a criteria task requiring those abilities. Spatial scanning ability improved, flexibility of closure did not, and no transfer of training  occurred. The second experiment attempted to train a single ability--spatial visualization--for transfer to two different criterion tasks. No improvement in spatial visualization could be inferred as a result of training, and no transfer of training occurred. Results suggested that (1) length and type of training may be critical factors, (2) some abilities may be more amenable to training than others, and (3) alternative training strategies should be considered.

However, only one substantial study of vocational education research has been undertaken. In 1974, the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council was awarded funds from the Bureau of Occupational and Adult Education for a two-year examination of federally supported vocational education research undertaken during the preceding decade. An eleven-member Committee on Vocational Education Research and Development (COVERD) was chosen to provide policy guidance for the study. The conclusions and recommendations of the COVERD study fell into two groups: assessment of the administration of the research and development program and assessment of the products of vocational education  research and development. In assessing products, COVERD concluded that vocational education research has (1) added to the body of knowledge about vocational education and its students, (2) has produced new programs and classroom techniques, and (3) has developed many curriculum materials which have been purchased by large numbers of people. Recommendations resulting from the COVERD report appear to have been a catalyst for change in the vocational education research and development process. Some changes, however, clearly went too far, and several changes which COVERD recommended have not been implemented. (LRA)",

This revision simulates the original pairing of items across situations. The revised scale was completed by 71 undergraduate education students and examined as to its  relationship to their self-reported ACT scores, grade point averages, and preferred class assignments. Results indicated: (1) the higher the ACT scores are reported to be, the more likely high ability is perceived as a major reason for success; and (2) the more that traditional assessment is preferred over short-duration, behavioral assessment, the more that effort is used to explain success.

Congress intended that the BSIP projects be demonstration projects and therefore be able to withstand the rigors of a validation procedure, contain good objectives, appropriate activities, and appropriate documentation, and allow for process and product evaluation in their designs. Congress singled out only four skills on which it would focus national concern through Title II: reading, mathematics, written and oral communications. Emphasis is not on  developing minimum skills but on using a developmental continuum in developing skills. The BSIP does not endorse any method of teaching the basic skills and is more concerned about the consistency, feasibility, and proven effectiveness of approach(es) forwarded for a particular target population based on their assessed needs.

Both conventional and Rasch Model scoring procedures revealed that: (1) variances for the three grades were equal in the  first study; and (2) no significant sex effect was identified in the second study. Both studies demonstrated that benefits can be derived by utilizing Rasch Model measurement procedures in reading research.

CC analysis entails calculation of one or more sets of canonical variate coefficients (CVC), i.e., weights which can be applied to the variables in a study. A canonical function (CF) always consists of exactly two canonical variates calculated so that the product-moment correlation between them is maximized. Thus, a squared CC coefficient indicates the proportion of variance shared by two sets of variables which each have been weighted by variate coefficients so that the CC will be as large as possible. The number of CFs which can be derived for a given data set is equal to the number of variables in the smaller of the two variable sets. CC  analysis actually involves analysis of a matrix which is computed from the inter-variable correlation matrix and is appropriately applied when three assumptions are met. These assumptions are discussed, an heuristic application of CC analysis is used to clarify how the procedure operates, and four additional coefficients which greatly aide interpretation efforts are defined. Interpreting canonical results is discussed from each of three levels of specificity. (RL)",

First, the need for formal methods to enable decisionmakers to specify more explicitly their information designed to meet this need, PIA, is described in enough detail to permit other investigators to apply the approach to their own studies. In the third section, a recently completed evaluation is used to illustrate the method's application. Several associated advantages of PIA include the  following: (1) Policymakers' and other information users' expectations and preconceptions regarding the evaluation and its findings are made explicit; (2) Policy alternatives are delineated and supporting information requirements for each alternative are identified; (3) Connections between evaluation information and alternative policy actions are given additional clarity; and (4) Areas of consensus and dissensus among information users are identified.

His antagonists agree that standard setting is a judgmental task but they have pointed out that arbitrariness in the positive sense of serious judgmental decisions is unavoidable. Further, small misplacements of the standard therefore can be considered inconsequential. In this paper, the uncertainty with respect to the 'true' standard is quantified and the consequences of the specification of the uncertainty on the optimum passing score are studied. In a second approach the assumption is made that the standard setters not only have information with respect to the position of the standard, but also relative information with respect  to the level of the target group of examinees. This information can be used in the final setting of the standard. If performance is lower than expected, one does better by lowering the standard a certain amount by means of a preconceived strategy. (Author/RL)",

Results indicated that there are qualitative differences in the estimates obtained from these two procedures.  While the parameter estimate distributions obtained from these two procedures were similar, lack of fit occurred for significantly more items for ANCILLES than for LOGIST. Lack of fit for ANCILLES appeared to be stongly related to item difficulty, while for LOGIST it was related to item discrimination. Although LOGIST is more expensive to use than ANCILLES, ANCILLES yielded lack of fit significantly more often than LOGIST, and did not yield item parameter estimates for two items. (Author/RL)",

Forty children drawn from two elementary schools and lacking in subtraction skills received training and opportunities to solve subtraction problems. In the context of training, children received effort attribution for prior achievement, attribution for future achievement, or no attribution. Results showed that attribution for prior achievement led to more rapid training progress, greater skill development, higher percepts of self-efficacy, and more accurate self-appraisal of capabilities. In contrast, attribution for future achievement did not influence children's achievement outcomes. The results demonstrate important  differences in outcomes as a result of how effort is linked with achievement. Effort attribution may have complex effects including the possibilities that the two forms of attribution differ in: (1) social reinforcement value; and (2) the type of performance feedback they provide to children. A third complexity relates to the idea that effort attribution is most effective with tasks perceived as intermediate in difficulty. The need for future research clarifying how these effects occur is suggested. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"A follow-up survey was conducted of the 1978 Educational Quality Assessment (EQA) to ascertain what impact the Pennsylvania Statewide Assessment Program had on schools and school districts. The survey instrument consisted of 20 items tapping: (1) the quality of information and services provided; (2) dissemination activities engaged in by the district; (3) value in identifying problem areas; and (4) programmatic changes made. Survey responses were received from 88 percent of the school administrators participating in the 1978 assessment and are presented. EQA was found to play an important part in making decisions in areas such as changes in courses and teaching strategies. Often principals used EQA information to make decisions leading to revisions of existing programs or the  development of new programs. Many respondents indicated that EQA provided data that confirmed a problem existed or called attention to problem areas not previously noted by the district staff. &quot;Percentiles on student performance areas&quot; and &quot;scores compared to predicted range&quot; were selected as the most useful type of scoring and statistics used in the school report, although all six options were selected by at least 50 of the 99 school administrators.

In selecting topics, potential sources of bias such as funding sources and publishing patterns are covered. How knowledge of appropriate literature, selection of independent variables, and control of sources of invalidity can be sources of bias in design are examined. The effects of these sources in terms of incomplete testing for race or sex similarities and differences, use of biased independent variables, and incomplete blocking or control of confounding variables are discussed. Bias and sampling are discussed covering the sources of bias (composition and selections of samples, the effects  of single sex or race samples, organizations, use of different race or sex samples for different content areas), and the results of that bias. The section on bias and measurement investigates the effect of bias on observation, aptitude and achievement tests, vocational tests, and affective tests. The section on bias and the generation of conclusions examines the way that bias can encourage overgeneralization, incorrect attributions of causality, and conclusions based on expectations rather than on data.

It was expected that the Instructions/Headings group would outperform both the Headings Only and Control (no instructions or headings) groups, and that the performance of the Headings Only group would be superior to the Control group's. A 2,500-word prose passage extracted from an introductory college testbook on ecology was used as the to-be-learned material in this experiment. The Delta Vocabulary Test and the Group Embedded Figures Tests were used as measures of individual differences. Four dependent measures used to assess performance on the ecology passage were an essay exam, outline exam, short-answer exam, and multiple  choice exam. Data were analyzed via six analyses of covariance. Results revealed that the Instructions/Headings group performed significantly better than the Headings Only and Control Groups on selected measures. No significant differences, however, were found between the Headings Only and Control conditions. In addition, it was found that field independent students outperformed field dependent students on a number of recall measures. Results are discussed in relationship to previous studies in this area.

When the individual is the unit of analysis, the outcome of interest is individual achievement and the variance explained by school or district level predictors is between individuals. A technique called situational regression (SR) is described which provides a link between these levels of analysis. SR involves regressing a criterion variable measure at the individual level on one or more predictor variables measured at the group level. Predictors are measured characteristics of the groups e.g., schools, to which individuals belong and may include  socioeconomic status (SES), percent daily attendance at the school (ATTEN) and the number of resource teachers assigned to the school (REST). Data illustrating the SR technique were taken from composite student achievement scores of all grade 5 students in one district and regressed on SES, ATTEN, and REST. These three school level variables together accounted for almost 17 percent of the individual variance in achievement scores and represented nearly 70 percent of the between school variation in achievement.

The two major facilitator responsibilities are: (1) to facilitate local implementation of the state mandated program; and (2) to serve as a state-local communication link. Data were collected by Maryland State Department of Education documents, survey questionnaires, and interviews. Respondents included SEA senior management, Project Basic staff, facilitators, and LEA coordinators. Findings are reported for two points in time: July 1979 and July 1980.  Results indicated that the facilitator role was perceived as successful by all levels of the educational hierarchy in that facilitators ensured local implementation of the project and maintained good relationships between state and local agencies.

All students completed the Teacher Treatment Inventory (TTI), consisting of 44 items describing ways in which teachers work with students. Additional data collected from all students included year end achievement scores and a self-concept of attainment measure. Teachers provided rankings of expected achievement in reading, mathematics, and schoolwork for each  of their students. According to students, low achievers get more negative feedback and teacher direction, and more work and rule oriented teacher behaviors; high achievers get higher expectations, more opportunities to participate, and more choice of tasks. Hierarchical regressions analyses showed that year end achievement was less effectively predicted by prior achievement, but more effectively predicted by teacher expectations in high than in low perceived differentiating classrooms.

The advent of NAEP public-use data files opens up many possibilities for those who have the skills, time, and resources to do secondary analysis. An analysis of the mathematics test items is presented which demonstrates alternate procedures for developing indicators of mathematics achievement. This analysis demonstrates that the NAEP item subsets will not always meet conventional psychometric criteria. This failure to meet standard achievement test criteria does not mean that secondary analysis of the data is unwise. It  does imply, however, that interpretation of findings, especially those using subtests, must be made cautiously. Limitations of the methodology must be acknowledged. Conventional achievement testing is not item-centered like assessment testing. The measurement priority of assessment is stability across multiple testings, not relative comparisons among persons. Consequently, standards of item discrimination and construct validity have obviously less import. Of far greater importance for assessments are standards of face validity, content validity, internal consistency and the application of rigorous data analysis techniques.

If any aspect of an evaluation is unlikely to provide any net-benefit to humanity as far as the overall evaluation is concerned, then it probably shouldn't be done given the relative scarcity of evaluation resources and energy. Examples of net-nonbeneficial energy-wasting evaluation activities include: (1) carrying out overly complex statistical analyses; (2) dissemination and use (or lack thereof) of the draft version of the Standards produced by the Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation which  forbade the draft version to be cited, duplicated, or distributed without written permission of the Chairman of the Standards Committee; and (3) the publication of articles including excess spending of time in adhering to style guidelines. Determining whether an evaluation activity has the potential to lead to net-benefit is clearly not always an easy task, but it is an effort toward achieving accountability. (RL)",

        "description":"A research project was conducted based on the hypothesis that metropolitan school desegregation, by removing white enclaves in the schools, has an effect on the way housing choices are made and results in lower levels of housing segregation. By comparing seven pairs of cities that are otherwise similar (in terms of size, region, minority percentage, and ethnic mix), it was consistently found that the city with metropolitan school desegregation experienced more housing integration than its counterpart, the city without metropolitan desegregation. The cities examined varied in regard to their size, their ethnic minorities, and the region of the country in which they are located. They include Bridgeport, Connecticut and Springfield, Massachusetts; Richmond, Virginia and Charlotte,  North Carolina; Augusta, Georgia and Greenville, South Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia and Tampa-St. Petersburg, Florida; Saginaw, Michigan and Racine, Wisconsin; Tulsa, Oklahoma and Wichita, Kansas; and San Bernardino and Riverside, California. The research also documented differences in the ways schools are used by housing sellers, depending on the factor of metropolitan school desegregation, with advertisements for housing in communities with segregated schools consistently using school names.

Respondents were asked to identify the biggest obstacle to the use of evaluation data and how TAC could help to improve evaluation use. Data quality was the most frequently cited obstacle to effective use of evaluations. Other obstacles cited reference data interpretation, quality of objectives, timing of the evaluation-report cycle, limitations of the Title I Evaluation and Reporting System, negative or inappropriate uses of data,  confounding results across programs, focusing the evaluation reports, and training at the wrong level. More direct training on data interpretation and use and on implementation evaluation, assistance with local studies, and a refocusing of evaluation on the building level were seen as vehicles for TAC to provide help for evaluation improvement.

Placing an emphasis on the desegregation of Bradford's schools, the paper is organized roughly into two main sections. After some introductory remarks, the course of events since World War II in the development of black input to the schools is outlined. A description of the dual structure once operating in the district is also presented. Secondly, the  events and processes in the development of black input are focused upon in order to describe the importance of the school district in community relations, the peculiar features of the political and organizational situation defining the context for conflict, and the strategies that operated in the process of change and resistance.

The Task Force identified three outstanding tasks that must be approached simultaneously in order to desegregate schools: the elimination of urban segregation through educational planning and housing policy, the extension of the States' responsibility for desegregation, and the development of new approaches to attack racial and ethnic bias. Nine proposals were made to assist States in carrying out their commitments to desegregation. They called for (1) clear policy directives, (2) commitment to policy, (3) understanding and  using existing state policy, (4) encouraging Federal coordination of programs for urban integration, (5) financial and psychological incentives, (6) incentives to increase residential opportunities for minorities, (7) technical assistance, (8) monitoring and sanctions, and (9) public understanding and support.

In this paper design, analysis, and reporting considerations important to the application of ANCOVA-type techniques in educational settings are described. Problems that arise from the use of complex data analysis techniques are identified, based on a review and critique of the evaluation of the national Follow Through program. Specific information that should be included in an evaluation report when ANCOVA-type techniques are used is described. Examples of the kinds of problems that appear when collecting data in school settings are provided in order to  illustrate the need for this information. Alternative ways of presenting the needed information in an evaluation report are discussed. The overall perspective is that evaluation reports must be more precise and indicate the limitations as well as strengths of the methodology used for the specific setting. (Author/APM)",

The first stage of the study focused on literature reviews that investigated the influence of the family on achievement and intelligence, cultural characteristics of Puerto Rican parents that should be considered by schools when developing relationships with the Puerto Rican community, and the past involvement of Puerto Rican parents in school decision making. During the second phase, selected procedures for obtaining information from Puerto Rican parents about their perceptions of schools' responsiveness to the needs of Puerto Rican children and about the specific needs of particular children were developed. One  of the identified procedures was field tested during the third stage. Recommendations for future research and policy formation are included. (MK)",

Black infants from lower status communities, ages 22-41 months, were evaluated during the early intervention study. Instruments used included the Peabody, Cattell, and McCarthy psychometric intelligence tests. Over time, all groups declined significantly in average IQ score, but program groups, by comparison to the control group, did much less so on the Cattell-McCarthy sequence. At the third and final testing, Peabody and McCarthy mean IQ scores differed an average of 25 points across the three groups. Program children, generally, were superior to controls on the McCarthy  measure of expressive language. The findings suggest the effectiveness of some types of intervention programs, and also suggest the different socialization processes to which black and white children are exposed. (Author/APM)",

It is divided into four principal parts. The first, &quot;Summary of Findings and Recommendations,&quot; summarizes findings about local programs implementing YEDPA and suggests strategies and tactics to guide the Department of Labor in forthcoming operations. The second, &quot;Program Experience in Fiscal 1978,&quot; reviews administration and operation of local youth programs. Issues covered in this section are linkages between prime sponsors and local schools, the client population, interaction between the summer job program and YEDPA, local accountability, spending patterns, and discrepancies between planned and actual  performance. The third section, &quot;Planning for 1978,&quot; identifies changes in local programming from the first to second year of YEDPA and analyzes the reasons for the changes and their likely consequences. Changes in procedures and operations, institutional roles, and policy are discussed. The fourth section, entitled &quot;The Local Perspective,&quot; adopts the prime sponsor perspective and examines some of the local conditions that have had an effect on YEDPA implementation. Prime sponsor staff stability and the role of regional offices are covered. (MN)",

The project was designed to assist youth in making a successful transition to adulthood through community-based and learning center experiences, and was implemented by the Harlandale and San Antonio school districts. Learning resources consisted of those in the learning center and those provided at community sites, with about 100 students participating each year. Both process and outcome of the project were evaluated. The process evaluation reviewed and assessed personnel, learning center, community sites, students, learning plans, learning activities, and student records through three intensive site visits. The program was found to be conducted in an  appropriate manner; some difficulties were noted in establishing experimental and control groups for the evaluation and having students meet all EBCE model requirements. The outcome evaluation used experimental and control groups of unknown equivalence and a set of instruments measuring relevant variables in career, basic, and life skills in a pretest-posttest design. Program efficacy was not confirmed in the career or life skills area, and mixed results were obtained for basic skills. Survey results from students, parents, and employers offered strong testimony regarding program quality and value. Recommendations were offered for project records and program refinement.

As a result of the study, an inservice education program for part-time faculty at the college that could serve as a model for other institutions was developed, and the program was implemented by means of a pilot project, evaluated, and followed by a full workshop to meet strongly felt inservice needs. The study was conducted by sending needs assessment letters to state departments of education, division of community colleges, in each of the forty-four states that has a public community college system, and by surveying the entire part-time vocational  faculty at Okaloosa-Walton to determine their most strongly felt inservice needs. Though only 16 percent of the state departments indicated that inservice education was provided for part-time faculty in their state, 40 percent recognized the need for it. The part-time faculty at Okaloosa-Walton identified metric measurement, teacher liabilities, motivating students, and teaching disadvantaged students as their most strongly felt inservice needs. All participants in the pilot and full-service workshops found the workshops to be beneficial. It was recommended that all community colleges employing part-time vocational faculty develop and implement inservice programs designed specifically to meet the needs of part-time instructional personnel.

        "description":"A study was conducted to address the question of what impact the expansion of employment and training programs for youth (such as the Youth Employment Demonstration Projects Act of 1977) is likely to have on employment and unemployment of young people. The method used in the analysis was to specify a model (similar to the Markov model) of the youth labor market which focuses on turnover flows between employment, unemployment, and school; and then to introduce employment and training programs and determine their impact on employment and unemployment both in the short-run and the long-run. The theoretical model identifies those program characteristics which are important in affecting employment and unemployment: (1) the extent to which the program is targeted at a particular group,  e.g., the unemployed, low income, etc.; (2) the placement rates of individuals leaving the program; (3) the scale of the program; (4) the timing of the program; and (5) whether or not the program changes the participants' longer-term labor market success. Using these factors, it was predicted that the impact of spending $500 million more on youth employment programs would mean a reduction in unemployment rates of between 0.1 and 0.9, depending on the assumptions made. The study laid the foundation for future examination of these issues with manipulation of different variables. (KC)",

These positions were then allocated across demographic groups on the basis of the distribution of enrollees by demographic group in the two years. The total expansion consisted of 221,000 jobs. Using the figures above and other factors in a simulation, it was estimated that the equilibrium impact of an expansion in youth employment and training programs by 221,000 slots with labor  market conditions being what they were in fiscal 1977 would be reductions in unemployment rates of slightly more than one percent for nonwhite teenagers and small or negligible changes for other population groups.

        "description":"This paper develops an approach to estimating the effect of government employment and training programs on measured unemployment. The theoretical aspects of the method draws heavily on earlier work on labor market flow equilibrium (see note). Previous estimates of the direct or statistical impact of government programs on the unemployment rate have not been based on a general equilibrium model and no attempt was made in these studies to constrain the labor market to be in equilibrium. This paper describes an empirical procedure based on Markov flow equilibrium and then implements it with data on youth employment and training programs. Models with both constant and variable transition probabilities are analyzed. The results are contrasted with results of the alternative  methodology used in previous studies. (Author)",

The study focused on such issues as funding mechanisms; federal and state roles; local implementation; special needs of women; state sex equity coordinations; state plans, reports, and public hearings; administrators, counselors, and instructors; curricula and texts; and related legislation. Data in general showed that women have taken a greater part in vocational education, especially in sex-mixed programs, and less noticeably in non-traditional programs, than they did before the legislation was enacted. The  report is organized in the following five sections by the major phases of the study: (1) an introduction to the issues involved and the methodology of the study; (2) an analysis of state reports and national and state enrollment data; (3) an analysis of recent research studies conducted to identify the impact of vocational education on women and men; (4) a description of the two public hearings conducted for this study and a summary of the issues raised; and (5) appendixes which contain analyses of state reports and enrollment data, a matrix of the contents of state plans, and other details of the study.

Three units deal with establishing recruiting contacts, developing recruiting software, and implementing recruiting activities. The three units of section 2  are designed to help vocational instructors teach their students how to find, get, and keep a job after graduation. Section 3 (2 units) concerns both student follow-up and employer follow-up. The final section (2 units) covers such miscellaneous responsibilities as (1) improving instruction through inservice education, occupational up-dating, and membership in professional organizations and (2) effective use of and working with advisory committees.

        "description":"A study of adaptation to work as both a process and an outcome was conducted. The study was conducted by personal interview that probed adaptation with respect to work's organizational, performance, interpersonal, responsibility, and affective aspects; and by questionnaire using the same aspects. The population studied consisted of persons without a college degree, aged seventeen to thirty, and recently employed at a new job. About one-third were at their first full time job, and two-thirds had received vocational training. Data were analyzed by both descriptive and rigorous methods. The results of the study suggest that, for those who adapt successfully, a hierarchy or sequence of adjustments may be involved which may be explained in terms of the five aspects of work selected as  the basis of analysis. The worker initially concentrates on job performance skills, then begins to adapt to co-workers, adapts to the organization, and creates interpersonal relationships with peers. The study's findings point to the importance of employers defining their expectations of new employees with respect to their performance, role in the organization, sources of information, and relations to supervision; the findings also point to the importance of preparing students to have realistic expectations of the workplace. Recommendations include replication of the study using validated adaptation measurement instruments and subjects more representative of the general population. (KC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to assess competencies for employability--preparing for, getting, keeping, and advancing in a job; where, in the public's opinion, such competencies should be taught; and where they are actually learned. National surveys of samples of the general adult public, public school teachers, high school seniors, and employers were conducted. Competencies dealing with traditional job values and expectations were perceived by the four response groups as being predominantly the responsibility of the home. Competencies relating to job advancement and promotion were perceived to be primarily the responsibility of the work place. The teaching of active worker behaviors concerning taking charge of oneself and getting ahead were assigned to the work place and the school,  and the teaching of job search skills was seen as chiefly the responsibility of the school. Important findings suggest that the teaching of employability skills is perceived by the public, and by groups with vested interests in employability, as a shared responsibility of the schools, the home, and the work place. Also, where employability skills should be taught is not necessarily where they are actually learned. For the most part, they are learned on the job. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Occupational transferability is an aspect of human performance that enables individuals to move successfully from one occupation to another. Insights about occupational transferability were gained from site visits to programs currently operating in fourteen organizations in business, industry, and education. These programs were selected because of their focus on job skills and their recognition of the need for preparation for career change. Five types of skill development for occupational transferability were noted; namely, task performance skills common to occupations; skills for applying broadly usable knowledge; personal and interpersonal effectiveness skills; self-analysis skills; and career-management and productivity skills. Examples from the programs show how these skills  are being developed. From this study, several tentative concepts have formed that may enhance our understanding of the competencies required to perform a variety of tasks in various occupational roles. Ten recommendations for future research and development to suggest possible directions for meeting needs in existing practice are given. (KC)",

        "description":"The valid interpretation of information related to the outcomes of vocational education is a persistent and profound problem of the profession. Some of the reasons for this problem are difficulties of communication, problems of definition, problems of collecting and interpreting data, and lack of documentation. The primary problem appears to be lack of commonly accepted definitions of &quot;vocational student,&quot;&quot;relatedness&quot; of training to employment, &quot;job performance,&quot; and &quot;job satisfaction.&quot; To address these concerns, a National Conference on Outcome Measures for Vocational Education was held in August 1978. The four major papers presented at this conference are contained in this document. In the first paper, Mary Bach Kievit explains the values of the various groups directly  concerned with vocational education, analyzes the impact that these values have on the perspective through which members of each group view vocational education, and ascertains the implications for choosing and interpreting outcome measures in vocational education. Then John Jennings describes the context in which the new evaluation requirements for vocational education came about in the Vocational Education Amendments of 1976, and the nature of those requirements. In the third paper, Donald W. Drewes examines the effects of standardized outcome measures through federal, state, and local levels. Finally, Grant Venn suggests that traditional success criteria in both work preparation and in general education are not relevant to the future. Somehow, the two must be put together and changed  if vocational education is to meet the needs of both learner and society. (KC)",

        "description":"United States economic courses of action--and inaction--are increasingly being based on the employment and unemployment figures put out monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Yet, the basic statistical concepts that are still used were fashioned during the Great Depression and do not take into account the very different conditions we have today. The BLS divides people into one of three groups: unemployed workers, unemployed persons, or &quot;not in the labor force.&quot; These labor force definitions have lost a good part of their significance because of dramatic changes of social mores, such as the two-income family and income transfer payments (e.g., Social Security). On the other hand, many people are working full time, year-round, and are still living in poverty. Different  types of measurement are needed in order to reflect the real problems that exist in this society. One way to do this is to add another dimension to the three that have been measured: the number of persons who are unable to attain an adequate standard of living through work. Another problem is whether to count students who want part-time work as unemployed. Because of these problems, Congress has created a National Commission on Employment and Unemployment Statistics to examine the procedures, concepts, and methodology involved in measuring labor market activities, and their adequacy for policy determination. The Commission needs input from those concerned with employment and unemployment (such as vocational educators) to determine a better way of reporting these statistics.  (KC)",

Focus on the analysis was on determining if there were consistent findings with regard to seventeen selected employment, educational and training, and ancillary effects variables. These variables were employment/unemployment, occupation related to training, earnings, employee satisfaction, employer satisfaction, attitudes toward work, work habits, basic skill attainment, academic abilities, attendance and dropout, occupational skill attainment,  continuing education, satisfaction with training, aspirations, attitudes and values, feelings of success, and citizenship. No difference in unemployment rates was found for vocational and nonvocational high school graduates. Postsecondary graduates generally had lower unemployment rates. Mixed results were reported for earnings, basic skill attainment, and academic abilities. Vocational students were satisfied with their training and reported feeling good about themselves. Fewer vocational graduates continued their education beyond the secondary level. Insufficient data were available concerning occupational skill attainment and dropout rates. (MN)",

A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)  procedure was applied to compare groups' degree of equity ratings. Results in phase 1 of the study identified eleven admission standards or practices which were being used to admit students to public occupational education programs. Phase 2 of the investigation identified four admission practices which were consistently rated as having the greatest degree of equity and four with the least degree of equity.

In 1978-79, eighteen high schools in seven states were evaluated using a pretest-posttest, experimental-control group design. Both experimental and control schools were monitored by telephone calls and site visits in addition to pre- and posttests. A group of experts in fields related to career development and practice completed 21-page rating instruments for each participating high school. A score describing each school on each variable was calculated by forming the average over the three or four raters who rated each school. Data were analyzed using analysis of  covariance (ANCOVA). Results showed positive growth of career development activities in the experimental schools as opposed to the controls. It was concluded that the gains were of sufficient magnitude to be nontrivial, and that CPSS addresses an important educational need.

The first section considers studies of job satisfaction from the beginning of the twentieth century and shows how the various approaches are not conflicting but contribute different and often complementary dimensions for understanding the nature and sources of job satisfaction. Measures of job satisfaction are also mentioned, and conclusions regarding job satisfaction research are drawn from the literature. The second section focuses on Lofquist and Dawis's Theory of Work Adjustment (work is the interaction between an individual and a work environment in which each has requirements of the other). In section 3 this theory  is applied to vocational education programs and policies.

        "description":"This paper provides an overview of the occupational regulation system, particularly licensure, in order that vocational educators may provide input into the regulative process and adequate information to students. The purpose and background of the licensure regulation process are traced. The function and workings of licensing boards are discussed. Licensing regulations that directly affect vocational education programs (those that pertain to education and training, experience, and examinations) are described. Licensing requirements that are unrelated to skill development and evaluation (residency, good moral character, and citizenship) are also covered. Mandatory continuing education, reexamination, and peer review are examined as strategies to ensure continuing competence of  licensees. Several of the broader ramifications of licensure, including increased costs, restricted entry to jobs and training, limited scopes of practice, limited interstate mobility, and diminished opportunities for minorities and women, are discussed. Ten policy considerations and recommendations are included. An appendix lists various national governmental and non-governmental agencies supplying information about licensing and certification and state occupational and professional licensing agencies.

        "description":"A paper analyzed the opportunities for developing a vocational energy education program under existing legislation, summarized the present status of energy-related vocational education, and addressed major issues that need resolution before energy-related vocational education can be expanded. There is a particular lack of sufficient funding for current secondary level programs and little funding for developing new programs. While extensive curriculum and instructional materials development is taking place, this development is inadequately supported, duplicative, undocumented, and not shared within the field. Lack of clear distinction between vocational energy education and general education about energy is another problem impeding policy formation. Definition of vocational energy  education will become feasible when the existing legal and institutional sanctions for vocational energy education (such as the National Energy Plan) and supportive education, the future energy supply, and short- and long-term job market analyses are related to current policies, legislation, and practices and to predicted educational needs. Research in all these areas and greater program dissemination efforts are needed. (Appendixes contain lists of vocational energy education sources, brief descriptions of vocational energy education and federal legislation, an analysis of future energy sources, and a historical perspective on definitions of vocational education.)

Special mention is made of two programs funded by the Small Business Administration to support development of programs to train men and women in entrepreneurial skills. Although most programs do not focus specifically on the training needs of women, the Office of Women in Business of the Small Business Administration works actively to assist women entrepreneurs. Some private sector training programs are also designed especially for women entrepreneurs. The study further raises equity issues in discussing the relationship between vocational guidance and entrepreneurship training. Although some work has been done to determine the  characteristics of the &quot;entrepreneurial personality,&quot; researchers must investigate further the characteristics and special needs of women in small business. Research must verify those traits which predispose the woman entrepreneur to succeed. In addition, educational materials and vocational testing practices should be reexamined in light of equity concerns. Finally, more exemplary programs for the woman small business owner must be developed and field tested. The federal government should extend efforts to include women in the contract procurement process and to ensure that the special needs of women entrepreneurs are met. (KC)",

        "description":"Short term skill training programs are those programs, usually one year or less, designed to train, retrain, or upgrade the skills of workers. Such programs provide an opportunity for postsecondary vocational institutions to respond to the human resource needs of their communities. A number of important policy issues are involved in the provision of short term training by postsecondary vocational institutions. These programs almost dictate the need for flexibility in course offerings and curriculum design. Mechanisms for acquiring funding, ensuring quality control, maintaining accreditation, and awarding earned credit are all affected by the development and implementation of short term skill training programs. In addition, federal initiatives, such as the Comprehensive Employment  and Training Act (CETA) and the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TRA) program may require a different approach and involve a different clientele from those traditionally found in vocational institutions. Nevertheless, short term skill training programs represent a viable means for vocational educators to become involved in regional, statewide, or local economic development efforts. Economic development efforts by vocational educators have been underway in a number of states, though Tennessee, South Carolina, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin are highlighted. In addition, the point is made that business and industry are willing to establish programs in cooperation with vocational institutions if those institutions are willing to tailor their programs to specific human resource needs.

This tentative analysis contributes additional observations to the studies reviewed and offers pertinent suggestions about ways of increasing productivity in the United States. Discussions of topics related to policy also are included: the mix and length of programs, ways to share the costs of training, issues related to efficiency and equity, and vocational education's role in reducing unemployment and creating jobs. Needs related to data collection, the effects of emerging technologies, and developing trends also are discussed. The study suggests that  improvement in American productivity will take an investment in time and money by management and labor; that vocational education needs to develop a more flexible delivery system--one better able to shift resources when demand shifts; and, to that effect, the vocational education system must play a part in the diagnosis of productivity problems as well as in creating their solutions.

Ths summary presents the following positions: (1) earnings sharing, and the eventual  elimination of the spouse's benefit; (2) a two-tier benefit system, in which a minimum benefit would be paid to everyone and the second-tier benefit would be tied directly to earnings; and (3) universal coverage as the best solution to the offset provision of the Social Security amendments of 1977.

        "author":["Bassi, Laurie J."],
        "description":"A study was conducted to develop a theoretical framework for unbiased estimation of the dynamic net impact of Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs on participants' earnings. (The possibility of selectivity bias arises from the non-random nature of participation in the program. That is, if participation is a function of unobservable variables such as ability or motivation, and these variables are also determinants of earnings, it will be impossible to distinguish the effects of the unobservables from the effects of the program without controlling for the selection process.) In the study, selectivity biases were controlled for through the use of an error components model. The model relies on the longitudinal nature of the data to eliminate the effects of the  unobservables by differencing them away. The estimation techniques developed allow for participation to be a non-random function of individual, unobserved variables that are both fixed and changing over time, and temporary fluctuation in earnings prior to the program. This framework represents an advance in the state of the art in impact estimation for employment and training programs, since it places fewer restrictions on the nature and type of comparison group necessary for unbiased estimation and, thereby, contributes to solving a problem that has long plagued evaluations of employment and training programs.

The state programs are developing model program evaluation/management information support units. This second issuance of Observations contains an outline supported by flow charts and summaries of Delaware's case review process. Oregon's deployment of staff in tracking issues is described and illustrated with an example of the technique at work. An interim report from Michigan examines the program evaluator's role as consultant through two case histories. Virginia's approach to evaluation uses team techinques employing both evaluation staff and  program personnel. Pennsylvania's contribution describes the structure of its case review process in terms of regional and district roles. West Virginia describes an ongoing study of the pros and cons of using benefit-cost analysis in vocational rehabilitation. Mississippi suggests that development of a management information system might well precede attempts at evaluation. The report concludes with a review, contributed by West Virginia, of a new handbook in human services evaluation, and a bibliography. (KC)",

The analysis and identification was based on a summary of literature; discussions with local, state, and national officials involved with youth employment; and site visits to eight exemplary youth projects (in Boston, Baltimore, Berkeley, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Seattle, and San Francisco). Results of the study highlighted programs which return youth to school; provide remedial education and job placement; and involve cooperation among the prime sponsor, the local education agency (LEA), and the private sector. Factors linked to  program success include tying academics directly to work experience; reinforcing attendance at school with paid work experience; career education, career awareness, and job preparation workshops; well-supervised job sites; and careful monitoring of programs through performance-based contracts, centralized intake, assessment, and pre- and posttesting.

The needs assessment model development phase of this study, accomplished through literature reviews, resulted in the development of a needs assessment model consisting of seven procedural steps. The model provides flexibility for the assessment of many varied vocational education needs. The field test was conducted through distribution of a survey instrument developed and validated using methods described in the model. A panel of experts was used to validate survey instrument goal statements identified as being areas in which sex bias and sex stereotyping might be  found within vocational education. The instrument was designed specifically for vocational instructional personnel. The sample was drawn from area vocational-technical centers in Florida. The study has provided a flexible needs assessment model, a survey questionnaire designed for instructional personnel, and data tabulation and treatment methods usable in needs assessment.

A study was conducted in the Milwaukee (Wisconsin) Public School System to determine the effect of the use of these materials with approximately 560 exceptional students (mentally handicapped, emotionally impaired, and learning disabled) in  junior high/middle schools. Based on in-depth interviews with twenty individuals representing administrators, teachers, and exceptional education students, nine primary effects on involvment in the Alliance and use of the materials were identified. Also, administrators at the Milwaukee site reported the Alliance materials to be a valuable core career education package, and the special edition for mentally handicapped students was valuable as a core exceptional education career education program. The investigation concluded that the use of Alliance materials served as a springboard for more extensive career education programs, helped initiate a career education program for exceptional education students, enhanced credibility of the programs and ability to secure local funds, increased the  knowledge of career options and related skills for both teachers and students, and stimulated district and classroom innovation.

        "description":"The &quot;Rural America Guidance Series&quot; of the National Center for Research in Vocational Education is a set of sixteen handbooks designed to help rural and small schools plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a career guidance and counseling program for grades K-14. It has been widely adopted by state departments, intermediate service agencies, and school districts across the country. The use and effects of the Series was studied in depth in the school district of Cashmere, Washington, (involving approximately 1,000 students) in December, 1979. Although Cashmere used only four of the sixteen handbooks of the Series, those that were used were key to planning the career guidance program. The handbooks provided a way to assess the career guidance needs of 250 students, to assess staff  needs, and to establish a goal-setting process for the career guidance program. It was found during three days of in-depth interviews with twenty-five administrators, teachers, counselors and guidance coordinators, students, and parents that the &quot;Rural America Series&quot; had seven primary effects on Cashmere's career guidance program. In general, the users of &quot;Rural America&quot; recommended the Series for its completeness, general applicability, high quality, and its valuable use as an organizational tool. They also cited its compartmentalized organization and its ability to promote confidence in its users. As drawbacks, users specified the large amount of material, its poor readability, the intensiveness of the training, and the Series' bulky packaging. Four recommendations for the National  Center and two recommendations for the users of the materials were made at the conclusion of the study. (KC)",

        "description":"The Performance-Based Teacher Education (PBTE) curriculum developed by the National Center for Research in Vocational Education has been widely adopted by colleges and universities training vocational education teachers. In order to determine whether PBTE works, two sites using PBTE--Temple University and the University of Central Florida--were studied in depth; results were verified through conducting telephone interviews and surveys covering seventy-one additional PBTE programs. Three levels of effects of PBTE were investigated: (1) effects on vocational teacher education programs; (2) effects on vocational teachers; and (3) effects on vocational education classroom and students, with the following results. It was found that PBTE has precipated significant changes in many  vocational teacher education programs, helped university vocational education departments survive crises of declining enrollment, and made teacher education more productive. There is evidence that PBTE is having long-term impact on improving the caliber of vocational education teachers, especially in the areas of instructional planning, organizing instruction, student reinforcement, individualizing instruction, and student evaluation. PBTE also has contributed to vocational education classrooms by increasing the use of competency-based techniques with students, and improving the performance of local school administrators in evaluating teachers. Overall, respondents gave PBTE very high marks. The few negative comments mostly were criticism of performance-based education in general rather  than of PBTE itself. (KC)",

Chapter 1 lists its four aims: analyze pertinent federal and state legislative provisions, identify competencies needed by guidance personnel to effectively conduct a comprehensive career guidance program, develop competency-based training materials, and train guidance personnel in use of materials. Chapter 2 presents procedures used, by the twelve major and two administrative objectives: (1) identify and characterize legislation; (2) identify competencies required of personnel; (3) identify, select, and describe existing career guidance program material resources; (4) develop and disseminate general audience project brochure;  (5) develop project training materials; (6) identify support materials; (7) pilot test training and support materials; (8) conduct national training workshop; (9) conduct four regional training workshops; (10) conduct state-level training workshop; (11) conduct national dissemination workshop; (12) evaluate project effectiveness; (13) utilize national advisors and consultants; and (14) prepare reports. Evaluation of regional workshops and state-level workshops is summarized in chapter 3. Chapter 4 discusses conclusions within the context of each separate objective. Recommendations made in chapter 5 are clustered into six categories: pre- and inservice for guidance personnel, certification, testing of competency materials in varied settings, future use of trained trainers, and materials  dissemination.

Three pairs of census district offices, matched on variables related to difficulty of enumeration, were randomly assigned to the two training methods and used training guides prepared using the two models. Data from 1197 JPA-trained and 1389 control enumerators were available for analysis. Attitudinal data, collected before and after job experience, served as basis for comparison. (Only some collected performance data were  analyzed for reasons described.) Both training approaches were very successful in terms of positive ratings by trainees. JPA trainees, however, gave significantly higher ratings of training quality, job preparedness, reading ease of training materials, adequacy of training length, and ratings of specific activities. They also reported significantly higher level of on-the-job manual use and better coverage of critical job tasks during training. Supervisors familiar with both training approaches expressed preference for the JPA training. (Questionnaires, job performance record, and data tables are appended.) (YLB)",

Topics covered include personal, professional, and societal changes; responses to change; theoretical approaches to change; the change agent; a model for change; and change implementation. Part II is designed to assist home economics teachers as they help students to recognize, accept or reject, manage, and initiate change in their own lives. It is divided into three sections. First, learning activities are presented  which will involve students as they explore the concept of change, describe changes in their lives, identify attitudes toward change, and recognize how these attitudes affect change management. The second section includes learning activities designed to assist students in determining how they have managed or are managing change in their own lives. Finally, learning activities are presented to assist students in developing change agent skills. All activity areas in all three parts follow a similar format: objectives, principles, and learning activities. Evaluative questions and forms are included within the learning activities. (YLB)",

Critical affective work competencies (Neat/Orderly/Personal Appearance/Manner and Pleasant/Friendly/Cheerful) were identified from data collected during a pilot administration of the Affective Work Competencies Inventory (AWCI). After review of possible instructional procedures and analysis of the projects' participants, an individualized training format was selected. A profile-feedback system was designed, prepared, and utilized to provide inventory results and guidance information for each of the project's participating youth and counselors. Of the seven Comprehensive Employment and Training Act sites  participating in the study, three were randomly selected to utilize the Pleasant/Friendly/Cheerful module and three were selected to use the Neat/Orderly/Personal Appearance/Manner training module. The remaining site was the experimental control group. For a post-test, the AWCI was administered to 126 project participants. The immediate achievement effect for youth utilizing the modules was statistically significant. (YLB)",

Using Ajzen and Fishbein's model of behavioral prediction based on attitudinal assessment, males identified as WMLM's, sincere liberals, and traditionalists from the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) were compared. Subjects were asked to pose for photographs in nontraditional sex-roles, complete questionnaires regarding their attitudes about posing, release photographs for use, and complete a measure of sex-role attitudes. Analyses of behavioral intention scores and the number of signatures on photo-release forms revealed that only WMLM's held attitudes consistent with their behaviors. Sex-role-related self-perceptions rather than perceptions of others  may be better predictors of male sex-role behaviors. In a second study, males (N=36), chosen on the basis of their self-perceptions of relative masculinity and femininity as measured by the BSRI, attempted to learn nonsense syllables paired with pictures of individuals engaged in nontraditional sex role activities. Men high in femininity were less able to learn the syllables. Self-perceptions of sex-role identity seem better predictors of male sex-role behaviors. (NRB)",

In the integrated conjoint family therapy model, children are present at family sessions, and the therapist responds to communications made by both adults and child(ren). Problems of conjoint therapy are discussed, including the disruptive behavior of children in therapy, language level problems, and the importance of hearing every family member. A concurrent model is also presented in which the therapist sees both the child individually and the family together in family sessions. Concurrent therapies are recommended when unresolved conflicts with an absent  family member exist, as with the case of divorce, and when a child has internalized a sense of shame or badness which cannot be expressed to the parents. Problems in concurrent therapy are reviewed, focusing on issues of competition and integration of the child's individual therapy insights into family sessions. Case material is presented to illustrate techniques of integrating child and family therapy skills, as well as the difficulties and benefits of such an approach. (NRB)",

The training of psychologists with a specialization in evaluation research is reviewed, and the pros and cons of evaluation research training within psychology are discussed. Several potential benefits of training psychologists in evaluation research are presented, such as: (1) the psychologist's professional identity remains within a discipline with recognized licensing and accreditation procedures; (2) an evaluator trained as a psychologist may have a broader range of marketable skills; and (3) training in evaluation research may increase the range of career opportunities for psychologists. One disadvantage of this training concerns  the notion that evaluation research represents a body of knowledge which transcends any single discipline; the development of multidisciplinary inputs to reflect the contributions of other disciplines is suggested to overcome this problem. Additionally, other concerns of evaluation research training within psychology are addressed, and the Hofstra University program is described in detail. (NRB)",

        "description":"Several theories of the alcoholic personality have been devised to determine the relationship between the clusters of personality characteristics of alcoholics and their abuse of alcohol. The oldest and probably best known theory is the dependency theory, formulated in the tradition of classical psychoanalysis, which associates the alcoholic's difficulties with dependence-independence conflicts with events that go back to early childhood. The anxiety theory states that alcoholics are persons with high anxiety levels who drink excessively to alleviate their anxiety. The power theory holds that excessive male drinkers have exaggerated needs to feel powerful, and gratify their needs through vicarious powerful experiences while drinking. Research on female alcoholics suggests that  these women have a fragile sense of self and use alcohol to make themselves feel more womanly. The four theories each identify some personality deficiency in the alcoholic and observe the alcoholic's use of alcohol in an attempt to compensate for that deficiency. No single theory appears to account for the personality of all alcoholics. (Author/HLM)",

        "description":"Socio-psychological research concerning the relationship between attributions and coping with negative events unrelated to marriage suggests two constructs, blame and perceived control, which may influence conflict resolution in marriage. Married women (N=32) were interviewed in an investigation of attributions of control and blame for marital conflict and satisfaction with marriage. Each respondent was asked to complete a marital satisfaction questionnaire and to discuss two standard conflict situations and two conflicts from her own marriage. Results indicated that blaming one's spouse for marital problems was negatively associated with marital satisfaction and perceived personal control over conflicts was positively associated with marital satisfaction. Using exploratory path  analytic techniques, a model of marital satisfaction emerged in which the wife's satisfaction was found to be related to her perception of both husband's and wife's contributions. The husband's role was traced through husband blame to seriousness of the marital conflict, whereas the wife's own role was traced through the wife's control to the problem's resolvability. Thus, the wife perceived her husband as the one who determined how negative their marital problems were, while she perceived herself as the major force behind the more positive aspects of resolving and avoiding conflicts.

Unacknowledged victims were more likely than acknowledged victims to have known the man, to have been involved in a romantic relationship, and to have experienced greater prior and immediate sexual intimacy. Unacknowledged victims also received fewer threats of bodily harm, experienced less offender violence,  and had less severe emotional reactions to their experience. Unacknowledged victims characterized the man involved more positively and were less offended by his behavior than the acknowledged victims. There were no differences in attitudes between the two groups. Findings suggest that there are important situational differences between the experiences of acknowledged and unacknowledged rape victims, but few, if any, internal differences between the women.

To test this model, relationships between attribution and performance under failure, success, and control conditions were examined. After completing an attribution scale, 164 subjects were randomly assigned to failure, success, or control conditions. Subjects' attributions were assessed before and after taking a performance test containing mathematical problems. Subjects then completed a second performance test containing mathematical and verbal problems. Following the second performance test, subjects completed measures of attribution, depression,  anxiety, and self-esteem. Results demonstrated that uncontrollable failure produces depression, anxiety, and hostility. Performance deficits depended upon attributions made on the internality and stability dimension. The internality dimension did not have a main effect on self-esteem, and the globality dimension did not affect generalization of helplessness. Some support, some refinements, and some contradictions to the reformulated learned helplessness model were found. (Author/NRB)",

It has been suggested that high premorbid stress levels before first-time psychiatric admission for schizophrenia will be related to better outcome. Subjects, first-time psychiatric admissions classified as schizophrenic by either Schneider's First Rank Symptoms, the New Haven Schizophrenia Index, or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual II, were assessed at hospitalization and two-year follow-up by structured, standardized interview schedules, and were bifurcated into high- and low-events groups based on their mean life events score. One outcome measure represented the overall level of follow-up functioning; four other measures were residualized on initial assessment scores to provide outcome  indices independent of initial scores. Results indicated that a high level of life events stress in the year prior to a first admission for schizophrenia was related to better outcome at the two-year follow-up when the Schneiderian and New Haven diagnostic criteria were used. Further analyses suggested that these results could not be attributed to demographic factors, premorbid status, severity of pathology at admission, or interim stress levels, and probably were not exclusively the effect of &quot;precipitating&quot; life events shortly before hospitalization.

Racial differences in responses to items on the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) were investigated to identify nonpathological differences between blacks and whites. Black and white men and women (N=748) completed the CPI. On the average, there were significant differences for 34% of the items in each of the 18 scales. Current data indicate that blacks may be more cynical, less anxious, and more compulsive than whites. The other factors extend at the dimensionability of black-white differences, with the lower degree of social extraversion among blacks perhaps being the more  important. Indications are that some scales of the CPI are more subject to the influence of ethnicity than others, with somewhat greater effects present for females. New item sets for measuring blacks should be developed as well as separate norms for various ethnic groups. (Author/KMF)",

The attitudinal information given to 80 subjects consisted of a series of statements purportedly made by a target person; the behavioral information consisted of an essay purportedly written by that person. Subjects were told either that the essay position had been freely chosen by the target person or that the essay position had been assigned. The influence of the essay was initially a function of both its content and diagnosticity. Two weeks  later, however, the diagnosticity of the behavior exerted little influence. This result was similar to the &quot;sleeper&quot; effect in the area of attitude change. Findings suggest that it may be dangerous to assume that the immediate discounting of a given behavior means that the impression of the actor will remain unchanged, or that the content of the behavior will be ignored.

These model links were tested in a two-year study involving 16 third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade classrooms in 5 schools, from which 12 students from each classroom were studied. The frequency of appropriate and inappropriate student responses and of teacher praise, criticism, and ignoring of these responses was recorded at observations throughout the year; teachers also provided attributions for the students' successes and failures. Relations between success attributions and praise, and failure attributions,  criticism, and ignoring were investigated. Teachers who used more criticism per interaction cited internal stable causes less often and cited immediate effort causes more often for student failure. Teachers who were freest with praise attributed successes least often to external teacher-related factors. The most freely praised students experienced successes least often due to internal stable causes and most often due to teacher-related causes. Data generally supported the expectation communication model. (NRB)",

        "description":"Very little of the professional literature on suicide deals with suicide in jails, and virtually no references to juvenile suicide in adult jails exist. To determine if the rate of juvenile suicide in adult jails might be higher than that in secure juvenile detention centers, suicidal conduct was used as the indicator of the harmful effects of placing children in adult jails. The sample included all juvenile detention facilities, sampling of jails with an average daily population (ADP) of fewer than 250 inmates, a full sample of those with an ADP of more than 250, and lockups. Questionnaires (N=913) were sent to the lockups in the sample. Data indicated that, during 1978, approximately 392,662 juveniles occupied adult jails and lockups. Results supported the hypothesis that the  rate of suicide among juveniles held in adult jails and lockups was significantly higher than that among children in juvenile detention centers and children in the general population. However, the data did not indicate that the suicide rate among youth placed in juvenile detention facilities was greater than that of children in the general population. These results suggest that the policy of incarcerating children in adult jails may be contributing to the relatively high rate of suicide. (RC)",

Two studies were conducted: the first was a 1979 survey of teenagers aged 12-18, their smoking behaviors, and related attitudes and demographics; the second was a 1979 follow-up study of a cohort sample first interviewed in 1974. Results indicated that the increasing prevalence of teenage smoking observed between 1968 and 1974 has subsided and a decrease in the smoking rates of both boys and girls has also  occurred. Girls had a higher smoking rate than boys in 1979. The smoking practices of family members exerted a great deal of influence on the teenagers. Among their peers, teenage smokers associated with friends who smoked; nonsmokers also tended to associate with nonsmokers. (Author/HLM)",

        "description":"In its broadest sense, metalinguistic awareness refers to the study of or reflection upon language as an object--the form and structure of language rather than the content, the way in which the form expresses or relates to the message. One value of research on metalinguistic awareness lies in its potential for testing adult notions about the ways in which children try to think about spoken and written language. Metalinguistic research reveals that young children are capable of generating structurally logical written language before they are able to reflect analytically on language, suggesting a tacit awareness of the symbolic function of print. Although metalinguistic awareness implies explicit awareness, by comparing whatever explicit knowledge young children have with what they  can do but cannot explain (tacit awareness, such as their early attempts at &quot;writing&quot;), one can understand better the full range of their abilities. Hence a practical task of metalinguistic awareness research is to establish criteria of explicit awareness by which educators can say a child is ready to deal with the demands of formal or systematic reading instruction. Turning to adult metalinguistic awareness, researchers could focus on understanding as a function of what individuals have been exposed to, where they have been, and where they might yet go in their linguistic explorations.

In the first phase of the study, 66 teachers were given the Theoretical Orientation to Reading Profile (TORP), which was designed to reflect belief systems of reading instruction organized around a continuum from an emphasis on units of language smaller than words to an emphasis on units larger than words. In the second phase, 20 teachers whose TORP responses indicated a range of instructional emphases on the continuum were administered the Conceptual Framework of Reading Interview. This instrument was devised to elicit specific beliefs within the construct systems. Based on their responses, the teachers were identified as holding moderate or  strong bottom-up or moderate or strong top-down conceptual frameworks. Analysis of the responses revealed that teachers with a strong bottom-up belief system tended to emphasize lower order units instructionally and to believe that students learn to read by learning decoding skills. Those with moderate bottom-up beliefs emphasized sounds, letters, and words instructionally. Moderate top-down teachers also believed that students learn to read by learning decoding skills; however, those holding both a moderate and strong top-down position believed that students learn to read by reading meaningful material. Those holding a strong top-down position emphasized higher order units instructionally. (FL)",

        "description":"The meta-analysis method was used to summarize the findings of 23 studies of the word learning process that had used imagery as an independent variable as either an &quot;imposed&quot; or an &quot;induced&quot; condition. Imposed imagery investigations compared word recall on the basis of the imagery attribute of a word, while induced imagery studies compared word recall on the basis of the use of imagery as a mnemonic strategy. The results suggested that imposed and induced imagery had a great impact upon word recall. In the case of the imposed imagery investigations, high imagery words were much more easily learned than were low imagery words. Larger differences in the imagery control and repetition comparisons in the induced imagery studies suggested that mental imagery as a mnemonic strategy was  quite effective. The findings imply that a meaning strategy (imagery) is a great deal more effective than rote memorization, and that the relative equivalence of sentence generation can be explained by the fact that it is a meaning producing strategy and that it probably produces an image through verbal processes.

        "author":["Angelotti, Michael"],
        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to suggest a point of departure for a coherent program of vocabulary growth. The paper offers three premises for a coherent program of vocabulary growth: (1) vocabulary is best learned as it functions in communication settings, (2) teachers can more effectively stimulate vocabulary growth if they attend more deliberately to vocabulary development as a multidimensional language phenomenon, and (3) the more teachers know about vocabulary, the better they can provide for its growth. Based on these premises, a &quot;multifeature vocabulary analysis grid&quot; (MVAG) is suggested as a mechanism that can be used to develop understanding of vocabulary and to sort out vocabulary knowledge as a function of five variables--print form, oral form, alternate (synonymous)  form, concept, and experience. The first part of the paper defines the five dimensions of vocabulary growth as they relate to communication processes and the teaching of vocabulary. The second part discusses the multifeature vocabulary analysis grid and its potential for the classroom and for research. (RL)",

The subjects were told to read an excerpt from a tenth grade biology textbook as if it were a homework assignment. They were tested with detailed essay and multiple choice questions after reading the selection twice. The first-reading data showed that subjects slowed down for ideas that tended to be recalled, for important ideas, for ideas that contained new or unfamiliar information, and for ideas containing a high number of prepositions essential to the gist of that idea. Analyses of the changes between  first and second readings showed that the difference rate was correlated with meaning unit importance ratings, the average importance of propositions in an idea, the propositions essential to the gist of an idea, and serial position. The overall pattern of correlations showed that the subjects read important ideas 51 words per minute slower and unimportant ideas 84 words per minute faster on the second reading than they did on the first reading. These data support the notion that macro and micro variations in eye movement patterns resulted from flexible reading strategies under voluntary control. (RL)",

        "description":"Seeking to discover how comprehensively and systematically one significant category of semantic elements is taught in current reading instructional material, a study surveyed the teaching and use of prefixes in the teachers' guides, readers, and workbooks (grades two to six) of six major reading series. Findings indicated that many of the most frequently taught and used prefixes were not taught in all reading series, with no apparent reasons for their omission. The data also revealed that sufficient opportunities for systematic vocabulary development with respect to most prefixes did not exist at many grade levels in the series that were studied. The following reasons were offered to explain the data: (1) a general lack of coordination between what is suggested in the teachers'  guides and what is offered in corresponding reading selections, (2) a basic misunderstanding of prefixation in the English language by textbook writers or consultants, and (3) over-reliance on the principle of frequency or literary selections in determining the vocabulary used. Based on the data and these explanations, it was suggested that researchers may need to reassess the principles underlying the choice of vocabulary and the teaching of word analysis skills in instructional reading materials.

Among the factors contributing to students' problems in reading mathematics are the students' interest and motivational level, their readiness for reading mathematics, the reading level in narrative material, and the students' understanding of the purpose for reading mathematics. To help students associate the spoken words with the written word, teachers can point to words written on the chalkboard as they are spoken. In addition, an understanding of mathematical concepts can be developed through the use of a mathematics dictionary. Teachers should also be sensitive to the roots,  prefixes, and suffixes as new words are introduced. In order to work successfully with symbols, students could be asked to interchange symbols, words, and pictorial representations. When reading graphic materials, students should be told to first survey the graphic to determine what it is about, the manner in which it is organized, and the information that it supplies. For the comprehension of mathematical sentences, students could be asked to write the sentences in as many different forms as possible. Finally, to prepare for reading word problems, they must be able to state the problem situation correctly in their own words. (HOD)",

On the cloze task, BEV speakers had  significantly more errors for verbs than for content words when compared to SE speakers. They also had significantly more errors in selecting the appropriate time adverbial on the basis of tense.

        "description":"One of the most widely respected features of English orthography is its sequential redundancy. Its psychological reality is evidenced by the relative ease with which good readers can encode sequentially redundant nonwords as compared to arbitrary strings of letters. Its psychological importance is implicated by evidence that this advantage is generally depressed or absent among poor readers. A knowledge of orthographic redundancy facilitates the encoding of the identities and the order of letters in orthographically regular strings. Automatic preliminary syllabification is mediated by the reader's knowledge of orthographic redundancy. Orthographic redundancy is an essential property of our written language and the primary domain of its utility is in the reading of multisyllable  words. Written English is a three-tiered system: it is at once an alphabet, a logography, and a syllabary. This insight adds meaning to our knowledge that logographies and syllabaries have not, in history, been abruptly displaced by alphabetic scripts, but instead, have evolved gradually into them.

But these results do not provide strong evidence that such an interaction is occurring during normal reading. Other forms of evidence using tasks more similar to reading (proofreading errors and errors in reading aloud) produce the same dilemma. Three aspects of perception have been identified that might be affected by contextual information: where the eyes are sent, the visual region attended to, and the visual information within that region that is used for reading. But studies that have investigated perception during reading are not  definitive on these issues; and there currently appears to be no clear evidence that the contextual information environment exerts control over what visual information is used in reading, that is, over the functional stimulus. In fact, subjects appear to be responding to considerable visual detail of words that are almost completely constrained by their prior context. From present evidence, then, it seems quite possible that contextual facilitation is not achieved by reducing the amount of visual information a reader acquires from individual words. (RL)",

        "description":"Conventional wisdom holds that many children experience difficulty when they first read expository material after spending most of their reading time with simple narratives. Unfortunately, there is little available data bearing on this belief, nor is it clear how one would go about testing the claim. The labels &quot;narrative&quot; and &quot;exposition&quot; in fact reflect conglomerates of characteristics that affect text processing. However, these characteristics are not found exclusively in one type of text or the other--a narrative can possess many of the characteristics of exposition and vice versa. If children do tend to have greater difficulty with expository text, it is because expository text tends to have certain traits that produce heightened psychological processing difficulty. Perhaps  the traditional text-type classification should be abandoned in the study of reading difficulty. Instead, texts should be classified as a function of the characteristics they possess that influence processing. A multidimensional psychological classification scheme of texts could be used to identify children's text processing problems, to investigate the cause of those problems, and to bring about the appropriate instructional changes.

When memory tasks requiring the use of any of a number of mnemonic strategies are presented to retarded children, they seem to remain passive and fail to produce active memory routines. These difficulties can be overcome in one of two general ways: (1) teaching the children the necessary strategies, such as rehearsal and categorization; and (2) forcing the subjects to think more deeply about the to-be-remembered material when it is presented, a task that puts the burden on the instructor or experimenter rather than on the subject. In either case, the data from research have  indicated that the memory performance of retarded children can be improved, often dramatically, as a result of well-designed traininq procedures. In addition, more recent work aimed at producing generalization has increased optimism that the memory skills of retarded children can be expanded from merely achieving retention of specific material to the internalization of memorization strategies.

Subjects were 61 Japanese kindergarten students in an urban school and 57 American kindergarten students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The students were administered (1) a cognitive processing capacity test, (2) a letter/hiragana knowledge test, (3) a letter discrimination concepts test, and (4) a number concepts and principles test. The results showed that the Japanese students scored higher than the Americans on all four measures. The findings support the position that the incidence of reading  difficulties in the United States may be attributable to a failure to provide adequate instructions. The findings suggest that adequate instructions, perhaps in the form of a model of teaching, may be one way of reducing reading difficulties in the United States. (FL)",

A repeated-measures design was used to assess the responses of 62 sixth grade readers to target words at three levels: no context, limited context, and expanded context. Two means used to assess the meaning of target words were number of response categories and proportion of paradigmatic responding. The results indicated that meanings attached to a word were more constrained when the word was embedded in a sentence than when it was isolated. The findings refute the implications of earlier word association research. (Author/FL)",

The students saw and/or heard a short animated story, during which they were instructed to think of pictures, think of words, draw pictures, write sentences, or use their own strategy to help them remember the material. A 28-item test measured student recall of concrete and abstract prose immediately after and one week after the presentations. The audiovisual group recalled significantly more concrete and abstract information than students in the other groups, while the visual-only group had higher recall of concrete prose than  did the verbal-only group. Repeated errors (making the same incorrect response in both the immediate and the delayed tests) were lowest in the combined audiovisual group. The visual-only group made more repeated errors for abstract prose than did the verbal-only group, but this pattern was reversed for repeated errors in concrete prose recall. Students using pictorial elaboration strategies made fewer repeated errors than did students using other elaboration strategies. (Author/RL)",

The paper stresses the importance of making books from all countries available to all children in order to help them understand and appreciate  the cultural diversity of the world. The third paper reports on the use of children's literature in early childhood education in Japan and describes how literature is used in the schools to support the social and cognitive development of young children. The final paper focuses on what various countries are doing to promote reading among children, as well as the general public.

The first three chapters discuss the nature of comprehension and establish the general philosophical framework for the strategies and activities that make up the major portion of the book. The framework presented in these chapters focuses on student language, experience, and thinking; and it serves as a basis for instructional analysis and decision making. The activities and strategies are arranged according to three levels. Those activities presented at level one are intended to concentrate specifically on the language, experience, thinking, or word recognition needs of the students for the purpose of building  a foundation for comprehension. Those activities offered at level two are designed to establish specific language, experience, or thinking linkages for use as an integral part of the concept development strategies. Instructional strategies offered at level three integrate and link the language, experience, and thinking activities from the first level into more holistic strategies for the purpose of concept development.

Linguists may ask whether literacy has any effect on mental functioning. If literacy is defined as the ability to record what can be spoken, decode what is written, and evaluate what is written, the third criterion separates basic literacy from higher literacy. The phylogenetic hypothesis on the effects of literacy asks what civilizing effects literacy has on people in general, and the ontogenetic approach asks how an individual's cognitive functions alter upon becoming literate. Some studies indicate that schooled literacy has a positive effect on thinking abilities, but tests with  literate people with no schooling indicate that metalinguistic skills may not spontaneously emerge from learning to write. Where college English is concerned, teachers assume that because literacy in principle allows higher skills of language evaluation, it automatically entails such skills. Until teachers can distinguish those cognitive skills literacy may make possible from those which it necessarily entails, they cannot determine how much of higher education is bound up in learning to write, and how much involves skills of a different sort.

The linguist structure demanded by the task was the simultaneous encoding and decoding of attributes of size, color, pattern, and shape. (In English such coordination can be accomplished through prenominal adjective ordering rules--\"a little brown, spotted dog.\" Japanese is a more agglutinative language in which the ordering of these attributes is quite flexible.) Subjects were preselected on the basis of a short term memory task. In addition to the communication task, they were given a perceptual matching test to assess the relative saliency of the four attributes. As expected,  the saliency of the attributes was similar for American and Japanese children. However, Japanese children were more successful than American children in producing informative messages as well as in comprehending their own encodings and adult encodings. By age seven the American children seemed able to comprehend the linguistically coordinated manner of adult descriptions as well as did the Japanese children. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"The theory behind curriculum branching (course options extending from the core curriculum) shows how such extensions can aid the writing curriculum by fruitfully integrating branching into the sequencing of writing courses. The theory first reminds educators of the complex mix of developmental factors and individual differences--of step-by-step procedures and intuitive leaps within specified frameworks. Second, it shows that the nontraditional workshop approach is hardly at odds with branching, for self-pacing and the use of adjunct courses fit into the larger view of sequence and hence sequential branching. This revitalized concept of branching can support both sequencing and individualized instruction by strengthening the ideal behind each concept and by uncovering individual  sequences. The mere fact of pluralism does not guarantee that individual differences will be acknowledged and worked with, but branching built into an overall sequential writing program encourages an increased degree of self-awareness and individual growth. Based on this theory, three steps for integrating branching into writing sequences arise. Speaking to the issues of informed alternatives, individualized learning, and the goals of writing sequences, these recommendations are as follows: writing teachers need (1) to clarify the structure underlying the writing program and communicate it to the students, (2) to consult process as a guide to overall sequence, and (3) to build toward a final writing course that unites maturation and motivation with cumulative skill.

These committees, composed of eight to fifteen people in actual industry positions and farm operations, provided over 200 responses and comments on what they considered necessary in the English courses at an agricultural college. This feedback resulted in the revision of the existing technical writing course and the creation of a second writing course  with additional emphasis on business letter writing. Students in these technical writing courses write business letters specific to their field of agricultural study (at times with suggestions from their agricultural studies advisors), prepare seven types of research reports, and develop specific communication skills for meetings, telephone calls, newsletters and brochures, advertising and news articles, interviews, and communication among workers.

Students can help by communicating continually with their professors; by asking the professors to help establish a time schedule both for submitting work and receiving commentary; by arriving at a clear understanding about the scope, emphasis, and length of the dissertation; by showing a preliminary draft of each chapter; by working at the campus or designated research facility; and by striving to attain a realistic balance between efficiency and perfection.

The audience should shout evaluative comments during presentation and the recorder should interrupt at each spelling and punctuation error. A final grade should be forwarded to the speaker's employers. The chief absurdity of this format lies in the fact that in the world outside the classroom writers do not write under such conditions. The question arises whether the pressures and anxieties teachers impose upon student writers in the classroom are unproductive. Many children bring a spirit of language experimentation to school that is gradually changed to anxiety and error avoidance. Teachers  can reduce anxiety by lessening the tyranny of grades and presenting enthusiasm for writing. Assignments should be realistic and pertinent to students' future lives. Free writing exercises and the opportunity to revise papers will produce papers of improved quality. Modelling classroom writing procedures on the practices teachers themselves engage in can create conditions for progress in students' development as writers. (HTH)",

Beginning each class with free writing activities on topics of enough interest that they distract reluctant writers from self-consciousness can be a very successful activity. Formats such as self-analysis, role playing, description, or argumentation may vary, but the instructions for free writing are basically the same: write rapidly, whatever comes to mind, without worrying about spelling, mechanics, or awkwardness. Feel free to experiment, there is no right or wrong; free writing will never be corrected or graded. Free writing is a process, not a finished  product. One reason why some students write poorly is that much of their previous instruction emphasized correct surface features rather than the steps real writers follow toward their finished product. Volunteers reading their writing aloud and students responding to each other's writing are among alternatives to grading. Free writing can create conditions like those in which children acquire language: through trial and error they succeed in constructing an expanded and more competent grammar, and their joy in the process is both an end in itself and a means to further achievement.

In the twentieth century truce resulting from the assumption that there can be no coexistence between the two, scientists and humanists are content to be treated as separate but equal, while social scientists claim to be scientists when it suits their purpose. Humanists produce knowledge without benefit of laboratories, sometimes working like scientists, but their medium is the word, and analogies, striking examples, and logic are their nonscientific proofs. These are the rhetoricians, applying Aristotle's devices as a methodology for discovering proofs about questions that  empirical sciences cannot handle: physics can explain how to build a nuclear reactor, but not whether the reactor should be built. The implications of the limits of science on composition research are that limiting study to only quantitative research or developing unrealistic expectations about what quantitative research can deliver would ignore the mainstream of insight in rhetorical theory from Aristotle's time to today.

        "description":"Clinical report writing involves two interlinking processes--creation and communication. There are six stages of clinical inference that find parallels in generative writing stages: possessing a postulate system, constructing the major premise, observing for occurrences, instantiating (classifying) the occurrences, reaching a referential product, and predicting the significance of the inference and making recommendations. So, too, does the nature of the clinical procedure as a whole offer comparisons to generative writing procedure. An examination of clinical procedure offers three methodological implications for the composition teacher: (1) before beginning to write, students should be asked to articulate the assumptions that inform their world view, (2) students should be asked  to enrich their contexts for writing, and (3) students' final papers should be evaluated as process as well as product. Past work in educational psychology and recent work in such areas as the cognition of discovery or hemispheric brain functions show that the &quot;clinical connection&quot; has already been recognized by educators in general and English teachers in particular as one worth pursuing.

The salient components of a holistic case are the persona of the technical professional, the facts about the technical problem and the real company, the fiction created on the basis of those facts, and the form of the case itself adapted for students. Four major steps relate directly to the development of these components: (1) design the case--plan the goals and objectives for the students who will assume the persona, and establish the real world source of information; (2) collect the facts--conduct the interviews, and research the technical and rhetorical information  about a specific problem in a real organization; (3) create the fiction--transform the facts into a realistic fiction that could have happened to a technical professional on the job; and (4) construct the case--recast the fiction into a functional instrument for students to write professional documents. This approach gives students the opportunity to perform in a realistic context, using all of the skills and knowledge required in communication on the job. (HOD)",

ACT English and social studies scores and several reading scores were also gathered. All this data was computer analyzed by the multiple regression procedure, with the final holistic rating as the criterion variable. Results indicated the holistic rating as the best indicator of success in the freshman writing course, and the ACT English score as second best. Number of errors, however, did characterize the remedial writers. While the ACT English and the preliminary holistic rating are workable for entrance testing, they are not the best combination for determining freshman  composition entrance for students who have spent a semester under remediation or who are testing for a second time. Therefore the university is using a holistic essay rating plus an error count on that essay as a freshman composition entrance test for students who are testing for the second time. (HOD)",

        "description":"Recent research supports the theory that unskilled writers produce writing through the mediation of spoken language. That is, their writing contains inexplicit meanings, or semantic abbreviations, characteristic of conversations in which the listener is familiar with the situational and cultural contexts of the monologue. Two studies further examine this theory. In the first, descriptive essays written for peer audiences in grades four, eight, and twelve were analyzed. Although the total number of words increased with grade level in the samples of weak writing, the rate of semantic abbreviation remained the same, while the increase in words in the strong writing samples was accompanied by a lower rate of semantic abbreviation. In the second study, writings from grades eight and  twelve for three different audiences were analyzed. In the strong writing samples the rate of semantic abbreviation decreased from parent to peer to editor audiences, while the weak writers produced more semantic abbreviation for the peer audience than for the other two. While this explanation for weak writing requires further research, it will help writing instructors in assisting students to revise their weak writing in the direction of more explicit meaning and to understand the context-dependent aspects of language.

        "description":"The University of Tennessee trains its graduate students to become composition teachers by requiring them to assist composition instructors with the teaching of their classes, to grade papers, to confer with students, to compute final averages, and to plan daily classes. The graduate assistant is also allowed in the course of a year to work closely with three different instructors, and therefore three different approaches to the teaching of composition. Graduate assistants are evaluated by the instructors that they assist and those who receive high evaluations are promoted to the stage of teaching assistant. Those who do not demonstrate the potential for being effective teachers are offered the option of continuing as research assistants or of working with a Tennessee press  publication, so they can at least continue to work toward their degrees and still receive financial assistance. For those graduate assistants who are made teaching assistants, the process of preparation continues with the tutorial and evaluator/advisor programs. In the tutorial teaching assistants and instructor discuss the problems that arise based on their own teaching experiences. Finally, by having an evaluator/advisor, the student benefits from the experience of a tested instructor while also confronting independently and essentially, without direct supervision, the teaching of composition.

Differences among texts also extended to the grade levels at which specific skills were introduced. The introduction of quotation marks, for example, began in five  different series at five different grade levels. Seven other punctuation skills spanned four grades in level of introduction. Of the 34 different skills noted in the analysis, only six were taught in all nine textbook series. Seven of the nine series expanded punctuation instruction dramatically in the third grade.

Within the experimental group, the skilled and unskilled writers showed such marked differences that they appeared to be involved in different experiments: the basic writers demonstrated a consistent tendency to regard the second writing task as divorced from the first essay, while  the skilled writers demonstrated a distinct awareness of the relationship between their two essays. On the other hand, the unskilled writers in the experimental group showed more improvement in their second drafts than did their counterparts in the control group, an indication that basic writers are not incapable of extensive, productive revisions, though the distracting presence of rough notes and first drafts simply impedes their revising processes. Based on these results, a three-phase procedure of revising from memory, comparing drafts, and synthesizing dissonant ideas was proposed to help student writers develop a pattern of revision. (RL)",

While the students pace their reading, the teacher can judge by the journal entries whether the students are on schedule. To enhance comprehension, lectures or films are presented as background for the novel being read, and vocabulary study focuses on unfamiliar words in the text. This interdisciplinary approach allows gifted students to decide how they will schedule their reading and writing and to get past the simple cognitive aspects of learning in order to concentrate almost totally on the higher levels of thinking--analysis, synthesis, and application--recommended for  gifted students. The papers let them reach as far as they are able, and no teachers are imposing their thoughts on the students. Many students pursue independently some of the tangents created by the background information. This format seems to motivate average students also. They learn not to fear &quot;big novels,&quot; since the course eliminates some of the &quot;drag&quot; on reading. It emphasizes reading for idea and enjoyment and promotes self-discipline. (HTH)",

In addition, groups such as the national Parent Teachers Association, Action for Children's Television, the Council on Dental Health, and the American Public Health Association are lobbying for legislation that would limit the types of communication available to children. The U. S. Congress in turn is pressuring federal agencies like the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to make rules defining material permissible for children's consumption. Although this trend seems to be gathering momentum, there are as yet no mechanisms for defining what the rights of the children are and no approach that  allows for the uniform application of those rights. The &quot;heightened judicial scrutiny test&quot; would give lawmakers and judges alike guidelines to be used in insuring society's interest in the protection of children and the child's interest in becoming an informed member of the adult society. The heightened judicial scrutiny test involves answering two questions: (1) Does the regulation at issue serve an important government objective? and (2) Is the regulation substantially related to the achievement of that objective?

Foley and an attempt to replicate Foley's study. By undertaking a reanalysis of the Foley data, the question of replication in Q method is addressed. By replicating the Foley work--with recommended modifications--in a different market and holding analytic methodology constant, the replication question is further explored; and by examining the results from Foley's two studies and from the present study in the context of the nature of Q method and its prior uses, comment is offered on the market segmentation question. Detailed discussions of the reanalysis and the replication  demonstrate how Foley's Q sort was a potentially useful approach to audience segmentation within a uses and gratifications framework, although the progress of more than a decade has, to some degree, bypassed the tool and some of the ideas underlying it. Concluding remarks indicate that the Q method retains considerable utility for further investigation of audiences by segments. (RL)",

The model proposed that perceptions of situational threat would be preconditions to the saliency of trust as a concept. Given that trust was a salient concept, the model predicted that competence, motivation, and openness would serve as independent determinants of trusting attitudes. A test of the model involving 319 college students provided support for the model. Under conditions of high threat, each of the three factors predicted variation in trusting attitudes and no significant interaction effects were observed. Under conditions of low threat, manipulation of the three variables made no difference  in determining trusting attitudes. The findings show that initial trust of groups in threatening situations can be predicted from perceptions of competence, motivation, and openness. (FL)",

The UCLA loneliness scale (LS) and the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (PRCA) were administered to 170 college students. Two versions of the LS were used, one instructing the students to refer to their last two weeks of experience and the other referring to most of their lifetime. The operational definition of situational loneliness consisted of scores falling more than one standard deviation above the mean on the two-week scale and less than the mean on the lifetime scale. Chronic loneliness was operationalized as scores that were more than one  standard deviation above the means for both scales. Using these criteria, 10 situationally lonely and 9 chronically lonely students were chosen for analysis. This analysis revealed that chronically lonely persons rated significantly higher than situationally lonely persons in CA. The results were interpreted as supporting an attributional model of loneliness and as providing important considerations for the therapeutic intervention involved in the treatment of both CA and loneliness.

When this instrument was used to survey 226 persons of voting age, an analysis by orthogonal rotation of the data produced a six-factor solution accounting for 52.6% of the variance. The six factors were labeled (1) avoidance (the most potent of the six factors), (2) conversation, (3) para-social interaction, (4) surveillance (general information seeking), (5) entertainment, and (6) selectivity. The results, largely consistent with earlier research on the subject, add some potentially important insights via the use of more extensive, open-ended preliminary interviews and the consequent development of a  larger inventory of relevant items for testing. In using a lengthier and more sophisticated categorical scheme to measure gratifications relevant to political news, it became possible to make some potentially useful distinctions about what kind of surveillance gratifications are most relevant to different types of people attempting to make vote decisions. The findings, such as those pointing to comedy entertainment as a viable orientation for political cynics, also suggested that some latent, socially awkward, and systematically dysfunctional gratifications not only can be articulated by respondents, but more importantly can be empirically understood.

The third section evaluates several measures of the different types of CA and concludes that an instrument  is available to measure situational and person-group CA, some forms of generalized-context CA, but not other types.

The literature indicates that conceptualizations of empathy primarily stress an orientation toward others, while assertive communication most often places an emphasis upon the self. Although first analyses indicate a negative relation between the two constructs, empathy and assertiveness do share some essential defining characteristics. Both constructs are conceptualized as ways to facilitate human understanding, both entail recognition of another individual's thoughts and feelings, and both involve the notion  of appropriateness and flexibility in manifesting empathic and assertive communication. Some research even offers \"empathic assertion\" as a specific type of assertiveness to be used in appropriate situations. It appears that a threshold might exist whereby assertiveness and empathy are related linearly up to a point, after which highly empathic individuals lose sight of their own goals and exhibit nonassertive behaviors. Continued research into this relationship, as well as a curriculum in assertiveness and empathic caring for others' rights, may effectively improve some of the problems besetting contemporary society.

        "description":"In the face of declining college enrollment and increased budget cuts, the speech communication department at the University of Nebraska devised a successful strategy to preserve and promote itself within the university. Outside authorities were selected for a department review committee. At the graduate level, the areas of concentration were reduced from seven to four to achieve an optimum balance of breadth and depth, and dual level and advanced level courses were offered on a rotating basis. To increase the low number of speech majors, students were allowed to tailor the program to a variety of career options, with cooperation from other departments. The introductory course format was changed to a modified mastery instructional mode to accommodate different learning styles,  and the graduate and faculty teaching load was reduced. To keep the rest of the university informed of the changes in the department, each change was presented through a university committee, student course evaluations were reported, courses were colisted with those of other departments, and the department prepared a proposal to improve the written and oral communication skills of the university students with five other departments. The department also sponsors workshops, an internship program, and competitive and community debate to draw attention to the practical importance of speech communication. (HTH)",

The literature contains several case studies as well as empirical research data. One study concludes that change is more likely to occur when administrators are hired from outside the district. Outsiders were also found to be more committed to their careers and to believe they had more persuasive ability in initiating change. Another author emphasizes the importance of questioning the motives of administrators when they propose changes. Among elementary principals, those with more experience or those who employed teacher aides were more frequently viewed as comprehensive change agents.  The interpersonal climate of a school, the technological level of a district, and the personal characteristics, attitudes, and behavior of principals are also seen as important factors in the initiation of change.

        "description":"To determine the nature of middle school education as it is currently practiced, researchers randomly selected 100 seventh-grade students in 100 schools in 30 states, and assigned an observer to write down each student's behavior and describe the learning environment at specified intervals during the school day of February 17, 1977. Analysis of the observations and comments made by the observers led to general conclusions in three major areas: first, the instructional program in middle schools too often is insufficiently interesting or relevant and too frequently fails to provide enough variation in the school day; second, instructional strategies and materials are undergoing modification, but more emphasis needs to be placed on the individual students' needs; and third,  relationships between teachers and students were found to be good but were not translated into an education fostering independence of thought, sensitivity to learning styles, or the sharing of learning experiences by both student and teacher. The characteristics of seventh-graders and of middle schools are described in this report, six sample observers' reports are included, study results are analyzed, and the future of the middle school concept is discussed.

        "description":"This paper reports the results of a study that investigated factors constraining or encouraging the use of evaluation data by school administrators. It begins with a lengthy analogy about the use of a restaurant guide that is intended to illuminate how constraining or encouraging factors influence the use of evaluation data. The author defines a constraint as something a typical administrator would consider a limitation on understanding or alternative courses of action. The paper then explains and illustrates two major constraints to the utilization of evaluation results. The first is \"proximity,\" which the author defines as similarity in time or structure. Within the author's framework, \"structural proximity\" of evaluation data is the similarity of the data in structure to the  needs of the educators or the material being evaluated. \"Temporal proximity\" means the timeliness or currency of the data. The author concludes that both kinds of proximity have a positive influence on data collection. The second constraint identified is competing demands on administrators' time. According to the author, administrators are unable to pay attention to evaluation data when there are too many other demands on their time. (Author/JM)",

The practical arguments, which are based on the promise of increased educational productivity (evidenced often by student achievement), are found to be plausible but still in need of confirmation through research. The ethical arguments are an application to teachers of the doctrine of workplace democracy, the notion that workers have the right to participate in making decisions that affect their work. It is concluded that both types of arguments must be considered in the development of policy. (Author/JM)",

A review of research shows that money may not be the best way to motivate teachers, who are more influenced by the intrinsic rewards of teaching. A report by the Educational Research Service suggests that merit pay programs often prove unworkable. Taken as a whole, the research in the area points most emphatically to a single conclusion about merit pay; its potential rewards are uncertain and it should be adopted, if at all, with a good deal of care. Evaluations must be made by several persons working with specific, multifaceted, and clearly  articulated guidelines. Merit raises should not be reserved for a few superior teachers but must reward all who achieve a specific objective. Plans should be considered that reward teachers with praise or recognition rather than money, and schools should help create systems that foster more satisfying work experiences for teachers.

Each issue was examined in the light of four interrelated questions: What actors are involved in the decisions? What ends do they seek and how? What reallocations of  power, financial support, or other resources will have to be made to satisfy varied interests? and What action-alternatives are open to state school officers?

Questionnaires were returned from representatives of 51 state education agencies. The top ranked strategy for technical assistance was for SEAs to train LEA staff and community members. Strategies identified as most effective in encouraging SEA staff to plan cooperatively with other state agencies include sharing of materials and holding joint meetings between SEAs and other agencies. The rankings of strategies pertaining to the establishment of statewide community education goals included identifying state-level agencies to participate, charging an SEA  staff member with the responsibility for goal development, and presenting goals to the state board. Strategies concerning the dissemination of community education materials imply that personal contact (through such means as speeches, awareness meetings, or bulk mailings) with target audience is important. The most effective strategy for financing a state-level community education position was funding through the federal Community Schools Act. A majority of respondents perceive that their SEAs have assigned at least a medium priority to community education development. (Author/JM)",

If misbehavior is serious or continuous, a conference may be held between administration officials and parents or guardians. The final step for serious or repeated offenses is suspension of the student's transportation privileges, with right to appeal.

Truants apprehended by police are taken to OSIS reception centers where they are counseled by attendance personnel, and parents are asked to return them to school. The program, operating in several school districts in California, has been credited with reducing unauthorized pupil absence and has also been correlated with lower incidences of juvenile crimes in those districts.

Officers who must write up reports during patrol hours can utilize school facilities while remaining in radio contact with their dispatchers at police headquarters and on alert for further requests for asistance. The officers' presence in the school, and their unpredictable comings and goings, help to deter nighttime vandalism of school property. Trailer watch programs are another inexpensive way to deter vandalism of school buildings at night and at other times when facilities are not in use. In exchange for free site rent and utilities, responsible individuals or families live in a trailer on school grounds. These individuals alert police if anything  suspicious is observed around the school property and act as a general deterrent to break-ins and vandalism. (Author/MLF)",

Today everyone of the 52 schools in Flint is a community school. Thousands of educators from all over the world have visited Flint to study community education firsthand.

Two school systems have developed crime resistance programs following the FBI concept.

Security measures were strengthened, but the thrust of the program was the development of a sense of pride, caring, and respect in the school, its people, and the community. This involved the active participation of students, faculty, staff, administrators, parents, and community leaders in discussing the situation and deciding what improvements could be made. Special efforts were made to improve the physical plant, encourage attendance, develop a bilingual/bicultural program, increase parental and  community involvement in the school, and help pupils identify their successes on an almost daily basis.

The clinic operates with two programs--a remedial academic instruction program in five basic subjects, and a counseling component in which all students are involved. The results of the clinic have been positive. Since the beginning of the program, out-of-school suspensions have decreased, and the recidivism rate of assignments to the clinic has dropped.

This bulletin describes five different types of alternative programs that have been effective in dealing with disruptive youth. They include the Tri-C Community Centered Classroom Program in Los Angeles (California); Project Advocate in Geneva (Illinois); Positive Alternatives To Student Suspension (PASS) in Pinellas County (Florida); For Love of Children in Harpers Ferry (West Virginia); and the Westside Alternative School in Omaha (Nebraska). These programs are currently in operation and represent a range of strategies. For example, Tri-C uses a family-type setting, intensive counseling, and community  resources. Project Advocate operates a behavior disorder component. PASS includes eight programs for school staff and students. For Love of Children is an outdoor living and education experience, and the Westside Alternative School focuses on academics, parental involvement, and vocational training. (Author/MLF)",

The project was designed to produce six results, including the training of district teams in the three states, the development of three- to five-year plans, the development of a cadre of practitioners in local programs who could train others, and the establishment of a team of educational professionals in the three states who could provide technical assistance. The team approach and inclusion of three states was believed to  have contributed to the participants' positive reactions to the training. Recommendations for future training include more time allotted to the selective recruitment and thorough orientation of team members, pretraining orientation for coordinators with emphasis on exchanging ideas, regular coordinator meetings, and the establishment of specific definitions for planning and programming.

The factors greatly affecting student numbers are identified as births, migration, and holding power (dropout rate). The authors conclude that pupil population projections are essential in planning budgets, programs, and facilities and that educational planners should  collect information from private, commercial, and governmental agencies.

Use of the Hawaii State Test of Essential Competencies to determine student progress toward these goals was recommended, but the task force recommended development of other methods for student demonstration of mastery since state law prohibits use of any test to deny student promotion or graduation.

        "description":"Addressed primarily to practitioners--legislators, administrators, and their staffs--this monograph is structured around a series of hypothetical exchanges between legislators and administrators concerning the implementation of a basic skills program. The author asserts that the hierarchical control that legislators traditionally rely on for program implementation is contrary to the need for subordinates to exercise delegated control (individual responsibility, initiative, and discretion) over their own actions. Since the most important interaction in education takes place between students and teachers, he stresses the importance of focusing attention on the classroom in solving implementation problems. This approach is patterned on a programmatic view that emphasizes delegated  control and service delivery capacity rather than a regulatory view that emphasizes hierarchical control and compliance. Backward mapping, based on the assumption that implementation begins at the bottom, not at the top, is presented as a logical, although not a foolproof, strategy. (Author/WD)",

        "description":"Administrative bureaucracy and the professionalism of teachers have combined in contemporary schooling to structure both interpersonal relations and knowledge, leaving students and parents relatively powerless to control any of the educational processes. Through bureaucratic organization, schools create structures in which knowledge, teachers, and pupils are simultaneously bureaucratized and subjected to rationalized control. As schools increase in size, there are greater pressures for standardization and further control. Accountability and external legislation further standardize operation and performance. Such pressures may eventually lead to the &quot;hyperrationalization&quot; of schooling. Teachers respond to this hyperrationalization by asserting their professional autonomy.  Advocates of professionalism claim the unique ability to make informed judgments in specified areas. In effect, they control access to professional knowledge, the distribution of that knowledge, and the conditions under which it will be made available to students. Ultimately, the principles of bureaucracy and those of professionalism are mutually reinforcing and increase the ideological, epistemological, and social processes of control over the student's destiny. Such a result is antithetical to liberal ideals of education. (Author/WD)",

        "description":"A study of the implementation of a rational/bureaucratic model of knowledge in classrooms suggests that current modes of educational administration are based on control, via rational planning, of social relations, individual consciousness, and epistemology. Bureaucratic organization and professionalism enjoy a symbiotic relationship, combined with an increasingly dominant technological rationality that encourages the prescription of educational inputs and expected outcomes. This leads to a physical impoverishment of schools as well as the obscuring of certain interests and encourages the depoliticizing of cultural transmission, the denial of the validity of certain questions, and the trivializing of socialization. In addition, the development of sophisticated curriculum packages  transforms the relationship between teacher and student, since teachers can now be held accountable for the mastery of prespecified goals (as in competency-based education). Teachers focus on methods of teaching rather than on purpose and content. In evaluation as in curriculum and pedagogy, administrative reliance on technological rationality appears to influence content, organization, and transmission of knowledge. (Author/WD)",

The findings include a decline in the opinion that longer service guarantees better teaching, and in commitment to teaching as well as an increase in willingness to consider alternative employment and in the view that professionally negotiated contracts are a necessity for all teachers. Over the three-year period, there was a significant increase in the number of teachers who considered themselves \"labor\" and considered the administration \"management\" and who felt they would prepare  for a different career if they were beginning college again. The authors decline to draw general implications from the data and suggest that their value lies in considering each questionnaire item separately. (Author/WD)",

        "description":"Organizational communication research needs a conceptual model or taxonomy of variables for developing a knowledge base for past and future findings and information access and retrieval. The proposed Outcome-Determinant-Interface (ODI) model distinguishes three major groups of variables, each divided into classes and subclasses. The outcome variables, representing desirable organizational end results, are morale, institutionalization, performance-effectiveness, and adaptiveness-innovation. Determinant variables account for the level of outcome effectiveness achieved, and include individual-employee, work-situation and work-group, organizational, and environmental determinants. Outcome and determinant variables may be dependent or independent. Moderating between outcome and  determinant variables are communication interface variables, grouped into intrapersonal, interpersonal, intragroup, intergroup, organization-wide, and interorganizational communication. A survey of 105 organizational-communication research studies, examining combinations of the outcome variable adaptiveness-innovation with all possible determinant and interface variables, revealed that a majority of possible research categories had not been studied. Further refinement of the proposed ODI taxonomy could produce an inventory of organizational communication propositions, generalizations, and areas for future research. (RW)",

The concept of leadership as a process of interaction within a group directed toward some goal is defined and discussed. The authors provide a framework for conceptualizing the interaction of administration, planning, and leadership within the broader scope of management. Kurt Lewin's theory of leadership is discussed, as well as Maslow's hierarchy of needs  and McGregor's assumptions about human motivation. Finally, a leadership model developed by Guba and Getzels contends that any kind of behavior is a result of influence from both personal and normative dimensions, and performance within a social system is caused by interaction between role and personality.

Among findings from analysis of 2,657 IEPs in public schools and IEPs of 550 students in state/special facilities were that IEPs were in place for most handicapped  students in the 1978-79 school year and that most of the IEPs contained the majority of the required elements; that IEPs had an average length of nearly five pages; that proposed evaluation criteria and a statement of the extent of participation in regular education were the mandated information areas included least frequently in IEPs; and that of the 96% of basic survey Ss who were enrolled in regular schools, only about 1% received all of their special education services in the regular classroom. The findings further indicated an increase in the average number of pages in an IEP, more short term objectives, and an improvement in the internal consistency of IEPs from the first to the second year.

Two levels of the substudy are examined: change from the prior to the current year in the IEPs and the IEP process; and the extent to which special education services actually provided to handicapped students were similar to those services specified in the IEPs. Changes are noted in the formats and other basic requirements, the kinds of information IEPs contained and method of presentation, personnel involved, types of special education and related services, internal consistency  and informativeness in IEPs, and in service settings. Findings from the second level of the substudy are reported, including the degree of parents' familiarity with their children's IEPs. Among major findings are that there were improvements over the year in specificity of information in IEPs, and a definite increase in the participation of related services personnel (in the public schools, but not in private schools).

Chapter 1 looks at some of the factors which detract from instructional time, and points out some of the benefits of tutoring which are supported by research. Peer or cross age tutoring is discussed in Chapter 2 in terms of academic skills improvement in tutors and noncognitive benefits for tutors. A third chapter looks at elements of an effective tutoring program with sections on programed vs. directed tutoring, content of instruction, establishment of mastery levels, frequency and duration of tutoring lessons, tutor training and supervision, measurement of progress, and selection of tutor student pairs. Chapter 4 briefly outlines some of the important decisions and  activities for teachers who implement a cross age tutoring program. Drawing on the materials developed by the National School Volunteer Program, Chapter 5 presents an overview of volunteer services, recruiting strategies, and procedures for managing volunteers in the classroom. A final chapter offers additional comments on tutoring. Appended are materials to illustrate how to prepare tutors for work with low performing children. (SB)",

The first chapter, &quot;Understanding Where the Students Are Coming From&quot; by J. Nazzaro and M. Portuondo considers the need to develop a multicultural perception, barriers to parent involvement in the schools, and suggestions for facilitating parent involvement. &quot;Special Problems of Exceptional Minority Children&quot; (J. Nazzaro) looks at Asian Americans, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans in terms of identification of exceptionality, special problems, and values and learning style. This chapter includes a table for each minority group in which relevant characteristics of specific conditions are related to  characteristics of a culture and the possible implications. A. Ortiz considers &quot;Development and Implementation of IEP's for Exceptional Bilingual Children&quot; in a chapter which includes sections on needed resources, special considerations for linguistically and culturally diverse students, parental participation, placement alternatives, and instructional strategies. The next chapter, &quot;Understanding the Use of Abusive Language,&quot; by A. Sullivan defines abusive language and provides a functional analysis of nine types of profanity. The final chapter by H. Bessand-Byrd is titled &quot;Competencies for Educating Culturally Different Exceptional Children&quot; and identifies competencies in the areas of values, philosophy, and traditional and contemporary life styles, human growth and development,  assessment, and the learning environment.

        "description":"The speech of two two-year-old Mandarin-speaking children was taped during free play in their homes. The following characteristics of their speech were discovered: (1) excellent, near full control of tones; (2) somewhat stricter word order than is found in adult speech (Mandarin is undergoing a word order shift from SVO to SOV); and (3) few coinages or use of the productive reduplicated forms in Mandarin, but greater than adult usage of morphological markings in the forms that were controlled. It seems that, despite the relative lack of morphological elaboration available in Chinese, the children found morphological markers easier to control than periphrastic forms involving adverbs or word order shifts and contrasts. In addition, all four children's preferences in aspectual  relations marked seemed consistent enough to project a fuller generalized schedule for the emergence of aspectual relations over time. Further analysis indicates that aspectual distinctions are far more central to the children than temporal ones. A cognitive universal is proposed for early linguistic marking of changes of state (distinguishable from endings or results) to be commented on by the child in a variety of overextensions constrained relatively little by linguistic form.

In a selective imitation situation, individualized for each child, the responses of the children were compared with semantic predictions made on the basis of one of 14 hypothesized rules, and with the semantic alternatives available from the child's lexicon. It was found that, in general, it is possible to predict what a child will say and when on the basis of the structure of a referential event. The research is deemed supportive of the notion that the distinction between information and certainty is the psychological basis for the distinction between assertion and presupposition in language, i.e., changing, informative elements are expressed on a background of unexpressed certainties.

The social context of Soviet bilingualism is discussed with reference to sources of heterogeneity, modernization as a motivating factor, political dimensions, and Soviet bases of research. The sociolinguistic paradigm of Soviet society is viewed as a function of the need to develop literacy, a need which is intimately tied to the status of Russian as the dominant language. The ethnological issues encompass the diverse ethnicity of the Soviet Union, aspects of demography, urbanization, and inter-ethnic marriages. The ideologically colored assumptions regarding language acquisition processes are set forth. These have implications for the development of a Soviet theory for language pedagogy, for the use of  the native language in learning second languages, and for a psychology of language acquisition and bilingualism. Various types of programs for bilingual education and Russian as a second language are described. A bibliography and a variety of statistical tables are appended. (JB)",

        "description":"Current views of the writing process are explored, and implications are drawn from them for the teaching of writing skills in the second language class. Certain psychological processes seem to be common to most writing tasks, namely: (1) the conception stage; (2) the incubation stage, in which two mental processes are at work getting the facts and arriving at a synthesis in terms of the writer's own thinking; and (3) the production, or actual writing stage. A final element that could be added is the revision process in which the writer takes on the role of the reader. Another writing-process model incorporates these stages, and points out the need to edit continuously as one writes in order to bridge the gap between thinking, which proceeds at a rapid rate, and transcribing, a  much slower process. According to a composite model drawn from the research literature, teacher input into the writing process is most effective in the pre-writing and the rewriting stages. Suggestions for this input are: (1) facilitating student recall of information; (2) specifying the context as clearly as possible; (3) helping the student ge* the data right in terms of his or her own intentions; (4) correcting student errors, preferably in an interview; (5) teaching the student how to edit; and (6) using controlled exercises.

This &quot;come&quot; is comparable to other modal-like forms, identical to motion verbs, which occur in Black and non-Black varieties of English, and which signal various degrees of disapproval. However, this usage of &quot;come&quot; occurs in BE only. It is of special interest that it occurs even in acrolectal varieties of BE, thus showing that the post-creole continuum in the United States differs from that in Guyana as described by Bickerton, who states that forms identical to forms in the base-language but which are functionally distinct do not occur in acrolectal varieties. The case for the grammaticalization of the mood, indignation, by usage of &quot;come&quot; is  elaborated as is its relation to &quot;gone,&quot; which is used to express disapproval. (Author/AMH)",

It was hypothesized that certain kinds of information and communication activities have particular properties, and that some of these activities are best pursued in face-to-face communication situations. Natural conversations involving an executive secretary were taped for a total of six hours on two different days. The conversations were analyzed interpretively to find out what was talked about. One new conception of verbal communication derived from this project was that office conversation provides for the existence of a \"diffuse information system,\" that is, a flow of trivial commentary which is, in fact, the bearer of information about the office. The communications  included: (1) locating people and things, (2) conversations mixing personal and office-related topics, (3) state of affairs information, and (4) facilitating activities and encouraging people. The data indicate that the sociability of office work is useful to the transmission of certain kinds of information and to the execution of some activities. Also, face-to-face conversation seems to be more useful than written or computerized communications for providing and interpreting certain types of information. (AMH)",

The setting for this study is the office of the director of a large business organization. The focus is a description of address forms used by a person holding the position of director of a committee, an ambiguous position in the organizational hierarchy. The particular factors that are significant here are status and intimacy. The ways that first names and nicknames are used within the committee office indicates that in that context, intimacy is a more important consideration in the choice of address forms than is status. A new compromise form of address, first name plus last name, was invented by the committee-director for use with the  associate directors as a way of avoiding using either first name or title plus last name. Use of this particular address form is interpreted as a means of calling attention to the committee-director's ambiguous status as well as the low intimacy factor. (AMH)",

        "description":"It is proposed that the role of teachers in bilingual education curriculum development is essential. The assumption is that pre-packaged curricula, programs, and materials cannot be effective because student and community needs differ from one situation to the other. Therefore, those persons involved in each situation should be the ones to develop the curriculum. In order to assume a central role in the curriculum development and implementation process, teachers need to develop skills in curriculum development as well as a critical consciousness. The first set of skills includes awareness of curriculum development as a decision-making process, the ability to perceive student needs and community culture, and skills in the instructional aspect of curriculum development. The second  factor, critical consciousness, is viewed as a political act because it has to do with questions of power and powerlessness. A suggested framework for the process is the &quot;curriculum collective,&quot; a core group of teachers and parents. This group would define itself, its tasks, and its political perspective. Teachers would interact with the collective as they implement the curriculum developed by the group. Assessment of the program would be on-going and effected through meetings among teachers, the collective, and the larger community. (AMH)",

Recommendations are provided regarding the proper extent of federal government concern with university affairs, including specific proposals for re-orienting federal activities accordingly. Because of provincial differences in cultural patterns, social needs, and their prospective demographic situation, each province has its own structure of educational institutions at the postsecondary level. Policy alternatives for provincial governments are presented, however, regarding grants, fees, financial aid, and research. A new design for federal policy is advanced that involves respect for provincial autonomy and provincial financial burdens. (PJM)",

Institutional officers must first determine how the data will be used by the external agency. By questioning how the requested information will be used, a determination can be made of what kind of data is actually required. Institutional officers also need to ask whether laws protecting the privacy of individuals whose records are held will not be violated. Each request for data should be analyzed for its probable cost to the institution. The effective collection of institutional data requires at least seven steps, which are listed (including notifying affected departments, preparing appropriate data reporting formats, and  incorporating the edited, tabulated data into the institution's information management system, or filing it, or recording it as an &quot;occasional report&quot;). The institution also needs to monitor the analysis of its data by external agencies to assure that the reported information is analyzed adequately and properly. An example of recurring, inadequate agency analysis of institutional data is the tendency of state agencies to ignore the distinction between fixed and variable costs faced by institutions with fluctuating enrollments. By reviewing the agency's use of data in decision-making, the institution can judge whether to provide a minimum of information or more extensive data. Once every three years, college and university administrators should prepare a careful summary tabulation of the  number of external data requests that they have received and the ways in which each was processed.

It is suggested that the attraction of the indexing approach to tuition arises from a number of causes including the upward pressure on tuition created by changing demographic and fiscal conditions. Results of a survey of current state policies for determining tuition indicated that 30 of the states do not have an established policy for determining tuition, three of the states have established policies but use no particular formula to determine tuition, and 17 states have established policies that index tuition to a specific measure. Indexing insures that a fixed portion of cost increases will be covered from student sources. The cost of  education is determined according to set accounting practices, and the student is charged a set percentage of this cost. Elements that should be included in the computation of the cost of education or instruction and the need for cost studies are briefly considered. Differentiating the actual percentages to be charged by level, student residency status, and type of institution is considered. Implications of using an indexing system on state policy issues are considered in relation to: state budgeting, institutional autonomy, cost containment, impact on enrollment, cost study requirements, cost behavior, equity, and access.

Two broad aims of the program are to explore the influence of social, political, and cultural forces on science and technology, and to examine the impact of technologies and scientific ideas on people's lives. Although based in the School of Humanities and Social Science, the program is meant to be an Institute-wide forum for students and faculty from many different departments. At the undergraduate level, courses examine such issues as the influence of ethical and political values on the work of scientists and engineers; how technological changes have altered the character of human work; the social implications of design alternatives in engineering; and issues related to  the development of the automobile and the growth of nuclear power. Eventually, a structured undergraduate degree program will be developed. A variety of arrangements for graduate students who wish to explore these areas is available, but a graduate degree program does not currently exist. The program's current and and prospective research projects are arranged under three general headings: the social study of science; technology and the organization of industrial society; and cultural systems in industrial societies. Projects under these areas are described, along with other program activities, including faculty seminars and public lectures, senior and postdoctoral fellowships, and a quarterly review. Information on funding, faculty descriptions, and 1980-81 course descriptions are  included. (SW)",

        "description":"State and local tax performance in the United States and in the South and implications for the financing of public higher education are considered. It is suggested that despite apparent gains in state tax revenues, little overall growth in real terms has been experienced in the region and nation in recent years, nor can much be expected in the early 1980s. Additionally, statutory restraints and reductions in federal funding affect the adequacy of state and local sources of revenue. Public higher education in the Southern states, which in recent decades has fared above national averages in terms of state support, cannot be assured of drawing or increasing, or even continuing, shares of state tax revenues. Although measures imposing spending limitations or tax constraints have been  voted down in many states, the number of states in which such measures have passed continues to grow. When utilization of tax ability is measured by comparison with average utilization by all states using a given tax, it is found that New England and the Middle Atlantic states generally continue to overutilize, while the North Central and the states comprising the Southern Regional Education Board underutilize. When increases in tax collections are adjusted for population growth and for inflation, the percent of real growth in state and local taxes increased less than 2 percent over the decade 1970-79. The use of selective sales taxes, general sales tax, property tax, corporation income tax, and personal income tax is examined. (SW)",

        "description":"The research literature on types of student retention, correlates of retention, and action strategies to improve retention is reviewed. Retention or student persistence can be assessed in terms of completion of a degree of certificate, a program but not a degree, or a term or course. Retention may also be persistence to attain a personal goal but short of a degree or a certificate. One type of retention study is designed to determine the characteristics and attitudes that are common among students who persist and among those who drop out. Research has indicated both student and institutional correlates of retention, and a number of theories have postulated that the interaction and fit between students and their institution are important in explaining retention and attrition. A  second type of retention study focuses on the practical application of retention strategies and their effectiveness in improving retention. A number of these studies are reviewed, beginning with the \"What Works in Student Retention?\" study (WWISR), the first comprehensive, national survey of action programs designed to improve retention. The action literature is discussed under two major headings: single-facet retention approaches and multifaceted approaches to improving retention. Twelve kinds of single-facet retention approaches are identified, and their effects on student retention are summarized: admissions and recruiting, advising, counseling, early warning and prediction, exit interviews, extracurricular activities, faculty and staff development, curriculum development, financial  aid, housing, learning and academic support, orientation, and policy change.

Among the reasons faculty development is needed are the following: decreased faculty mobility caused by declining university enrollments, financial problems that require more efficient use of existing faculty, and the lack of awareness of the variety and sophistication of instructional methods available for classroom use. Approaches to faculty development range from the independent review by faculty members of their own courses and methods and attempts to make changes to emphasize the systematic design and implementation of instruction. Other approaches include the political approach, the  educational research approach, and the interinstitutional approach. Assertiveness training workshops and growth contracts are methods by which faculty members can become involved in their own development. Postulates for a successful program include the following: provide an acceptable rationale for why the faculty development program is needed, involve the faculty in planning, balance institutional priorities and individual needs, make participation voluntary, include part-time faculty, reward participation, publicize the program adequately, evaluate the results, and provide adequate funding.

Strategies to improve the situation may involve national and regional organizational activities and institutional practices and programs. Specific women's organizations and councils/caucuses of more broadly based professional associations that may be of assistance are briefly described, along with institutes, internships and other training programs, workshops, and conferences that have been developed for women administrators or that are committed to affirmative action.

Among the findings are the following: employment in S/E jobs was obtained by about one-half of the bachelor's degree-holders and about three-fourths of the master's degree-holders; employment in part-time and non-S/E jobs occurs among only about one-sixth of the  degree-holders in the labor force; while about 9 out of 10 of the engineering and computer science graduates were working in S/E jobs, only about 1 in 5 of the social science degree-holders were so employed; employment opportunities for recent S/E graduates have shifted toward jobs in industry and with the federal government; in general, the S/E utilization rates for men were higher than those for women at both the bachelor's and master's level; most of the differences in utilization rates can be attributed to concentrations of men or women in particular fields (men predominate in engineering and women in the social sciences); R&D activities continue to be the primary work of about one-third of scientists and engineers with recently acquired bachelor's and master's degrees.

        "description":"Tenure practices in science and engineering (S/E) departments in universities and 4-year colleges with tenure systems were estimated, based on a 1978-79 survey of member institutions of the Higher Education Panel of the American Council on Education. The survey findings were designed to help assess the effect of the tenure system on the number of faculty openings for new doctorates. Of the faculty openings available to recent doctorates, about 4 percent of the full-time S/E positions became vacant as the result of the failure of faculty to earn tenure or the expiration of nontenure-track openings. In addition, 2 to 3 percent of faculty positions opened due to retirement, other voluntary separations, and death. Growth in the number of faculty positions was the other major source  of openings, accounting for approximately 4 percent of the full-time S/E positions. The greater the proportion of faculty who hold tenure, the smaller the number of potential openings for recent doctorates. About two-thirds of the 123,000 full-time S/E faculty at universities and 4-year colleges held tenure, another one-fourth were not tenured but in tenure-track positions, and about 1 in 14 were in nontenure-track positions. Data are also provided on tenure approval rates, reconsideration rates for those denied tenure, and pretenure probationary periods. Information is provided on tenure status and tenure decision outcomes of S/E faculty by field, institutional level, and type of institution. If the number of full-time faculty does not increase because of declining college enrollments,  the tenure system may be an important source of openings for new faculty, if no major changes occur in tenure practices.

AASCU, with cooperation from the International City Management Association (ICMA), proposed to organize and conduct an intensive short-term planning project for a cooperative action program in urban affairs and academic public services. Three objectives were set and met: (1) to identify specific public and private institutions with interest in the proposed  program; (2) to engage key individuals from these groups to assess their needs and interests and potential input; and (3) to establish formal linkages with these groups interested in program participation. A planning workshop secured endorsement for an Office of Urban Affairs and Public Service. New goals and objectives for the office are identified, including (1) establishing new links among academe, national organizations, private foundations, and local government, and (2) identifying alternatives for the modification of college teaching, research, and service within the community. Appended are pre-workshop coorespondence, the workshop proceedings, and other workshop information. (Author/PJM)",

The Cal-SOAP is a competitive-grants program designed to encourage cooperative, interinstitutional projects to increase the enrollment of low-income high school students in postsecondary institutions and to increase the number of low-income community college students who transfer to four-year institutions. Questions addressed by the evaluation are as follows: whether activities are implemented as planned, the number of students being served, whether the projects are adequately staffed and managed, the degree of progress that has been made toward achieving the stated objectives, and the cost of the program. The following five projects that were  awarded grants for 1979-80 and 1980-81 are examined: Central Coast EOP/S Consortium (Project HELP, Santa Clara County); Educational Guidance Center Consortium (East Bay); San Diego County Cal-SOAP Consortium (San Diego County); Solano University and Community College Education Support Services (SUCCESS, Solano-Yolo County); and South Coast EOP/S Consortium (Orange County). During the developmental first year, almost all of the Cal-SOAP project activities have been implemented as proposed. The pilot projects are experimenting with strategies to reduce duplication in outreach efforts, to disseminate information, and to use college students as peer tutors/counselors with high school students. The text of the enabling legislation is appended. (SW)",

A 23-item questionnaire was sent to the state's 57 higher education institutions, and 45 responded. The findings are discussed in relation to admission and orientation procedures; social barriers; and architectural barriers for students in wheelchairs, students with visual handicaps, students with auditory handicaps, and students with systemic-neurological handicaps. Among the findings are the following: 86.7 percent of the schools admit all applicants regardless of their disability; about half have no written policy concerning students with handicaps, and the majority of schools use flexible admission policies; most of the schools have  various types of human service programs for students with handicaps, including specially designated counselors and special facilities or activities; only 11 schools have no special arrangements for students with handicaps; there are numerous architectural barriers for students in wheelchairs; 75.6 percent have designated parking for the handicapped, and 16 schools have ramps to all buildings; 60 percent have viable volunteer services to support the visually impaired; and lecture halls typically have no microphones or regular loudspeaker system. Changes from an earlier assessment in 1973 (an eight-year period) are noted, along with a number of areas for which immediate, low-cost changes and long-range, more expensive changes can be made. Among these recommendations are to employ persons  with handicaps to help increase awareness among the university community and support an active human services program. (SW)",

(2) To whom is it important? (3) How does it operate in California? and (4) How can it be made more responsive to questions of quality and accountability? Four state administrative offices were studied, including the California Postsecondary Education Commission, the California Community Colleges, the California State University and Colleges, and the University of California. The resulting report contains three parts. Part I defines program review in the context of its critical relationships to academic planning, examines current literature and the experience in other states, notes changing social conditions, and describes the  governing and coordinating mechanisms in California. The subordination of program review to budgeting and planning is noted. In Part II, nine recommendations are given for strengthening state and segmental planning, simplifying the review of new programs, and increasing accountability for educational objectives. They include: strengthening state and segmental planning in its relation to review of new existing programs; simplifying new program review procedures to emphasize statewide concerns; and increasing accountability for educational objectives. In Part III, interaction among the recommendations is emphasized, along with their dependence on institutional program planning and program review. (Author/PJM)",

Administrative salaries in public universities were also surveyed. Academic staff compensation was considered from two perspectives. First, the rate of increase in salaries over time was compared to the rate of inflation to determine whether the purchasing power of salaries of academic staff had remained constant, decreased, or increased. Relevant to this issue is the question of how public employees compare with other professional employees in their ability to keep pace with inflation. The second perspective examines compensation of Illinois academic staff in comparison to that of faculty of similar institutions in other states.  Major questions here include (1) whether compensation in Illinois is competitive with compensation in similar institutions in other states, and (2) whether compensation in Illinois institutions has gained or lost ground over time when compared to compensation elsewhere. Findings indicate, among others: (1) the academic profession has experienced substantial loss of purchasing power across the nation, and (2) over the past 10 years, public and nonpublic university compensation has deteriorated in comparison to that in other states, while community college compensation is above the average.

        "description":"Motivational bases for affirmative action programs, particularly as these programs pertain to postsecondary education, are considered. \"Motivational bases\" refers to the basic incentives that are invoked in order to gain public support for affirmative action programs. Three types of motivational bases are addressed: those associated with reasons of morality, those associated with legality, and those associated with utility. The effectiveness of these motivational bases in generating popular support and the accomplishment of its ultimate goal of equal educational and employment opportunity is criticized. Background information on affirmative action is also reviewed. There are essentially four ethical principles that may be used to determine the morality of affirmative action: the  principle of simple justice, the principle of compensatory justice, the principle of distributive justice, and the principle of formal equality. A chief merit of legality as a motivational basis for affirmative action is that it emphasizes that affirmative action is the official policy of the nation (or state, or city). It also lays stress on the power of federal (or state, or local) enforcement behind this policy. Utility focuses on the effectiveness of a program or policy as a means to an end, rather than on the intrinsic qualities of the program or policy itself. Advantages and disadvantages of the three approaches are analyzed, and it is argued that the utility perspective appears to have fewer disabilities and more strengths than the other two. (SW)",

The question of satisfaction from work and its relation to motivation, a topic of controversy in the field (Greene, 1972) is examined, and the concept of motivation is briefly described from four perspectives: need/drive theory, expectancy theory, behaviorist theory, and flow theory. The important connections between these four perspectives and the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are addressed. The impact on the psychology of the motivation to teach and the relatively newer notions of Csikszentmihalyi (1975, 1978) are analyzed. It is suggested that faculty must be taught how to apprehend the latent satisfactions in  the teaching profession, the noninstrumental activities that are nonetheless critical to the sense of work worth doing. New ways of conceiving of teaching and its satisfactions are introduced. The contexts for understanding these new modes come from the literature of psychology. An attempt is made to show the relationships among productivity, satisfaction, and feedback as well as the conditions that may bear on those variables. In institutionalizing a feedback system, not only must instructors receive more feedback to maximize their satisfactions and productivity, but students and faculty who provide the feedback must also have feedback of their own. If feedback is seen as valuable it will more likely continue and the communication process and channels will be institutionalized.  (SW)",

Results of surveys on other states are analyzed in terms of how the states develop cost-of-instruction data, and how costs are determined, aggregated, and used. The involvement of California's legislative and executive branches in cost-of-instruction studies since 1961 is reviewed, and the impact of program budgeting upon state support for public postsecondary education is considered.

Faculty cultures is used to refer to work-related perceptions, norms, and values that are shared by some or all of the teachers within a given school. Collegial interaction directed toward the solution of common and recurrent problems is seen as a fundamental dynamic in the creation and maintenance of informal cultural guidelines for instructional practice. Responses to six essential problems in teaching are described. Those problems are: inadequate preparation, ambiguous goals, precarious autonomy, instructional isolation, and batch-processing of students. It is  concluded that despite professional and organizational barriers to faculty solidarity, informal work groups do develop and that these primary groups offer their members help, support, guidance, and consensual validation regarding appropriate instructional practices. A sociological model of the teaching-learning process is presented, within which collegial relationships and faculty cultures are central. Research linking faculty cultures to student achievement is highlighted and the need for further research is noted. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"The responsibilities of the business department chairperson at Castleton State College were assessed. A literature review included the area of organizational structures of academic institutions, and key faculty members and administrators at the college were interviewed to identify the key issues and problems of organizational structures and job responsibility at the college. Pertinent documents were also reviewed. It is suggested that the departmental chairperson structure at the college is a system that can work efficiently from a managerial standpoint. The overall problem within the current system is the lack of a job description for the department chairperson. It is recommended that in the process of constructing the divisional director, a middle management be established in  order to better delegate authority from one centralized system at the deans' level to the department chairpersons' level where most decisions have to be made. It is suggested that the department chairperson be responsible for undergraduate and graduate curriculum development, student advising, and classroom assignment. The divisional directors would be concerned with employment of new faculty, the business advisory committee, off-campus programs, Master of Business Administration programs, and community needs. Appendices include a chart of the organization of the college, a flowchart on academic policy development, and the text of the recommendation for reorganization of the departmental structure.

At Wayne State University, some steps toward CADI have been taken, with the result that personnel time has been reduced for some activities, and the product improved in others. A PLATO lesson that was designed involved the use of a questionnaire employing a 2-level sort--one by the courses the respondent had taken, and one by the design and development functions performed by the respondent. This simplified data gathering and improved the quality of the data collected. CADI also uses online documentation and interaction where appropriate. While the system can be used for  preparing text materials, the greatest potential is probably for lesson development. The Instructional Quality Inventory developed by David Merrill provides a set of guidelines that may be useful in designing such lessons. The evaluation of CADI materials, while not completely precise, can be accomplished by reviewing their accuracy and conformity to accepted practice, but only the test of a prototype will tell if the instructional package works.

Data were collected for four months on: (1) student attrition, (2) training contact hours, (3) first-try scores on module tests and phase tests, (4) number of remediations per instructional module, and (5) the number of unsatisfactory scores on practical tests. Observational data were also collected on the frequency and duration of categories of instructor behaviors during the 6-hour computer-managed instructional shift. The larger S/I ratio (30:1) had some detrimental effects on student  training time for some career patterns, and on some instructor behaviors. Instructors in the larger ratio condition spent more time in testing and student administration activities, and less time answering student questions on technical matters. The S/I ratio had no significant effect on the student achievement measures. Four references are listed, and appendices include data on student qualifying scores and mean module completion times for individual modules. (Author/BK)",

However, not all producers have been this successful in merging the capabilities of television with the needs of learners, and a review of the strengths and weaknesses of ITV is in order for both producers and those considering using it. Strengths include the capability of hiring the best available teacher, using a professional production staff to plan quality productions, encouraging good quality teaching, extending appeal to a wide audience, bringing immediacy to learning, preview opportunities, improving classroom teacher and student skills, availability of nontraditional  resources, attention control, permanence of lessons, and outreach to parents and homebound students. There are, however, several weaknesses, e.g., scheduling difficulties, lack of direct feedback and group discussions, nonindividualized instruction, and high cost of programming. Ideal television teachers communicate with students, think visually, know the subject, display showmanship, and are flexible. To determine the quality of programming, the producer should be asked specific questions concerning program objectives and content, intended audience, educational qualifications of staff, and proof of the program's effectiveness.

Part II briefly discusses materials selection in light of diminishing financial resources and urges directors to systematically evaluate materials in terms of student and program needs. The appendix includes a form for evaluating the usefulness of learning materials, a reading and study skills lab evaluation form, and a directory of 58 companies which supply learning lab materials.

One hundred and thirty-nine male and female high school students from a 12th grade course in psychology were assigned randomly to one of four treatment conditions. The two independent variables of management strategy (adaptive control and learner control) and advisement (with and without) were tested with a pretest-posttest, two-way factorial design that involved the four treatment groups. Advisement information was provided to the students using the Minnesota Adaptive Instruction System. Data analysis indicated that advisement, using  either a program control or learner control management strategy, resulted in better posttest performance, less instructional time, and fewer instructional examples than those same management strategies with no advisement.

Major findings, based on responses from 45 states and the District of Columbia, reveal that only 12 states used specific criteria and that 24 used general criteria outlined in broad policy statements or in legislation. Nine states and the District of Columbia had no criteria at all; most of these states also had no community colleges or so few that statewide policy statements were not considered necessary. The most commonly used criteria were: (1) population projections, (2) follow-up studies of area  high school graduates, (3) enrollment rates, (4) formatted needs studies, (5) site selection procedures, (6) funding availability, (7) evidence of community support, (8) evidence of non-duplication of programs, (9) enrollment capacities of present institutions, and (10) the effects of an existing campus on a new campus. Findings also indicate that the specificity of the criteria used tended to increase with the size of the community college system and with fiscal constraints. The study report summarizes findings for each of the responding states. Proposed criteria for Alaska are appended. (JP)",

        "description":"A day-long faculty workshop was held at Prince George's Community College, a suburban Maryland institution, to identify the sources of stress affecting the faculty and to examine possible strategies for managing stress. At the workshop, the instructors were randomly assigned to small discussion groups and were asked, during the morning, to list the job situations found to be most stressful and, during the afternoon, to propose personal and organizational strategies for combatting stress. During the morning session, 218 stress generators were identified in six categories: administration (118), student-related (36), peer-related (23), financial (20), working conditions (16), and personal (5). The stress factors most frequently cited included lack of faculty participation in  decision-making, the increase in under-prepared students coupled with student expectations of high grades, apathetic peers, and low salaries. The afternoon sessions yielded 153 strategies for reducing stress, including strict enforcement of prerequisite completion, realistic student placement, and the establishment of peer support networks. The study report reviews the literature dealing with \"professional burnout\" and presents a model for understanding stress, in which burnout is seen as a breakdown in the relationship between the individual and organization.

George Vaughan summarizes the writings of prominent critics of the community college and suggests that two-year college educators analyze and profit from their criticisms. Burton Clark reconsiders the community college's \"cooling out\" function and even less desirable alternatives, such as preselection and guaranteed graduation. After recapping the major points made in \"Dateline '79,\" Arthur Cohen plots trends for the 1980's. Richard Johnston considers the negative social impacts charged to the community college and proposes an alternative system of postsecondary education. William Neumann and David Riesman present a profile of the \"community college elite,\" that is, those  community college transfer students who graduate from selective, independent senior colleges. David Breneman and Susan Nelson look at the way the community college mission is affected by patterns of public financing. Robert Templin, Jr. and Ronald Shearon discuss two theories of the relationship between social stratification and education, and review studies providing evidence in support of and against charges that community colleges support the status quo. Steven Zwerling considers the influence of growing numbers of adult, part-time students on the community college. An ERIC bibliography on the community college mission concludes the monograph.

Preliminary findings from data collected after 1975 are also reported. All PCDC programs share several common features which define the PCDC approach to parent education. PCDCs must actively engage low-income families with young children between the ages of birth and three years. They are multidimensional programs providing a range of information and experiences to parents on children's development, child-rearing techniques, health, nutrition, home management, adult skills in relating to organizations and institutions and community resource  utilization, while offering social activities and social and health services. Established in 1970 by the Federal Government to help mothers raise socially and cognitively competent children, PCDCs were found to have positive short-term outcomes related to child corpetence. Preliminary analyses of data collected since 1975 at the Birmingham and New Orleans sites show that mean Stanford-Binet IQs in program and control groups were nearly identical by the time participating children reached 60 months of age. At both sites, IQ effects at the time of program graduation appeared to be weaker for later cohorts, but the cohort across group interactions were not significant. (Author/RH)",

In the first study, 48 children (3, 4, and 6 to 7 years of age) were given three different kinds of tasks (interpersonal task, facial recognition task, and vocal recognition task). A cross-age comparison of their responses was then made. Improvement with age was shown on all three tasks. Facial recognition was the easiest task, while vocal recognition was the most difficult task for all age levels. When the patterns shown across tasks and emotions were examined, identification of the emotion &quot;happy&quot; was found to be easier with facial and situational cues, while identification of the emotions &quot;sad&quot; and &quot;mad&quot; was easier with vocal  recognition cues. The youngest group showed &quot;sad&quot;-&quot;mad&quot; confusion with both facial and situational cues, while 4- and 6- to 7-year-olds showed this confusion only with situational cues. In the second study, the same tasks were given to a group of 35 preschoolers during their first year in a university-based preschool and again one year later. In general, findings for correct responses closely replicated the findings for the two youngest groups in the original study. These findings suggest that preschoolers make considerable progress in judging emotions on the basis of cues available in faces, voices, and situations. (Author/MP)",

The purpose of this study was to identify the cognitive processing capabilities of a group of Tasmanian (Australian) children. Fifteen cognitive tests were administered to 122 4- to 8-year-old children enrolled at Sandy Bay Infant School in Hobart, Tasmania. The data derived from the tests were examined in four ways. First, responses were scored and distributions for the population were prepared. From this data it was evident that five of the tests failed to differentiate the children. Second, the relationship of the scores for the 10 remaining tests were examined and this analysis revealed one  primary factor reflecting quantitative skills, and another reflecting qualitative transformations. Third, since the primary factor accounted for most of the variance, the hierarchical order of the tests was examined. No evidence of such an order was found. Finally, the test scores for the 10 differentating tests were related to four memory (M-space) tests given earlier to the same population. The pattern of responses on the cognitive tests for six groups identified via a cluster analysis of the M-space data demonstrated systematic differences between five of the six groups. (Author/MP)",

Four M-space tests -- The Counting Span Test (Case and Kurland, 1978), Mr. Cucui Test (DeAvila and Havassy, 1974), the Digit Placement Test (Case, 1972), and The Backward Digit Span Test (Hiebert, 1979) -- were administered to the children. Using four different scoring rules for each test, it was found that the context of test may give students a cue which helps them answer questions above their M-space level, that there is no abrupt shift or change in M-space, and that some children appear to incorporate a strategy of chunking information in order to solve problems beyond their  indicated M-space level. Cross tabulation of the four tests indicated that children classified into an M-space level by one test would not necessarily be classified into the same level using another test. Analysis revealed one primary factor reflecting quantitative skills and another reflecting spatial perception. The principal conclusion of this study is that with some qualifications children can be grouped by test scores into well-defined sets with similar working memory capacities. (Author/MP)",

In order to facilitate the use of currently available measures, tests have been categorized in terms of 10 broad areas and subcategorized in terms of the constructs they measure. The 10 areas of classification used are: (1) test batteries measuring many constructs; (2) measures of aptitude and/or intelligence; (3) measures of the ability to cope with cognitive demands; (4) measures of the ability to cope with personal-social demands; (5) family measures; (6) measures of language development; (7) measures of sensory-motor or physical skills or status; (8) measures of  subject-matter achievement; (9) measures of teacher and or program; and (10) miscellaneous measures. As indicated above, each measure was further assigned to one or more construct areas depending upon test content. For example, the broad area \"ability to cope with cognitive demands\" includes tests measuring the following and other constructs: attention; attitude toward school; curiosity; memory; and reasoning. In separate sections of the report the methodology and general conclusions of the review are indicated. Titles of tests are listed by construct in Appendix A. Appendix B provides a guide to the different test listings. (Author/RH)",

In order to allow this volume to be read alone, without the necessity of constant cross-reference to Volume I: &quot;Children at the Center,&quot; certain sections of that volume are included in Volume Two. In particular, the sections of Chapter One that address the study design and variables have been taken substantially from Volume I, as has the portion of Chapter Two that  describes the study sample. Other sections of Chapter One and Two are new, including a discussion of general analytic issues and approaches. Chapters Three through Six describe instruments, analyses and results linking regulatable center characteristics to caregiver behavior, child behavior and child test scores. These chapters constitute detailed support for Chapters Five and Six of &quot;Children at the Center,&quot; which summarized the study's results on quality of care. The major findings of the NDCS are summarized in the Preface to Volume II. They are restated in Chapter Seven, amplified by details from Chapters One through Six. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This study examines the possibility that ability to avoid detection of deceptive behavior via nonverbal behavior might be related to an individual's role-taking skill. Sixty-one 5 to 12 year-old boys and girls were led to be verbally deceptive or truthful by saying that they either had enjoyed or not enjoyed an unpleasant experience or had enjoyed or not enjoyed a pleasant experience. Untrained adult judges then rated whether they thought the children were being truthful or deceptive. It was hypothesized that the children's role-taking skill would be positively correlated with their ability to avoid detection by the adult judges. Results indicate a positive relationship between the ability to take the perspective of others and success at avoiding detection. The awareness that  one's nonverbal behavior during social interaction has an impact on the perception of others appears to be an important factor influencing the ability to control nonverbal cues. Children who are better able to take the perspective of others in the role-taking task were also more effective at controlling their nonverbal behavior. (Author/MP)",

The aim of the project is to establish a theoretical basis for a field study of locally initiated experiments using various teaching strategies. More specifically, this paper is restricted to a discussion of the cognitive framework underlying the theoretical basis. A review of the psychological foundations of activity learning shows that theorists often postulate the efficiency of activity learning, or that the relation between recommendations for teaching strategies and psychological theory is often handled in a superficial way. An attempt is made to formulate characteristics of &quot;Activity&quot; with reference to Piaget's description of cognitive development.  Activity is described as a mode of thinking about phenomena. This mode of thinking can be characterized by a willingness to try different ways of interpreting a phenomenon, a searching for intentions behind an act or a text, and a testing of knowledge already accessible in new situations. This is called the assimilative aspect of the acquisition of knowledge. &quot;Activity&quot; is also characterized by a willingness to change one's mind, and the efforts made to understand, which is called the accommodative aspect of the acquisition of knowledge. A note is also added about the field study, and about certain expected results. (Author/MP)",

Thirty-six 4- and 5 1/2-year-olds were asked to judge the reality of specific televised events shown on videotape. The events depicted varied in aggressiveness, format (cartoon versus non-cartoon) and type of character (humorous or non-humorous). Responses were scored on the basis of children's judgments as to whether the portrayals were either real or pretend. While age and sex differences were absent, children's real-pretend judgments were found to be dependent on the format of the events observed. Cartoon events were viewed as fiction whereas non-cartoon  events were generally seen as more real. Neither type of character nor type of event appeared to alter these perceptions.

In a free-operant laboratory setting, a mechanical clown delivered marbles, which the children could later trade for toys, according to one of the two schedules. All sessions were videotaped and scored for particular superstitious behaviors (for example, touching the clown and making faces). Since no differences emerged as a function of FT interval length, all twelve children were grouped for analysis. One third to one half of the twelve children showed evidence for acquistion  of superstitous behaviors; four children showed some dominant behaviors but it was not possible to clearly ascribe the word superstitous to them and three children showed extremely low frequencies of any particular behaviors. An independent assessment of reinforcement effectiveness was conducted, and inter-observer reliability was provided. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"This study supports the claim that environmental factors in early intervention programs can positively affect the development of early communicative behaviors in infants. A sample of 20-month-old infants from low socioeconomic backgrounds and at risk for mental retardation was randomly divided into a day care intervention group and a control group. Additionally, a middle class comparison sample was formed. Each infant was observed with his or her mother in two standardized settings: (1) a free play setting in which infant-initiated &quot;showing&quot; communications were recorded and (2) an experimental setting in which &quot;requesting&quot; communications were elicted and recorded. Results indicate that high risk infants attending day care intervention programs initiated communicative behaviors to  their mothers more often than did infants receiving no day care intervention. Moreover, the frequency of the day care group's communicative behaviors was not significantly different from that in the middle class comparison sample. The developmental level at which the high risk day care infants initiated &quot;showing&quot; and &quot;requesting&quot; communicative acts was significantly more advanced than that of the high risk infants not attending day care intervention. The high risk day care infants'&quot;requesting&quot; communicative acts did not differ from those of the middle class sample. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Early Russian religious and educational influences on the 20 various Alaskan Native languages are described, followed by those of American origin in schools and religious groups after the American purchase in 1867, all of which show the development of diglossia and language shifts. The present dual educational system, which includes state schools and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools, has contributed to shifts in language use from Alaskan Native languages to varieties of English or combinations of both. Alaskan Native and non-native students learn native language-specific dialects of English which have their own phonological and syntactical characteristics. Teacher attitudes, knowledge, and understanding, as well as differences in culture-specific modes of discourse, and the  use of formalized textbook English are seen as factors which create interethnic communication problems. The geographic and cultural isolation has also been influential in creating a lack of language proficiency and educational achievement. Recommendations for student eligibility for the bilingual program in ESEA Title VII include: identification of limited English proficient students by teacher recommendations and testing; documentation of community language and cultural influences by languages other than English; and description of historical community cultural contribution to the limited English proficiency of target students.

The bilingual group consisted of students from Rock Point Community School who had first been taught to read in Navajo and then, at the second grade level, had also been taught to read in English. The second group consisted of students from a selected sample of BIA schools who had been taught to read in English only in English as a Foreign Lanugage (EFL) direct method programs. The study utilized existing programs in carefully selected  schools. Students who had received bilingual instruction scored higher on standardized achievement tests than did students at comparable schools who had received English-language-only instruction and better than earlier Rock Point students who had received English-language-only instruction. Also, the bilingual students who were taught arithmetic in Navajo and English until the end of the second grade had significantly higher mean scores on the Total Arithmetic subtests than did the EFL direct method group at grades above the fourth. The major portion of the monograph consists of Appendix A, which describes other related studies and Appendix B, which details the Rock Point Study's methodology, findings of the study, and a statistical analysis.

Two hundred eighteen (25%) agriculture students and 289 (50%) home economics students were similar in socioeconomic background; however, in terms of educational aspiration, of the 80.6% of agriculture students desiring graduate study, 65% expected to attain it, while of 70.8% of home economics students, only 43% expected to do so. Agriculture students  also expected higher initial salaries than home economics students. Parents had the most influence over the career choice of agriculture students while home economics students were more influenced by high school teachers and college friends. Agriculture students perceived the agricultural area more positively than home economics students and considered themselves to be more concerned, friendly, and liberal, although they displayed more traditional attitudes especially in the areas of sex roles. Both groups endorsed sex education in the schools. (Author/SB)",

These differences can cause varying degrees of confusion and conflict for Indian people, and these problems surface as soon as an Indian child begins his formal education, especially if the school is staffed predominantly by non-Indians, and the educational philosophy follows dominant society guidelines. Increased cultural sensitivity and awareness on the part of educators is necessary if the cultural conflict felt by Indian children is to be lessened, and their educational experiences become meaningful and positive. Administrators, teachers, and support personnel can help the Indian child understand and cope with cultural conflicts  experienced in school. In order to do this, all school personnel must be sensitized and attuned to the child's culture and to their own through inservices and workshops. More culturally sensitive school systems can help in the minimization of culturally based problems and the school personnel will gain in personal understanding and growth. (Author/AN)",

Conducted on reservations in an attempt to partially meet the needs and concerns of American Indians regarding the potential and ongoing energy extraction and development on their lands and surrounding areas, the programs addressed energy development, conservation, preservation, assessment, monitoring, reclamation, legal issues, and other aspects of energy resource development. In a joint effort between the ANL and tribal education groups, course criteria and student selection were determined, depending on the needs, concerns, and environmental settings  of each reservation. Despite positive feedback on the success of the training workshops and follow-up programs, a number of problems revealed a need for program modification, diminished politically motivated interference, and increased portions of funding for participating students. Descriptions and evaluations of two major programs included: a six-week summer program during 1976 at Navajo Community College in Tsaile, Arizona, for 6 Hopi and 4 Navajo students; and a six-week Eastern Montana training program which involved 20 students from the 3 reservations located near active mining operations in Montana.

The plan of analysis is in five parts: (1) general formulation of the cost equation; (2) capital cost and fixed charges thereon; (3) operational cost for labor, maintenance, and repair; (4) fuel cost, arising from the fuel cycle; and (5) the effective load factor during the cost analysis period. A parametric analysis of the generating cost of nuclear power is reduced to determining the effects of six independent variables, such as plant load factor (PLF), special plant cost (SPC), fixed charge on capital equipment (FC), specific fuel cost (SFC), average new plant efficiency during load cycle (EFF),  fuel burnup (B) on the four dependent costs of capital cost of electricity (CCAP), operating cost of electricity (COP), fuel cost of electricity (CF), and total cost of electricity (CTOT) in mills/kwh. The computer program ECOST is shown with a description of how to perform the parametric analysis. The program assigns three values to each of the six independent variables, an initial normal value, and upper and lower abnormal values. (Author/SK)",

The last module, RS-9, includes a separate program, WANDIC (one-dimensional diffusion code with three energy-group representation), for the calculations of neutron spectra and group constants for use in fast breeder reactor calculations. It can be used with the criticality programs in RS-2 and RS-8. The reactor is divided into several concentric annular regions and it is assumed that those regions can be represented fairly well by their average properties. The  previous modules show how these properties are found. The set of nine modules is intended to supplement textbooks and other lecture material generally available to students in their course work. It is assumed that students are familiar with elementary nuclear structure, neutron-nuclei interactions, and introductory material on fission chain reactors. (Author/SK)",

Examples of types of &quot;real&quot; problems which require the various operations for their solution are presented. The applications of each operation are grouped by addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division and a model example is included with each category. The use of models for operations is considered important because they: (1) help to show when to use a given operation; (2) show important relationships between arithmetic studied and the real world; (3) can be used to develop and illustrate properties of  operations; (4) can be used to check answers; (5) help to classify the applications of arithmetic; and (6) help to explain concepts in higher mathematics.

Data gathered by means of evaluation questionnaires mailed with sample kits to 251 institutions show that the material was generally well received, but participants indicated they would purchase the kit only at a price below the actual production cost. Informal contacts with publishers reveal that various factors make it impractical for them to commercially produce the REACH KIT.

Most modules contain computer programs which are built around a particular application of a physical process. The module is directed toward intermediate undergraduate students of the ecological sciences who are familiar with differential calculus and algebra. Frequently in the application of calculus to ecological problems, relationships between measured quantities involve rates of change of the quantities of interest, rather than the quantities themselves. Stated in mathematical terms, it is possible to determine derivatives of functions instead of the functions themselves. It is then necessary to use an inverse operation on the  derivative to determine the desired function. This operation is called integration. Each function's behavior used in this module is comparable to characteristics of the ecosystem it represents. Topics are introduced and extended in the problem sets and computer exercises.

Most modules contain computer programs which are built around a particular application of a physical process. Primary production in aquatic ecosystems is carried out by phytoplankton, microscopic plants which move with water currents. The yearly pattern of biological production is in large part controlled by a seasonal cycle of thermal stratification. This module presents a model of primary production in a lake ecosystem. The principal physical, chemical, and biological processes are introduced and the formulation of the model and the mathematical approach used to work with it are described. A final section discusses running the model and  modifying its input or boundary conditions so it can be used to simulate a variety of situations. Exposure to numerical analysis and differential equations is a prerequisite to use of the module. (Author/CS)",

Most modules contain computer programs which are built around a particular application of a physical process. This module and a comparison module are concerned with elementary concepts of thermodynamics as they apply to ecological processes. The First Law of Thermodynamics states that during any biological, physical, or chemical process, energy can neither be created nor destroyed. The relationship between an organism and its environment can be studied by examining the exchange of energy in the form of the flow of heat and the transfer of mass. Primary focus in the module is on the microclimate and the exchange of heat between organisms  and their environment. The law is also used to study the energetic cost of locomotion, rate of food assimilation, and energy flow in ecosystems. A basic knowledge of algebra is required in order to understand the text and complete the problem set. (Author/CS)",

Most modules contain computer programs which are built around a particular application of a physical process. Specifically, this module develops a method for calculating the exchange of heat between an animal and its physical environment. The approach used is to develop a mathematical model that represents the energy balance of an animal, to discuss the components of the model, and to apply these theories by working out the details of the energy budget of a familiar animal. Examples are used to illustrate that if the sheep's environment is given in terms of temperature, wind speed, and incoming radiation, it is possible to determine the  rates of body metabolism and evaporative losses that will allow the animal to maintain thermal equilibrium. The model which is developed can be applied to other animals and environments and can be used to evaluate household fuel bills. A knowledge of differential equations is a prerequisite to the course.

Classical and modern radiation theory are discussed and the applications of these physical principles to analysis of biological systems are presented. Emphasis in these applications is upon the evolutionary significance of the physical processes. In one type of application, physical theory is used to isolate constant factors in the environment to which all organisms must adjust their evolution. In a second  application, physical theory is used to elucidate the constraints governing the evolution of biological systems. It is demonstrated that radiation theory is applicable to a wide range of sense organs, radiation types, wavelengths, and organisms. (Author/CS)",

The basic hypothesis is that the likelihood of engaging in updating activities is a function of individual motivation and characteristics of the work environment. To obtain information about work environments, researchers developed the Work Description Questionnaire for Engineers (WDQE). A factor analysis of data provided by over 400 practicing engineers and supervisors led to the development of a final version of the WDQE, which was then administered to an additional 500 engineers. Results generally validated the Dubin model and indicated that  valence-instrumentality-expectancy theory can be a useful framework for understanding individual motivation and its impact upon technical updating. It is suggested that the WDQE can provide an organization with information that can facilitate technical updating by its employees. (Author/WB)",

The final section uses Santa Barbara County, California, as an example to illustrate how a local analyst can use a computer program to develop population forecasts and future age distributions. Included in the appendix is the entire computer program, written in FORTRAN IV. This tool can improve local  population projections and may be used by local officials in making policy decisions.

        "description":"Reported are three studies of attitudes towards and effects of science education field trips. In the first study, 425 fifth and sixth graders participated in outdoor science activities in one of three types of settings. Results indicated that more learning took place when the number of available examples of concepts to be learned and setting novelty were both maximized. Students reported positive feelings about their experience and were observed to be spending over 90% of their time during the field trip on the assigned activities. The second study surveyed the attitudes and perceptions toward field trips of a nationwide sample of teachers, administrators, college methods instructors, and nature center professionals. All four groups held positive attitudes toward field trips and  provided similar responses to most questionnaire items. The final investigation demonstrated the significant influence of certain factors associated with field trips upon learning and behavior. The three studies indicate that educators view science field trips as important, that field trips have clear cognitive and affective benefits, and that certain characteristics of learners and the field trip setting influence student attitudes, behavior, and learning.

Participants worked in small groups to identify strengths and weaknesses of the program. Overall evaluation was accomplished through use of a questionnaire. A major thrust of the dissemination phase was a four-day workshop for engineering technology educators invited on the basis of  geographical distribution and type of institution. Other modes of dissemination included direct mailing of materials to individuals and institutions and trips to conferences and other institutions by project staff members. Results indicate an awareness and acceptance of the curriculum in both industry and the educational community. (Author/SK)",

        "author":["Harris, Thomas E."],
        "description":"The paper provides a simplified introduction to conflict theory through a series of in-class exercises. Conflict resolution, defined as negotiated settlement, can occur through three forms of communication: tacit, implicit, and explicit. Tacit communication, taking place without face-to-face or written interaction, refers to inferences made and action taken on the basis of mutual knowledge or assumptions about the other's probable responses. Implicit communication is the expression of intent to perform some act. Explicit communication is action performed. Classroom exercises illustrating each form of communication in conflict situations are described. Tacit communication is illustrated by situations in which two parties must act to achieve a common goal, without opportunity to  communicate; their action must be based on assumptions made about the other's response, based on acquaintance with the common knowledge and culture shared by both. Implicit communication is illustrated by situations in which three parties engage in negotiations in which offers and counteroffers, which may benefit or injure the parties in varying degrees, are made before action is taken. Important conflict-resolution concepts illustrated in these exercises are power relationships, persuasion, inducement, and constraint. Explicit communication is illustrated by the \"Prisoners' Dilemma,\" in which two prisoners accused of a crime are separated and given the option of confessing or not confessing. The punishment each will receive depends both on his own response and on the unknown response of  the other prisoner. Important conflict-resolution concepts illustrated by this exercise are gain, preservation, trust, competition, cooperation, and perception of self and others. The author stresses that while for the purpose of the exercises the three forms of communication are separate from each other, in reality they interact with each other in almost every conflict situation.

Three models assess the direct and indirect effects of parental characteristics: socioeconomic status, level of political activity, and level of non-political (organizational) activity. The fourth model assesses the impact of adolescent involvement in high school activities. The two samples, one in 1965 and the other in 1973, consist of over 1200 students and their parents. Results indicate that taken individually each pathway to participation has an effect. When the four models are combined into a single model, all remain important except the one denoting parent involvement in non-political activities. The combined model also reveals the crucial role of civic  orientations in converting pre-adult experiences into later participation. The conclusion is that socialization influences must be considered in explaining political participation. (Author/KC)",

It examined the effect of modes of interaction (asking for help by letter, phone, or in person) and the size of the request (whether they asked for a small or large favor). The sample consisted of 96 male and female undergraduates in introductory sociology classes. The students were told that the experiment consisted of determining whether a special type of person agrees to help others without receiving anything in return. Participants were instructed to ask other students for help by letter, phone, or in person; for each person from whom they requested help, they could earn 20 cents. Results indicated that the mode of interaction is an important factor in persons' willingness to request help. Participants  were most willing to do so by writing, less willing by phone, and least willing in person. Also, the effect of the mode of interaction was related to the size of the request. When the request was small, subjects were as likely to make the request by phone as in writing. When the request was large, subjects were as unwilling to make the request by phone as in person.

The Republican elections of 1980 are analysed according to: how and when citizens are introduced to political candidates, what accounts for the dynamics of awareness and recognition of candidates, how and when citizens develop affective orientations toward political candidates, and what accounts for changes in how citizens evaluate candidates. The sample consisted of 8,000 New Jersey residents interviewed between October, 1979 and July, 1980. Participants were asked to recall names of candidates running for the presidential nomination, state candidate preference, and explain the most important reason for their support of the candidate. Results indicate that  knowledge and opinion of presidential candidates is distributed in three layers of the public: attentive, peripheral, and inadvertent. Attentives, approximately one-third of the population, are already aware of the candidates when the media first devote attention to the campaign. Their knowledge about the candidate is not based on prominent coverage. The peripheral, about one-fifth of the population, become aware only after exposure to the intense coverage accompanying success in a campaign test. The inadvertents, one-third of the public, also depend on such coverage, but only to the extent that they recognize candidates names rather than become aware of them. Many citizens base their evaluations upon perceptions of the candidate's competitive strength rather than on personal qualities or  ideological positions. (Author/KC)",

Images of these racial and ethnic groups were compared with images of women over the same period. Specific purposes were to determine the frequency of images of racial minorities and caucasians and to identify various aspects of minorities images such as dominance, appearance, and role. Of a total of 577 political cartoons, 378 had specific July Fourth themes. Of these, 354 portrayed women and 24 portrayed racial minorities. Fourth of July cartoons were selected for study because they are one of the few cultural  artifacts that have been around for 100 years and because they often reflected the \"U.S. as melting pot\" rhetoric which might be expected to portray American cultural realities at different time periods. Findings indicated that, in general, cartoons excluded racial minorities except during specific time periods when a particular group was often discussed in the news (for example, the case of the blacks during the 1960's as a result of civil rights activism). When minority groups were represented, however, the depiction of all subjects changed from near caricature in early decades to greater directness and simplicity in later years. In spite of this progress, however, few racial minorities were shown in roles challenging the establishment. Also, minorities were seldom portrayed as equal to  Caucasians. Of the groups studied, native Americans were pictured as least assimilated and women and blacks as most assimilated. (DB)",

        "description":"This handbook contains model lessons on consumer education for use with intermediate, junior high, and high school students. The handbook was developed as a result of a grant which the Social Science Education Consortium received to conduct three consumer education workshops for approximately 100 Colorado teachers and school administrators. Many of the lessons described in the handbook were used and evaluated by participants in these workshops. The learning activities are self-contained and can be used in social studies, business, home economics, language arts, business, math, and science courses. The activities are organized according to the nine consumer economics categories identified by the U.S. Office of Education: basic economics of the marketplace; legal rights, redress,  and consumer law; financial management and credit; energy consumption and conservation; major purchases; special problems (e.g. advertising, public safety); federal assistance and services; consumer representation; and government regulatory processes. The activities are many and varied. For example, in an activity on energy use, students take home worksheets on which they record the numbers and kinds of electrical appliances their families have. When students return to class with their completed worksheets, the teacher selects a dozen commonly used appliances and asks students to suggest what they might do or use if each one were not available. As an extension activity students are asked to identify one appliance that he or she uses every day and refrain from using it for one week. They  then write and share brief reports about how difficult or easy it was to do without their favorite appliances and what they did or used instead. Other activities include a candy/gum buying simulation, role playing a small claims court case, analyzing their own spending habits, preparing personal budgets, recycling an empty container, and comparing prices of items in different stores.

        "description":"This paper assesses the impact of computer based research activities on attitudes of students in an introductory sociology course at Ball State University toward sociology and toward course activities. Special emphasis is placed on attitude differences when research activities are incorporated on a voluntary or required basis. The objective is to provide insight into one aspect (i.e., student attitudes based on various types of experience with computer research) of the role of computer based technology in the shift in teaching methods in colleges and universities in the United States from lecture and textbook approaches to approaches based on more active student participation. The method involved surveying students regarding their attitudes toward having small research group  meetings once a week instead of four lectures per week. Findings indicated that student attitudes toward computer research activities were more closely related to whether there was a choice about participating in the activities than they were to the activities themselves. Specifically, findings indicated that negative attitudes emerged when research activities were mandatory for the entire sociology class or for a selected group of students and that positive attitudes resulted when students participated in the activities by choice. Further, students in the mandatory research group found the computer activities difficult, indicated a high degree of anxiety about the course, disliked sociology, and recommended that research activities involving computers be dropped. The conclusion is that  students will master computer skills more easily and react more positively toward computer based research activities when they are given the option of whether to participate in such activities.

Canoeing, backpacking, skin and scuba diving, and camping served as a catalyst for the program with the primary emphasis on the study of the environment. Findings revealed that these physical activities contributed to the growth of positive attitudes toward the concepts of individual responsibility, group differences, awareness of environmental problems, and sense of belonging. The active involvement of the  participants in team efforts such as camping, canoeing, and skin and scuba diving had a tendency to enhance interactions among students.

A review of available measurement instruments, both published and unpublished, is presented along with information about their appropriateness for use in determining student achievement of the specified educational goals. A research model for use in determining student achievement of the goals of education identifies several types of educational variables which may affect outcomes and offers some sample sets of research hypotheses.

        "description":"Considerable research has been done relating measures of teacher personality or attitudes to classroom behaviors, pupil achievement, and pupil attitudes. The major purpose of these studies has been to identify patterns of classroom behaviors, attitudes, concerns, and conceptual processes which characterize teachers. Fifty-one junior high teachers participated in a study of classroom organization by completing a questionnaire on teacher beliefs. Eight dimensions of teacher attitudes concerning educational goals included: subject-matter emphasis; personal adjustment ideology; student autonomy vs. teacher direction; emotional disengagement; consideration of student viewpoint; classroom order; student challenge; and integrative learning. Teachers also answered questions concerning  class organization, instructional emphases, behavior management, and teacher concerns. Biographical data was also collected. The effects of teacher control, social-emotional concerns, integrative learning, and role separation on classroom techniques were examined. Results indicate that teacher beliefs predict classroom processes and results, but not in a simple fashion. A composite of several beliefs (high role separation, high integrative learning, and low social-emotional concerns) seems to be related to certain processes and results (high academic on-task behavior, high achievement, and low student ratings of teachers). A profile of teacher beliefs could be useful in predicting teacher behavior and management effectiveness. (CJ)",

        "description":"The teacher's ability to manage the classroom has been consistently associated with pupil achievement and high pupil attitudes. Research has also shown that classes with high proportions of low ability students tend to be more difficult to manage because of the special needs of these students. This paper focuses on the strategies and behaviors apparent in classrooms of teachers who are teaching similar subject matter content to classes of differing ability levels. Two low ability classes were also examined to contrast teacher behaviors which are successful in initiating and maintaining instructional activities. Higher ability classes had teachers who: (1) described and presented objectives and materials more clearly; (2) provided content and reasonable work standards related to  student interests and needs; (3) were consistent in dealing with student behavior; (4) were receptive to student input; (5) nurtured affective skills; and (6) maintained a task-oriented focus. Teachers in low ability classes were seen as adapting presentations to ability levels, reinforcing inattentive student behavior, and using more personal conferences to stop misbehaviors. Maintaining student cooperation and attention was harder in the low ability classes. A comparison of the two low achieving classes suggests that there are optimal ways of providing instruction to increase productive learning time. (CJ)",

The beginning of the school year can be crucial to teaching success in these schools. Case studies are presented of three different teachers teaching in a single low socioeconomic, minority junior high. Comparison is made of classroom activities, organizational strategies, and student behavior in the classrooms of three teachers of varying managerial effectiveness. Concrete illustrations are provided of some beginning-of-school teaching strategies which appear to work in such a setting. The teachers were observed in the opening days of school and six times throughout the year. It was concluded from these observations that what  teachers do to establish a productive classroom climate and to orient students in the first few days of school is an important determinant of classroom management and teaching success in junior high school. However, without continuing, consistent enforcement of the rules and behavior standards set in the first days, a productive classroom climate may deteriorate rapidly. (JD)",

This assessment testing is part of the testing component within the Alaska Statewide Instructional Support System (SISS), and is based on specific objectives critical to a student's academic success. Objectives covered are: mathematics computation, mathematics application, word identification and reading comprehension. The results are based on a statewide sample of students in grades 4 and 8. Student performance was compared to desired levels of performance on specific learning objectives. Statewide, scores did not change substantially between 1977 and 1979 for grade 4; across all content areas in 1977, students in small/rural districts scored lower than those in large or medium-sized districts.  Bilingual students in grade 4 did better in 1979 than in 1977. Students in grade 8 showed similar patterns across all content areas; those from large and medium-sized districts performed better than those in small/rural districts for both years. Nonbilingual students performed better than bilingual students. In both grades, students with reading problems did not do as well as those without such problems. Statewide, 1979 performance results were better than the 1977 sample. (Author/GK)",

        "description":"Because testing and the use of test results are controversial subjects, parents and advocates must exercise considerable care when working to assure that tests are appropriately used in public elementary and secondary schools. One should guard against making assumptions which may have been created by widely publicized reports about test abuse. Prior to discussing test use with educators, parents and advocates should be clear about the specific nature of their concerns, as knowledgeable as possible about testing, and have outlined the specific information they want from the educators. Considerations should include: (1) tests should be used to help children; (2) educators should be able to clearly explain the meaning of test results; and (3) tests and test results should not be  considered to be the exclusive property of the school or school district. Each year, parents and advocates need to systematically determine who required the test to be given and how the test results will be used in order to determine whether the tests are truly being used to benefit the children.

Complete statewide results of this California Assessment Program (CAP) are presented, including the following features that have become standard: (1) detailed findings including those of specific skill areas within each major area, and the skill area findings for mathematics reported separately for boys and girls on the basis of socioeconomic level; (2) national comparisons; (3) expert interpretations of the results by identifying skill areas of impressive student performance and those that need attention; (4) test results comparable to those of previous years; (5) subgroup analyses; (6) correlates of achievement  focusing on the amount of time students spend watching television, reading, and doing homework. Two important changes to the CAP were related to grade 3 and included a new test of written language and mathematics, as well as a new scaled score reporting system which allows for comparisons of scores from year to year. Two reasons for revising the CAP included enhancing its relevancy and breadth, and using the matrix sampling technique to reduce the amount of testing time.(RL)",

Specific attention is given to the history of attitude measurement, characteristics of attitudes, steps for scale construction, reliability, validity, and other technical considerations.

        "description":"In 1977 Congress mandated an assessment of the &quot;economic and social consequences,&quot; of the nation's 4-H programs. The evaluation problem posed involved the identification of all social and economic effects caused by some facet of a very large, nationally decentralized youth education program. The design utilized drew on exploratory research methods to focus on inferred, attributed, and demonstrated consequences at three orders of occurence. This mandate sparked conflicting concerns between sponsoring and administering stakeholders for &quot;integrity&quot; and for &quot;pragmatic necessity&quot; in evaluation design. In the course of dealing with these conflicts, several potentially critical differences in large and small scale evaluation situations were identified. Some of the differences suggested  included: (1) nature of the evaluation question, where large scale evaluations (LSE) tend to assess underlying funding policy or rationales and smaller scale evaluations (SSE) tend to assess program operations; (2) program variance, which increases with scale; (3) data management and collection, where LSE are more costly than SSE; (4) effect of time and resource constraints, which are more likely to effect design and methodological choices in LSE; and (5) stakeholders' attitudes and behaviors, which seem to increase with fear, suspicions, and controversy as scale increases.

        "description":"Previous research on the nature of aptitude processes had ignored the important differences between speed and level of performance. However, investigations of the relationship between individual differences in speed and level suggest that speed of solving simple spatial tasks is largely independent of level attained on more complex spatial tasks. The present experiment was designed to investigate the relationships between speed, level, and complexity in individual differences in spatial ability. Thirty male high school and college students were selected to represent a wide range of individual differences in verbal ability and spatial ability. Subjects were required to match, rotate, combine, and combine and then rotate three to eight point polygons. Each subject was administered  216 items. Data were analyzed using regression, analysis of variance, and correlational techniques. Correlations between intercepts, slopes, predicted times at maximum difficulty, and level scores and reference constructs supported the basic hypothesis of speed-level independence. In particular, individual differences in speed of solving simple items were independent of both level on the task and reference abilities. Speed of solving complex items was strongly correlated with level on the task, but more highly correlated with verbal than spatial reference constructs. (Author/RL)",

The school system in question applied for state funding to develop appropriate instrumentation and implement such a plan. Its uniqueness was in its attempt to secure funds for developing an evaluation for a given program. Because the project called for test development, program evaluation, and curriculum evaluation and validation, specialists in these areas were included on the multi- disciplinary evaluation team along with faculty members from the Evaluation Research Center and Foundations of Education Department and graduate students. After examining the program proposal, objectives, and curriculum documents, descriptions of the existing program for the gifted and the  evolving program for students gifted in the fine and performing arts were developed. The 3-year project proposal called for development and implementation of an evaluation design, development of assessment instruments, and development of a plan for reporting student achievement. The team approach to evaluation resulted in bringing about the anticipated positive results. Various benefits accruing to the university, school system, and the state department are identified. Components of the project are detailed in the appendices. (Author/GK)",

First, key premises used by the UEPP are outlined. These include: (1) principals are the major decision makers for the use of project resources across the district, while central office project staff serve as coordinators and resource people who carry out the principals' decisions; (2) improvement in a high school district comes both from within each school and from coordinated project-wide activities; (3) urban schools can improve if a comprehensive approach is made in the areas of student achievement, student motivation,  student conduct, staff development, and community involvement; and (4) model urban programs should be developed and tested in those classrooms they are meant to influence. Progress to date in the areas named above (student achievement, motivation and conduct, staff development, and community involvement) is then discussed and is described as excellent. Finally, five case examples from the model (the Council of Principals, the Honor Clubs, the Extended Day program, Talent Search, and the University Collaboration program) are analyzed in terms of their potential for contributing to successful model building programs.

Teacher education personnel at five colleges and universities were interviewed for data collection. The majority of programs studied were begun within the last four years in response to state mandates and multicultural education standards adopted by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. Programs were usually initiated by individual faculty members, although committees were soon established to provide leadership. Short range goals varied from offering a course in multicultural education to establishing multicultural education centers and/or offering  graduate degrees within departments of curriculum and instruction. Long range goals included expansion of short range objectives, securing financial support, and integrating multicultural processes within the schools. Recommendations for institutions desiring to establish multicultural education programs are included.

Professors were  found to incorporate activities into their courses to promote racial understanding, address practical issues related to training teachers to work in desegregated schools, and promote the development of positive teacher attitudes toward a variety of racial groups. Continuing review of course outlines was recommended to ensure ongoing professorial commitment. (Author/MK)",

Within each stage a comprehensive list of career  development tasks is specified. Chapter 3, A Diagnostic Taxonomy of Adult Career Problems, addresses the conceptualization and development of the taxonomy. Major tasks explored are decision making, implementing plans, organizational/institutional performance, and organizational/institutional adaptation. Chapter 4,The Diagnostic Assessment of Career Development Problems, provides a framework emphasizing problem identification, problem analysis, and problem evaluation. Case studies are included. Chapter 5 reports on a pilot study based on a direct measurement design of problem behaviors of the establishment stage, and Chapter 6 discusses implications for further research and makes twelve recommendations.

Most data are projected from responses by 610 companies to a lengthy Conference Board questionnaire. The report also reflects information and insights gained through personal interviews with executives at scores of these same firms. The first section (chapters 1-3) presents an overview of the corporate employee education and training activity, describing its goals, scope, staffing, and organization. A second section (chapters 4-5) describes industry's use of outside resources for employee development and its own  after-hours programs, while a third (chapter 6) is devoted to the internal programs provided during working hours. Section 5 (chapter 7) reports on the views of business executives about facets of the industry-school relationship. Finally, several case illustrations provide a glimpse of the full range of education and training activities in individual companies. Companies represented include Cincinnati Milacron, John Breuner Company, and John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company. Appendixes include (1) a brief report on educating nonemployees, (2) descriptions of existing company courses, (3) summary of the survey sample and methods, and (4) additional data on company expenditures.

In addition, demographic information regarding the teachers was gathered to study the relationship between application scores and these selected variables: (1) teacher age, (2) number of years teaching experience, (3) number of female students currently enrolled in the production agriculture class, and (4) geographic location in Ohio. The 1979-80 Production Agriculture State FFA degree application was the instrument used for the study. A set of three sample degree applications to be scored and ranked was  developed. One group of teachers received a packet with one application with a female name and two with male names; the second group received the same applications with the student name changed to one of the opposite sex. Study findings indicated that production agriculture teachers do not demonstrate sex stereotyping when evaluating male and female State FFA degree applications. There was a negligible correlation between the selected variables and application scores. (YLB)",

The subjects were thirty-five female introductory psychology students. Five were black, one was Oriental. About three-quarters were first year. Five were majoring in the social sciences, eleven in traditional liberal arts, the rest were from various undergraduate professional schools. Four TAT slides were used to elicit imaginative stories. Subjects also responded to open-ended questions. Results indicated  priority of personal success definitions was, in descending order, personal satisfaction, people, effects and job, and family life. Common reasons for career preference were helping people, loving people, and liking and interest. Education and career-related work were the most frequently mentioned career-directed actions. Most subjects planned career-preparatory work or graduate education. The motive to avoid success was negatively related to (1) femininity; (2) priority given to personal satisfaction, jobs, family life, and people in general; and (3) career choice because of liking for and interest in field.

Project activities included continuous staff training through inservice workshops, staff development sessions, and refresher meetings; recruitment of high school juniors and seniors (700 in three years); and recruitment of 300  participating community sites. In addition to completing in-school requirements and electives, REAL students were required to demonstrate certain competencies, participate in short-term community exploration experiences, and complete projects including both career and academic tasks designed to meet individual student needs. Project and school district personnel and a third-party evaluator felt that all project goals were successfully achieved and recommended that a modified version of REAL be adopted on a statewide basis. (Appendixes constituting six-sevenths of the report contain the third-party evaluation report, project REAL components, and REAL publicity.) (MN)",

        "description":"Explanations of age-related differences in adult memory usually assume two forms: processing deficits and structural deficits. Processing deficit explanations attribute recall differences to a failure of older adults to effectively use the processes of attention, organization, mediation (the use of such devices as visual images and verbal images and verbal expressions to link meaningful bits of information into integrated memorable whole), and elaboration (the use of a levels-of-processing approach for encoding bits of information in a systematic hierarchical fashion). Structural deficit explanations attribute differences to speed and capacity limitations associated with age-related changes in the central nervous system. Findings of discourse-learning studies suggest that  characteristics of the adult learner interact with characteristics of the material to determine recall outcomes. Sex and educational background of older adults influence recall scores. It is possible that part of the observed age-related recall difference is due to metacognitive factors. (Metacognition is the general knowledge that guides selection and implementation of task-specific operations.) While older adults may fail to integrate seemingly trivial facts, they integrate meaningful new knowledge with existing related knowledge, ensuring high levels of recall. Activation of existing knowledge may help to moderate recall deficits in older adults. (Author/MN)",

The programs were evaluated on the basis of an eleven-category evaluation system developed by Cyril Houle in his study &quot;The Design of Education.&quot; After evaluation with respect to materials, teaching method, student participation, teacher participation, location planning, support, supervision, and follow-up, three other approaches to adult literacy program design were similarly evaluated: (1) Laubach's religiously oriented approach, (2) Paulo Freire's psycho-socially oriented approach, and (3) that approach revolving around aspects of functional  literacy which is espoused by the United Nations. After a comparison of the effectiveness of these approaches to that of the ABES programs, fifty-seven guidelines were developed for program planning; creating and using materials; facilitating student and teacher program participation; selecting a program location; and program support, supervision, and follow-up.

(The APL project involved the identification of competencies required to function in society, the assessment of competency levels among American adults, and the development of curricula and guides for adult competency based education programs.) In her report Joan Fischer compares the APL effort to eleven other efforts to identify adult competencies (some of them based on APL), examines the APL study, and  reviews twelve national and state level competency identification efforts (in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Alaska, Utah, California, and New York). She concludes with a summary of competencies deemed important by the APL and other efforts. In their report Haney and David review the history of the original APL effort, examine the conclusions of five major APL critics, add their own criticism, examine the reasons for the spread of APL to state and local programs, and point to areas for further study. They conclude that the value of APL has been its contribution to broadening the conceptions of how adult basic education can be organized and to enriching the body of curriculum materials on which adult educators can draw. They question, however, the plausibility of searching for any one set of  knowledge and skills with which to define overall adult competence in a variegated and pluralistic society. (MN)",

Local leadership is the most essential ingredient in successful job creation programs at the community level. Local leaders can work to obtain baseline information about the community relating to its economic health, the extent and character of its unemployment and underemployment, its available resources, and its education and training programs; identify the community goals and objectives to which vocational education can contribute; and define the joint responsibilities of civic, business, industry, and educational leaders. At the same time, state leaders need to work with local education  and community leaders to implement programs. State leaders have several functions to perform: (1) planning with local leaders, (2) linking the efforts of others to build on prior successes, and (3) coordinating the various services and resources available at the state and local levels. State-level coordination provides a number of advantages over local education alone. These advantages are a minimum of lead time for training, more reading available start-up training, and wider program accessibility. (MN)",

Two exemplary sites using a set of performance-based teacher education (PBTE) modules and supporting materials developed by NCRVE were selected for detailed study of impact: Temple University and the University of Central Florida. Major focus of field work was determining the effects of the PBTE modules. Findings indicated PBTE (1) helped vocational teacher education programs survive in a period of retrenchment; (2) increased access to vocational teacher certification, accountability, convenience to teachers, flexibility, teacher competency in some areas, and teacher's self-evaluation and  responsibility for learning; (3) shortened time required to certify teachers; and (4) changed teacher's role from classroom lecturer to instructional manager. Conclusions drawn about effects of PBTE curricula included that it has changed aspects of delivery of vocational teacher education, appears more effective and efficient in educating teachers than traditional approaches, is perceived by users as a high quality product, provides impetus to the competency-based vocational education movement, and appears to have long-term impact on improving teachers.

To facilitate the impact of research activities, one must develop procedures to predict and assess research impact. At present, the responsibility for impact assessment usually lies with researchers. This causes difficulty for some researchers who fail to see how impact assessment of their individual projects pertains to overall state program goals. Beginning this assessment process with clarification of funding program rather than individual project goals would eliminate this difficulty and foster inter-project linkages. This approach helps eliminate  the temptation to fund only low-risk, low-payoff projects, helps establish more realistic and attainable expectations, and encourages multiple-year efforts. Focusing on programs and program goals does not, however, eliminate the need for project designers to determine their own goals and methods for measuring impact. Intended immediate impact should be assessed during the funding life of the project, and long-range impact can be assessed as part of the evaluation of the success of the total program.

        "description":"The objective of this project was to develop and test a method of offering technical education to individuals employed in the electrical power industry. Representatives from industry were invited to an advisory council meeting where attention was focused on the needs of the industry. This information was used to define an extensive curriculum, and selected units were identified for implementation. It was decided that the method of presentation would consist of highly structured criteria-based units using sound-on-slide instruction. A significant part of the program was the use of a traveling laboratory housed in a 35-foot semi-trailer. The units were evaluated through pre- and post-testing and were revised. Once a unit was completed, a student text to accompany the unit was  produced. Results of the field testing indicate that the project has been successful in meeting its objectives. Additional work in continuing education for particular areas is suggested. (Appended are the following units--Information Booklet, Introduction to Electric Distribution, Distribution Substations, Power Factor Improvement--a sample certificate, and a typescript for Distribution Substations.)

It also interprets the findings in light of public policy implications for job training and employment programs. Chapter 1 introduces the problem and sets up a core model for research on the early, middle, and late periods of youths' early careers. Chapter 2 reviews the youth career literatures and notes research that should yet be done. Chapter 3 provides research methods for analysis of early youth careers, notes variables, and suggests methods of analysis. Chapter 4 reports results obtained by the  various methods, with information on the effects of sex, race, education, socioeconomic status, disadvantaged background, age, urbanization, job level, and tenure. Chapter 5 summarizes findings of the study and presents recommendations for public policy. Appendixes include tables of regression analyses for various core models, tables of variables, and references. (KC)",

        "description":"A study of apprenticeship systems in a large number of foreign countries revealed considerable interest in expanding and improving apprenticeship systems, both as initial training systems and as a way of easing the transition from school to work and relieving youth unemployment. The American apprenticeship system differs from those of other Enghish-speaking countries by a relative absence of skill shortages, the alternative routes to skilled status, the absence of training boards or councils, the concentration on construction trades in apprenticeship, and the advanced age of apprentices. In these other countries apprentices are concentrated in relatively few occupations, and full-time vocational education competes with or is replacing apprenticeships in many occupations.  On-the-job training includes broadbased introductory training and pay incentives. Successful related instruction depends upon administrative or institutional coordination of instruction and on-the-job training. Few foreign countries have policies to expand minority and female program participation. In most countries public finance of apprenticeship systems and participants has increased. Study of these foreign systems yields few policy implications for the American system. Implications for the American system include increasing the number of apprenticeships and occupations using apprentices, and strengthening the role of the Federal Committee on Apprenticeship.

        "description":"A study was conducted to refine and coordinate occupational analysis, job performance aids, and elements of the instructional systems development process for task specific Air Force maintenance training. Techniques for task identification and analysis (TI &amp; A) and data gathering techniques for occupational analysis were related. While TI &amp; A and occupational analysis can function as complementary technologies for major improvements in Air Force maintenance, there are substantial incompatibilities between them. TI &amp; A technology identifies specific tasks for specific hardware whereas occupational analysis identifies sets of heterogeneous maintenance tasks across an Air Force Speciality Code (AFSC). Expansion of the latter technology by gathering information on hardware-specific  bases is necessary to effectively combine both TI &amp; A and occupational analysis. The gathering of hardware-specific information and the gathering and displaying of data on activities which are common elements of many maintenance tasks such as the use of test equipment and hand tools are proposed. Analysis of this data will identify patterns of personnel/job/hardware relationships for reclustering hardware for improved specialty codes and cost-effective instructional systems development. The identification of such clusters will result in better personnel practices, more cost-effective utilization of Air Force manpower, and improved maintenance. (MN)",

Five categories of individuals, all considered vocational education decision makers, were surveyed: AVTI board members, legislators, AVTI directors, AVTI superintendents, and State Board Members. Participants responded to a twenty-seven-item survey instrument indicating agreement or disagreement to each item on a Likert-type scale. Items addressed the issues of governance, taxation and financial support, satisfaction with the present delivery system of postsecondary vocational education, and the connection between the method of taxation and  governance. Respondents agreed that (1) AVTIs should remain under direct management of local boards; (2) the AVTI levy and governance of the AVTIs were connected; (3) the state board, state department of education, and local school boards were doing a good job of delivering vocational education services (they were satisfied with present government structure); and (4) a local tax levy to support AVTIs is appropriate and equitable.

Data revealed the following: (1) the existence of overlapping and contradictory funding distribution requirements arising from contradictions in the amendments and from their ambiguity,  (2) little evidence that the implementation of planning requirements effected any substantial changes, (3) a general strengthening of state evaluation capabilities with more emphasis on program quality than on outcomes, and (4) difficulty in determining the effects of vocational education programs because of the many factors other than school curriculum which affect student achievement.

        "description":"From 1978-79 incidence of long hours among full-time wage and salary workers dropped for the first time since the 1974-75 recession. Of those who worked long hours, about 43% received premium pay (time and one-half the regular wage for hours worked in excess of forty per week). Employers used overtime hours to cope with disequilibrium phenomena and to meet increased demand. One-third of the workers regularly working long hours received premium pay, compared with two-thirds of those working long hours occasionally. Incidence of long hours remained about the same in goods-producing but fell in service-producing industries. Although white- and blue-collar employees were equally apt to work long hours, incidence of premium pay was much lower for white-collar workers. The proportion  of union workers on long hours was two-thirds that for nonunion workers, while the proportion receiving premium pay was twice as large. Frequency of long hours among women was only half of that among men. Black workers were much less likely than white to put in long workweeks. Individuals aged 25-54 had the highest incidence of long hours.

Both are  based on three basic standards: (1) detection, prevention, and elimination of original discrimination; (2) detection, prevention, and elimination of reverse discrimination; and (3) upholding of educational/employment standards. Furthermore, chapter 2 identifies ninety checkpoints/stages in the educational process, and chapter 3 identifies forty-seven checkpoints/stages in the staffing process at which discrimination should be avoided. Some checkpoints are required, others are suggested.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the effect of the college attended on the occupational attainments of students. Data were obtained from the National Opinion Research Center on the occupational and educational activities of the college class of 1961 and analyzed by path regression techniques. (Analyses were limited to the activities of male graduates who entered professional and business-managerial occupations; female graduates' activities were not analyzed, although some data are provided.) Results of the study included (1) that college origins influence careers among professional occupations, not among business-professional ones; college origins provided differential first-job status, and they also appeared to be associated with subsequent mobility; and (2) college origins  influenced the occupational achievement of low status individuals more than of high status college graduates; grade point average was more important to the attainments of high status graduates than it was among low status ones. Implications of the research are that the social stratification system is made up of chains of opportunity, and that it is important to be able at the the right place at the right time (right college). The findings suggest that policies have to be tailored to the specific occupational segment in question; that society needs to provide incentives in the occupational market as much as in the educational market; and that more attention should be paid to the question of who goes to what college.

In later chapters the authors, who were involved in the Vermont Adult Basic Education (ABE) program, address issues that learners find more difficult to deal with. Chapter 1 provides adult learners' views of what it is (and is not) like to be illiterate. Topics considered include mythologies of literacy, realities of the mythology, realities of illiteracy, coping with illiteracy, and realities of literacy. Chapter 2 concerns what it is like to decide to become literate. Both constraining forces and facilitating factors are  discussed. Chapter 3 focuses on what the process of becoming literate is like, who can support this process, and how. It addresses the necessary unlearning and relearning and what is learned. Chapter 4 then describes how the Vermont Adult Basic Education Program integrated home-based tutorial instruction with more traditional methods of delivering adult basic education. (YLB)",

This project analyzed the reasons for earnings disparity among white and nonwhite, males and females in the labor market. The comparison was made by using the human capital framework to analyse the extent to which various personal characteristics and market factors contribute to earnings for a representative sample of American youths. The data used in this study were obtained from a survey conducted by the Opinion Research Center for the Division of Extension at the University of Texas. These data provide information about the earnings, age, training, schooling, location, occupation, and functional competency or ability of the persons surveyed. The analysis of these data determined the returns on  various forms of human capital investment for the different groups. It was found that increased competency or functional literacy was most important to white females and nonwhites in explaining labor market success. White male youths' performance in the labor market was not greatly affected by increased competence. The study recommended that functional competency improvement programs be made available to youths.

Its basis is research concerning vocational education; sociometric conditions and needs; analyses of the past, present, and future of vocational education; and the current state of the art relative to curriculum systems. This competency-based model utilizes the research effort of Groneman, including the ten purposes of occupational experience and thirty-two teaching competencies developed through occupational experience. These purposes and competencies are correlated with a list of the ten major factors in the role of the vocational teacher as taken from performance-based teacher education materials developed at The Ohio State University by the National Center for  Research in Vocational Education. (This chart is provided.) The competency-based work experience component proposed integrates course work and field application into a unified comprehensive program. Basic programming principles should be used for each phase of the work experience component's development. They are (1) knowledge of specific outcomes, (2) entry assessment, (3) simulations/work situations, (4) progress monitoring, and (5) recycling.

They contain information on the characteristics of handicapped persons, and some of the psychological and legal considerations that form the background from which the students come; and they focus on developing insight that will help instructors to provide a better program for handicapped students. The materials consist of four learning experiences, with self-checking tests for each experience. Learning experience 1 explores the characteristics of handicapping conditions and the psychological factors associated with them; learning experience 2 provides an orthopedically handicapped simulation; learning experience 3 discusses learning disabilities and includes a  sample of how a reading-disabled student views a text selection; and learning experience 4 provides a simulation of visual impairment.

        "description":"Within the context of the reauthorization of the Vocational Education Act of 1963, as amended, the predominant issues for vocational education in the eighties will be refined into policies. Central issues related to reauthorization and to the larger picture of the future of vocational education can be generally grouped into four broad categories: (1) federal role and national purpose of vocational education; (2) governance of the enterprise; (3) equity, access, and civil rights; and (4) program improvement. The federal role should be one of stimulation, equalization, and improvement. A nationwide statement of purpose must emphasize the critical nature of vocational education. Governance includes both the sole state agency concept and linkages with other agencies and groups.  Provisions for equity, access, and civil rights must clearly be spelled out and enlarged upon in the new legislation. As part of program improvement, new technology, productivity, and economic development should not be ignored as a dimension of the outreach capacity of vocational education. These issues are the basis for laws which generate policies. Vocational education will become a dependent variable in the educational, social, and economic subsystems of the country when it achieves a political posture based on program effectiveness. (YLB)",

The Technical Report of the Seminar on Planning and Management of Mass Media for Nonformal Education Programs in SEAMEO and Associate Member Countries (Singapore, November 27-December 5, 1978) is then reproduced in full. The next article reports progress of the Lingap ng Pangulo sa Barangay, a school-on-the-air program commenced in 1977 in  the Philippines. The following three articles are extracts from papers concerning nonformal education broadcasting in Pakistan: (1) description of the Programms for Farmers, (2) evaluation of the results of an ongoing Adult Functional Literacy Project (AFLP) utilizing television at Community Viewing Centers, and (3) a followup of people who undertook the AFLP program. The issue concludes with two articles on problems of obtaining material in Western Samoa and on a recent seminar and workshop in Thailand for senior broadcast managers. (YLB)",

In the first report the failure of program evaluation in rehabilitation is traced to the fact that counselors are not neccesarily evaluators, to the existence of vague and ambiguous VR goals, and to faulty evaluation methodology. Efforts in the development of VR program evaluation criteria are discussed in the second report on the relationship of program evaluation and VR agencies. In the third  and fourth reports the Pennsylvania and Mississippi model evaluation units document their experiences in the formation of their model units. Suggestions and forms for managing information requests dealing with VR evaluation are provided in the fifth report. Two book reviews (the first on Joseph S. Wholey's Evaluation: Promise and Performance and the second on Scarvia Anderson and Samuel Ball's The Profession and Practice of Program Evaluation) constitute the final two reports. Appendixes include a bibliography of program evaluation literature and a list of periodicals and journals relating to rehabilitation and evaluation. (MN)",

Significant findings, conclusions, and implications are found at the beginning. The introduction section summarizes followup studies in general and those studies specific to the spinal-cord injured. The methodology section overviews the research population (297 former Arkansas Rehabilitation Service spinal-cord-injured clients three to four years postentry into an Innovative and Expansion service delivery project) and initial and followup questionnaires. Results are presented in two subsections. The first, Life Status at Followup, contains categorical information  describing what happens to spinal-cord-injured persons after rehabilitation services, including satisfaction with services, vocational economic characteristics, and changes in life status. The second subsection, Indexing Adjustment to Spinal Cord Injury, is a technical supplement describing an empirical measure of adjustment from the perspective of the disabled with these eight subscales: (1) avocational-intellectual, (2) avocational-leisure, (3) basic adult daily living (ADL), (4) independent ADL, (5) shopping-cleaning ADL, (6) vocational activity, (7) general physical health, (8) general mental health.

        "description":"Three demonstration projects were conducted to determine if worker attitudes toward and participation in employer- or union-sponsored tuition assistance (TA) programs could be favorably influenced by information dissemination, counseling, and links to area educational institutions. Model I consisted only of information dissemination about the availability of TA; Model II (which was not completed) added counseling on site; and Model III consisted of all three variables. The research design involved sampling random cross sections of workers before and after the introduction and operation of a model program at the sites. The data collected showed that the model interventions had significant positive impacts on workers' knowledge of the existence of the tuition aid benefit and how to  use it, on the delivery of information to workers, and on workers' attitudes toward education, training, and their companies and unions. The demonstration projects also encouraged labor-management-education cooperation and fostered changes in the administration of the TA benefit. Recommendations include that employers and unions provide information and counseling about TA to their employees/members; that they cooperate more with educational institutions to provide education meeting worker needs; that changes in the administration of TA plans be made; and that further research, including longitudinal studies and case studies, be done.

        "description":"More than 250,000 federal employees nationwide are participating in a three-year voluntary experiment to find out if the federal government can successfully use flexible and compressed work schedules as alternatives to the traditional eight-hour day, forty-hour workweek. If the experiment is a success, the Congress may modify laws to allow permanent use of alternative work schedules. Because the results of the experiment may significantly affect the work habits and patterns of all federal employees, it is essential that the Congress have valid and reliable information on which to base its decision. The General Accounting Office (GAO) believes that the experiment and evaluation, which the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is currently conducting, will not yield the data the  Congress needs. As a result, the experiment will fail to achieve its intended objectives. GAO makes a number of recommendations to OPM and the Congress to increase the likelihood that the experiment and evaluation will produce the results needed. (Author)",

NIE increased representation of minorities and women in its work force between 1973-79. Minority representation rose from 36% to 42%, while women represent 54% of its work force. The seventeen laboratories and centers conducting educational research projects have some equal employment problems--underrepresentation of minorities and women in professional, management, and governing board positions and overrepresentation of them in clerical and support positions. Long-term agreements containing affirmative action requirements and development of special goals and  timetables should help remedy these problems. NIE has undertaken a number of projects to increase participation of minorities and women in its activities, including the unsolicited proposal program, Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization Program, Minorities' and Women's Program, and black college initiatives program. These efforts have met with some success, but have generally been inadequately funded and staffed. (YLB)",

On-site interviews were conducted with target groups representing all persons integral in female student recruitment, retention, and placement: students, teachers, parents, employers, administrators, and counselors. Conclusions based on interview responses included (1) retention is improved when two or more nontraditional students  are enrolled in a vocational program; (2) teacher attitude is critical to class acceptance of students in nontraditional programs; (3) prior experience in the field is a contributing factor to female enrollment; (4) role models are a significant factor in the success of female students in nontraditional programs; (5) audio-visual instructional, and orientation materials that include representations of females are useful in female recruitment, retention, and placement in nontraditional programs; and (6) support sessions give visibility to nontraditional students.

Part A describes the correlational study to discover how thoughts and actions of community college students related to their satisfaction with outcomes of their decisions. It focuses on the administration to 255 community college students of a Decision-Making Questionnaire (DMQ) to measure actions and thoughts representing five different decision-making styles: rational, impulsive, intuitive, dependent, and fatalistic. Summaries are presented of decision-making behavior associated most highly with ratings of decision outcome satisfaction, decision importance, and decision confidence. Part B reports the experimental study to discover whether teaching a systematic &quot;rational&quot; procedure for making  decisions would improve the &quot;quality&quot; of the resulting decisions. (A good decision is one yielding consequences consistent with the decider's values.) It describes development and use of the Career Decision Simulation (CDS), a standardized procedure for assessing career decision quality through use of an objective, numerical scoring system and providing data on a person's decision-making style. Among findings was that training in rational decision making was not as effective as might be desired. Further research suggestions for this and the correlational study are discussed. Appendixes, amounting to approximately one-half of the report, include the DMQ, DMQ factor analyses, CDS administrator's manual, and curriculum and instructor's guide for teaching rational decision-making and  interviewing skills.

Almost exclusively responsible for the rising number of multi-earner families have been the steep annual increases in the number and proportion of working wives. Since 1970, the number of wives in the work force has increased by one-third (to nearly 24 million). Many of the working wives were also working mothers, since 16.6 million or 54 percent of the women with children under 18 were working; 79 percent of divorced mothers worked in March 1979. Among the most striking changes that occurred during the 1970s was the sharp rise in the number of working women heading one-parent families  (one of seven families in 1979). Tables in this report contain data on workers by race, sex, age, marital status, Hispanic origin, presence and age of children, number of wage-earners in family, contributions of wife's earnings, family income, single-parent family income, occupation, and full- or part-time employment.

In the first paper, Harry Lasker and James Moore review the major works on adult psychological, intellectual, and moral development. They describe the major stage theories posed by researchers and their implications for educators. (For example, some individuals may not be able or willing to respond to directive instruction, while those at a different level of development would welcome this approach and not respond well to others.) In the second paper, Edwin Simpson looks at three components of adult learning. These components are (1) the body of theory on adult learning, from which a number of principles of  learning and teaching can be derived; (2) the psychological and social circumstances of adult learners; and (3) the conditions under which learning takes place (approaches to learning). He views the learning experience as a combination of these three components and suggests that the choice of combinations may vary according to the purpose and circumstances of the learning experience. The unifying theme of these two papers is the importance of recognizing the diversity of adult learners and learning, and putting these differences into integrated frameworks in order to have a foundation for making specific changes and adaptations to help the learner be more effective.

This goal was accomplished by developing an in-service training program to provide school personnel with increased awareness of the unique learning concerns of hearing-impaired students in the classroom. Major project activities included a needs assessment to identify the special learning concerns and vocational counseling needs of hearing-impaired students. Following the needs assessment, training modules were developed to make school counselors and occupational specialists aware of hearing-impaired students' vocational needs. Additional components were designed to provide counselors with skills to more  effectively meet these needs. Evaluation of the workshop format and associated components was accomplished by field testing in four separate sessions. Results indicated that participants were highly positive toward all evaluation issues.

Can generalizable patterns of transition be found, and if so, do these patterns differ according to the age of the respondent? What are women's most difficult and most satisfying times of life? To provide some exploratory quantitative data on these questions, a sample of 120 women completed a questionnaire designed to provide information about personal perceptions of transitional periods. The data indicate a lack of age differences in such areas as perception of the most satisfactory and difficult periods of life, body satisfaction, satisfaction with life, self-concept, and agreement with the goals of the women's movement. The preliminary findings suggest that women's developmental patterns are different from those of  men--e.g., 47% of the subjects indicated that their own personal growth and self-acceptance were the best parts of their present life stages, while 38% indicated that freedom was the best part. The age span from 21 through 25 was mentioned most frequently as the most satisfying as well as the most difficult age range. (Author/CS)",

This paper articulates a model of schema development in adults by defining a schema as a representation of some stimulus domain and a set of rules or plans for processing incoming material and drawing inferences from that material. Data and impressions regarding the four stages of schema development are presented, paralleling the developmental stages that children go through in acquiring grammar and lexical concept. Since few studies have looked beyond a linear relationship between schema processing and expertise, the issue of multiple stages is identified as an area for future research  efforts. (Author/CS)",

An attempt was made to coordinate the teacher's classroom activities with those of the change agent and to devise individualized instructional strategies. To assess the impact of the VIS program on the children, the teachers, and the school, a multivariate assessment strategy was used with a pre-post control-group design. The outcomes for the children appeared to be closely related to the organizational response to the program and to the nature of teacher involvement. By the end of the third year, only one of the three targeted schools remained  actively involved in and supportive of VIS. Teachers in the other two schools were overtly antagonistic to VIS personnel. When the staff became actively involved in the intervention, students made larger gains than in previous years, an indication of the impact of organizational change. (Author/CS)",

Students' reactions to a dormitory lottery in which each student had an equal chance of obtaining a room were studied. The lottery seemed fairest to students who shared the university's beliefs about the equitable distribution of rooms and to those who actually won a room. The students varied widely in their beliefs about who should be given a dormitory room, and their beliefs played an important role in determining their reaction to the lottery. At the same time, however, most of the students seemed to share a single basic criterion for evaluating the lottery, namely, whether or not they thought it would benefit  them personally. (Author)",

        "author":["Martin, David W."],
        "description":"Performance becomes degraded when the human processing system undergoes the stress of processing overload. Information processing models are often used to predict how performance will be affected. Single channel models hypothesize that information will either be lost in the queue or processed with delay. Single capacity models predict that for a single task a speed-accuracy function can describe performance, and that for dual tasks performance-operating-characteristic-functions can describe performance. Multiple channel models suggest that any process can be degraded when a channel is overloaded even though other processes could be carried out by other channels. Multiple capacity models predict that speed-accuracy functions and performance operating characteristics can be found  for processes that require the same capacities, but, depending upon the capacity requirements of each task, the task can trade off in many ways. The emotional reaction associated with stress may require processing resources and acts like a separate sub-task compounding the overload problem. The type of processing required of operators monitoring system status in automated systems may draw from the same resource pool that supplies resources for dealing with stress. When new strategies are needed to allocate attentional resources, the effects of stress seem to be particularly detrimental. (Author)",

To investigate the influence of the perceiver's own disclosure on attraction to a disclosing stimulus person, female subjects (N=48) selected two topics and disclosed information on them to a confederate stimulus person. This disclosure was manipulated to occur either before or after the videotaped confederate selected and disclosed three topics that were either low or high in intimacy. Attraction was assessed by means of a three-item summed liking index and a six-item summed impressions index. Results indicate that impressions of the confederate were more  positive when the confederate disclosed first and when she disclosed intimately. The perceiver's own disclosure was correlated with attraction to the confederate when the perceiver disclosed before her partner, but not when she disclosed after. (Author)",

Mother-only families have higher rates of childhood aggression than do intact, father-present homes. The effect of father presence and father absence on the aggressive behavior of family members was examined, along with the behavior patterns in families with an identified aggressive target child and families without an identified aggressive child. Mother-only families (N=9) and intact families (N=15) receiving treatment for an aggressive male child comprised the sample of deviant families. Mother-only (N=9) and intact (N=16) families from the community comprised the normal sample. Trained observers rated the families over a three-week period using the Family Interaction Coding System.  Families with an identified deviant child were found to demonstrate more aggressive behaviors than families with a normal target child. Of the deviant families, the mother-only family was more likely to be aggressive. Deviant intact families increased more than normal intact families in aggressive behavior when the father was absent. Mothers demonstrated increasing aggression the longer the father was gone, regardless of whether the family was normal or deviant. (NRB)",

Efforts were made to operationalize and classify coping responses and to explore their relationship to treatment outcome in a comparison of recovered alcoholics (N=42), relapsed alcoholics (N=57) and matched community controls (N=89). Comparisons of coping were made after controlling for demographic characteristics, incidence of negative life change events in the past year, the stresses being coped with, and prior levels of functioning (alcohol consumption, emotional and psychosomatic distress). There were no differences between recovered  alcoholics and control subjects. Relapsed alcoholics reported using more avoidance and emotion-focused coping responses. The coping responses were also predictive of posttreatment functioning after controlling for the research variables. Results suggest the importance of coping responses to stress in the process of recovery from alcoholism. (Author/NRB)",

Personality correlates of persistence in education were examined in the context of a causal model of attainment in an eight-year longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of 2213 young men. Results imply that anxiety and commitment are moderately good predictors of presistence in education even when social background and intelligence are statistically controlled. Schooling experiences, especially grades received, influence the development of personality characteristics that are useful in achieving later-life educational and occupational status. Successful school experiences strengthen student bonds to the school social order. Students react to academic  failure by drawing away, and by becoming resentful, detached, and anxious. The implications for schools as socializing agents suggest that schools must accommodate an increasingly heterogeneous mix of students with divergent needs and demands. (Author)",

        "description":"Relevant conceptual frameworks must guide data collection and analysis if data are to be useful to service program planners and administrators. Such frameworks are increasingly important in the systematic assessment of the total array of services in a planning region. This paper describes a two-dimensional classification matrix developed in relation to health and social services for older persons with a potential applicability to other service systems. The first dimension, level of competence, is outlined as five areas of behavioral functioning: (1) life maintenance; (2) perception-cognition; (3) self-maintenance; (4) effectance; and (5) social role. The second dimension, level of independence, is presented as defining a continuum of living arrangements that represent the level  of need for support. This model suggests that, by using this system, services can be simultaneously differentiated according to the levels of competence and independence of those served. The utility of this framework for organizing service data is demonstrated through its application to information collected on services for the elderly in one location. Additionally, the potential of this framework as a tool in the planning process is discussed, and areas needing further development are identified. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"Although age-related memory differences in adulthood occur in a variety of memory tasks, most of these tasks represent uncommon memory demands. An investigation of everyday memory demands explored the effect of contextual organization on memory performance of middle aged (N=20) and older (N=20) women. Tasks involved reconstruction of spatial arrays, with replacement of objects in either a contextually organized panorama or a noncontextually organized bank of cubicles. Performance of the middle aged subjects did not differ between the two tasks. Older subjects performed as well as middle aged subjects in the contextually organized panorama reconstruction, but exhibited a marked deficit in reconstruction of the noncontextually organized version. The pattern of performance and  strategy use supports the conclusion that in a task which allows the use of existing contextual organization as a memory aid, age differences in memory performance disappear. Age differences in adult memory performance may be limited to tasks which remove previously learned relationships between items, requiring subjects to invent an organizational structure to facilitate recall. Such tasks are probably unrepresentative of the memory problems met in everyday life, especially by older adults. (Author)",

Psychological, social and emotional problems result from excess weight, and those who fail in their weight-loss efforts become extremely depressed.

Counselors can have a positive and reinforcing role in weight-reduction programs which combine general group support with behavior modification techniques. This monograph includes: (1) strategies counselors can use with clients; (2) self-management techniques to be practiced by individuals; (3) problems with various age groups and special populations; and (4) dieting \"myths\" and problems associated with both  failure and success in losing weight. Dieting tips are provided and appendices include usable charts and records, a food exchange diet and an extensive list of food exchanges.

This monograph examines some strategies counselors can use to help themselves adopt a future orientation and to assist their counselees in meeting the future confidently. The writings of Cornish, Fletcher and Conboy bring some focus to concepts and dimensions held by futurists and which are related to the counseling profession. It is suggested that counselors hold a set of beliefs (e.g., Change over time is an integral part of understanding the future) in order to aid counselees in developing guiding images about their personal and social futures. Some problems need to be dealt with in this context, including: economics, politics and government, science and technology, individuals and society. Several strategies are  discussed for teaching the futurist/counselors' beliefs: (1) a wheel of consequences is used to illustrate a holistic approach to the universe; (2) a \"Backward Think\" approach illustrates the \"integralness\" of change; (3) image-building of the future is examined through a \"what if?\" approach; (4) alternative choices are highlighted using a decision tree; and (5) purposeful action using a scenario or a future timetable is discussed.

Burnout in human service organizations is also identified, and six conditions that contribute to burnout in organizations are explored: lack of funds, lack of flexibility, lack of decision making powers for middle managers, task overload, little recognition for efforts, and nature of client population. One strategy for preventing burnout is the instituting of a social-professional support group which provides opportunities for organizational and individual assessment, a method  to reduce conflict, feedback and rewards, timeouts for individuals, and screening procedures for new counselors.

One response to this problem is described in this monograph on the School Team Program, a national network of training and resource centers set up to train teams of school and community representatives in problem solving techniques that would help them develop effective programs for youth. Chapter One describes the evolution of the program's network of regional training and resource centers, and briefly documents the impact these centers have had in local communities they have served. Chapter Two explores the rationale behind the training used by the regional centers to prepare school teams for developing effective programs. Chapters Three and Four summarize typical residential training  and onsite support activities. Chapter Five describes the unique management techniques that, from the beginning, have helped to build a national team of like-minded professionals who share a set of mutual program goals and objectives. Impact data were not available at this writing but participants in the nine-year program suggest that problems associated with substance abuse, e.g., arrests and fighting, were reduced.

Examples are given of ways to teach each step that will make reading comprehension an active process.

        "description":"The traditional approach to reading in the content areas has been to teach reading skills only in reading class, usually using literature or narrative selections and expecting transfer of those skills to content texts or other expository materials. The transfer of those reading skills has been such a disappointing experience that even students who are competent in the traditional reading skills have difficulty coping with the particular skills necessary in the content areas. Reading specialists have been trying to convince content teachers that preparing and guiding students in the reading of their textbooks will help students learn and remember more of the content, but a poll of secondary students from a variety of subject areas shows that teachers do not stress the importance  of reading assignments. Rather than waiting for reading in the content areas to be taught, reading teachers can do it themselves. A successful program in a suburban Chicago, Illinois, school uses content materials to teach reading, such as a science text for comparison and contrast format or a history text for cause and effect. The units are based on the specific skill involved rather than literary themes. The approach works well as long as each component is integrated into a whole process. (HTH)",

The data analyzed in the study were student responses to test items varying in their representational (diagrammatic versus verbal) and organizational (pertinent versus extraneous) features. It was found that students' problem solving success was not significantly affected by representing percentage problems diagrammatically, but was powerfully affected by the presence of extraneous organizational features in the test items. The subjects' scores on those items that contained pertinent  information only were significantly higher than those scores on items that also contained extraneous information. There was no specific hierarchy of difficulty found on the basis of representation and organization of features. (RL)",

A Computer-Assisted Language Analysis System (CALAS) was constructed which focuses on the text as any interpretable record of the employment of a language. In making its interpretations, CALAS utilizes a model of the English language, which imputes to its texts the properties of a syntactic and semantic grammar. Data analysis is accomplished in three stages: (1) analyzing the text to identify each word in sequence in terms of its grammatical equivalent; (2) gathering the individual words into phrases, which are again identified in terms of their  grammatical equivalents; and (3) gathering phrases into clauses, with the component phrases displayed within each clause and identifying the phrases within a clause in terms of the roles each plays within the clause. This macro/micro analysis of text invites identification of and comparison among texts in terms of their structural properties. (HOD)",

Twenty-five parents completed the survey instrument, which consisted of questions concerning the number of available children's books in the home, the time spent reading with the child, and the quality or type of behaviors that accompanied or resulted from the shared reading time. The responses showed that (1) the parents placed a high value on making books available to their children, (2) they read to their children from four to seven times a week, (3) the mother was the major person with whom the reading was shared, (4) the child most often initiated the reading, and (5) reading at home encouraged oral language development, acquainted  children with books and print, involved them in activities that extended the concepts encountered in books, and promoted good, social-emotional interaction among family members. Based on these findings, the staff of the child development center created a lending library designed to encourage children to take books home and share them with their families. An informal survey of the lending library's effectiveness indicated general parent approval. (FL)",

The paper notes that English is a fairly regular and complex system in which both sound and meaning share leading roles in determining spelling. Studies are discussed that have shown that common phonic generalizations do not hold true for spelling and it is noted that these research efforts cause conclusions about the logic of spelling because of a limited focus on grapheme-phoneme correspondence and because of the atypical word samples drawn primarily from basal readers. The authors discuss observations that they have made over the year with spelling students of all ages and note that when words  are analyzed with a grid containing the four topics of phonics, semantics, etymology, and preference, most words fall into more than one category of spelling influence. Examples and explanations are provided of words that fall into these four categories. The paper notes that if all these values are not understood and appreciated, then English spelling may seem a morass. (MKM)",

        "description":"A study was designed to test the hypothesis that memory for metaphor was primarily a function of the structure of the metaphor itself. Eighty undergraduate students rated the quality of subsets of 80 metaphors and later freely recalled them, while another 40 students simply read metaphors in their extended contexts and later received a surprise cued recall test. Student ratings of metaphoric quality had only a slight relationship to the frequency with which they recalled those metaphors. There was no relationship between the 80 student ratings of quality and the cued recall frequencies from the other 40 students who merely read the same metaphors. Ratings of conceptual similarity were only minimally related to free recall from students who rated the quality of metaphors in  extended context. The metaphors with presumably the poorest general comprehension were not consistently the most poorly recalled, nor were the best understood metaphors the most frequently recalled ones. The tenors of the metaphors were recalled significantly more often than vehicles in the cued recall measures. These results indicate that memory for metaphor is related to its structure but not to its quality, conceptual similarity, or comprehensibility. That is, metaphoric terms (vehicles) are more effective in reminding people of things that are likened to them (tenors) than vice versa, suggesting that vehicles provide the schema to which tenors are assimilated.

A book list and course objective of ten books in 18 weeks were then devised, and due to lack of funds for materials, the teacher began to collect individual copies of books from the list on her own. In the course, which proved to be very successful, students selected a book and filled in the title, author, and the date they began reading next to their names on a large chart. As they read, they kept a running list of  difficult words they encountered, and on which they could later be tested. To keep track of the students' reading, the teacher reviewed index cards on which the students recorded one or two line summaries of their daily reading. When a student completed a book, the teacher assigned a tailor-made activity specifically related to what the student had read and his or her response. Students found that this approach taught them responsibility for their pace and assignments and independence in researching their own ideas. (HTH)",

In the first part of the study, the four students practiced all the words in a passage until they could recognize them correctly and rapidly (word list practice). They then read the passage aloud and wrote answers to comprehension questions. For the repeated reading practice, the students read a different passage aloud twice and wrote answers to comprehension questions. A comparison of the scores from each condition revealed  that the students' oral reading performance and their comprehension were better when they had repeated reading practice. The second part of the study investigated the effects of modeling correct intonation on the oral reading and comprehension performance of the same four students. The repeated reading practice was the same as in part one, but for patterned response, the children listened to the passage being read as they followed along in their own text. They then read the passage aloud once and took the comprehension test. The results showed that the students scored slightly better in comprehension and made fewer errors in the patterned response method, supporting the theory that prosodic cues have an influence on oral reading and comprehension.

The information was presented in the following ways: (1) analogy embedded in text, (2) analogy given as the topic of an antecedent text, (3) analogy embedded in text in conjunction with an analogous-antecedent text, and (4) information presented on a topic without explicit analogies. The data suggested that attempts to increase background knowledge were more beneficial than a control condition in which no attempt was made, but the overall measures revealed no unique effects related to analogy. Analyses across passages suggested that  the more information subjects were given about the unfamiliar topic, the more text reproductions they produced. The group given analogies both in an antecedent text and embedded in the instructional text generated more text reproductions than the other groups. All of the groups given some information in antecedent texts generated more than the control group, which was not given such texts. Student background knowledge seemed to influence recall regardless of treatment condition. (RL)",

The report focuses on three questions: (1) What conditions lead people to elaborate and organize input facts? (2) What are the mechanisms behind organization? and (3) How well can these organizational mechanisms be interfaced with the original theories of sentence memory? The report reviews some basics of how current sentence memory models represent and retrieve sentences and then illustrates three conditions that lead to an elaboration of representations. It then takes up each condition in detail, reviews the experimental data  showing that the condition does indeed result in an organization of the input, and delineates the theoretical mechanisms involved.

At the secondary school level sustained silent reading is best conducted in a content area classroom. To implement an SSR program, the teacher should discuss it with the class, stimulate interest by having a wide variety of materials displayed, schedule it frequently, constantly add to and change the subject-related materials, diversify the program whenever possible, and give students a chance to evaluate  SSR after a few months.

ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between readability level and grade level for both the space and the cloze data. Consistent with earlier work, readability level of the passage had an effect upon performance on both the space and the cloze tests; the number of correct responses decreased as  the readability level increased. All the students seemed to enjoy completing the space test, and the space test took much less time to complete than the cloze test. These results supported the hypothesis that a space test could, with further reliability and validity research, serve as an informal measure of reading in much the same way as the informal reading inventory and the cloze procedure.

Significant correlations were found between the raw scores on the space test and the cloze procedure, indicating that the two measures assessed similar traits. The data further  suggested that a student was probably reading below grade placement level when scoring below 40% on a space test of a passage written at grade level.

A measure of each student's socioeconomic status was computed based on the father's occupation.

According to this theory, certain kinds of metaphors are based upon underlying analogies, and the processing components used to interpret these metaphors are highly similar to those used in the interpretation of analogies. A critical difference in the two kinds of information processing, however, is in the interaction of tenor and vehicle in the interpretation of metaphor; a comparable interaction does not occur in the interpretation of the domain (first half) and range (second half) of an analogy. In the first experiment, modeling of latencies for comprehending analogies and corresponding metaphors showed that information processing was similar, but not identical, in the two  tasks. In the second experiment, comparisons between different metaphoric forms showed that the proposed theory could account for ratings of the aptness and comprehensibility of various metaphors, and that making more clear the identities of the terms of the analogy underlying a metaphor and the nature of the interaction between tenor and vehicle increased both the aptness and the comprehensibility of a metaphor.

Subjects included 51 children who were identified as having a language-learning disability at ages seven to eight. All children with identifiable hearing loss or neurological deficit were excluded. The criteria for language-learning disability was a low verbal/high performance WISC profile and an identified reading disability of at least one year below age expectation on the Wide Range Achievement Test. Results indicated that early  discrepancy scores between language and general intelligence are suggestive of later language-learning disability.

The findings revealed that the more effective managers (1) were more clear and specific with format requirements for written work, (2) had more consistent and efficient procedures for communicating  assignments, (3) had more systematic procedures for regularly supervising and encouraging students as they worked, (4) stressed careful and consistent checking and turning in of classroom and homework assignments, and (5) were more consistent in the use and manner of feedback to students about assignments.

Trotter Elementary School (Boston, Massachusetts) accomplished (1) the development of an outline of basic writing activities and skills for grades one through five; (2) the use of holistic rating; (3) the development of a common correction symbol; (4) the development of writing folders containing student writing samples; (5) the establishment of a central file of ideas and materials; (6) in-class demonstrations of activities to develop writing skills; and (7) meetings with or communications to parents about the writing program. Teachers' evaluations indicated that the children enjoyed writing more, that the frequency of writing practice increased, and that the students' writing appeared more organized. On the basis of one  holistic rating session of one set of grade five writing samples, it was determined that the writing program had increased the writing ability of the poorest writers in that grade. (Attachments include directions for eliciting writing samples, criteria for judging writing samples, outline of the curriculum guide, the correction symbol system, and samples of student writing.)

        "description":"For many reasons, oral histories should commend themselves to classroom teachers. Sensitively edited, they are eminently readable because of their intimacy, their authenticity, and their varied presentation of human life. As with other books, especially novels written in the first person and autobiographies, oral histories can provide students with insight into the lives of those far different from themselves. Oral history can be used by teachers interested in oral interpretation. Questions concerning the age of the speaker, his or her attitude toward the immediate and distant audience, the speaker's values, and the tone (pitch, volume, quality) of the speaker's voice can aid in the interpretation. For the language arts or English teacher, oral histories can be a springboard into  various writing and editing assignments. Students can interview each other, family members, or members of their communities. Through the experience of interviewing, transcribing, and editing, students can learn that everyone has a story to tell and a personal heritage to be preserved. (A short bibliography of oral histories and how-to books on oral history is provided.) (MKM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to test whether quantitative feedback would help students write with the stylistic simplicity appropriate to their audience and purpose without sacrificing other elements of good writing. Two business and technical writing classes received identical reading assignments, classroom activities, and writing assignments; but one class got feedback on their writing from a computerized readability formula, the Simplified Test Approach for Readability (STAR), which was based on the Flesch readability formula. Five assignments were tested in all, and a nine-point scale was used to assess appropriateness of stylistic simplicity. The results were suggestive but not conclusive. The overall achievement of students in the STAR group correlated more positively with scores  on the stylistic simplicity scale than did the achievement of students in the control group. However, the control group scores on the stylistic simplicity scale were not highly predictive of overall achievement. That is, the control group students may have mastered stylistic simplicity, but their learning did not consistently correlate with overall achievement. Further analysis suggested that feedback to students about grade level equivalents in readability may have accounted for the relation of overall achievement to stylistic simplicity. (RL)",

        "description":"John Kenneth Galbraith maintains that advertising is the prime instrument for the management of total consumer demand and results in increased consumption. Galbraith also maintains that television is a more effective advertising tool, in that it reaches people in all spectrums of intelligence. Other economists disagree, holding that it is actually consumer disposable income that determines consumer demand. A path analytic model was devised to test these arguments with measures and statistics on capitalism, per capita gross national product, advertising expenditures, and aggregate consumption as variables. The results provide strong support for the assertion that it is advertising, rather than general affluence, that is the major determinant of consumption. However, they do not  support the argument that television is a stronger advertising medium than print. Neither print advertising expenditures nor television advertising expenditures predict aggregate consumption as well as do total expenditures. This suggests that advertising media are complementary, and that advertising's greatest effects are achieved with a mix of media. (HTH)",

The instruments were the Attitude and Knowledge in Written Composition from the battery of Illinois Tests on the Teaching of English, the Language Inquiry, the Philosophy of Composition, and participants' writing samples. A preliminary analysis of the evaluation data indicated the summer writing workshops had a positive impact on the participants. Results of the subjective analyses of the participants' philosophies of composition and the telephone  interviews appeared to correlate positively with the results of the two objective measures--the Attitude and Knowledge in Written Composition and the Language Inquiry. It appeared that, following participation in the summer workshops, the teachers either acquired or increased their process orientation toward teaching writing and adapted methods in their classrooms that were compatible with this approach.

        "description":"The social and literary representation of the unmarried woman of \"a certain age\"--the spinster--provides a convenient focus for observing the overall progress of all women in English life. As the single woman's stature increased in the esteem of her culture, English writers began to reflect the changing social attitudes by depicting her in ever more positive ways. The popular poetry of women writers which appeared in the giftbooks, magazines, and monographs that adorned middle- and upper-class drawing rooms in nineteenth century England provides another glimpse of how women themselves regarded the fame and fortunes of the ever-increasing number of spinsters among them. Women poets' attitudes toward the unmarried woman shifted from ridicule, to pity, to respect; finally, in the  1890s the spinster was replaced in prominence in the popular imagination by the competing figure of the \"New Woman,\" a daring and controversial creature whom women poets by and large avoided depicting at all. The poetry of Adelaide Anne Procter, George Eliot, and Augusta Webster help to illustrate the change in attitudes toward the single woman. (HOD)",

Too often drama theorists rely on intuition, tolerating the unexplained and the unsystematized. They could learn from theorists in other fields, such as physics and the \"hard\" sciences, by organizing the facts of their field of knowledge and by realizing that the formulation of theories is a cyclical process of analysis, synthesis, and verification. Organizing the facts known about drama, understanding these facts thoroughly, and using them to improve drama theory is what drama theorists should be doing. In this way they make their own work and work in the general field of drama both easier and more productive. But preparation of theorists must first begin with learning the  facts upon which valid, effective theories are built. In short, drama theorists need to focus on the analysis, synthesis, and verification of the facts of drama. (RL)",

Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a 19-month state of emergency, during which 150,000 people were arrested, newspapers were censored, and dissent was essentially eliminated. A central figure in the confrontation with the Indian government over political suppression before and during the emergency was Jayaprakash Narayan, an outspoken advocate of socialism and a movement to create a classless society. Convinced that Gandhi's government was incapable of achieving the change he felt necessary, in 1973 he urged a peaceful struggle against hunger, unemployment and ignorance. In 1975, when Gandhi was accused of using government employees to aid her election campaign, Narayan tried to topple her  government through mass civil disobedience. He was imprisoned in the ensuing emergency, having precipitated the very suppression he feared. He continued his opposition in prison until he was released because of a serious kidney ailment. When Gandhi failed to win reelection, Narayan helped to form the new government shortly before he died. His denunciations of tyranny, embodied most succinctly in his &quot;Prison Diary,&quot; form an enduring testament to the values of free expression and civil liberty. (HTH)",

Teachers of theory, criticism, and history assert the importance of their studies but do not demonstrate that importance. It is easier for teachers to expose students to explicit material on theory and test them to see if they remember it than to have the students analyze and evaluate it. A reasonable theory course might do the following to help students better understand the use of theory: (1) introduce the student to the basic issues of epistemology, as background for reading Plato and Aristotle; (2) exercise the basic conceptual and evidential skills by analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating assertions by Artistotle and other theorists; (3) synthesize available  understanding, to make clear that theory is not what Aristotle said, but what is understood. Some classroom activities aimed at achieving these ends would include role playing in which the class takes the part of Aristotle defending drama to the instructor's Plato, who is trying to ban drama from his republic. Or the class might defend Shakespeare against Voltaire, which gives the students an opportunity to evaluate and understand these theories rather than just memorize them. (HTH)",

A study was undertaken to clarify the cognitive steps by which recipients went from information about communicator characteristics or situational pressures on the communicator to changing (or not changing) their opinions. Premessage expectancies were examined by means of \"expectancy subjects,\" who were not exposed to a message but received information about an attribute of the communicator. To demonstrate that this information created an expectancy about the communicator's position, these subjects then estimated the position the communicator would take in the message. This  assumed that subsequent to receiving the communicator's position on the issue, recipients made use of the causally relevent information they had available prior to the message. The degree to which this premessage expectancy was confirmed by the position the communciator took in the message was then assumed to affect the outcome at each step of the recipients' postmessage processing. The general impression conveyed by the findings of this study is a lack of sensitivity of premessage and postmessage processing to variations in the communication situation. (HOD)",

Recent research into the functions of the left and right cerebral hemispheres and the patterns of communicative deficit in patients suffering from brain damage suggests that the hemispheres play different roles in these communicative processes. The left hemisphere is particularly involved in the symbolic communication process, while the right hemisphere plays a special role in spontaneous  communication. Damage to the left hemisphere in right handed people is associated with deficits in language expression and comprehension--the aphasias. Nonverbal communication is relatively intact in aphasic patients, however. While it is likely that the two hemispheres are both associated with either spontaneous or symbolic processes, it should be emphasized that the two systems are highly interactive, and serve to modify one another. One cannot be fully understood without the other. (HTH)",

At present, format diversity reflects divergent interests and tastes only as marketplace forces dictate. Neither has format diversity been subject to regulatory scrutiny. Prodiversity policy focuses on nonentertainment programing and is intended to achieve only intramedia diversity. To foster pluralistic programing--and to avoid excessive sameness among formats--unprofitable formats need to be protected in much the same  way nonrenumerative public affairs programing on television is protected.

Three different sources of data on audience dependence on television news were used (1) to examine more closely the shift toward dependence on television for news, (2) to determine the linkage between needs and dependency, and (3) to determine changes in the linkage between needs and dependency over time. In general, the data supported the arguments that dependence emerges from the social fabric and individual needs, because both these types of variables were related to levels of dependence on the media. But such social classifications do not explain the identified shift  to television dependence across time, indicating that there might be a period effect associated with the growth of the medium and corresponding increases in news programing. Any explanatory factor for the increased dependence on television will probably come from an examination of the needs of audience members. It may well be that audience members select television in part to avoid conflict, yet the conflict included in the news presentation of the medium is the very thing producing the frustration they experience.

The paper proposes a course that could be used for inservice training or as a component of a communication course in nurses training. The proposed course would use Mark Knapp's \"Social Intercourse\" as a textbook and would consist of ten one-hour sessions. A course outline, containing descriptions of the topics and activities of each session, is included. (FL)",

Specifically, the study sought to discover whether the basic course should be required and whether public speaking, interpersonal communication, or another activity should be the focus of the basic course. Telephone interviews were conducted with students and former students who had completed the basic course. The findings revealed that the content of the basic speech communication course fulfilled the needs of students and alumni. Both groups recommended that the course be required, that the course should combine interpersonal communication and public speaking, and that it should emphasize practice over theory.  (FL)",

(1) Since most community colleges are open-door institutions, many students are coming to these institutions ill-equipped to handle the oral and listening requirements of academic life, necessitating course work below the basic speech course offering. (2) Noncredit speech communication courses must be developed to supplement the academic offerings. (3) Programs developing particular communication skills will be needed to meet the needs of specific groups within the community. (4) Instructors should evaluate realistically the types of communication skills that their students will need in social and career settings. (5) More two-year  college instructors of speech communication should be involved in community-based consulting. (6) A national effort should be undertaken to ascertain what types of speech programs should be developed at the two-year-college level. (7) Community colleges tend to be conservative in their course offerings, while the expansion of course offerings is the best way to stimulate interest in a field; so speech communication teachers need to take advantage of the trend for specific courses for special people and make that trend a much more dynamic movement.

What role should the communication scholar play in the investigation of terrorism? Specifically, there are six areas within which the communication scholar may actively contribute to an understanding of terrorism as communication: (1) mass media, (2) applied communication, (3) small group/interpersonal communication, (4) rhetoric, (5) intercultural communication, and (6) the ethics of communication. Impact of terrorist coverage upon the general audience, and impact on other terrorists must be considered. Research may indicate that audiences are incited to panic or that other terrorists are incited to further violence. Small group and interpersonal  communication research is needed to study the relationship between hostages, terrorists, and mediators and to determine options available in negotiations. Terrorism occurring in other countries, but which is aimed at audiences in the United States, presents peculiar problems to scholars in intercultural communication. Finally, the morality of media coverage of terrorist violence and self or government regulation is an area of discussion wide open to contribution by communication research. (HTH)",

The paper uses this application as the conceptual basis of a model of interpersonal persuasion that consists of the elements self-esteem, social knowledge, a repertoire of strategies, and an instrumental orientation. The model is explicated and then partially tested by examining correlational data on indicants of the four elements of the model and actual success at persuasion in a laboratory dyadic communication setting. The reported results suggest general support for  the model. (Author/FL)",

Thus, documentary film provides for the artistic portrayal of reality for purposes of influencing public thought. Given the rhetorical bent of this definition, one is surprised to find that very few film critics have examined the documentary from a rhetorical standpoint. To remedy this lack of attention, Humboldt State University, California, has developed a course in rhetorical theory to study the documentary as a rhetorical phenomenon. Throughout the course, the instructor lectures on a particular  theorist, shows a documentary film to illustrate the ideas brought out in the lecture, then leads a discussion exploring the links between the theorist and the film. Some of the films used are, &quot;Sixteen in Webster Groves,&quot;&quot;Webster Groves Revisited,&quot;&quot;The Strange Case of the English Language,&quot; and &quot;The KKK: The Invisible Empire.&quot; The classical rhetorical canons as used in a particular film are also discussed.

Immediacy refers to the language of a message expressing a close relationship to the referent, while nonimmediacy suggests that the language expresses a more distant relationship. Subjects in the study were 118 college students who wrote brief messages in response to hypothetical situations. Receiver status (peer/authority) and receiver attitude (positive/negative) were varied between subjects, while controversiality and importance of the referent were varied (each high/low) within subjects. Cognitive orientation and attitude toward referent were covariates. Cognitive orientation related positively to nonimmediacy. Attitude related negatively to nonimmediacy  only when controversiality was controlled. An interaction was found involving all four independent variables. For all four sources, messages about less controversial referents were more nonimmediate than messages about more controversial referents when the referent was high in importance. When the referent was low in importance, the relationship between controversiality and nonimmediacy tended to disappear or reverse. Only for the peer-negative attitude receiver, however, was there a significant positive relationship between controversiality and nonimmediacy when the referent was low in importance. (Author/RL)",

Studies indicate that classroom interaction, feelings of personal achievement, and pride in workmanship are primary motivators for teachers. Absenteeism may be reduced through strong community support and teacher agreement with district policies. Furthermore, the organizational structure of a school affects motivation. In an environment in which rewards and privileges are distributed evenly and social relations are not highly stratified, teachers are highly motivated. School boards can intensify job satisfaction by creating an environment that enhances teacher self-confidence and achievement. Trust and encouragement are very  important: teachers need to feel that problems will be solved in a non-threatening manner and that praise and acknowledgement are more than token gestures. The school board can promote community support through press releases and public relations campaigns informing people of teachers' positive accomplishments. Minigrants may be awarded to teachers for the implementation of a new idea, or reimbursement may be offered for inservice activities. Finally, teachers may be involved in the decision-making process, working for their own goals as well as for the school's. A sense of influence and achievement are critical in motivating teachers.

Education is the responsibility of all the organizations, institutions, and persons in the state, but the schools, as directed by the Party, have the leading role in developing a citizenry of proper social outlook. This &quot;new Soviet man&quot; will not only contribute through his labor to the expansion of Soviet industrial and military power, but will also actively participate in building a Communist society. The Soviet Union has one of the most extensive preschool programs in the world, providing free, voluntary, nursery schools for children from two month to three years, and kindergartens for children from three to seven years. General education is provided through a system of primary  schools (through third grade), incomplete secondary schools (through eighth grade), and the complete secondary school (through tenth grade, for those who pass examinations at the eighth grade level). The curriculum at all levels of schooling is set nationally. Teacher education is particularly important since education is the primary means for spreading Communist ideology. This booklet describes the nature of Soviet education, noting philosophical emphases, structural characteristics, and major problems of the Soviet system. (Author/PGD)",

The first chapter discusses the history of planning, possible definitions of planning, needs for flexibility, continued evaluation, and communication in successful planning, and the value of planning to educational leadership. Chapter two reviews 14 planning models, including the Banghart-Trull Model, Kaufman's Educational System Planning, the Phi Delta Kappa Educational Planning Model, four state planning models, and seven school system planning models. Established management systems, tools, or techniques are identified in chapter 3. These include the planning-programming-budgeting system (PPBS), zero-based budgeting (ZBB), management by objectives (MBO), systems analysis, needs assessment, the  Delphi technique, management information systems (MIS), forecasting, planning, evaluation, and review technique (PERT), operations research, and checklists. The fourth chapter describes the seven steps in the process of planning. In the fifth and concluding chapter, the author urges awareness of the individual nature of any situation requiring planning and argues that, like other management practices, planning as such is not dehumanizing, but can be used humanely or not depending on the attitudes, interests, and intentions of the planners.

The study, conducted in four Houston high schools, applied the model described in &quot;CCBC Notebook,&quot; February 1980. This report offers a portion of the overall research, providing a summary of the patterns identified. The first segment of the report consists of data collection procedures for the three measured groups: students, teachers, and principals. Two instruments were used, the Class Activities Questionnaire (CAQ) and the Organizational Climate Description Questionnaire (OCDQ), in conjunction with interviews and on-site observations. The second segment lists the findings and analyses. Observations and interviews indicate that the four principals were not equal in their  understanding of instruction and, thus, were not equally clear on intentions for instruction. Table 1 compares actual cognitive activity with the teacher's ideal of cognitive activity on seven cognitive levels. Table 2 compares teacher and principal behavior on four dimensions of organizational climate. Three figures provide correlational interaction between levels of instruction and organizational climate dimensions, suggesting that teachers operate according to their unique perception of the school which may differ greatly from the perception of other teachers within the school. Synthesis reveals that data obtained through interviews and observations were remarkably synchronous with the CAQ and OCDQ data. (JK)",

The service delivery system of the RDU program operated through seven projects in 20 states and served over 300 schools or school districts over the period 1976-79. Qualitative research methods, that is, case study reports, site visit material, and coded written reports, are the data sources for this report. The discussion of the preliminary findings places equal emphasis on products and problem-solving processes. Product characteristics  positively related to successful programs are validated effectiveness, complexity, and direct impact on pupils. Problem-solving process characteristics positively related to successful programs are linking agent behavior as measured by the amount of time spent by the agent, amount of influence of the agent, and the agent's adoption of a facilitator or process role.

The specific innovation examined in this research is called developing mathematical processes, which emphasizes process and induction rather than computational skills. Although the principal is the primary determiner of school policy, there were at least three other variables that significantly affected continuation of this innovation: the actual and perceived fit of the innovation with the developmental and learning characteristics of the student, the students' test scores on standardized mathematics tests, and the difficulty students who transferred from other schools had with the program. The interaction  among these elements stands as a useful example of the importance of attending not only to the specific values of the variables over time but to the dynamics that produce those values. Thus, the findings suggest the use of long time-frames and attendance to multiple and reciprocal causes. (Author/JK)",

        "description":"Parental discipline appears to play a major role in the development of delinquent and aggressive behavior. The belt theory predicts that parents who have used corporal punishment are likely to produce children who exhibit delinquent behavior. A striking factor is that all delinquent youths see corporal punishment as necessary in child rearing and most are convinced that the beatings they received prevented them from committing homicide. The intensity level of violent parental discipline can be equated to the child's level of exhibited aggression. Thus, normal parents can expect to have aggressive children in proportion to the degree they discipline their children. The use of the belt appears to work because it produces enough fear to terminate temporarily the unwanted behavior.  However, as the fear dissipates, aggression remains. The two basic responses to the threat of pain are fight and flight: females tend to run away while males are more apt to commit aggressive crimes. Cross-cultural studies relating severe parenting to aggression support this theory. The roots of violence are in the home: we cannot work with an aggressive child without focusing on the family.

Coordination, while essential, is made difficult by the proliferation of agencies and bureaus concerned with basic skills and by the need for autonomy among educators. A review of pertinent literature indicates that other barriers to coordination include a lack of resources, motivation, and leadership. Strategies to reduce these barriers are negotiation between organizations to establish operating procedures and concentration of power in the hands of one organization's authorities. After careful planning, coordination should be introduced cautiously in increments. In a complex collaborative  effort, a matrix management or network communication structure may be more appropriate than the traditional pyramid. In the final analysis, coordination may not be an effective strategy in all circumstances and should not occur where it is infeasible or undesirable. (WD)",

The ethnographic method is revealed to provide insights into the underlying relationships of surface events when a subject's presentation of self ceases to become a performance, when someone breaks a norm and others react, or when a portion of the observed structure changes or malfunctions. In the progress of the study, the researchers discovered new dimensions being added to the principal's role as a result of unionization and  community group pressure. In addition, the researchers found that the implementation of legislation concerning desegregation and handicapped children, the institution of a mastery learning-based curriculum, and the centralization of school administration have significantly altered the principal's role and behavior. Plans for further research include an analysis of principals' views of their new roles and the skills and increased paperwork required of them. (WD)",

The various categories of information are summarized and outlines of several alternatives for implementation in district planning are suggested. (Author)",

        "description":"The broad question addressed is whether the Upper Midwest needs a new regional educational laboratory and, if so, why and where and for whom? Conclusions were reached after a sampling of deans of education, chief state school officers, classroom teachers, National Institute of Education staff members, local superintendents, and other knowledgeable persons was interviewed. The author concludes that the region is not really ripe for a full-scale laboratory. He further recommends that, rather than conduct a round of hearings on the need for a laboratory, it would be more constructive to assemble representative chief education officers, deans and presidents of universities, and teacher organization leaders to discuss the options with them. Such a group could elect to form a planning  council or a regional council with an explicit problem-solving agenda for a period of 18 months and a very limited staff and budget. If there were to be a laboratory for the region, it could evolve out of such a council and would have a very explicit sense of mission and a precedent for participatory decision-making.

This report was directed to be a description of current laboratories' operations. As a result, it focuses on structural, organizational features on the assumption that lessons could be learned from current organizations that would aid in the planning for new ones. It devotes some space to a discussion of McREL, a new decentralized laboratory. The paper also examines the laboratories' relationships with other organizations. The report concludes that there is a range of research and development functions to be  fulfilled; that there currently exist several different kinds of organizations, including regional educational laboratories, whose activities are geared to fulfilling these functions; and that there is no single, best way to think about structuring educational laboratories.

Using teachers as informants, a social age and social quotient was obtained for all children from the Vineland Social Maturity Scale. A teacher estimation of each child's social maturity was also obtained. Each child was administered 23 communication tasks which were essentially nonverbal and involved three skill domains: percept production, or the  ability to produce a visual percept for another person, i.e., showing; percept deprivation, or the ability to remove a visual percept from another person, i.e., hiding; and percept diagnosis, or the ability to determine what another person was attending to visually. Findings indicated that young retarded children are aware of other people's acts and abilities.

A final section offers a recapitulation of findings particularly as they relate to broader considerations of the needs and problems of young mildly retarded adults and to improvement of training and habilitation services for this population. Cited among findings are that approximately half of the Ss living at home indicated dissatisfaction with their present living arrangements and nearly all said that they wanted  to be on their own; that the unemployment rate for the Ss' parents was about double of that for the general population; that a problem cited by respondents as relating to employment was transportation, and the ability and independence in getting around; and that data supported the appropriateness of the FCI format and content for administration to mildly retarded populations. Appendixes include instructions for administration of the Forced Choice Self Description Inventory, guidelines and a sample copy of the general information questionnaire used for the fourth interview of the community adjustment followup sample of former special education students, a multiple criteria rating scale of community adjustment, a table of occupational levels assigned to reported employments, and copies of  generalization keys for male and female versions of the FCI.

Basic considerations of a multidisciplinary team in determining the appropriate placement for the handicapped students are listed (including the nature and degree of the handicapping condition and availability of adaptive materials). To make placement decisions, educators need information related to student needs and information related to placement options. An outline describes student and placement option information for curriculum, related services, learning style, social/psychological characteristics, and physical characteristics. Steps in the implementation of the placement decision model are  charted, and special considerations in LRE decision making are reviewed. Appended are a decision summary checklist, a placement option worksheet, and LRE placement examples (which include an individualized education program--IEP, and IEP summary of student needs, placement option descriptions, decision model applications, decision summary checklist, and placement option worksheet for the selected placement).

Research is reviewed on injuries related to public playground equipment, the equipment/user interface, and accommodation of equipment for all children. Noted among findings are that 72% of all reported injuries were associated with falls, that the ability of children to use playground equipment safely depends on their capacity to make accurate perceptual discriminations, and that handicapped children select play activities similar to those of nonhandicapped children when provided accessible and safe play equipment. Causal factors for injury and potential remedial strategies are listed for climbing apparatus, slides, and swings. It is concluded that  many accidents can be prevented by safety standards governing mechanical hazards, and through design criteria, modification of user behavior, and adaptations for appropriate sensorimotor, perceptual motor, psychomotor, and cognitive abilities.

First, two different strands of literature are surveyed: (1) the material on labor earnings determination viewed through capital, discrimination, and supply and demand type models; and (2) the works on what can be called the economics of language. An earnings equation is then put forth that includes, as an explanatory variable, language and its role as an ethnic attribute and a form of human capital. The sample used in the statistical data is then described, and a correlation of relevant economic factors is made to the income differences between English-speaking and French-speaking groups in Quebec. A statistical analysis is then detailed  concerning the labor earnings of Quebec males as they relate to their education, language, and job experience. Further, attempts are made to estimate the contributions of ethnicity to differences in earnings between Anglophones and Francophones. This contribution is then compared to that found in other labor markets where ethnicity was shown to be a relevant factor. (Author/PJM)",

The data were transcriptions of spontaneous conversation between the researcher and each child. The analysis was of: (1) the order of acquisition of Spanish verb forms, and (2) the influence on the acquisition of the child's repetitions of verbs spoken previously in conversation by the adult. Errors in the children's verb systems were similar. For all, the form used in more inappropriate contexts was the third person singular. It seems that this is the basic form. Two  assumptions were made about the nature of repetitions: (1) the child determines what s/he will repeat; and (2) the adult's model is not appropriate or inappropriate by itself; rather its appropriateness depends on the subject the child uses in his/her subsequent utterance, which is determined by the child. The same questions will be addressed in a subsequent study in Puerto Rico. (AMH)",

Additional costs were defined as those which would not have been incurred had the second language program not been in existence. Three types of additional costs were identified: instructional, ancillary, and developmental. Costs were analyzed according to the following dimensions: second language (French, Ukrainian, German), program type (extended, bilingual, immersion), program stage (development, implementation, maintenance), instructional level (elementary, junior high, senior high), school size (small, medium, large) and school setting (urban, rural). Information was collected by means of a  questionnaire and interviews with school board officials. Data were compiled and analyzed according to the dimensions detailed above. Although questionnaires were mailed to the 23 school jurisdictions offering second language instruction in Alberta, the findings are based on the detailed analysis of five boards which were selected as providing a good cross section of all study dimensions. The study revealed considerable diversity among programs both within and among boards with respect to staffing patterns (pupil-teacher ratio), ancillary services provided, and developmental effort expended. The findings raised a number of issues meriting further investigation. (Author/PJM)",

Primary responses (those given most frequently) were divided into three categories: (1) those which matched the French responses; (2) those which matched but appeared to be translations of English responses; and  (3) totally un-French responses, made up largely of clang-associates, into which the majority of learners' responses fell. Secondary and tertiary responses were also made up largely of clang associates. Two possible attitudes toward these results can be taken: either the discrepancies reflect serious inadequacies in the learners' grasp of French, or the discrepancies are not important, and will diminish as experience with the language increases. More information about language instruction is needed to determine which attitude is correct. (PJM)",

Traditionally, much of the social interaction of the classroom has been \"whole group,\" with the teacher as the focus of the lesson or activity. However, many classrooms have recently been restructured so as to provide individualized instruction to the students for at least part of the day. Deviation from whole group structure places  new communicative demands on both teacher and students. A study was done to determine how effective teachers structure their actions and their responses to children's actions in these situations. Results indicate that teachers develop norms for making communicative responses to children's initiatives and that they apply these norms with some degree of consistency across participation structures.

The following results were reported: (1) when verbal ability is controlled, students who study foreign language for longer periods of time will do better on various SAT sub-tests and on the SAT-Verbal as a whole than students who have studied less foreign language; (2) having studied two foreign languages has no significant effect on SAT scores or on scores on the Test of Academic Progress (TAP); (3) language studied has no differential effect on SAT or TAP scores; and (4) there is some evidence that higher grades in foreign language study will  increase the effect of this study on SAT scores (particularly the reading and vocabulary sub-scores). In conclusion, it appears that the effect of foreign language study makes itself felt more in the area of vocabulary development than it does in that of English structure use. (JB)",

The original text on the steps taken by the college to remain viable during the difficult circumstances of the seventies is supplemented by an epilogue in which the results of the Aquinas College reassessment of its mission, role, and scope and subsequent initiatives are discussed. The college initially focused on its heritage, continuing strengths, and aspirations and later sought to achieve its aspirations in view of conditions prevailing in the external environment. It is concluded that the self-study resulted in new ideas for institutional development, and the overall process became a vehicle for implementation of a number of programs and  development of an accreditation report. Every faculty member was assigned to one of five study groups, and each group had three student members. Study-group members visited other campuses and took part in campus-wide retreats to compare recommendations. It is claimed that the institution's new continuing education mission was implemented with a minimal amount of disruption because of effective internal communications. (SW)",

Evaluation is seen as a form of accountability. Reasons why better, more formal evaluation of statewide boards will be important to a wide range of constituencies--such as trends toward performance budgeting--are examined, and various complexities of the evaluation process are addressed. The major relevant evaluation efforts undertaken recently are summarized, including the University of Missouri Task Force on State Level Coordination and Governance in Higher Education, two Alabama evaluations, evaluations by the Academy for Educational Development of consolidated governing boards of Mississippi, West Virginia, and Florida;  and legislative performance evaluations in Connecticut and South Carolina. Evaluation criteria used by South Carolina's Legislative Audit Council to evaluate the Commission on Higher Education, critical reactions to the criteria from selected respondents around the country, and modifications based on the reactions are examined.

        "description":"Differences in academic career participation by men and women and their marital and child bearing rates are assessed along with current research findings on dual-career faculty couples. Case study research on 10 dual-career couples is reviewed, with emphasis on familial relationships resulting from commitment to two careers. Observations regarding dual career couples within the academic setting, and characteristics of both institutions and faculty couples that influence the integration of career and family, are reported. The argument is made that modification of institutional structures to accommodate dual career couples is beneficial to both sides. The case study research suggests that there seems to be little change in the pattern of how household tasks are distributed;  overall, dual career families appear to spend less time on housework tasks, children take more responsibility, and husbands contribute slightly more. Sociological research indicates that women continue to spend more time on household tasks than do men and seem to be the major &quot;psychic parent.&quot; Research has also suggested that women in dual-career marriages cut off leisure and recreational activities. Perspectives on successful dual-career marriages and the future of these arrangements are considered. (SW)",

The following areas are covered: admissions, part-time study, financial aid, support systems, career planning, and improving the employment prospects of women with graduate degrees. Among the admission barriers are little effort to recruit women candidates, requiring courses as prerequisites that have only been offered in the last few years, placing limits on the age of credits accepted, changing graduation requirements, requiring  letters of recommendation, the current grade inflation trend, and attitudes of interviewers. Other barriers are that most financial aid is directed to full-time students, and these students face difficulties because of residency requirements (number of courses taken), class scheduling, and lack of access to school services. Once the re-entry student has gained admission, there is a need for encouragement throughout graduate study and an appropriate entry-level position upon graduation.

It is  concluded that through careful coordination among support service offices, dissemination of information, and periodic self-evaluation, an institution can provide more accessible support services to all students and be responsive to the special needs of the growing re-entry population. A selected list of resources is included, along with a field evaluation questionnaire for the draft of this paper. (SW)",

        "description":"As part of a larger study, data concerning enrollment trends in Indiana high schools, colleges, and universities are examined, and the Indiana college attendance rate and scores on the College Board Scholastic Aptitude Test are compared with those of other midwestern states and with national averages. Additionally, the levels of education attained by Indiana adults are compared with those of other states' and with national averages. Population trends of the state and nation are compared, and Indiana's population is projected up to the year 2000. Information was obtained from public, private, and proprietary institutions authorized to offer degree/credit programs. Information was obtained on enrollees (beginners) as follows: (1) those who graduated from Indiana high schools in  December 1978 or by June of 1979; (2) those who graduated from Indiana high schools in any year previous to 1978-79; and (3) those who came from any source other than Indiana high schools (e.g., out-of-state or foreign students). A summary of the findings, and statistical data, charts, and graphs are included. Among the findings were that 83 percent of new enrollees came from Indiana and that the on-going college attendance rate in 1979-80 for Indiana's high school class of 1978-79 was 45.9 percent. (SW)",

The curriculum is designed to prepare individuals for the construction industry. Sixty-three employees of Colorado AGC member firms completed the survey instrument. Based on the findings, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) respondents found it difficult to look beyond their own particular job responsibilities in evaluating the importance of elements of the curricular guide; (2) respondents attached a higher level of importance to elements that were related to their academic background; (3) the length of construction experience does not appear to  have a significant influence on perceptions of element importance; (4) the response to work experience as an alternate source of instruction for construction-oriented elements indicates that classroom instruction for these elements has only partially been accepted by industry personnel; and (5) while eight elements were found to be substantially less important than all other elements, the original construction education guidelines are essentially as valid now as when they were developed. The findings are illustrated by statistical tables, and procedures used to select the study population, develop the questionnaire, and analyze the results are described.

Course-taking behavior was defined as the average credit hour load of a student as distributed across the program course offerings of the institutions. The basic study question was to determine what influences, if any, student characteristics have on course selection patterns. The influence of the following student characteristics were assessed: sex, minority group status, full-time versus part-time student status, and level of the student. Additionally, the school and department in which the student was enrolled were considered. University of  Pittsburgh undergraduate professional school students were studied: 4,413 in the fall term and 4,374 in the winter term. Among the findings were the following: of the six schools, only that of social work and health-related professions did not identify sex or race as influences on course-taking behavior; all schools showed that a difference existed between part-time and full-time students relative to the courses selected; and course-taking behavior (course election patterns) was differentiated among levels of undergraduates. A methodology for analyzing course-taking behavior, which includes use of multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant analysis, is considered. (SW)",

The study objective was to learn if HEGIS is a necessary and useful data base for determining the condition of higher education and developing policy. The quality of the HEGIS data perceived in terms of accuracy, timeliness, and characteristics of computer tapes and related documentation was determined, as was the need for universe data and annual surveys. Two literature reviews, more than 70 interviews of users and contributers to HEGIS, and surveys of two different populations of users were undertaken. Findings include the following: (1) HEGIS data have provided a foundation for the majority of reports and books that have affected public policy on  higher education; (2) enrollment and financial data are used much more extensively than other survey data for analyzing the condition of higher education, policy analysis, and for making decisions at state and local levels; (3) accuracy has improved; (4) timeliness of data is seen as a major problem; (5) the uses of HEGIS data have increased significantly in recent years; (6) HEGIS data have not been used as extensively as they might in reporting on the condition of women and minorities in higher education; and (7) more data are wanted on student characteristics and financial aid.

It was found that women's studies programs have been involved in faculty development. In addition to formal faculty development activities, these programs have organized workshops and conferences on a variety of topics, developed innovative instructional techniques, produced instructional aids to provide a women's perspective in the curricula, engaged in a variety of research activities, organized consortia among colleges, and evolved new  patterns of faculty governance. It is recommended that research be conducted on the involvement of women's studies programs in faculty development activities.

Tenure decisions typically reflect evaluations of performance and judgments about potential. Minimum eligibility requirements commonly used and typical reasons for revoking an individual's tenure status are outlined. As defined by the American Association of University Professors, tenure is designed to promote academic freedom and economic security for the faculty. Benefits that tenure may bring to the institution as a whole are noted--including creating an environment conducive to faculty undertaking long-term or higher-risk projects. Six criticisms of tenure are considered as well, such as its being a one-sided contract and a restraint on institutional flexibility.  Prerequisites to establishing tenure policy, the board's role, and guidelines for a board review of individual tenure decisions are discussed. Alternatives to tenure (e.g., a tenure quota or an extended probationary period) and information about contract systems are presented along with questions that are useful to trustees in discussing tenure issues.

The study was based on a stratified sample of 135 institutions of which 95 participated. The sample represented all parts of the public sector except autonomous professional schools. Primary sources of information were the enrollment, salaries, and finance sections of the Higher Education General Information Survey; other salary information; and an audited financial statement, a voluntary support survey, and a questionnaire filled out by college officials and faculty and student representatives. In an analysis of the condition of the public sector, attention is directed to consolidated trends for all  institutions, comparative trends for different types of institutions, and estimates of the overall condition of each participating institution. Broad areas of analysis are as follows: enrollment and admissions, faculty and other staff, content and quality of educational program, operating revenues and expenditures, undergraduate student financial aid, and liabilities and net revenues. It is concluded that although times are difficult, public institutions have been able to operate so that educational programs have not been harmed seriously and retrenchment has not been severe. It is suggested that this basic stability has been achieved at the expense of physical, financial, and human capital and through changes in budgetry priorities, and that if trends of the last decade continue  indefinitely, a time will come when educational performance will deteriorate.

        "description":"Policies on U.S. citizens studying medicine abroad are reviewed, based on visits to six foreign medical schools in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Europe, which have about 5,400 U.S. citizens studying medicine, or about half of the total estimated number. The following areas are considered: education and training provided, clinical training in U.S. hospitals provided by U.S. citizens studying in foreign medical schools, avenues available for entering the American medical system, and federal financial assistance in the form of guaranteed student loans and educational benefits provided to these students. It is found that many U.S. citizens attend foreign medical schools with the goal of returning to practice in this country; however, the education and training provided by some of these  schools vary greatly and may not be comparable to that offered in U.S. schools. It is recommended that more appropriate mechanisms be developed to ensure that all students who attend foreign medical schools demonstrate that their medical knowledge and skills are comparable to those of their U.S.-trained counterparts before they are allowed to enter the mainstream of American medicine. Alternatives to be considered in accomplishing this objective are suggested, including admission with advanced standing. Recommendations concerning guaranteed student loans and educational benefits, and U.S. hospital clinical training of foreign medical school students are also offered. Appendices include information on qualifying examinations, foreign medical schools, accrediting organizations in the United  States, and communications among agencies. (SW)",

        "description":"Current financial assistance files at three public colleges/universities were examined to determine whether there is discrimination of women in the award of financial aid. Attention was directed to several specific assistance programs: Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Awards, National Direct Student loans, Guaranteed Student Loans, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant awards, work-study loans, and state aid awards. The three institutions differed in several respects: one was a major graduate and research institution in the West with a diverse student body, one was a large community college system in the East with a large ethnic minority population, and the other was a smaller commuter campus. Study variables included sex, marital status, age, dependent/independent  status, ethnic status, number of dependents, income, and parental financial contribution. Findings indicate that there is a fairly equal distribution of aid by type and amount between males and females. It is suggested that a slight favoring of females in average awards may be due to their being the majority of single heads of households and are therefore more needy. A brief literature review, references, and small-print statistical tables of the findings are included. (SW)",

It is suggested that institutes and centers enable higher education institutions to accept new responsibilities and pursue them in new ways. A combination of societal, professional, and institutional forces contributed to the rapid growth of institutes and centers, including the growing dependence of society on scientific and technological innovation and the related availability of funding for research and development. The functions carried out by institutes are usually more restricted than those of departments and usually are confined to one or two combinations, such as the performance of research, the administration  of public service, or the facilitation of instruction and research. Three general types of institutes are identified: standard institutes, which resemble the typical bureaucratic organization; adaptive institutes which are more likely to use part-time and temporary personnel and to shift programs to meet changing resources and needs; and &quot;shadow institutes,&quot; which are sometimes dormant but represent a capacity for meeting needs when they arise. Among the contributions of institutes are that they allow the institution to emphasize problem-oriented research or public service and that they are effective for interdisciplinary efforts. Recommendations to strengthen the role of institutes and centers within the university are offered. (SW)",

Subjects were enrolled in the winter 1979 semester of a basic media course at the University of Missouri, Columbia. The experiment was conducted over an 8-week period and involved only production skills. In testing the first null hypothesis, eight tasks were designed to develop production skills in picture mounting, lettering, illustration, and design. In testing the  second null hypothesis, the composite scores from the Media Production Skill Scale (MPSS) and the averages from the Media Utilization scale were correlated using the Spearman rank coefficient. The first null hypothesis was rejected in three of the eight competencies: squared reduction, projected enlargement, and hand lettering. The second null hypothesis was accepted. (MER)",

After scrutinizing all available published and unpublished reports of research in this series for appropriate data, 23 sets of complete data were found to be available. Those studies which contained data sufficient for the application of meta-analysis techniques developed by Glass (1977) comprise the sample for this investigation. Effect size measures were computed, and regression analysis was performed to examine the relationships of effect size with presentation pace, grade level, type of learning, and type of illustration. Results  of the analysis are reported, and it is concluded that, although it is likely that more thorough aggregation will modify these findings, the data do provide indications of possible trends which may ultimately be sustained by more complete analyses, and which may help to generate experimental investigation in the interim.

Third and sixth grade students were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: groups one and two viewed two 7-frame stories accompanied by oral narration; groups three and four viewed the same stories without narration. Groups one and three differed from two and four in that the first story was low detail and the second was high detail, while groups two and four viewed the same stories in reversed detail level. The criterion tests consisted of 14 recall questions per story, seven about events relevant to the story, and seven about events irrelevant to the story. The tests were given immediately following the second story and again one  week later. The results indicated that narrated stories facilitated recall significantly better than non-narrated stories; although low detail line drawings were remembered better than high detail pictures on the immediate test, the effect was not present on the delayed test; relevant events were recalled better than irrelevant events; and narration improved recall of irrelevant events more than of relevant events.

Each profile includes a statement of how the child is perceived as a student in the regular academic areas of the school, a description of what the child learned in the LOGO classes, an analysis of each child's particular strengths and problems, and the  particular teaching strategies that were considered appropriate for each child. Most of the students' work related to computer graphics, but a few also undertook non-graphics projects. The 16 students spanned a wide range of interests, abilities, and cognitive styles.

ASIMS comprised a NOVA 1200 minicomputer with support peripherals, a Computer Integrated Instruction (CII) system in General Damage Control (GDC), and a Shipboard Training Administration System (STAS). CII GDC provided offline instruction integrated with online computer testing, diagnostics, and prescriptives. STAS provided a generalized File Management and Information Retrieval System (FMS) that facilitated control of shipboard files, records, and reports. Posttest scores indicated that graduates of the CMI course significantly outperformed  groups trained under conventional shipboard methods. Results also showed that CMI is technically and operationally feasible aboard ship, and commercial, off-the-shelf minicomputer systems can support both a CMI capability and limited nontactical ADP functions. A cost-effectiveness study was beyond the scope of the project. Project and technical supports are listed, as are references. (Author/LLS)",

The program begins by selecting a melody from the database and displaying the clef, key signature, time signature, and first note. The short four voice cadence which follows can be repeated as often as necessary until the student is ready to hear the entire melody. After each of the first two playings of entire melody, the student has 30 seconds to notate the melody on paper. After the third repetition, the student uses an interactive music editing system to  enter his version of the melody. Two indexes are available for the student, one for editorial assistance and the other to help him determine which activity to go to next. The music data are formatted in a table of 48 60-bit words of computer memory. The format is described in detail in the appendices as are the two audio routines used. (BK)",

Several traditional and modern models of professionalism are discussed and applied to librarianship. Shortcomings of the profession, e.g., its scholarship and the non-prescriptive nature of its client-patron relations, are discussed in the light of these models. Also discussed is the ideologically based criticism of professionalism that emerged in the 1960s which suggested that hegemony over certain critical areas of knowledge, rather than placing professionals in a position to serve society better, might be used as a basis for social inequality. The summary discusses contemporary librarianship as it related to the traditional  models, the validity of those models for today's world, and the options and prospects for librarianship in the 1980s.

Part I first presents the relevant sections of the Bill, which mandate that college students' computation and communication skills be tested at entry; that colleges provide remediation and counseling appropriate to students' scores; and that an upper-level test be developed to assess students' ability to succeed in upper-division course work. After outlining the purview of the Articulation Coordinating Committee, the report discusses the need for empirical data demonstrating the relationship between achievement test scores and academic success. The next section draws from several sources to estimate that testing will reveal that 25% to 75% of the community  college freshmen will need remediation, while the following section considers the impact of older, reentry students on this estimate. The next two sections identify general responses a college can make and outline three specific alternatives: (1) provide referral for underprepared students; (2) provide one remedial course each in communication and computation; or (3) implement a developmental studies program. Finally, the possible effects of the upper-division exam on enrollments and public relations are enumerated. Part II of the report summarizes 13 findings of site visits and a survey of faculty attitudes toward college-level remediation. (AYC)",

        "description":"After discussing current community college financial problems, this paper examines the acquisition of alternative funding through the application of marketing strategies and strategic planning. The paper first differentiates marketing from sales or promotion and then describes the ability of a marketing program to attract new consumers and to provide early identification of potential threats to the college, such as community apathy, reduction in state funding, or competition from other institutions. The role of long-range strategic planning in the marketing process is then explained as a way in which colleges in search of alternative funding sources attune their planning efforts to institutional survival in the realization that continued existence cannot be taken for granted. A  discussion follows of the ways in which the college bookstore and other college operations that are tied to the college's mission may legitimately serve as profit-making enterprises and thus reduce dependence upon legislative funding. Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of a college marketing program and suggests the creation of a quality control department to monitor its progress. Included in the appendix are a marketing audit instrument which was specifically designed for community colleges and a form for use in identifying and evaluating marketing issues.

To help students locate and secure internship positions, Part I provides: (1) an interpretation of the Strong Campbell Interest Inventory; (2) an exercise requiring students to delineate the duties, responsibilities, and job conditions that apply to their vocational areas of interest; (3) an introduction to resume preparation and contents, (4) samples of effective and ineffective resumes and cover letters; (5) a discussion of interview behavior; and (6) samples of employer information and pre-interview forms. Part II outlines the requirements for internship eligibility and presents exercises designed to help the student identify opportunities for  personal and career development on the job. Special emphasis is placed on the cultivation of perceptual growth, that is, the ability to perceive the interactions of all positions in the work environment and thereby become a more knowledgeable employee. Part III presents materials needed to document on-the-job learning and to apply it toward college credit. These materials include instructions for writing learning contracts, compiling end-of-term reports, and preparing interim reports describing learning experiences as they are encountered. Sample reports are provided, as are the forms used in internship evaluations. (JP)",

The total number of transfer students to the CSU system was 1,343, a figure which had remained constant over the previous five years. Similar consistency was seen in the students' grade point averages (GPA's); on an average their GPA at the state universities was 2.72, representing a 0.13% decrease from their SAC average of 2.85. Of the CSU transfer students, 67% attended one school, CSU Fullerton, where most majored in Business Administration and related fields, such as Accounting, Finance, Management, and Marketing. In Fall 1978, the last year for  which UC transfer data were available, 52 former SAC students transferred to the system. The average entering GPA's and university GPA's of the SAC transfer students were higher than those of other community college transfer students, and the university GPA's of those transfers who were eligible to enter the UC system upon high school graduation were comparable to those of UC native students.

        "description":"Community college students are dropping courses at increasing rates at substantial costs to their institutions and themselves. Subsequently, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate this trend, the factors that influence it, and ways of reversing it. A recent study revealed that the most frequently cited reason for course withdrawal was job conflict--a factor over which the college has little control. Other reasons, however, were related to instruction, such as fear of not receiving a passing grade, inadequate prerequisite instruction, and dissatisfaction with course content and/or format. Attrition studies have also sought to discern patterns in the term in which students most frequently drop courses, faculty members' perceptions of the causes of attrition, the use of  student support services prior to withdrawal, and course reenrollment. College withdrawal has also been the subject of several studies, which have shown that most of the reasons students give for dropping out of a college are not related to instruction, with major influences being job conflict and financial problems. Several ways of reducing attrition are recommended in the literature, including: (1) establish a testing program for guidance and placement; (2) promote student use of support services; (3) improve instruction; and (4) suggest staff consultations prior to course withdrawal. A bibliography is included. (AYC)",

Additional purposes were to (1) determine the extent to which socioeconomic factors and maternal characteristics were associated with HOME scores, and (2) determine how well the HOME would predict child test performance if the influence of economic resources or maternal ability level were partialed out of the correlations. The study was based upon a socioeconomically heterogeneous sample of 41 mother-child dyads. The HOME and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development were administered when the children were 6- and 18- months-old.  Thirty-six of the 41 children participated in follow-up testing with the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale at 48 months of age. Results suggest that in a socioeconomically heterogeneous sample, knowledge of the family's earned income at the time of the child's birth predicted children's intellectual status at age of 4 as well as did HOME scores gathered in the first or second year of life. Mothers' IQ predicted child IQ best of all. After the effect of maternal intellectual differences upon child intellectual outcomes was partialed out, a measure of early environmental quality showed no relationship to child outcomes.

Additionally, background information on each  subject and a self-rating given by each subject were obtained. Among the results it was found that (1) there was a significant relationship between facial appearance and assessments of functional capability given by all pre-service child care workers; (2) children with unattractive facial appearances were consistently given lower ratings than children with attractive facial appearances; (3) there was no evidence that the effects of professional preparation made any meaningful contribution to the judgment of capability of attractive and unattractive children; and (4) the relationships between self-characteristics, preparation, and experience and the extent of influence that appearance has on ratings of intelligence were found to be vague and non-significant.

        "description":"This paper discusses factors that affect parent-child relationships when children become adolescents. Several factors are seen to be related to the development of reciprocity in parenting behaviors between adolescents and their parents. Factors related to the development of reciprocity are (1) teenagers' physical and intellectual development and their capacity for prosocial behavior; (2) the overlap of child and adult roles expected of teenagers; (3) the adolescent identity crisis; and (4) parents' needs. Examples are given to illustrate the operation of these factors in practical situations. Also discussed are situations which create conflict and stress for parents and teenagers; the teenagers' desire for independence and the parents' reaction to this desire; and changes in the  life styles of parents. In conclusion, an argument is made that adolescents have an inalienable right to be involved in deciding how they are to be reared. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"In order to explore relationships among social cognitive ability, peer status and interpersonal behavior, the frequency of 11 different social actions was recorded with the target child being the agent of the recipient of the behavior. Twenty-three children from 3 to 8 years of age enrolled in an 8-week university summer school program were observed for ten 5-minute periods during indoor free play. Each child was administered a test for referential communication ability and a test for solving interpersonal problems. In addition, peer status was evaluated using picture sociometric methods obtaining both peer nominations as well as peer rating scores. A positive and significant correlation indicated that children who suggested nonforceful strategies for solving interpersonal  conflicts were most likely to be nominated as liked peers. A number of friends score based on the peer ratings correlated positively and significantly with referential communication ability. Referential communication skill correlated positively with refusing, while interpersonal problem solving ability correlated positively with asking, being asked, and helping, and correlated negatively with imitating, receiving, and receiving disapprovals from peers. Popular children tended to boss, teach and help, while being nominated as a disliked peer was inversely related with refusing behavior; peer ratings were positively and significantly correlated with being imitated. These findings provide some evidence in support of the concurrent validity of the social cognitive test and the peer status  sociometric measures. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Nutritional deficiencies and imbalances can influence learning directly or indirectly. Fatigue, boredom and low motivation may be the result of poor nutrition. Some vision problems, it is known, are related to deficiencies in vitamin A. A number of studies indicate that protein-caloric malnutrition affects intellectual and psychomotor development. Few educators may realize, though, that thiamine deficiency may decrease abilities involved in learning to read and write. The effects of some nutrient deficiencies, such as thiamine, iron, and minor vitamin A deficiencies, can be easily, rapidly and completely reversed. Unhappily, the effects of protein-caloric malnutrition and major vitamin A deficiencies are not as easily changed. To some extent, however, they too can be reversed. A  few studies suggest that improved environments, especially at the preschool level, can ameliorate severe effects of early malnutrition. Additional nutritional problems are associated with allergies, alcohol use, phenylketonuria (PKU), lactose intolerance, and minerals such as lead. The remarks above highlight only a few nutrition issues. Because malnutrition is possible in affluent, developed countries, educators need to develop school-wide policy and practices that extend beyond school lunch, breakfast and nutrition education programs. The effects of soft drink and candy vending machines as well as fund-raising candy sales should also be considered. (Author/RH)",

Information for the study was obtained from samples of public school children and their parents. The samples were drawn from the communities of Oakland and Hayward, California, and included 70 boys and 69 girls and their parents. Data were assembled through interviews and evaluations. Findings indicate that 37 children had played with fire and had burnt different items. Half of the burning behavior was done intentionally. About half of the children had been involved in play with matches, and several more reported playing with lighters or firecrackers. In order to analyze fire-play in detail, five categories of reported involvement in fire-play  episodes were formed. Categories ranged in frequency of involvement from no episodes to many episodes. The five groups were then compared in terms of family background, child characteristics and child preference (for example their attraction to fire variables). Children who most frequently played with fire were rated higher in 20 mischievous behaviors than children less frequently involved in fire-play. Play with matches was found to be related to problem areas in children's lives. Findings further indicate that fire-playing, fire-setting, accident-prone, hyperactive and delinquent children show very similar behavioral and personality patterns to each other as well as similar family conditions.

        "description":"Mothers' ability to decode the emotional expressions of their male and female children was compared to the decoding ability of non-mothers. Happiness, sadness, fear and anger were induced in children in situations that varied in terms of spontaneous and role-played encoding modes. It was hypothesized that mothers would be more accurate decoders of their children than the non-mothers. It was also expected that emotional expressions of female children would be decoded more easily than those of male children, and that positive affect would be more easily decoded than negative affect. Twenty-four children (12 male and 12 female), their mothers, and 24 matched non-mothers were recruited for the study. Children viewed slides and listened to corresponding narratives depicting scenarios  such as a birthday party, a lost dog, and a false accusation. Spontaneous and role-playing behaviors were then observed by the mothers and non-mothers. It was found that the pattern of decoding accuracy differed for mothers and non-mothers. Mothers were able to accurately decode expressions of happiness, but had relative difficulty in decoding expressions of sadness, fear and anger. The pattern of decoding accuracy for non-mothers was such that no affect was decoded at greater than chance levels. Decoding accuracy also differed according to the sex of the encoding child.

        "description":"A brief summary of research findings which support the hypothesis of scriptal knowledge structures in children and which indicates that children use such structures in ways very similar to those of adults is provided in this paper. Research reveals that when children as young as three are asked to tell what they know about events, they tend to give highly generalized accounts for both familiar and relatively novel events. It is suggested on the basis of such findings that young children's knowledge of event structures is generalized from the outset, rather than being abstracted from the accumulation of specific episodes. Research seems to indicate that although scripts are used more flexibly with age, basic script structure, level of generality and content seem relatively  invariant from ages 3 to 8. It is speculated that a major developmental change may be the ability to differentiate between and separately store specific episodes as well as generalized scripts. In general, the evidence suggests that scripts function as a form of cognitive organizer, basic to the formation of more complex schemas and categories. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between high risk infants' sensorimotor development and their use of intentional communications. Twenty-six 20-month-old infants, selected at birth by use of High Risk Index, were studied. At 15 months of age each infant was administered five scales from the Uzgiris-Hunt Ordinal Scales of Psychological Development. Each infant was then observed at 20 months of age with his/her mother in two standardized settings. In the first setting, which consisted of a play interaction situation between the infant and his/her mother, information was obtained on how the infant communicates intentionally to his/her mother using the &quot;showing&quot; function of communication. The &quot;showing&quot; function of communication was measured by the infant's  use of nonverbal behavior (pointing, showing off), vocalization and actual words to obtain the mother's attention. In the second setting which consisted of the administration of an experimental task to the infant, again with the mother present, information was obtained on how the infant communicates using the &quot;requesting&quot; function of communication. The &quot;requesting&quot; function of communication consisted of commands or requests by the infant to the mother or experimenter in order to attain an object or to require the mother or the experimenter to act in some way. Results indicated that measures of the &quot;showing&quot; function were significantly related to only one of the Uzgiris-Hunt Scales -- the object permanence scale. Measures of the &quot;requesting&quot; function were significantly related to two of  the Uzgiris-Hunt scales -- the vocal imitation scale and the object schemes scale. It is concluded that this study does not provide strong, consistent evidence to support the notion of a relationship between infants' cognition and language. (Author/MP)",

The 1978 handbook includes ideas and procedures for involving parents on getting acquainted sessions, field trips, classrooms and school policy advisory committees. In the 1980 handbook, the parent-child interaction program component emphasized activities for helping the child with language development as well as with other cognitive and affective abilities. The Workshop component was focused on the world of work, social, study and communication skills and general educational  development. Additional workshops discussed helping children develop a healthy sexuality, personal grooming, sewing and cooking. A major part of the handbook provides an account of what was done by Project Follow Through staff to involve and assist parents, their children and school personnel. The handbook also provides, in several appendices, summary reports on the parent-child interaction activities that were conducted, sample memos and bulletins, minutes of meetings, plans, questionnaires and workshop curricula.

Learning activities files for home and classroom use as well as several parent discussion guides were field tested in 44 sites located in 14 different states. The field tests focused on the usability, content, age-appropriateness and readability of the files and guides. In addition to the formative evaluation of the new materials, a process evaluation of the feasibility of preparing a weekly guide to accompany the television program, &quot;Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,&quot; was conducted. Field test data are discussed and  recommendations are advanced. Activites related to the publication of the Home Visitor Training Package are indicated. The evaluation forms used as well as inservice material designed to sensitize preschool teachers to dimensions of child development are appended. (Author/RH)",

Subjects were administered Damon's Positive- Justice Interview, and were presented helping and sharing tasks under five behavioral conditions corresponding to Damon's justice levels. Findings supported cognitive- developmental theory, demonstrating that different patterns of altruistic behavior emerge at different levels of social-cognitive maturity. In addition, it was demonstrated that certain types of moral reasoning are highly consistent with moral behavior. Moral reasoning within a practical altruistic context was more closely related to altruistic behavior than was moral reasoning within a hypothetical context. (Author/RH)",

Volume I, directed to school administrators and teachers, contains information for use in solving pedestrian safety problems that commonly occur at or near schools. Volume II, a parents' guide, is designed to increase parents' awareness of the need for pedestrian safety education and to provide them information about the related instruction being offered to their children at school. The volume is divided into 17 short lessons that cover instruction on topics such as using crosswalks in a safe manner; looking and  listening for approaching traffic before crossing streets, driveways, alleys, and the like; obeying traffic signs and signals; and walking safely along sidewalks and roadways. Volume III, teachers' and administrators' guide, includes outlines of 17 lessons that deal with those behaviors most commonly linked to pedestrian accidents involving young children. Each lesson focuses on one or more basic concepts or behaviors, beginning with the most basic and progressing to the most complex. For each lesson, the following information is provided in tabular form: lesson emphasis, time needed to conduct each lesson, materials and equipment, expected child outcomes and activities for teachers, parents, and children.

Meaningful parent involvement in such programs is said to have potential for increasing awareness of good nutrition, clarifying conflicting information, coordinating home and school nutrition teachings, and helping children make wise food choices. To help parents work effectively with school personnel, the guide provides a brief explanation of lines of school authority and the differing responsibilities of school personnel for food and nutrition programs. Also presented is a list of the major health and meal requirements under which school nutrition programs operate. A step-by-step action plan is outlined whereby a PTA nutrition committee can become  actively involved in school programs. A checklist for observing the school food system, an evaluation form for parent projects, brief articles on \"Health Foods vs. Healthy Foods\" and \"Breaking Communication Barriers,\" and a glossary are appended.

The rising divorce rate among Jews, tremendous changes in the structure and function of the American family, the isolation of the nuclear family in the suburbs, and, importantly, Jewish parents' need for guidance concerning Jewish child-rearing practices, all present problems that can be alleviated through Jewish day care programs. Jewish parents need information about parenting skills and child development as well as an introduction to Jewish living experiences that they can practice at home. Personal observations show that Jewish parents may have inappropriate expectations for their children's achievement and are frequently unable to provide on-going, rich, Jewish observances in the home. Staff at nursery  schools operated by the Board of Jewish Education have come to serve as surrogate family for enrolled children and their parents. By empathizing with parents, building parents' positive self image and confidence, and providing advice and a variety of Jewish participatory experiences, the center staff can provide young Jewish parents with guidance they have lost as traditional practices have become less prevalent. At nursery schools operated by the Board of Jewish Education, parents are involved at least 12 times each year in school activities related to family or parent-child events such as naming and birthday ceremonies. Additional ways to draw parents close to Jewish living need to be developed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"As part of an effort to identify states' roles and responsibilities in Indian education, major unresolved problems in Indian education were identified by survey and on-site visits in Alaska, Minnesota, Montana, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. Educators, government officials, parents, students, and tribal officials were surveyed regarding educational programs and practices, educational finance, legislative and policy issues, and interpersonal and interagency relationships. Most of the 149 respondents agreed that: 1) program evaluations and studies of achievement differences between Indian and non-Indian students are needed; 2) Indian education is not a major state priority; 3) federal, but not state, policies are often a barrier to meeting Indian educational needs; 4) social and  health problems affect Indian students' academic achievement; and 5) there is little interagency cooperation to address educational needs of Indian students. Although educators and government officials believed that schools met the needs of Indian children, that Indian-school relations were good, and that current funding mechanisms were adequate, parents and tribal officials disagreed. Among the most significant unresolved issues noted were: parental involvement with Indian education; basic skills for Indians; cross-cultural staff and teacher training; and the need for Indian teachers and school administrators. The results are reasonably applicable to other states. (SB)",

Many local and federally funded programs existed to provide Indian students with a bilingual/bicultural atmosphere and aid in the mastery of basic skills. Bilingual programs were particularly numerous, but basic skills programs were less so. Although Indian education curriculum development varied greatly from state to state and locality to locality, many school districts made concerted efforts to provide counseling, tutoring, and retention programs to help Indian students. Indians, however, felt that Indian-operated  programs and schools were more responsive than public schools to the needs of Indian children. Indians supported alternative programs (usually federally funded) such as alternative K-12 schools, experimental &quot;demonstration&quot; school models, BIA contract schools, and adult basic education programs. Indian preference for teacher hiring was rare in school districts with many Indian children and active recruitment was infrequent. Cross-cultural training was suggested for non-Indian teachers. Parental and community involvement in Indian education programs was emphasized by many school districts and states.

In response to a 1979 Presidential mandate to define and address the needs of rural America, the ED has identified basic problems of rural education that lend themselves to solution by the federal government: poor federal-school communication; ambiguous rural data; lack of rural resources and personnel; and government lack of appropriate strategies, formula, criteria, and procedures for rural education. In addition, for fiscal 1982, the ED has proposed a &quot;Rural Network,&quot; an information sharing, technical assistance method of addressing the special needs of rural and small schools. Proposed &quot;Network&quot; services include rural education  outreach, locally initiated rural education research, an updated rural data base, extension service models, identification of successful rural practices, and information dissemination. Other recent significant events indicating increased awareness of the importance of rural issues include the funding of a rural school Network by the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, the appointment of rural advocates within ED, an attempt to eliminate anti-rural bias in Office of Education regulations and criteria, and a National Institute of Education study advocating the acceptance of the reality of rural America.

        "description":"Using two panel studies which collectively covered the preadolescent-to-young adulthood period in the life cycle, the study focused on the issues of level of aspiration formation, stability, and race-sex subgroup invariance. The panel studies collected data from youths from (1) rural areas with towns of 2,500 or less and urban areas with cities of 40,000 or more characterized by school drop-out, unemployment, and poverty; and (2) counties with a more rural population, characterized by higher proportions of black residents and lower socioeconomic levels. The analysis utilized an unobserved construct approach via confirmatory factor analytic models. Findings indicated that socioeconomic background has a continuing, and at times increasing, influence on level of educational (LEA)  and occupational (LOA) aspirations. The increasing stability of both LEA and LOA (described through the process of &quot;crystallization&quot;) indicated that, while students from low grade school to early high school will change and thus be susceptible to attempts at raising career awareness through career education programs, a delay until the sophomore year or later might substantially lower such a program's chances of success. In terms of subgroup invariance, most of the structural departures from invariance examined were interpretable in light of other pertinent research reports. No strong evidence was found for differential race-sex subgroup reliability in &quot;idealistic&quot; and &quot;realistic&quot; indicators of the level of aspiration construct. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"Continuing the hearings begun April 14, 1980 on S. 2166, a bill to establish a National Institute of Native American Culture and Arts Development, testimony was heard from 19 witnesses representing the federal government and the administration, interest groups based in the Washington, D.C. area, and several Indian Tribes and Pueblos. Witnesses testifying in support of the bill's intent included representatives of Congress, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Nations Project, and the Ponca Tribe of Oklahoma. Those testifying against the bill included representatives of the Departments of Interior and Education; the National Congress of American Indians; the Santa Fe/Albuquerque Indian Schools; and the Zia, Isleta, Santo Domingo, Nambe, and Taos Pueblos. Opponents feared  that passage of the bill would result in an invasion of cultural privacy, loss of basic educational opportunity for Indian children in the Santa Fe area, possible infringement on religious freedom, and lack of Indian control of the facility. Other testimony concerned funding; the preservation of Indian culture, tradition, and belief; and the renovation of the Albuquerque Indian School campus. The committee reviewed the intent of S. 2166, the text of which is included in the record as is that of H.R. 6266, a companion measure. (SB)",

However, in all five Southwestern states the proportion of Chicano students to Anglo students decreases at every level, due mainly to the higher attrition and dropout rate for Chicanos than for Anglos. Two key resources are recommended to those interested in understanding the Chicano experience in schools. First is Thomas Carter's &quot;Mexican Americans in School: A History of Educational Neglect,&quot; and the second is a set of six reports published between 1970 and 1974 by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Four  other publications are briefly noted in this paper. Results of research in the literature are discussed in the areas of achievement, self concept, aspirations, and bilingual/bicultural education of Chicanos. The basic conclusion reached is that the literature available is minimal, inferior in quantity and quality, and falls far short of providing a basis for comprehensive assessment of the problems in Chicano education or a basis for formulation of policies to ameliorate these problems.

        "description":"The study documented the college and university hiring practices in California, Colorado, and Texas between 1970 and 1977 and documented the experiences of Chicano and Native American scientists with respect to employment. Data were gathered through mail surveys--31 (a 62% return rate) for the first part of the study and 82 (a 55% return rate) for the second part. The analyses were performed separately for Chicanos and Native Americans, although in many cases the findings were quite similar. The findings indicated that few Chicanos and Native Americans were hired between 1970 and 1977. Furthermore, it appeared that those individuals who were hired were not hired due to Affirmative Action. Thus, it was concluded that Affirmative Action plans at colleges and universities were not  working to provide equality of opportunity for the minorities and that the following would help to provide that equality: (1) stricter goals and time tables regarding Affirmative Action plans should be implemented; (2) the federal government should take a more active role in enforcing Affirmative Action at every level; (3) Affirmative Action officers at colleges and universities should be independent of the schools and should be more active; (4) openings should be advertised widely including through minority organizations and publications; and (5) serious consideration should be given to retention, promotion, and tenure.

        "description":"A general theoretical framework, group conflict analysis, can be applied to the study of cultural plurality in higher education. Basically, the conflict perspective views society as a conglomerate of interest groups competing for dominance in and of society. Once a group gains dominance it will monopolize resources in an attempt to maintain and perpetuate its ruling status. The institutions of society become part of the resources controlled by the dominant group. In modern corporate societies education is a major institution and resource for the ruling group. Higher education (particularly schools of education) is a key institution because it creates and perpetuates ideologies which govern the formal compulsory education of all individuals. Institutions of higher education mirror  the stratified ordering of the larger society. Culturally pluralistic programs in higher education are subject to the same second-class (or lower-status) citizenship as their respective ethnic groups in the larger society. Higher education tends to follow a unicultural monolingual ideology which favors one group over all others. A truly democratic society may diminish group conflicts through its policies by assuring equal opportunity to all members, regardless of cultural group membership. (Author/AN)",

        "description":"As part of an ongoing investigation to determine the locational behavior of single-family-housing residents on the metropolitan fringe, a pilot study was conducted which simulated residential choice by asking respondents to rate the economy, convenience, and desirability of rural housing descriptions relative to a standard suburban residence. Four factors were manipulated: (1) size and arrangement of lots within a development; (2) monthly mortgage payment; (3) distance from work and shopping; and (4) availability of public services. Thirteen people representing three subgroups of suburbanites, exurbanites, and precludeds made choices to the simulated suburban/rural housing preferences on rating scales and questionnaires. Analysis of the rating data showed that each factor by  itself was an important determinate of the desirability, economy, and convenience ratings. Individual differences were found to be related to sociodemographic factors, previous housing history, and current and projected lifestyles. Further investigations were planned to apply the methodology to a group of consumers in the housing market, and thereby predict housing decisions and estimate the latent demand for alternative nonurban housing characteristics.

In forager and agricultural societies, social workers and other human service personnel intervene into kinship patterns, extended families, customs, rules, taboos, and obligations that are quite different from those in cities. The theoretical paraphernalia that works in industrial societies does not apply in native villages or small prairie towns; therefore, an analytical, rather than a general cataloguing approach in intervening becomes more effective. Social workers who are trained in industrial and  technological societies must discover the current stage of the agricultural structure of the rural family they are working with, the economic and cultural needs of the individual family, and the local helping resources available, in order to determine the most effective counselling approaches to use in a successful and humane manner, without destroying the ways of the native people in each rural society.

Mexican American students are more often retained in grade, placed in low ability groups, or placed in classes for the educationally or mentally retarded than are other students. Mobility and language factors create educational problems for the migrant student. After providing information on historical background and present status of Hispanic students, the report describes the contributions of the following school  programs and approaches: Title I, Head Start, Migrant Education, Bilingual Education, Vocational Education, and Special Education. Also discussed is the need for bilingual teachers and texts. Recommendations for improved Hispanic education include: (1) better records on Hispanic groups in order to better address specific educational needs; (2) elimination of all discrimination and segregation of Mexican Americans; (3) facilitation and validation of academic credit accrual and exchange process; and (4) increased bilingual education and other programs for limited-English-proficient students.

The Commission report draws implications from the papers concerning educational needs of minorities resulting from poverty, cultural differences, linguistic differences, mobility, need for parent education and parent involvement, and health problems of students. Although the authors of the papers generally limit their remarks to elementary/ secondary issues, each group appears to have education needs at the  postsecondary level. In essence, the papers provide a comprehensive overview from which to assess the ongoing activities of the Commission. The Commission assists states in addressing the needs of cultural minorities by technical assistance, by information/data collection, and by interpretation of state needs to federal policy makers. Specialized staff members provide in-depth assistance in the areas of school finance reform, desegregation, Indian education, and migrant education.

Data analyzed dealt with safisfactions, perceptions, evaluations, behaviors, and environmental characteristics, as seen by rural residents in three national and one regional (northern Michigan) surveys conducted between 1971 and 1976. The studies, which included questionnaires, personal interviews, and telephone interviews, defined the population groups by age, race, income and educational levels, job status, and occupation, with the last three categories looked at separately for men and  women. Results indicated a somewhat \"mixed picture\" of life in rural America. In most instances, a greater satisfaction than dissatisfaction was seen in rural areas than in urban areas, but rural residents taken as a whole were seen to be neither better nor worse off than urban Americans.

Various members of the administration and a group of Indian leaders from across the country attended the hearing, at which Senator John Melcher presided. Indian witnesses testified and made recommendations on the following concerns: the administration and funding of the Title II Indian child and family services program; ambiguities in the amount and distribution of funding; mechanism or regard for tribal priority and authority in child welfare; questions on service population; problems with communication; compacts between states; problem identification;  Bureau of Indian Affairs involvement; discussion of a boarding school study; and access to funds by off-reservation Native American organizations. The follow-up letters presented issues of concern from the Inter-Tribal Childrens' Program and the Sisseton-Wahpeton-Sioux Tribe. (JD)",

In Part I, much recent research is cited. Although methodology and results vary greatly, the research clearly points to a serious drug problem in many Indian communities. High and ever-increasing rates of marijuana, alcohol, and inhalant use are noted. Among the factors correlated with high drug use among Indian youth are the absence of one or both parents, peer encouragement in use of drugs, school troubles, and negative self-image. Part II contains many suggestions for ways to fight drug abuse, some of which are in use. Role model programs, cultural activities, treatment and  prevention programs, and drug education geared to all segments of the community are discussed. Part III is a discussion of nine major drugs: inhalants, marijuana, alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, psychedelics, cocaine, heroin, and PCP. This section describes how the drugs work, what they are, how they are taken, how they affect the user, and what their dangers are. The report is intended for use by people in the field who work with the drug abuse problems of American Indian youth. (SB)",

        "description":"Data analyses from 14 case studies of American rural communities reveal specific diversities and differences from typical urban areas, and suggest that rural schools and rural areas are one integrated social structure, which implies that one cannot intervene in one without impacting on the other. Implications from this hypothesis indicate that public policy must take a holistic view of rural schools and rural communities as one unitary social system, and form the basis for a recommended agenda for rural school improvement in three categories: (1) broadening the data base on rural America/rural schools; (2) examining the forces intervening on rural communities/rural education which shape its present operation; and (3) creating a development capacity within rural education.  Creating improved procedures for rural schooling, through redefinition of the needs, processes, and possibilities of quality education for rural students, necessitates the development of a more differentiated and flexible public policy, and places the responsibility for implementation of the new procedures on the combined efforts of those working in rural education and those who live in rural communities.

The gearing up period was devoted to research existing programs, identifying team members and their responsibilities, and selecting the programs to be studied. Site visits lasted from three to five days for data collection and report writing, with return visits required to three of the locations. Data analysis was continuous throughout the two year period, and all information was reviewed upon completion of the project. A minimum of technical assistance was used during  the first year, and approximately 10% of the principal investigator's time was devoted to technical assistance during the second year. Reflections on the methodology revealed four conditions which contribute to the quality of such studies as being: an experienced principal investigator; a well-developed conceptual framework; a carefully selected study team; and time and money. Methodology for future similar studies is recommended, and appendices to the narrative include descriptions of the case studies and the design work session. (JD)",

Research in education has often attempted to demonstrate the superiority of one type of instruction when compared with another. This research is based on the idea that no single treatment is satisfactory for all students, but that different pupils do best with different types of instruction, depending on the individual student's characteristics. Matching instructional treatments with student characteristics to maximize learning is called Aptitude-Treatment-Interaction (ATI). Significant ATI's were obtained in the reported  studies with three different aptitude variables. Field dependence-independence, general reasoning, and locus of control appear to be the most promising variables for future research, particularly in mathematics education. A complete report of each study is provided in the appendices. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"Research on the structures and processes involved in simple mental arithmetic is reviewed. Results suggest that mental arithmetic is a memory retrieval phenomenon, which develops with the experiences of elementary school and can be understood in general as retrieval from organized network representations. Simple mental addition with basic facts was examined in children from grades 1 and 5 and in college students. The data indicate that two models are necessary to describe the development of addition performance. These models are a simple counting framework for children in the early stages of mastery, followed by the network retrieval model from about the fourth or fifth grade on. The most basic result in studies of mental arithmetic is the problem size effect--a regular increase  in reaction time (RT) as the numerical size of the problem increases. The RT performance varies with task (verbal production vs. verification), problem size, and age. The report recommends use of the true/false verification task in future studies of the psychology of arithmetic performance, as data generated from such tasks is more amenable to information processing models.

The rationale states that global education contributes to a fundamental competence in a world context, to educational excellence, and to the nation's vital interests. Components of global education include increased language learning, foreign area studies, learning about cultural concepts, experience with a wide variety of interdependent relationships, examination of critical global problems, and learning to weigh future consequences of present decisions. Efforts to develop global perspectives in education exist in both federal and  nonfederal sectors and include both school and out-of-school settings. The four general recommendations of the task force are: to establish a special program of incentive grants and contracts, to improve and expand education for global perspectives, to encourage the incorporation of global perspective within existing or planned United States Department of Education programs, and to provide leadership in facilitating collaboration on education for global perspectives.

        "description":"This monograph stresses the importance of art education in elementary and secondary schools and explains how school/community partnership in the arts can help keep arts education programs alive. Part of a series containing background information on arts programs in schools, this document is intended to aid individuals and school art advocacy groups as they urge support from educators, school board members, parents, artists, arts administrators, students, community leaders, legislators, and government agencies. Reasons why art programs are being reduced or eliminated in many schools include declining enrollment, vandalism, low test scores, the back to basics movement, spiraling inflation, and budgetary priorities. In spite of these problems, however, arts programs are expanding in  some school districts. Examples of communities with expanding arts programs include Minneapolis, Ann Arbor, Cleveland, Boston, and Luling (Louisiana). Although programs in these communities are dissimilar with respect to size, specific objectives, funding, and level of student participation, they are all the result of strong and sustained leadership of at least one individual and all rely heavily on school/community partnership. Specifically, they stress cooperation among parents, educators, artists, and local art resources such as museums, historic preservation societies, art galleries, local presses, theaters, recital halls, broadcast media, and music and dance companies. The conclusion is that schools will improve their chances for a successful arts education program if they take  inventory of local resources, enlist the aid of a wide variety of local artists and resources, investigate and borrow ideas from effective programs in other communities, and seek committed and professional leadership.

It is intended as an aid to parents, educators, and other interested citizens as they evaluate and/or seek to improve arts education programs. The questions are accompanied by comments which serve as general guides to the kinds of answers one might expect and to areas in which additional information might be elicited. The document is presented in 11 major sections. Section one characterizes the type of individual for whom the self-assessment questions are particularly relevant. These individuals include parents of artistically gifted children, parents of students with special needs, representatives  of local cultural organizations, civic leaders, and a member of a board of education faced with budget cuts. Sections two through ten are organized around the following questions: \"Is there a formal school board policy or set of goals concerning the arts?\"\"How are the arts reflected in the school budget?\"\"How strong is the arts program in the elementary and secondary schools?\"\"Are there arts programs for students with special needs and interests?\"\"How are the arts integrated into the regular academic program?\"\"Does the district provide staff inservice programs in the arts?\"\"Do school arts programs involve the community?\" and \"Does the district have a comprehensive program in the arts?\" The final section offers a check list for evaluating an arts program. These include faculty  expressions of hope for program improvement, parental input, the amount of staff development throughout the district, and the degree of commitment to the arts among school board members and principals.

        "description":"The paper reports results of a study to determine the impact of values decision-making activities on the content retention and attitudes of high school social studies students. The study used the Casteel-Stahl approach to values education. This approach maintains that students must engage in four phases of thinking during values/moral classroom instruction: conceptual, relational, valuation, and reflective. The framework allows teachers to develop subject matter centered materials which will enhance content comprehension while simultaneously aiding students in acquiring decision-making, valuing, and moral-reasoning skills. The sample consisted of 18 eleventh grade American History classes taught by six teachers. The classes were randomly divided into control and experimental  groups. The researcher planned, developed, and wrote eight values dilemmas, each covering an event or topic in the text. Experimental teachers were given no special training in using these activities. Students were tested at the end of the first and fourth weeks. Results of both tests indicate that students who interacted with the values dilemmas retained more content as well as developed more positive attitudes than those who did not use the activities. The data suggest that the Casteel-Stahl model of values education is a viable approach to help students in the various cognitive and attitudinal dimensions of their lives. Copies of the values dilemmas used are appended and comprise the major portion of the document. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"This paper introduces key concepts in the field of moral stage development and presents highlights from a long-term research project on moral discussion, and, particularly, on the role of transactive discussion in moral development. The main objective of the research was to identify those features of moral discussion (defined as transactive) that differentiate developmental discussion from non-developmental discussion. Transactive discussion is the label used to identify a form of verbal interaction which is more simultaneous, mutual, and bi-directional than simple verbal interaction. It is hypothesized that moral stage development results from transactive discussion because each member engages his/her reasoning with the reasoning of the discussion partner. Developmental  discussion is interpreted as discussion that results in advancement of an individual from one moral stage to another, as determined by changing scores from a moral development pre-test to a posttest. Non-developmental discussion is interpreted as discussion which does not result in any such change. The document is presented in two sections. In section I, concepts, theories, vocabulary, and literature on stage transition in moral development are examined. Topics discussed include Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development, stages of moral reasoning, stage transition, models of stage variability, moral education strategies, and moral discussion analysis. In this section, a chronological narrative of the research project is also presented. In section II, a detailed description of the  manual used to code moral dialogue throughout the research project is presented and some data on analysis of peer counseling skills are cited. Also included in this section are implications for further research, including that transactive dialogue research should consider the communication skills of participants in moral education programs.

In addition, it identifies reasons why so few organized family planning programs have targeted men as clients and why men have so often played a peripheral or negative role in family planning. The document is presented in seven chapters. Chapter I introduces the topic and relates the involvement of men in family planning to social and economic development, men's self-interest, public health, and men's role in the family and in society. Chapter II relates reproductive biology to the macho myth and explains how large families often mean higher social status in developing countries. Chapter III compares traditional methods of male and female contraception. Chapter IV discusses recent research on the male  birth control pill. Chapter V presents an overview of family planning programs for men in developing and developed nations. Chapter VI explores considerations upon which couples and societies base their choices regarding family planning. Major considerations include effectiveness, side effects, availability, cost, and safety. The final chapter suggests how men can play a more responsible role in family planning. Changes necessary to bring about increased male responsibility include more support for male contraceptive research and male birth control programs, more liberal approaches by businesses and marketing companies toward contraception, and expanded school and community sex education programs.

One of the major objectives of the study was to examine the status of the psychology course from the perspectives of three major groups of certified teachers--social studies teachers, guidance counselors, and a group of teachers representing all the other miscellaneous areas of certification--to determine if their certification area influences their approach to the course. The study examines teacher characteristics, characteristics of the students enrolled in the courses, as well as course objectives, content, and methods. Where relevant, findings from this study are compared to those from similar surveys conducted in Florida and Mississippi. To gather data questionnaires were sent to  teachers and students in the state. Five hundred and fifty four of the 864 schools surveyed (64.1%) returned completed questionnaires. Psychology is taught in 59.7% of the schools in Illinois by 149 social studies teachers, 65 guidance counselors, and 114 teachers in the &quot;Other&quot; category. Social studies teachers received significantly fewer hours of college level psychology course training than their counterparts. None of the three groups of teachers came closer to meeting the expectations or needs of the students than the others. Also, the three groups of teachers emphasized the same content and topics and used identical teaching methods. (Author/RM)",

The document is presented in three parts. Part I covers the Michigan Social Studies Textbook Act, an historical overview of previous Michigan textbook studies, the professional responsibility of textbook evaluation and selection, and the design of the 1978 Social Studies Textbook Study. Fifteen reviewers evaluated textbooks and accompanying instructional materials according to the degree to which they accurately reflect our multi-cultural society, portray people from other areas of the world, are concerned with the handicapped and women, are adequate for bilingual and gifted  students, are at appropriate reading levels, and accurately reflect current scholarship in social studies education. Textbooks and/or programs evaluated were &quot;Concepts and Inquiry&quot; (Allyn and Bacon, 1978), &quot;The Social Sciences: Concepts and Values&quot; (Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1970), the &quot;Holt Databank System&quot; (Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1972), and &quot;Windows on Our World&quot; (Houghton Mifflin Company, 1976). Part II includes a summary of findings and recommendations, editorial commentary, and suggestions for consideration. The findings are organized according to reviewer and the four textbooks are evaluated according to each of the specified categories. General findings demonstrate that none of the programs is adequate in all categories; significant deficiences exist in terms of sex bias,  handicapped, and American Indians; and much work is required before textbooks will accurately reflect our pluralistic society.

Textbooks and/or programs reviewed were &quot;Concepts and Inquiry&quot; (Allyn and Bacon, 1978), &quot;The Social Sciences: Concepts and Values&quot; (Harcourt, Brace,  Jovanovich, 1970), the &quot;Holt Databank System&quot; (Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1972), and &quot;Windows on Our World&quot; (Houghton Mifflin Company, 1976). The findings are organized according to reviewer, each of whom was assigned a specific topic in analyzing all four programs. These topics are Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, Africa, Asia, Middle East, Russia and Eastern Europe, Handicapped, Women, Bilingual, Gifted and Talented, Readability (two reviewers), and social studies scholarship. General findings demonstrate that none of the programs is adequate in all categories; significant deficiencies exist in terms of sex bias, handicapped, and American Indians; and much work is required before textbooks will accurately reflect our pluralistic society.

        "author":["Rest, James R."],
        "description":"The document discusses the nature of moral judgment, reviews previous studies which link higher education to moral judgment, and presents results of a longitudinal study comparing college and non-college subjects. This project report from the Higher Education and Cognitive-Social Development Project at the University of Minnesota is presented in three sections. In Section I the motivational and cognitive theories of moral education are discussed. In the motivational theory, the goal of moral education is to change the individual's motives from selfish, impulsive, and unsocial to altruistic, disciplined, and social. The cognitive theory portrays the goal of education as developing the individual's understanding about how people interact with each other. Lawrence Kohlberg's six  stages of moral development and a review of research on cognitive development are presented. Section II summarizes research on the impact of higher education on moral judgment as measured by the Defining Issues Test (DIT), which constitutes the largest data base on a single measure of moral judgment. Results indicate that changes in moral development occur over long periods of time and apparently not through the teaching of specific doctrines. Section III reports results of a longitudinal study by the author to determine if college students show greater gains in moral judgment development than non-college students. The 59 subjects were tested during high school, two years after, then four years after the initial test. Thirty-eight subjects had gone to college, 18 had not (for three  subjects the classification was ambiguous). Participants in the third testing completed the DIT, the Comprehension of Moral Concepts Test, Law and Order Political Attitudes, and a &quot;life history.&quot; Results indicate that higher education fosters development in moral judgment, particularly at the four year mark.

Fifty-two subjects were tested both in 1976 and 1978, creating 104 subject-oriented dilemmas. Thirty-two were in college, 17 were not, and three were in college at the first testing but had dropped out by the last testing. Participants completed a Defining Issues Test (DIT), Comprehension of Moral Attitudes Test, Law and Order Test of Political Attitudes, a written moral dilemma test, and a short personal questionnaire. At the end of the tests, students were asked to describe their own moral dilemmas. The most important findings of the study were that the moral dilemmas that  young adults write about are extremely diverse and changeable over time. Subjects described their dilemmas from three perspectives: social issues such as abortion, gay rights, the arms race; personal problems; and general causes of human conflict such as greedy people and corrupt governments. Subjects with more education tended to relate slightly more social dilemmas. Females gave proportionally more personal and social dilemmas; males recorded proportionally more general cause dilemmas. A comparison with the DIT scores did not show that any of the dilemma types were developmentally more advanced. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"This technical project report provides the National Science Foundation with information regarding the substantive achievements of the Social Science Education Consortium's project QUESST (Quantitative Understanding To Enhance Social Science Teaching). The report begins with a discussion of materials development and project publicity. Thirty-three quantitatively oriented social science learning modules were developed for use in grades 7-12. Through a wide variety of teaching methods, the self-contained modules teach the following quantitative concepts and skills: numbers, percents, ratios, index numbers, classification, rank order, continua, central tendency, correlation, and reading graphs and tables. In one module students compare American energy consumption with the rest of the  world and explore domestic energy consumption patterns. Interpretation of graphs and tables helps students to develop and evaluate the hypothesis that total energy consumption is a function of population size and standard of living, in this case measured by GNP per capita. In another module students examine two variables, health and wealth, and relate these to the degree of urbanization found in various world regions and nations. A third module, through the use of a collage of newspaper headlines, graphs, tables and case studies, examines the upward movement of wages and prices in recent years. Other social science topics dealt with in the modules include world military, American immigrants, income, inflation and the consumer price index, the energy crunch, advertising, and government  revenue and expenditures. All 33 modules are included in this report. Also included in the report are a discussion of project publicity, efforts to secure a commercial publisher for the materials, and an evaluation report based on results of the project field test.

The third part of the document briefly describes the results and methodology of a comparative study and contains all the tabular results. The data analysis revealed that psychology as a separate course of study for credit was taught in 331 of the 554 Illinois secondary schools responding to the questionnaire. One of the major goals of the study was to determine if the certification areas of the teachers would translate into different approaches to the courses. The study shows that all of the teachers used the same teaching methods. (Author/RM)",

        "author":["Flavin, Christopher"],
        "description":"This monograph explores how architecture is influenced by and is responding to the global energy dilemma. Emphasis is placed on conservation techniques (using heavy insulation) and on passive solar construction (supplying most of a building's heating, cooling, and lighting requirements by sunlight). The basic problem is that architecture, like transportation, manufacturing, and agriculture, is heavily dependent on fossil fuels. It is estimated that approximately one-quarter of the world's energy supplies (two-thirds of which is derived directly or indirectly from oil and natural gas) is used for heating, cooling, and lighting buildings. Until recently, buildings in many countries were constructed with little or no concern for their energy efficiency or lifetime fuel costs.  Building designers and researchers have recently become much more energy-conscious, due in large part to realization that paying for electricity is now the biggest expense in operating most large buildings. Also, the level of general awareness regarding energy use in buildings has risen rapidly as consumers, builders, real estate agents, and others have been exposed to education about climate conscious buildings. The conclusion is that the potential of energy-conscious improvements such as passive solar techniques and conservation for reducing dependence on expensive fossil fuel energy will be realized if designers, consumers, and regulatory agencies make an immediate and total commitment to make the transition to climate conscious buildings. Ways in which this transition can be  accelerated include labeling of the fuel requirements of buildings by trade associations and local governments, provision of tax breaks for solar and other energy efficient homes, and establishment of energy standards for all new buildings.

The study was part of a larger investigation of the literature on needs and practices in precollege science, mathematics, and social science education. Specific objectives of the social science portion of the study were to identify, analyze, and summarize the literature concerning the state of and trends in practices in precollege social science education, the effectiveness and efficiency of educational practices, and the state of and trends in perceptions of needs. Major sources of information included the ERIC data base, \"Dissertation Abstracts,\"\"Psychological Abstracts,\"\"Education Index,\" reviews of research in social studies education, and other  journals related to the social sciences. The report is presented in four major sections. Section I describes the state of social studies practices and changes over the 20 year period. Section II focuses on current educational practices in social studies. Section III describes literature that surveys needs in the social studies. Section IV examines the \"new social studies.\" One-hundred-fifteen summary observations are listed at various points throughout the paper. These include the difficulty of obtaining a clear picture of patterns of actual classroom practices, teacher education practices, and needs. Particular problems are that very little research on effectiveness exists, there is difficulty in defining purposes and boundaries of social studies, and there are many differing perceptions  of the \"new social studies.\" (Author/DB)",

        "description":"This paper presents a rationale for making social action a major goal of elementary and secondary school social studies education. In addition, it describes social action models, suggests social action approaches appropriate for students at various grade levels, and reviews literature on social action by public school students. Social action is interpreted as any attempt by an individual or group to effect change in the social or political environment. The author recommends that social action within the realm of social studies should be consistent with rationality and human dignity, should involve consideration of issues involved in a particular problem and examination of alternative courses of action, and should help students understand how to participate intelligently and  responsibly in a democratic society. Three social action models are described. For each model, steps are outlined to help students identify a problem, collect and analyze data, discuss various solutions, take appropriate action, and evaluate results of that action. Twelve general means of taking social action are suggested, including circulating and signing petitions, interviewing people involved in the problem, presenting programs to civic and church groups, and collecting and sending money to causes and organizations. Instances of social action for the period 1929 to 1980 are outlined in tabular form by problem, school, location, action, and bibliographic reference. Among the approximately 90 actions outlined are neighborhood clean-up campaigns, surveys of pollution and litter, creation  of a solarized heating plant in a nature center greenhouse, and a school-wide fund drive to collect food for indigent families.

Health facility reuse is an activity which will become an increasingly common strategy in addressing the interrelated problems of rising health care costs and surplus of acute care hospital facilities. The Health Facility Reuse Conference investigated \"reuse\" from six critical issue perspectives: financial feasibility, codes and standards, systems approaches, project implementation, planning strategies, and design evaluation. Policy issues and future research and  agenda are presented for each critical issue, and priority activity areas are recommended. Any health organization must be considered an infrastructural institution within its community, and any flexibility which can be generated in the existing health facility system must be directed to satisfy broad economic and social criteria. This project has tried to establish the direction for systematic research into the often adhoc or reactive capital investment in existing health facility resources. (Author/JN)",

Areas covered by the survey included the attitudes of the General Assembly members toward teachers, teachers' salaries, and age of retirement. The survey was designed around eighteen questions with additional space for comments. Questions covered a range of relevant topics such as &quot;Do you favor graduate school programs in Tennessee?&quot;; &quot;Do you favor a comprehensive school system for each county in Tennessee?&quot;; and &quot;Do you think that the curriculum for majors in education should be revised?&quot; The questions were intended to discern opinions and attitudes from the members rather than elicit information based  on factual knowledge. A general agreement was reached suggesting that education today is considered &quot;better&quot; by a substantial number of respondents. Consensus among respondents indicated that too much emphasis is being placed on higher education. Respondents also agreed that the greatest deterrent to education in Tennessee is the home environment of the child, that teacher education curriculum should be revised, and that school board members should have at least twelve years of formal education.

An analysis of supply and demand studies shows continuing high demand for and moderate shortages of educational specialists. Both generalists and specialists are concerned about defining and delimiting roles and responsibilities. Evidence of negative effects of specialization is scant, but certain problems appear to be common--\"dumping\" of problem students, over-referral, and lack of parent involvement. Exploratory studies of generalist-specialist interaction were carried out with 66 teachers and 22 physicians. Interviews focused on referral practices and problems; teachers agree less about grounds for referral and have more problems than  physicians following up on referrals. Teachers lack a responsive system for handling feedback and also sense more client difficulties during referrals. Recommendations include: improving communication among educational generalists and specialists; reducing \"dumping\"; making record keeping systems more responsive; and increasing public involvement in planning for specialist services.

Some confusion exists over the exact definition of CBTE and how a state views teacher education will affect the thrust of CBTE programs. The selection of competencies and the determination of how the competencies will be measured are two significant issues. The first problem is essentially a matter of public policy to be resolved at the state and local levels. The measurement problem is more difficult since the tools needed to provide objective information for truly accurate measurement do not exist. The source of funding for CBTE programs is another factor that must be considered. Providing technological support for  these programs is another problem that will have to be solved at the state level if CBTE is to become a requirement for accreditation for schools of education.

To meet the educational demands of a changing society, education professionals are needed to design and conduct training programs, prepare educational materials and consumer guides, provide personal and career counseling, and evaluate program and personnel effectiveness. A review of many existing programs at schools, colleges, and departments of education reveals considerable diversity in programs offered to education students going beyond the traditional school-related teacher education curriculum. Many institutions have expanded their mission to include the preparation of child care recreation personnel and counselors for a wide range of  community and business settings, as well as programs for allied health, government and community agencies, business and industry, and museums.

While there was some evidence that many teachers may not desire increased involvement, the question was raised of whether or not such involvement might be in their best interests. Teacher involvement was examined in nine areas: instructional coordination, curriculum development, professional development, evaluation, school improvement, personnel, rules and discipline, general administration, and policy making. Analysis of the phases of decision making and the relationship between involvement and influence in the decision making processes suggested that teachers have more involvement  than influence. The absence of teacher involvement was examined from the perspectives of psychology, political science, sociology, and organizational theory. It was concluded that each of the disciplines made valuable contributions to an understanding of teacher decision making at the school level, although none alone could provide a complete explanation for the current pattern of teacher involvement.

Students presenting shared problems often were seen as able to control their behavior, but not as misbehaving intentionally. The contrasting patterns of attribution seen in their three levels of problem ownership were also associated with contrasting patterns of goals and strategies.

Three distinct reactions to this problem have occurred. One proposed solution is to break the apriori model into separate component skills and to train teachers in each skill. A second approach is to train teachers to operate according to the apriori models of rationality and to apply the learned principles in the classroom. The third approach suggests that the discrepancies between theory and practice demonstrate that teachers should not be pressed into these preformed molds. It is most desirable to enable teachers to be rational by helping them choose effective strategies. Since few teachers follow the steps  provided in the apriori model, it is important to understand how teachers make decisions. Teacher education programs which prescribe teacher behavior are miseducative. Current research on teacher thinking should not provide prescriptions that may serve as the content of preservice or inservice teacher training programs. (JN)",

        "description":"Three developmental approaches to teacher education are examined in an effort to determine a coherent theoretical framework of criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of education programs. The first is discussed in terms of the development in a teacher of concern for student achievement and increasing willingness to be flexible in adapting new innovations that may improve student learning. The second approach to teacher development is based on the application of scales designed to identify the ability to take multiple perspectives, to be empathetic, and to employ principled moral reasoning. The third developmental approach to teacher education seeks to produce teachers who are nondirective, and who will promote developmental growth in children. The rationale for each of these  approaches is discussed and the justification of each by leading proponents is presented. A critique of all three approaches is offered. (JD)",

Goals and strategies are connected with different uses of the term &quot;development&quot; in teacher education. Associated with efforts to construct theories of teacher development is a diagnostic-prescriptive approach to staff development. It is important to match the teacher's needs and to diagnose the teacher's current stages of development in order to understand how to proceed. A second model, derived from existing developmental theories, is built around creating a mismatch between the teacher's current stage of development and the desired stage of development. A third concept  emphasizes certain enabling conditions that support self directed learning. Teachers need to attain a certain level of psychological maturity in order to foster developmental growth in their students. (JN)",

It begins by pointing out the importance of the development of positive self concepts in children. The early development of self and general self concept is described, and then attention is focused on the impact of schools in general and of teachers in particular on the self images of youth. A review of the research evidence discloses that the impact can be a negative one. However, a concerted effort to bring about positive changes can be successful. Additional research is needed in many areas of self concept development. There is a great need for a more comprehensive understanding of the construct \"self concept\"--how it develops, what influences it,  how it changes, and how the changes can be measured. More action research is needed to identify effective change strategies. (CJ)",

This can be applied to the new professionalism in the teaching of ethics. Loosening the creative tension of perceived responsibility effectively closes down the real moral decision. The contemporary notion has the ethicist as co-worker to the scientist. The degree to which professional ethics can be charged with error is measured subjectively. The attempt has been to restrict ethics to rule-making and method-devising. Concern with rules may disclose an intensification of professional competition. Professional ethics borrows from the law of methodology. Teaching ethics requires more than reference to a body of knowledge or  jargon. (JN)",

There are two modes of transmission available to researchers: inservice to practicing teachers, and inclusion of relevant research in preservice teacher education. A study was conducted to involve beginning student teachers in one of the most pervasive research projects of teacher effectiveness in the past several years: the Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study (BTES). The BTES is a research program concerning teaching effectiveness in the elementary school. The purpose of the study was to identify teaching activities and classroom processes that enhanced student learning. The results of the study were integrated into the Academic Learning Time (ALT) model of  classroom instruction. ALT is a measure based on observable student behavior and is defined as the amount of time a student is engaged in an academic task. BTES showed positive correlations between ALT and student achievement. Project results indicate that current research on teaching effectiveness can and should be successfully integrated into preservice teacher education. (JN)",

This descriptive study concerns the implementation of the Developing Mathematical Processes (DMP) instructional program, which was created to be compatible with the IGE system. DMP approaches mathematics through the measurement of attributes. The major content areas are problem solving, place value, attributes, measurement, addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, fractions, geometry, and statistics. An emphasis is placed on exploring relationships between objects using processes such as describing, classifying, ordering, equalizing, joining,  separating, grouping, and partitioning. The study was carried out at two schools; grades 2 and 5 participated at each school, and data were collected through tests on general objectives of the program, observations, teacher logs, and interviews. Profiles by school for each grade on means of instruction (pacing, grouping, materials, and interactions), time use (allocated, nonapplied, available, and engaged time), and achievement provide a basis for discussing the relationships among the variables.

The WDRSD has four fundamental purposes: (1) to identify and describe instructional objectives for the  skills which appear essential for competence in reading; (2) to assess individual pupils' skill development status; (3) to manage instruction of children with different skill development needs; and (4) to monitor each pupil's progress.

The subjects of the study were 127 elementary school teachers, 106 secondary school teachers, and two teachers who taught at both levels. The median number of years of teaching experience was 5.6 years. Each teacher responded to three questionnaires which tested: (1) their preferences for sixteen conceptual models of teaching; (2) how well each of 24 adjectives describe an ideal teacher; and (3) philosophical  beliefs by rating the teachers' strength of agreement with each of 44 statements on educational theories. The analysis of results showed that homogeneous groups of teachers can be created based on instructional preferences, and that teachers role-ideals and preferences for educational philosophies are related to their preferences for conceptual models for teaching. Implications of these findings are discussed, and a detailed analysis of the methodology with supporting tables, as well as a list of references, is included. (FG)",

The most basic theoretical contribution that psychology has made to cognitive learning has been the delineation of a unit of thinking, the concept, which acts as an organizer of experience. The methods of evaluating concepts and the different forms of representation in a cross disciplinary study revealed trends across disciplines and baseline variability among learning tasks in different courses. The methods of evaluating concepts include measures of the frequency and familiarity of key concepts, and measures of word associations to the concepts. The methods of representing concepts in a cognitive structure produced tree  structures and similarity matrices. These could then be rated for consistency and for the kinds of relationships between concepts. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"Generalizability theory was used to analyze the dependability of elementary school student ratings of attitudes toward school subjects. The rating scales under investigation have been developed to measure the attitudes of students toward four school subjects at both the primary and intermediate levels. Two generalizability coefficients, differing in assumptions of true and error variance, were calculated which estimated the dependability of assessing class attitude. A third coefficient was calculated which estimated the dependability of assessing individual student attitudes. The effects of varying the number of scale items and/or students on the dependability of class means or individual student attitudes were investigated. The results suggest the attitude scales measuring  primary student attitudes toward school subjects are not dependable indicators of student attitudes when class is the unit of analysis. There is cogent evidence that both primary and intermediate student attitudes can be dependably evaluated by the attitude scales when the student is the unit of analysis. (Author)",

The major audiences were parents, legislators, school board members, lawyers, journalists and others who would be interested in and profit from training related to educational testing. Nero and Associates, Inc., together with the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory and the California Department of Education, arranged, designed and conducted five seminars/workshops for groups and organizations representing the above audiences. The format and specific content for each seminar/workshop was developed in collaboration with representatives from each group. For example, lawyers were involved in designing the workshop for  attorneys to insure that the information presented would address issues of concern to that group. Staff from the National Institute of Education worked with the contractor to establish the workshop agendas and identify the key groups. The workshops were held from April 1980 through September 1980. The work resulted in a set of training materials which can be used by measurement specialists to train citizen groups.

As a result, the composition of El Camino's student body changed to one representing all ability levels. Other major changes at El Camino were: (1) academic emphasis was placed on basic skills and (2) school rules such as closed campus, dress code, and no smoking were communicated and enforced. Academic achievement during the first year was measured by the district's minimum competency tests and the Tests of Achievement and Proficiency (TAP). Overall academic achievement remained high. Average test scores on TAP were well above the national average and the percent passing the minimum competency tests  increased. Attitudes toward El Camino were measured by surveys completed by parents, students and staff. General observations by all groups were that coursework was harder this year; students had more homework; students learned more; the new rules such as closed campus and dress code were enforced but unpopular with the students; and El Camino would improve more next year.

Students are to be assessed in grades 4-11. Students not making sufficient progress towards meeting the district's standards are to be provided with remedial programs, and school personnel are required to hold conferences with parents to inform them of their child's weaknesses in basic skills. After June of 1980, no student may be granted a high school diploma unless he or she has met district proficiency standards and completed the course requirements set forth by the school district. This study was designed to examine the progress of a representative sample of 155 local school districts in implementing  the Pupil Proficiency Law and attempts to point out problem areas which may require policy clarification, redirection of state technical assistance, or both. In addition, in-depth case studies were conducted in 15 districts. Major findings are organized into three areas: district tests, curriculum and instruction, and effects on students.

A pre-post design was used in seven institutions, with a pretest only in the other colleges. Results indicated that the DTMS were: (1) sensitive to gains from instruction in a single semester; (2) highly correlated with course grades obtained concurrently;  (3) predictive of end of course grades when the DTMS were administered at the beginning of the course; (4) a better predictor of course grades than SAT-Mathematical scores for remedial courses; (5) related to course difficulty as perceived by students; (6) capable of demonstrating a trait-treatment interaction in a precalculus-calculus sequence; and (7) related to the content of mathematics courses as judged by mathematics faculty members.

Principal component analyses of 14 affects resulted in two factors: (1) general happiness, pride, and satisfaction; and (2) surprise. Regression analyses indicated that perception of success or failure accounted for a very high proportion of the variance, although internal causal attributions were related to positive affect.

This conference was designed to explore the numerous issues of quality and assessment at the master's level from a variety of perspectives. This volume of 18 contributed papers focuses on the areas of needs and objectives, curriculum design and delivery, the meaning of quality, extant standards of quality for accreditation, definitions of assessment and methods of assessment for master's programs. Methods of assessment are specific to two types of master's degree program: type 1 centers in advanced studies in an academic discipline, e.g., history, physics, and sociology; and,  type 2 is professionally or vocationally oriented as in engineering, law, applied music, teaching or in a discipline in preparation for teaching.

        "description":"A paired-comparisons measure of distributive justice development, the Distributive Justice Scale (DJS), was developed and validated in four studies. Pictures were drawn to represent the different stages of distributive justice for a given dilemma and the DJS was scored by selecting the child's preferred stage via the picture comparisons for each dilemma. In Study 1, 104 children from kindergarten, grades 2 and 4 were given the DJS and two Piagetian logical reasoning tasks. Age trends and a relationship with logical reasoning were found. In Study 2, 66 children from grades 1, 3, and 5 were given the DJS and a measure of verbal ability. Age trends and a low relationship with verbal ability were found. In Study 3, 88 children in grades 1, 3, and 5 from Kinshasa, Africa were given  the DJS. The trends replicated Study 2. In Study 4, 56 children from lower and middle social classes in kindergarten and grade 3 were given the DJS. The lower class lagged behind the middle class in their DJS scores in both grades. Implications for distributive justice research were drawn. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"A study of identity development was carried out in Bristol, England, with Asian, West Indian, and indigenous British adolescents. Ethnic and gender differences in patterns of identification conflict with others were found between minority group boys and girls. Both sexes from both minority groups, however, had substantial identification conflicts with representatives of their own ethnicity, distinguishing them from indigenous adolescents. This common feature of the two minority groups may be explained in terms of dual socialization, that is, socialization within both their parental culture and British culture. Prejudice against West Indians and Asians was demonstrated in the indigenous adolescents, but the generally held view that discrimination against low status groups results  in their members' self-devaluations was not supported. Similarly, the argument that sex discrimination results in self devaluation was not supported. Finally, the general argument that similar processes of identity development would be found in girls experiencing sex discrimination did not gain support. The processes of sexual identity and ethnic identity development were shown to be different. It is believed that ethnic and gender differences displayed in overall patterns of identification conflicts are related to the differential roles played by parents, teachers, and peers as positive reference models in the individual's self concept development.

        "description":"An examination was made of the antecedents to singlehood for black women, based upon questionnaire and interview data from a larger study of 56 black women who graduated from predominantly white colleges in a northeastern city between 1968 and 1970. During the past few decades, researchers have found that a high percentage of educated black women have remarried. In this study, social class background was found to be an important variable in differentiating within the group. Both middle class and lower middle class parents value educational attainment, but vary in the degree to which they stress marriage. The participants in this study who came from middle class homes were expected to integrate careers with family life, while the upwardly mobile women from lower middle class  backgrounds had parents who focused on education to the exclusion of other goals. It is concluded that since the process of social mobility necessitates concentrating on adjusting to new environments and styles of interaction, black women from lower middle class families were forced to postpone marriage. Findings suggest that social class is also an important variable in the study of singlehood among other groups. (Author/MK)",

        "description":"The relative strength of racial and nonracial factors in motivating the public's opinion about busing has both theoretical and policy implications. If nonracial, especially self interest, factors are the strongest motives for opposition, then the success of busing, and of school desegregation in general, will depend upon the ability of the American political process to ameliorate the personal, social class, and educational aims of the contending parties. If opposition is rooted in racial or political attitudes, then attempts to adjust the self interest claims of the contending parties will be ineffective, leaving opposition to busing undiminished. This paper describes the results of a public opinion study conducted in Louisville, Kentucky, at the end of the first year of county  wide court ordered desegregation. The study examined the correlates of anti-busing attitudes with both racial and nonracial factors. It was found that neighborhood ties, perception of one's own neighborhood schools as superior to others, having children in the public schools, and having children who were bused, were all insignificant in predicting opposition to busing. Racism, however, as demonstrated by the beliefs that discrimination no longer exists, that blacks are making unfair demands and gains, and being accorded undue recognition and respect, was a significant predictor of anti-busing sentiment.

Two basic sources have been used: data collected for the author's dissertation, and interviews with high school principals in Brooklyn, New York. After an overview of the history of West Indian immigration, the recent status of the immigrants is discussed in terms of access to jobs, housing, and education. This is followed by a discussion of the settlement patterns and acculturation of the immigrants. Problems faced by parents unfamiliar with the educational process in the United States and children transferring to American schools are delineated. It is concluded that the difficulties faced by students from the West Indies are  not the result of the students' inability to profit from education but are the result of the failure of the educational system and the West Indian community to make the process meaningful for the children.

The race and sex of the person to whom each behavior was directed were recorded as were the affective tone (positive, negative, neutral) and the focus (task oriented, ambiguous, social) of the behavior. Findings indicated that children interacted more with peers of their own sex then with peers of the other sex. Children also tended to interact more with peers of their own race. Girls demonstrated strong own-race preferences while boys interacted cross-racially at approximately the same rate that would be expected if race were not a  factor in interactant choice. Analysis of the data on the affective tone of the interactions suggested that negative behaviors were very rare. No differences in the tone or the focus of interracial or intraracial interactions of the children were found. (Author/MK)",

Survey data indicated that Project Concern graduates made higher occupational choices and became involved in post secondary education at a greater rate than other groups. Results of a survey of second through eighth graders suggested that students had positive attitudes toward themselves and school. Academic achievement data was incomplete.

The study examined five cities faced with desegregating their schools: Cleveland, Columbus, Buffalo, Dayton, and Milwaukee. The main body of the report presents descriptive information about desegregation costs. Cost variations among cities are attributed to (1) technical factors (such as rules defining allowable costs for transportation reimbursement), (2) situational factors (that is, type of desegregation plan), and (3) &quot;constructivist&quot; factors (the informants' positions as defendants or plaintiffs). Despite outward variations, there are underlying regularities that were found during this study: resource reallocation, additional revenues, non-programmatic costs such as  attorneys' fees, inadequate financial management, and planning tools. Greater attention to the political economy of urban school desegregation is recommended. (Author/MK)",

Following the introductory chapter, chapter 2 concerns the current world-wide emphasis on the continuing development of staff, particularly as it relates to technical and further education. Chapter 3 examines the various methods by which staff development programs can be managed and provides a basis for the description of the following chapter of the operations and the two staff  development programs. General approaches to evaluation is the topic for chapter 5 and leads into a detailed account of the proposed methodology for the evaluation of staff development in technical and further education (chapters 6 and 7). Chapter 8 outlines the manner in which the trial phase of the study was carried out and includes suggested analyses by which data collected at either the college or system level may be examined. The final chapter discusses the application of the general methodology to specific staff development activities. (YLB)",

Nine experienced researchers with backgrounds in anthropology, sociology, educational psychology, and science education conducted eleven case studies. These field researchers used observation and formal and informal interviews to provide most of the data. Review of written materials added information. Interest was in discovering issues within each site and not in predetermined variables. The survey was designed to provide additional interpretations and information on the extent of generalizability of the case study data. A relatively innovative approach to survey research was taken in using issue findings as  the survey's primary conceptual structure. Each issue was portrayed through a scenario (a contrived illustration with related questions) of the survey. Members of nine organizations who reviewed the study reports generally appreciated the combination of approaches. Drawbacks to case studies included report length and cost in time and money. Survey research could be done more cheaply and reach more respondents and result in broad coverage of some pre-determined properties. Greater use of the survey in combination with case study would give a broader and deeper portrayal of issues within a given setting. (YLB)",

To accomplish these objectives, speakers, beggining with keynote speaker Marjorie East, focused on issues such as the profession of home economics and how to build it; the future of education, including the importance of the affective domain, the accountability movement, and the  National Institute of Education evaluation of consumer and homemaking education; and needs in secondary home economics education programs in the 1980s. Speakers also discussed recent legislation affecting home economics education. Sociologist Jessie Bernard closed the conference with a self-portrait of a family derived from more than thirty years of family letters. A summary of the conference and list of participants are included in these proceedings. (KC)",

        "description":"This study focuses on the role of the federal government in reducing persistent joblessness that prevails at relatively high levels even during periods of high employment or prosperity (&quot;structural unemployment&quot;). While the problem of cyclincal joblessness dominates public policy discussion at the present time, structural unemployment is being increasingly recognized as one of the nation's most serious domestic problems. Persistent high levels of &quot;prosperity&quot; or structural unemployment are attributable to seemingly intractable structural imbalances within the economy. The key policy problem centers on the use of aggregative and structural policies to reduce total unemployment to the 4-5 percent range and to bring the hard-to-employ into the economic mainstream without inducing  increased inflation. The study concludes that, while differing in degree, both cyclical and structural unemployment should be addressed in periods of high as in periods of low employment. The most critical issue to resolve is how to balance short-run and long-run goals for the economy in the selection of public policy alternatives. (KC)",

In the first of three sections, claims and evidence concerning the relationship of basic skills to employability and occupational competence are discussed; while in the next section, information on the level of acquisition of reading, writing, and arithmetic skills of vocational education students in secondary schools is presented. Characteristics of remedial efforts to improve vocational students' basic skills are discussed in the third section. Results of the literature  search suggest the following: (1) Proficiency in certain reading and computational skills is required for performance in all types of occupations. (2) Information is not yet available on the level of basic skill acquisition of students in different vocational programs; however, it is known that vocational education students perform below average in reading comprehension, vocabulary, and mathematics. (3) Available information leaves unanswered questions about successful efforts to improve the basic skills of vocational students, though inferences can be drawn from research conducted on literacy programs for adolescents and adults. The study also makes recommendations for improving vocational students' basic skills. (KC)",

The first chapter of the book defines job sharing, discusses the background of job sharing in light of the changing needs of workers, and points out potential benefits of job sharing, such as more efficient use of human resources, aid in recruiting employees, and maintaining quality in human services programs. The second chapter overviews considerations affecting successful implementation of  job sharing, such as cost factors, union cooperation, lay-off rights for part-timers, establishing quotas, personnel ceilings, reversibility, recruitment, and CETA. The third chapter explains how to design and implement a job-sharing program, while the fourth contains case histories of six job-sharing experiences in government agencies. Appendixes contain a glossary, a summary of the case histories, a list of avallable project studies and reports, a sample flyer, a model survey designed to assess current employee interest in a permanent part-time or job-sharing program; alternative recruitment sources; recommended supplementary reading; and a publications list.

A declining rate of labor force participation by older men and a growth in participation by older women were noticed. Examination of labor force participation rates by race revealed a higher participation rate for minority women than for older white women. Participation is positively correlated to level of educational attainment. Older married men are more likely to be in the labor force than other men. For women, the opposite is true. The trend toward early retirement is continuing. The industrial and occupational distribution of elderly workers differs from that of younger workers due to such factors as pension and retirement policy, physical demands, employment opportunities,  and educational requirements. Examination of differences in the level of unemployment among older workers by age, sex, and race demonstrated that the duration of unemployment is longer for older workers, particularly men. The future employment plcture for older workers will depend on such factors as declining birth rates, better education, inflation, and the effect of retirement on the physical and emotional health of the individual. Current experiments in phased retirement may become more widespread. (Fifteen tables are included.) (MN)",

By 1979 thirty-six per cent of all workers over 18 completed at least one year of college, and the percentage of workers not completing high school declined considerably. While the proportion of men participating in the labor force continued to fall, the number of female labor force participants increased. This increase is related to the growing proportion of women with postsecondary education. Unemployment rates continued their traditional relationship to years of school completed. The steady rise in average years of school completed has led to a substantial upward shift in the educational levels of workers in major occupational groups. Over the decade, the content of many jobs  changed drastically because of technologlcal advances. Nevertheless, data indicates that many better educated people are entering jobs for which formal educational requirements ln previous years were far lower. This trend could have negative repercussions such as workers perceiving themselves as being over qualified.

        "description":"A study examined existing literature on retirement practices and policy. Demographic change and the gradual development of pension benefits have led to the phenomenon of early retirement. There are three groups of early retirees. The voluntary retiree is in relatively good health, with adequate financial resources, can take full advantage of early retirement benefits and is prepared to enact the retirement role. Among involuntary retirees are those who retire because of ill health and those whose jobs are eliminated The third group consists of unprepared retirees. Initial research on the early retirement experience was conducted before the growth of inflation. Thus it did not encounter that stressful retirement experience which would later develop because of inflation and which  would require such interventions as retraining and job search assistance consistent with an unemployment approach to early retirement. To develop policy alternatives in early retirement practice, more information is needed on the costs and benefits of early retirement to the individual and the national economy. An unemployment-oriented and a life-cycle approach are needed in future early retirement research. Future policy must emphasize the productive retention of older workers, thus shifting emphasis from early retirement to the larger area of work and aging. (MN)",

This title instructs Prime Sponsors to form a new kind of intermediary organization, a Private Industry Council (PIC), which has the major objective of increasing the opportunities of CETA clients to find employment in the private sector. This technical assistance guide shows how on-the-job training (OJT) programs might operate in the setting of the PIC. The guide begins with a chapter on the background and history of OJT as an employment and training program. It then discusses the various possible roles of PICs in marketing and operating OJT programs, such as client screening, determining local priorities, staffing,  linking with other programs, and assisting employers; and then details the methodology of OJT agreements and contracts. Since bringing an innovative approach to private-sector OJT is implicit in the TITLV VII legislation, one chapter is devoted to variations and new concepts that PICs might adopt in Title VII activities, including OJT. The guide closes with a chapter on managing the OJT program. (This technical assistance guide is based largely on an earlier publication, &quot;On-the-Job Training: CETA Program Models.&quot;) (KC)",

The methodology developed was college-based, focused upon the college staff development program, and considered the staff development responsibilities of general staff, senior staff, and college program organizers. This approach was consistent with a collaborative model for management of staff development. Whenever appropiate, the evaluation methodology sought information from two or more categories of staff to provide different perspectives on the various issues pertinent to the evaluation of staff development. These issues related to the background factors,  processes, and outcomes. A questionnaire approach was used for gathering relevant information; where appropriate, the questionnaire included parallel forms of questions for each of the three categories of staff. Modifications were made to methods and measures such that the methodology could be suitable for evaluating specific staff development activities. (YLB)",

The purpose of this study was to determine how to train effectively more than 200,000 Air Force civilian employees to use the Job Performance Appraisal System (JPAS) designed by the Air Force. Experimental comparisons were made of the differing versions of two basic instructional prototypes: instructor-led and self-instructional. Results demonstrate that each approach teaches all occupational levels equally well, provided the instructor-based training is led by someone who is very knowledgeable in the system. Although students responded somewhat more positively to instructor-led training than to self-instructional training, the instructor-led training  took more time than the self-instructional training (16 hours for the instructor-led training versus a maximum of 11.5 hours for the self-instruction). Since the demand on human resources for the instructor-led course is significant when thousands of persons must be trained, administratively and in terms of cost-effectiveness, the self-instructional package is preferable.

The objective of this self-administered, self-instructional document is to help students better understand themselves and the world of work, and begin to see points of similarity and conflict between their self-perceived strengths and weaknesses and the demand of jobs and careers. The booklet contains three exercises, two of which can be repeated. The first exercise leads the student to examine his/her own preferences, aptitudes, or values--along particular dimensions independent of the student's  current job placement or work history. Subsequent exercises encourage the student to rate current or past jobs along the same dimensions, compare the two ratings, and enter the comparisons on a summary sheet. The dimensions included in the 200 questions which make up the basic exercises are personal values, job characteristics, job requirements, personal strengths and weaknesses, tolerance for various physical and other occupational circumstances, and reactions to attitudes of others. Detailed explanations for use of this guide are included. (KC)",

It is concerned with only one form of experiential learning--field experience or community-based education (internships, cooperative education programs, field trips, practicums). Chapter 1 is an introduction. Chapter 2 overviews the guide and introduces the actlon research model which is the basis for the implementation process. Chapter 3 discusses the rationale and nature of experiential learning. Attention is given to Kolb's four-phase experiential instructional system. Eight guidelines from the literature that are important to effective field experience instruction  are presented. As a guide for curriculum development, chapter 4 provides a profile of EbCE, a field experience/intership postsecondary program designed by the Appalachian Educational Laboratory (AEL). Chapter 5 outlines some existing program variations, reviews laws governing secondary and postsecondary school evaluation efforts, and describes agencies with oversight concerning quality control of educational processes and establishment of learning outcomes. Its major thrust is a learning measurement. Chapter 6 summarizes program scope and processes. Appendixes include a planning sheet for program implementation and descriptions of instructional materials in AEL's experience-based career education. (YLB)",

The following three instruments were administered to 265 high school juniors and seniors at five sites (Ames, Iowa; Bremen and Brunswick Georgia; and Syracuse and Ithaca, New York): (1) a student questionnaire designed to secure demographic data and student attitudes toward educational programs; (2) the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, which consists of 100 self-descriptive items; and (3) a self-concept instrument measuring student ability to deal with such factors as tension, confidence, peer groups, and opportunities to make judgments and explore various roles. Data revealed that EBCE students were more positive than control group students in their  attitudes toward their current school program. They considered their program superior for learning about career planning, job search skills, and specific job skills. Comparison and EBCE students did not manifest any significant differences in their responses on the latter two instruments. Designers of the project attribute this lack of difference between the experimental and comparison students to several factors, including the failure of at least one site to do any posttesting, a possible insensitivity of the instrumentation to self-concept changes occuring in EBCE students, and time limitations.

These were (1) Super's career development perspective, (2) Holland's typology of occupational choice, (3) status-attainment research in the field of sociology, (4) economic theory of individual willingness to work in different occupations, and (5) a model of decision making drawn from psychology. Although Super's work is highly eclectic, some of his key hypotheses lack strong empirical support. While national samples suggest that Holland's basic hypothesis regarding matches between personality and job type have merit, many of his secondary hypotheses remain weak. Status-attainment research is largely supported by data. However, its theoretical and conceptual bases are too simplified to render a realistic  picture of the process of occupational choice. Economic theory contributed important hypotheses neglected in other writings done to test these theories. Application of decision theory to occupational choice is the least thoroughly studied perspective on career choice. Because key concepts relating to the process of occupational choice are not clearly defined and because statistical procedures have not been used in research on career choice, a comprehensive theory resulting from the integration of these five perspectives is not close at hand.

(In the framework of this study burnout is defined as that state of non-productivity, non-motivation, and indifference which interferes with a worker's delivering services effectively.) Existing literature does not clearly discriminate the causes of this syndrome. However, similar behavior results when problems occur in any of three areas: (1) factors in the worker's personal life, (2) factors related to the nature of the work being carried out, and (3) factors related to the job conditions under which the work is carried out. Stressors in these three areas have independent origins but overlapping consequences. Examination of these stress source areas as  they relate to mental health service personnel suggested a number of strategies to alleviate the burnout syndrome by reducing stress and increasing coping skills. Once the sources of stress at a particular organization are uncovered, jobs can be redesigned and organizational strategies can be used to intervene. These strategies include shorter hours in direct client contact, rotating assignments, developing procedures for joint handling of problems, developing mechanisms for staff support, and providing inservice training for required work skills.

        "description":"This review describes materials (dated 1975 or later) that (1) could be used to teach conservation behaviors that could be implemented by workers in traditional occupations, and (2) address the needs of secondary and postsecondary vocational students with no previous technical training. This list was compiled as a result of a literature search whose purpose was to locate currently available energy use and conservation instructional materials; to determine how well these materials address conservation issues; and to identify the vocational areas in which energy conservation materials are lacking, insufficient, or inappropriate. The materials selected for this review stress on-the-job energy conservation practices in seven vocational education disciplines: agriculture, distributive  education, health, home economics, office, technical, and trades and industry. After explaining the search methodology and analyzing the findings, the report provides tables keying the literature described to the seven vocational education areas. The report then provides brief worker conservation behaviors and behaviors that would require few modifications for use with vocational students. An appendix lists bibliographles consulted. (KC)",

The General Accounting Office (GAO) found that most worksites provided adequate experiences. Others, however, had problems in development of good work habits, in supervision, and in monitoring and counseling. Also, many sponsors experienced operational problems. The Department of Labor and its contractor had to intervene frequently in program operations. This raised questions of whether the demonstration was a fair test of the guaranteed job concept and whether sponsors are capable of implementing complex programs. GAO recommends that, if the  Congress decides to expand the pilot projects or undertake a similar program, it do so gradually to allow sponsors time to develop the capacity to implement the program properly.

The module is intended for use by both the mental health practitioner or consumer advocate and the mentally disabled individual. One preliminary unit and seven activities, designed to be given in three to five two-hour sessions, are presented to enable the consumer to participate in the Individualized Service Plan (ISP) process. (The ISP is both a design for services as well as the mechanism linking persons who are mentally retarded with that combination of services which will enable them to live in the community with a progressively decreasing number of life-long services.) The seven activities require  students to read their plans; assess their needs; understand the steps of the process; voice their goals, needs, and strengths in a planning interview; learn to understand and use various forms and records; and learn the parts of and how to act at an ISP meeting. (Appendixes contain an overview of the ISP process and information on ISP meetings, client involvement, and the identification of needs areas. (MN)",

        "description":"A study was conducted among adults enrolled in adult basic education (ABE) General Educational Development (GED) courses to determine their perceptions of the impact of the ABE/GED programs on their employment/economic position, skill and knowledge acquisition, community involvement, attitudinal changes, personal relationships, and continuing education. After a review of the literature, a questionnaire was constructed and orally administered to 120 randomly selected ABE/GED students in three Maryland counties. The interviews were supplemented with group discussions, classroom observations, and case studies. Results of the research suggest that the major changes ascribed to participation were ln the affective domain. Participants reported improved self-concepts and increased  feelings of personal worth. They also reported significant improvement in skill areas such as reading, writing, computation, and consumer behavior. The most improved skill was mathematical ability. Involvement in community organizations also increased slightly, growing in relation to time in the program. Although no positive economic impact could be documented, many participants reported that they anticipated getting jobs, promotions, and so forth as a result of their involvement in the program. Many of the participants planned to continue in the program to earn their GED. (The authors note the study is limited by its interviews of current participants rather than of students who have completed the program, and its ability to measure only perceptlons of impact, rather than actual impact,  of ABE/GED on the participants.)

Musick, director of training for the Graniteville Company in South Carolina and president of the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD), focuses on how research can contribute to a better understanding of the vocational training process. He states that only by working together with the schools can industry hope to meet its needs for personnel trained to produce the goods and services of the future. Musick emphasizes the need for closer cooperation between industry and traditional in-school training programs as students move back and forth between the classroom and the work place. He notes the increasing age of the American workforce and discusses the implications of the age increase in regard to increased training needs, the need for  greater productivity, and increasing mechanization of the work place. In a question-and-answer session, Musick describes training programs carried out by the textile company for which he works, and focuses on training research provided by the ASTD. (KC)",

        "description":"Women are at a disadvantage under both Social Security and private employee pension plans because the retirement systems were set up at a time when most women were non-working spouses of employed men, a condition that no longer exists. Today women workers, divorcees, and widows of retirees often find themselves with inadequate retirement benefits because they have intermittent work histories due to being out of the labor force for years to bear and rear children and perform homemaking tasks. In some cases, women who have worked may receive less retirement income than wives of single-earner couples even though both couples have the same average monthly incomes. Other problems include those of divorced women who cannot collect pensions from their former husbands' retirement plans,  low pensions because of women's generally lower wages, and loss of benefits by widows whose husbands did not take reduced pensions in order to provide survivor benefits. Proposals to reform Social Security include earning sharing, a double-decker system, inheritance of earnings credits, homemaker credits, and child care drop-out years. Proposals to change employee pension plans include options to increase survivor protection, earnings sharing of pensions for divorced spouses, and changes in employee pension plan provisions to provide commensurate pension benefits to short-service and low-wage workers or those who have interrupted careers or partial attachment to the labor force.

There is still reason to believe that these dire predictions will not come true, however; there is reason to be optimistic about the future of the American education system if educators will face the challenges in a realistic way. This means setting priorities and determining what the school system can and cannot be expected to accomplish. This also means preparing for a shift in emphasis from serving a primarily teenage population to serving an increasingly older population. It means finding ways to involve a population in which only 25 percent of the people will have children in the schools in promoting the welfare of the  schools. We need to find effective and efficient ways to train adults for changing occupational needs. Budget cutbacks will require greater attention to accountability as taxpayers demand the maximum benefit for the dollars they spend on education. (KC)",

It also dealt with alternative paths taken by rejected applicants, focusing on those who made additional attempts to enter nursing programs. Drawing from institutional data and personal interviews of nursing school administrators conducted during the first stage of the study, most data for this phase was gathered by questionnaires answered by 2,400 applicants to nursing education programs. Results showed differences in family responsibilities, academic achievement, and work experience for applicants who had been rejected and those who  had been accepted. At the conclusion of the study, the following recommendations were made: (1) financial aid should be made available to students, particularly first-year students with family responsibilities; (2) funds should be made available for tutorial/remedial programs to assist students having academic difficulty; (3) studies should be made of the geographic distribution of schools of nursing by type of program (baccalaureate, associate degree, diploma); and (4) nursing school policies should encourage students to make multiple applications (to several schools).

A study of the program for the period September 1, 1978, through August 31, 1979, showed evolving relationships between the prime sponsors and the educational system and between the prime sponsors and the private sector, and growing experience in dealing with school drop-outs. Several new activities were launched during this period, including a private sector wage subsidy  variation experiment; an effort to provide educational resources; and a modest expansion in several sites. During this period, large numbers of youths were employed and attending school, the share of private sector worksites was growing, and youths were remaining in the program for fairly long periods of time. However, while substantial improvements in administration were noted, the program model continued to pose a challenge, and the effects of the rapid start-up were still apparent at some sites. In a few cases, sites experienced persistent operational problems. (KC)",

The evaluation was based on data collected in interviews with 2,830 persons--1,419 of whom were offered supported work jobs, and 1,400 of whom were members of a randomly-selected control group at twenty-one sites--and provides information on the employment and earnings, welfare receipt, drug use, and criminal activities of both groups during an eighteen-month period after their enrollment in the sample. The evaluation suggests that supported work has succeeded in achieving many of its primary short-term objectives. During the early months after  enrollment, the employment and economic status of the experimentals in all four target groups improved substantially compared to that of the control groups. This was accompanied by significant reductions in welfare benefits. During the brief post-program period (months 16-18), however, the results are more ambiguous and vary between sites and target groups. (Evaluators caution that survey results are preliminary, limited by a small sample, and may have been influenced by rising employment opportunities nationwide and the existence of a special unemployment compensation program.)

The program was started in January, 1978, and enrolled more than 59,000 youths in 17 communities across the country by November, 1979. A study was conducted to assess the quality of the work setting created for the Entitlement participants, and, incidentally, to define a &quot;quality work experience&quot; for possible application to future programs. The study involved field visits by experienced assessors to a random sample of 520 worksites. Data were collected on job  content, participant-to-supervisor ratios, presence of work sponsor job performance standards, and characterstics of the work process. Finally, assessments of the value and quality of the jobs from the perspectives of three parties--the youths, their work sponsors, and independent field assessors, were recorded. Analysis of the data showed that about 85-90 percent of worksites were adequate or better; and that only a very small proportion of worksites involved &quot;make-work,&quot; while a very large proportion provided &quot;meaningful&quot; work that might lead to future employment opportunities, that kept youths busy, that was valuable to the sponsors, and that satisfied the youths. A slower start-up of the project and more careful worksite monitoring may likely have reduced the incidence of inadequate  worksites in the demonstration. (KC)",

Evidence is presented to suggest that a wide range of events cue clients' perceptions of counselor expertise, attractiveness, and trustworthiness. Results from studies are also presented which found that when sources of counselor expertness are combined, the counselor's ability to influence a client's opinion is increased.

Problems can occur in both interviews and interpersonal relationships because of bias, which originates from background characteristics, psychological factors, and behavioral factors pertaining to both parties. To learn more about how bias toward behavioral characteristics and background characteristics of job applicants can influence selection decisions, three hypotheses were tested: (1) applicants who spoke little during an interview would be viewed less favorably; (2) evaluations of black applicants by white interviewers would be less favorable than those of white  applicants; and (3) interviewer evaluations would be a function of the combined effects of vocal activity and race of the applicants. Each hypothesis was confirmed. The results suggest that, under experimental conditions, applicant behaviors (vocal activity) are more important than applicant characteristics (race), but that race remains an important variable in interviewer evaluations.

        "description":"This paper presents the views of the New Zealand Counselling and Guidance Association regarding the need for changes in the system of selecting individuals for training as school counselors in New Zealand. A number of options are offered for improving the mechanics of selection, recommending selection criteria, and suggesting procedures for differentiating applicants on the basis of such criteria. Options for improving selection include: (1) placing practicing counselors and university training staff on existing selection panels; (2) standardizing selection procedures; and (3) selecting people for training by means of a national or regional panel. Selection criteria are based on the applicant's motivation to learn, ability to work well with colleagues, and personal qualities,  such as open-mindedness and self-acceptance. Procedures for differentiating applicants consist of: (1) writing or tape-recording responses to statements by students; (2) role-playing a counseling session; (3) writing a short paper on a topic relevant to school counseling; (4) leading a student discussion group and then analyzing the performance; and (5) undergoing a series of personal interviews with selection panel members.

The research reviewed consists primarily of investigations of the following issues: (1) the problems students experience and present to counseling centers; (2) student usage of counseling centers; (3) the functions and services of counseling centers; and (4) the theoretical problems defining and describing the roles of counseling centers. Parallels between the changing roles of counseling centers and concomitant changes in the field of counseling psychology are drawn. The literature review is divided into three time periods (1932-55, 1955-70, and 1970-80), which reflect major changes in the roles of  counseling centers. The final section identifies patterns in the research and discusses implications. (Author/CS)",

        "description":"Many research efforts have focused on the effect of client and counselor sex on the process and outcome of counseling. It was hypothesized that same-sex counselor-client dyads would develop a more open, empathic relationship than would opposite-sex dyads, and that this would be reflected in the number of sessions the counseling dyad spent together. The relationship between client attendance at the first counseling session and sex of the assigned counselor was also investigated. Client subjects were students who sought personal counseling. Preliminary findings did not support the hypothesis. Significant differences in number of counseling sessions between same-sex and opposite-sex counseling dyads were not found; the amount of time the dyad worked together depended more on the  type of problem presented by the client than on the sex-pairing of counselor and client. The results support previous findings that neither same- nor opposite-sex pairing is a predictor of counseling process or outcome. No relationship was found between the sex of the counselor and attendance at the first counseling session. These preliminary results suggest that same- or opposite-sex pairings have no appreciable effect on the counseling process as measured by number of sessions. (Author/CS)",

        "description":"Many research efforts have demonstrated relationships between the experience of mental health volunteers and their attitudes toward mental illness. Questionnaire surveys were completed by adult volunteers in psychiatric and nonpsychiatric programs in order to assess general attitudes toward mental patients and to control for the potential effects of volunteerism on the attitudes of mental health volunteers. Results indicated that adult mental health volunteers in psychiatric programs had more positive attitudes toward mental illness than volunteers in nonpsychiatric programs. These results are consistent with the findings of studies with college students, suggesting that those who volunteer to work with psychiatric patients perceive the mentally ill to be \"childlike unfortunates\"  who should be treated with a minimum of restrictive measures. Such positive attitudes do not appear to be artifacts of volunteerism, nor are they exclusive to college student volunteers. Thus, the widely held belief that mental health attitudes and mental health volunteerism are closely related is given empirical support. (Author/CS)",

Anecdotes from 116 victims identified 5 types of sexual harassment: (1) sexist remarks or behavior; (2) inappropriate and offensive, but sanction-free sexual advances; (2) solicitation of sexual activity by promise of rewards; (4) coercion of sexual activity by threat of punishment; and (5) sexual crimes and misdemeanors. Information from students in postsecondary institutions who have been harassed by faculty, staff, or other employees  reveals that few colleges and universities are dealing with the problem and that students are coping privately with harassment. The Council recommends that schools publicly state their policy on the prohibition of sexual harassment, avenues of complaint, and sanctions for incidents, and suggests that the federal government make sexual harassment an act of discrimination under Title IX.

Recent network developments provide useful suggestions for support systems research in the analyses of social ties and social networks, and the implications of large-scale social structure for small-scale support systems. Most support systems studies consider a single social network and define all social ties as supportive, disregarding variations in the content, breadth, symmetry and use of such ties. The network analytic approach employs a differentiated analysis of both ties and networks in support systems research. Much of support systems literature analyzes the network in isolation. There is, thus, a need for the incorporation of  power and dependency relations into support systems studies; the implications of large-scale division of labor for the flows of network resources must be considered.

Descriptions were reduced to three parent factors (Generous, Lost, and Masculine) and four child factors (Troubled, Responsible, Selfish, and Warm). The older generation used the factor, &quot;Lost,&quot; less often than their children in describing the story parent; &quot;Lost&quot; was used more often to describe a mother than a father. The story child was described as more troubled, more responsible, less selfish, and less warm by the older generation than by their own children. Although the results  were unclear as to whether generational differences were due to age, parenting, or cohort group differences, the data suggest that individuals over age 35 had a less conventional view of parents and children. The older generation showed signs of greater tolerance and more capacity for ambiguity. (NRB)",

Prior to their assumption of full adult roles, students could adopt an \"energy ethic\" having a lasting impact on society. Based on these beliefs, a multi-phase research effort was undertaken, including instructional intervention and attitude surveys, to determine the effects on youth of energy education. The data suggest that energy-conservation instruction has a significant effect on the attitudes and behaviors of high school students. Females were more positive toward conservation than males; older students and those with higher grade-point averages also had more positive attitudes. Further experimental research  is needed to demonstrate the causal connection between education and energy-conservation attitudes and behaviors and to examine ways in which teenagers influence home energy-consumption patterns.

The Vandenberg revision of the Shepard-Metzlar mental rotation test was administered to 206 college students. The test consisted of 20 criterion figures, each followed by two correct and two incorrect alternative figures. The correct alternatives were identical to the criterion sample but were presented in a rotated position. Immediately after finishing the rotation test, subjects answered a questionnaire designed to assess their perceived cognitive strategy used in solving the spatial task. Ocular dominance, handedness, and familial handedness were also assessed by questionnaire. The superior performance of males on the mental rotation  test was highly significant (p=.0001). The most common strategy employed by both sexes in solving the spatial task was mental picturing; however, females used significantly more verbal strategies than males. Handedness, per se, was unrelated to spatial performance, but right handed females with familial sinistrality had lower spatial scores than those with no familial sinistrality. More females than males were found to be left eye dominant; left eye dominance in females, but not in males, was associated with lower spatial scores. (Author/RL)",

Presentation of the  utilization model is planned for three sessions: Session I examines the test results and identifies present needs; Session II deals with curriculum and instructional planning; and Session III is devoted to decision making and setting goals.

        "description":"Through consideration of a conceptual framework, this paper proposes that a comprehensive evaluation can be made that accounts for a project's ability to accomplish social change. The concepts are: (1) ideological development--permits the evaluator to predict the probability of the ultimate change a project can accomplish based on the change agents' consideration of social justice; (2) legacy of change--permits evaluators to determine the potential for continued change after a project's funding ends; (3) comparability--contrasts one project with another to determine the relative merit of each; and (4) social efficacy--includes the determination of the effect of a project and the use of resources used by the project. This framework provides a better standard of judgment than can  be made from a single evaluation methodology, because the concepts are not discrete; consideration of each provides a triangulation of data and perspectives to evaluate outcomes of social intervention. A major benefit of this framework is that it offers a procedure for considering effects of social change projects that incorporates multiple perspectives in the analysis. Also considered, however, are which social elements must be changed to effect social change ultimately. (Author/GK)",

High school seniors received 34 tests including 12 measures of FDI. Analysis of the data using multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, and factor analysis resulted in five dimensions including two associated with the FDI measures. One of the FDI dimensions measured cognitive restructuring which involved unfamiliar geometric shapes (e.g., Find a Shape Puzzle, Raven Progressive Matrices) and generation of novel representations of the material (e.g., Paper Folding, Paper  Form Block, Block Design). The other FDI dimension, related to perception of the upright, was labeled familiar field and was postulated to measure strategy selection in familiar situations. (Author/RL)",

This survey ascertains teacher preparation and knowledge in testing, teacher assessment of the importance of testing to teaching, and teacher attitudes toward various testing issues. Findings indicate that teachers seem to be generally supportive of standardized tests, and understand the need for quality standards in education. Specifically, it was found that teachers want useful information in three areas: (1) diagnosing individual student needs; (2) planning instructional activities and programs, and (3) placing and grouping students. Results of  the survey support the notion of testing an an integral part of instructional programs. Teachers appear to be somewhat supportive of minimum competency testing, but see many serious flaws in most current programs in this area. (Author/GK)",

Objectives and test items correspond to content taught in grades 1-8, but there are no specific levels. All pilot test levels include items covering reading and mathematics. The lower level skills are divided into levels one and two of the pilot test. The upper level skills are divided into three levels; in levels three through five, all items in the upper  level skill survey are included. Objectives and subtests covered include: phonetic analysis, structural analysis; vocabulary building, reading comprehension, math computation, and math application. The difficulty of the five levels increase within each subtest area. The pilot study included 1658 students; generally a favorable response to the pilot test was indicated.

Relationships of these three indices to student background characteristics and measures of anxiety are of special interest in this first data set.

The enrollment for the course is typically heterogeneous: students may be majors or non-majors, any one section may contain honors college students and disadvantaged learners, and students may be of differing class levels. The advantage is that test scores can be standardized without legislating a common examination for all sections. Unique findings of this study were: (1) the computer file containing serial positions of items on examinations proved extremely useful; (2) obvious violations of unidimensionality and asking questions based on trivial, unevenly taught information led to items  which did not fit the model well; (3) less stability in the equating procedure may result when large differences occur in an examination system; (4) more than one training session for instructors is recommended; and (5) latent trait models can work in a large, multi-section course examination which surveys a variety of ostensively different topics.

These include: case studies, content analysis, use of a focused survey, and concept analysis. Each strategy addresses an issue particular to experiential education. Case studies allow data collection on a large number of variables related to an individual learner, and are useful in describing the diversity of a program's treatment in assessing individualized student outcomes. Content analysis involves the systematic classification and analysis of existing documentation. This methodology is also useful in experiential education research because it is unobtrusive. A focused survey is a questionnaire based on a theoretical framework that explores people's  attitudes and experiences related to one or a few constructs. Concept analysis clarifies abstract concepts, determines their meanings, and identifies how concepts work during thought processes. Also included in the paper is an explanation of the proposed essential elements within nine dimensions of experiential education. The dimensions are as follows: purpose, setting, participants' characteristics, learning strategies, student roles, instructor roles, outcomes of learning activities, management and support factors, and program outcomes.

The new Uniform Methodology (UM) measure could be implemented in two stages. In the first stage, four changes to the UM measure would be introduced. None of these changes would require the collection or analysis of additional data; they should be introduced as a package. In the second stage, the UM should be made more comprehensive by expanding the list of assets included in the resource base. The values of many of these assets will have to be estimated by  calculating the discounted present value of current and projected future income from each asset. In addition, the allowances against income--living, tax, retirement--should be converted to a negative asset value by calculating the discounted present value of current and projected future allowances. Only after both stages have been implemented will the annuity income approach be complete, internally consistent, and equitable. (Author/RL)",

The method was applied to the Communication Activities Skills Project (CASP) for grades 3-12. Writing samples were collected before and after the Project from experimental and control groups, using a stimulus question. Three or four teachers rated each sample, after three days of holistic evaluation training. To eliminate possible bias, raters were not aware of the research group origin of the sample, and scoring was anonymous. Reliability coefficients were measured for: the pre-Project and post-Project samples, the difference between  them, and choice of best sample. Coefficients ranged from .62 to .95; most were above .75. Results on the relative performance of control and experimental groups conflicted, depending on the method of comparison: analysis of variance vs proportion. Detailed information concerning the holistic method and the rating categories is appended. (GK)",

        "description":"To assess the potential user population for Project TALENT data and to identify barriers to usage of the data for secondary analysis, a small telephone survey of leading large-scale survey researchers was undertaken. The survey was designed to elicit suggestions for strategies for reducing barriers to use of the data. Four levels of barrier were considered: unawareness of the existence of the data base, negative attitudes about secondary analysis, specific difficulties or deficiencies of the data base, and cost of data processing. In the case of Project TALENT, most researchers were aware of its existence, but not of the scope of information contained in the data base; half expressed negative feelings about secondary analysis in general. Most respondents felt that useful data  were present and expressed interest in future use. For established researchers, costs at the level required for use of Project TALENT data were not perceived as a barrier. Recommendations obtained from the respondents for improving usage matched the steps taken by the TALENT staff, although some areas were identified where additional effort was needed. (Author/GK)",

Measures of trait anxiety, state anxiety and achievement were obtained on a sample of undergraduate students; the A-Trait and A-State scales of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were used. Half of the students received additional humorous items in the achievement test. The purpose of the study was to examine the assumption that the introduction of humor into the academic test situation would facilitate achievement test performance for highly anxious students. Results of the study did not support this thesis; this finding conflicts with two previous investigations of the interaction of humor and anxiety in test performance. The major difference between the studies involves the method of humor presentation. The  inclusion of humorous items as a pedagogical device may, however, be detrimental to high anxiety students, who displayed lower achievement than the low anxiety students on the humorous version of the test.

        "description":"Attention is drawn to the ways in which current conceptions of intelligence and its measurement differ from those which were generally accepted in 1928. The following principles underlying intelligence testing were generally agreed upon in 1928: (1) the assumption of intelligence as a recognizable attribute, responsible for differences among children and adults in learning, reasoning, and other cognitive capacities; (2) the principle that sampling appropriate mental tasks and norming scores against distribution in the population yields IQs acceptable as quantitative measures of level of intelligence; and (3) essentially innate and genetically determined, intelligence develops with age, regardless of the environment. These statements are contrasted to 1978 thinking, and the  following common criticisms of intelligence testing are highlighted: most item types are developed haphazardly without clear rationale; group tests are often given by untrained lay people under poorly controlled conditions; test results depend on practice and motivation; the tests are unreliable, and, the public feels threatened by tests. The remainder of the paper is a look at recent investigations supporting genetic/environmental factors on intellectual growth. (GK)",

Implications for the redirection of evaluation practice are considered. Specifically, Part I of the report distinguishes between the different types of concepts and the data associated with them. One conclusion is that the initial understanding of a phenomenon must be through qualitative concepts, and from them quantitative concepts may evolve. Part II examines various ways in which numbers are assigned; concluding that neither assignment nor measurement is synonymous with  quantification. Part III examines the history of both the qualitative and quantitative in the physical sciences, and the implications for evaluation. The main idea of Part III is that much qualitative work has been prerequisite to fruitful quantification in the physical sciences. Because evaluation draws on the social sciences, which are in early developmental stages, quantification in evaluation may not be as fruitful as qualitative methodology. (Author/GK)",

The two-factor solution, closely approximating Wechsler's a priori grouping into Verbal and Performance scales, was retained at each age level as the most psychologically and psychometrically sound solution to describe the 11 WPPSI subtests. Calculation of the coefficients of congruence confirmed the stability of the factor structure across all age levels.

Additional data provide a comparison of the attitudes of these groups with those predicted or expected of them by members of the National Council on Measurement in Education.

Overall, it is concluded that both students and teachers view standardized tests as one component of the ongoing instructional program--sometimes useful, sometimes not. They view test results with limited respect and healthy skepticism. A related conclusion is that measurement specialists generally do not have a good understanding of the opinions about  standardized testing held by the users of such instruments.

The role and importance of each form is addressed, as are alternate approaches to providing such explanation. The concept of explanation is defined as anything said or done to help someone understand something. The classification of explanation is based on a distinction between types and methods. Methods are identified and defined: descriptive, narrative, genetic, experimental, and theoretical. Two of these types of explanation--action and value explanation--have generally been neglected in evaluation. Causal explanation has been interpreted in a narrow fashion, and causal claims not satisfying its requirements have been regarded as unsound.  Action and value explanations have objective significance which is capable of being spelled out empirically, and they are therefore susceptible to public testing. It is concluded that, in spite of imperfect circumstances, there are ways of responsibly arriving at intellectually and morally sound explanations; although the available means are demanding on the judgment and conscience of the evaluator.

It assesses how homogeneous the weighted original item responses are, when they are scored for pattern congruity. Four data sets generated to simulate different sample sizes, numbers of variables, numbers of variables per factor, and proportions of randomly generated error, were analyzed with alpha factor analysis followed by rotation to the varimax criterion. Subsequently, both types of consistency estimates were calculated. Results indicate that the two indices are sensitive to different data characteristics. The alpha coefficients are  primarily sensitive to the variance each factor explains, as reflected by the number and magnitude of the salient pattern coefficients associated with each factor.

A new index, K*, is proposed as a modification of m; it is a means of invalidating the three-parameter logistic model for the multiple choice item. Shiba's research on the measurement of vocabulary, which is based upon latent trait theory, is introduced; this includes an eventual tailored test on vocabulary, utilizing information obtained from distractors as well as correct answers.

Results showed that the teachers and students accepted future world perspective values, but students to a lesser degree than teachers. There was a significant difference between  scale scores of the teachers and students. Further analysis of responses revealed that teachers and students are generally supportive of selective economic growth, international cooperation and world economic equity values.

The program was originally designed following the mentoring model current in social science and feminist literature in the mid-1970s. With experience, however, the program co-directors found that the mentor relationship did not allow for the mutual teaching and learning essential in a new field and that the relationship too often simply replicated the hierarchy characteristic of the traditional and patriarchal research university. Proposed in its place is a program modeled on the collective work and cooperative ideals of feminist theory. (Author/GK)",

The factors of reward experience, socioeconomic status (SES), and sex are examined while testing conflicting predictions of the hypothesis and reinforcement theory. Children from grade 1 at two public elementary schools worked on a counting task. Half of the children attended a school which had a 100% minority enrollment (low SES), and half attended a school which had a 95% Caucasian enrollment (middle SES). A Baseline 1, treatment session, Baseline 2 paradigm was used to assess the effects of both reward introduction and withdrawal. Reward experience (group), SES, and sex were manipulated in a 3 x 2 x 2 design. Subjects who earned a reward during the  treatment session for maintaining Baseline 1 output levels, significantly outperformed never-rewarded controls during Baseline 2. Control subjects initially highest on motivation measures declined significantly from Baseline 1 to Baseline 2; comparable subjects in the reward groups showed no change. In addition, reward-group subjects that were initially lowest in motivation significantly increased their output and time on task across sessions. (Author/RL)",

The author presents case studies of two moderately successful magnet schools, the Martin Luther King Middle School in Boston and the Clifton Multi-Age Magnet School in Cincinnati. He then discusses magnet schools in the context of desegregation and illustrates the way in which the courts have been using magnet schools for desegregation purposes. In the third section the author discusses the educational dimension of magnet schools, somewhat apart from their desegregation impact. The author then reviews the roles of State and Federal governments in supporting magnet education. The booklet is concluded with a discussion of the pros and cons of metropolitan magnet schools and  recommendations for magnet school programs. (Author/MK)",

        "description":"As part of an effort to investigate the cultural characteristics of Cuban Americans and to develop culturally appropriate mental health treatment models for this population, a study of Cuban/Anglo American adolescent value differences was conducted. To study cultural variables, a Value Orientations Scale was developed based on the work of Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck. Four factorially derived subscales were obtained. When Cuban immigrant and Anglo American adolescents were compared, the Cubans tended to prefer lineality, subjugation to nature, present time, and not to endorse idealized humanistic values. The Americans tended to prefer individuality, mastery over nature, future time, and to endorse idealized humanistic values. The implication of the findings is that a psychosocial  treatment model that would be sensitive to the cultural characteristics of Cuban immigrants must validate this population's preference for a lineal style of relationships.

The study reviewed was aimed at (1) investigating the effectiveness of &quot;Ecological Family Systems Therapy,&quot; an approach created by the Spanish Family Guidance Clinic in Miami, Florida, and (2) identifying the relevant variables of treatment intervention contributing to treatment effectiveness. Presented are four case studies of drug and/or alcohol abusers in which four different models were utilized: intramural individual, individual ecological, family intramural, and family ecological. It is suggested, based on preliminary findings, that (1) family ecological models are most effective in attracting, maintaining, and rehabilitating poorly  acculturated families; (2) family models are most effective in the treatment of marital dysfunctions and in cases in which the symptomatic behavior is found in a young family member; and (3) individual models are effective in promoting personal growth and development in the identified patient, but are not very effective in repairing marital dysfunctions. It is also suggested that combined (alcohol, drug, and mental health) treatment centers most effectively address the problems of Cuban immigrants. (Author/GC)",

The study reported in this paper researched the premise that, in a bicultural setting, biculturalism leads to adjustment while monoculturalism causes maladjustment. A Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire and a scale relating cultural involvement to behavioral adjustment in the classroom were developed and administered to Hispanic American (Cuban and non Cuban) high school students. Both scales were found to be reliable and valid for Cuban Americans, but less so for non Cuban Hispanic Americans. Bicultural subjects were found to be better  adjusted than monocultural subjects. It is recommended on the basis of the study that school counselors confronted with immigrant youngsters living in a bicultural community be able to facilitate an effective bicultural adjustment.

Clinical variables, such as intergenerational conflict in Cuban families, are also discussed as they affect the acculturation of adolescent children. It is speculated that in families in which adolescent males exhibit an accelerated rate of acculturation, the adolescents may be presenting an acting out psychological profile. (Author/GC)",

Nichols decision, this paper reviews Federal policy regarding bilingual education, discusses the current sociopolitical context of bilingual education, discusses evaluations of bilingual programming done to date, and examines the implications of these factors for schools and classrooms at the local level. Some of the features that distinguish present bilingual education policy from policies adopted in regard to earlier immigrant populations are outlined. Political problems faced by bilingual education since &quot;Lau&quot; are identified as (1) loss of local autonomy, (2) conflict between the legislative and executive branches of government (3) inconsistencies in the guidelines for legal compliance between 1970 and 1974, (4)  funding, and (5) reliance on Title VII funds, which perpetuates a deficit (rather than a cultural difference) model of bilingual education. Several recent evaluation studies of bilinigual education programs are reviewed and critical issues common to these evaluations are discussed in terms of their implications for future programs. Finally, a composite model for an exemplary bilingual program is described, based upon what has been learned from previous evaluations. (Author/GC)",

Recognizing the central role that families play in the lives of children, neighborhoods are examined as important environments for both families and their children. Unique characteristics of urban environments and the special ways in which their multiple levels and interacting systems pose risks and opportunities for child development are then discussed. New York, NY 10027 Data from a study on people's perceptions of &quot;high risk&quot; versus &quot;low risk&quot; urban neighborhoods are reviewed,  showing that despite demographic similarities, the high and low risk neighborhoods varied significantly in terms of social stresses and supports, adequacy of child care, and residents' attitudes toward the neighborhood. Finally, the school is hailed as an institution that, with proper moral, political, and economic resources can protect environmentally-at-risk children, increase their opportunities, compensate for weaknesses in families and neighborhoods, and influence public policy related to children.

        "description":"There is a widely shared belief that Asian Americans have overcome the bondage of racial discrimination to become a successful model minority. In this essay, the empirical basis of this success contention is examined against its historical background and the remifications of the belief are explored. First, the ascendance of the Asian American success theme in the late 1960s is traced. The portrayal of Asian Americans as a hardworking, successful group is contrasted to popular racist beliefs held about blacks. Second, recent research on Asian Americans is examined. It is argued that available evidence does not warrant the image of this group's success because typical indicators of success, such as education and income, have not been properly adjusted for extraneous factors.  Finally, several consequences of the success myth are identified. It is held that: (1) Asian Americans, particularly the young people, resent the success contention as a device of political exploitation; (2) a pattern of occupational segregation for Asian Americans limits occupational aspiration and choices of Asian American youth; and (3) Asian Americans experience a sense of lost identity and attribute this feeling to the pressures of assimilation and to their ancestors' concern for survival.

Data collection methods included source identification and review; interviews with theoreticians, scholars, and administrators; and coordination of information on illegal immigration impact with ongoing research and current events. Data revealed that although little hard data exists on this impact and its interpretation is often contradictory, there is indirect evidence of such impact. Minority youth and illegal immigrant ages, skills, characteristics, geographic concentrations, and areas of employment are similar. However, there is evidence of dual labor markets for both groups within industries. Data on non-Mexican illegal  immigrants in the urban North and East is particularly weak. Although youth labor force projections for 1985 indicate that youth population and youth unemployment will decline, racial minority youth population and unemployment will not similarly decline. Research is needed to clarify impacts of illegal aliens on racial minority youth, including analysis of residential survey data, case study of impacted industries and services, statistical studies, and futuristic policy oriented studies of the impact of alien immigration on youth employment.

A Goal Framework Model, which is provided, defines the problem areas as attributes (dimensions of meaning) and indicators (descriptions of possible needs). Section 4 deals with conducting the actual needs assessment using the goal framework. The three basic steps described are ranking problem areas, rank ordering needs, and integrating procedures. Exhibits include an instrument for problem area ranking and examples of (1) data processing (for ranking), (2) determining urgency of need, and (3) integrating results of problem area ranking and urgency of needs ranking.

The councils, each autonomous, are loosely organized and funded under the Department of Labor's Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects Act (YEDPA). Since they work outside the traditional structure of both education and employment institutions, the councils can be a source of help to Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) prime sponsors in finding ways to work with other sectors of the community. Although work and education councils are concerned with bringing about more productive integration of education and work throughout an individual's lifetime, they  focus heavily on smoothing the school-to-work transition for youths. The communities taking part in the Work-Education Consortium Project sponsor such programs as creating career development clearinghouses, developing directories to community resources, starting networks of volunteers for career exploration programs, generating support for high school work experience opportunities, staffing placement services, and surveying employer projections for young workers. A list of communities involved in the consortium and highlights of their projects is included in this report. (KC)",

        "description":"In response to the need for realistic materials for training inservice and/or preservice teachers in classroom discipline, seventy-nine first-year vocational education teachers in public secondary schools in Florida were studied. The purpose of the study was to identify critical and frequent discipline incidents and the appropriate alternatives for handling them; to identify discipline problems which should be included in preservice and/or inservice education; and to compare the solutions used by the teachers with the solutions proposed by experts in the field. Data were collected by means of a critical incident form derived from McFadden's Model, then screened by two panels of experts. The study found that (1) there was a discrepancy between what the first-year teachers did to  resolve discipline problems and what experts felt \"ought to be done,\" with the teachers more likely to use short-term solutions; (2) the two panels of experts disagreed on \"effective\" solutions for a given critical incident; (3) obtaining specific solutions to specific discipline problems was not feasible; (4) first-year teachers have needs for training in handling discipline problems that have not been met by preservice or inservice education; (5) student placement and the laboratory setting were factors in discipline problems; and (6) students' disruptive personal habits were most often perceived as causes of critical discipline incidents.

        "description":"As an alternative for or adjunct to paper-and-pencil tests for predicting personnel performance, the United States Air Force studied the use of peer ratings as an evaluative tool. Purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of peer ratings among Air Force basic trainees. Peer ratings were obtained from more than 27,000 basic trainees. An effective method was developed for scoring them by algebraically summing the positive and negative ratings. A modification of the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula was used to determine interrater reliability coefficients which were adjusted to the mean number of trainees in the flights. The peer ratings yielded uniformly high interrater reliability coefficients which indicated substantial agreement among raters. It was  concluded that the method developed for norming peer ratings from different size groups was valuable and could be applied to standardize future peer ratings. Peer ratings thus show promise for performance appraisal when normed using this method. References and extensive norm tables for personnel characteristics such as effort, cooperation, people orientation, emotional stability, intelligence, calmness, physical strength and energy, and likelihood of success are included.

        "description":"A study designed to develop a selection model for the prediction of Signalman performance in sending and receiving Morse code and to evaluate training strategies was conducted with 180 Navy and Coast Guard enlisted men. Trainees were taught to send Morse code using innovative training materials (mnemonics and guided practice). High and average aptitude groups were compared on code learning and performance factors in relationship to traditional vs. innovative materials. The Armed Services Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) and nonverbal tests (Visual Pattern Discrimination--VPD--and Visual Reaction Time--VRT) were used to predict performance. Mnemonics and guided practice proved superior to traditional training materials for learning Morse code, but the type of training materials had no  significant effect on ability to send and receive messages. The ASVAB tests were good predictors for high aptitude individuals, while the VPD proved the best predictor for the lowest quartile. As a result of the study, the following training model was proposed: (1) VPD as well as other tests for screening low and average aptitude applicants; (2) self-paced instruction; (3) VPD exercise used as orientation for code reception; (4) examination of validity of course entry requirements.

        "description":"Two studies examined modifiability in intellectual functioning in older adults. The fluid-crystallized theory provided a theory base for the research. (Fluid intelligence follows a normative decline through adulthood, while crystallized intelligence remains stable or even increases.) In the first study thirty subjects (average age 69.2) participated in eight practice (retest) sessions, at which they were administered two tests involving figural relations and induction. Although no external feedback was given during retest sessions, subjects exhibited steady gains between consecutive trials. In the second study fifty-eight subjects (average age fifty-nine) participated in five training sessions on strategies for solving figural relations-type problems. Maintenance of training  effects over three posttest periods and generalizability of training across seven measures were used to assess the training. Mean scores for the training group were larger than the control's scores for all seven measures at each posttest occasion. Findings that subjects possessed or were able to generate cognitive strategies useful in improving their fluid intellectual performance and that training effects extended beyond the target ability imply the potential for modifiability in intellectual functioning in middle and later adulthood and suggest that comprehensive theories of intelligence including both potential and normative dimensions of functioning may be particularly important in adulthood.

        "description":"This book contains fifty-three case studies covering a wide variety of private-sector activities and public-private partnerships designed to increase training and employment opportunities for the hard-to-employ and speed the transition of the unemployed from government support and subsidized jobs to permanent private employment. Compiled from a survey of more than eighty trustee companies of the Committee for Economic Development, many of the studies are concerned with special efforts to provide better job preparation, placement, and skill training for severely disadvantaged persons, including those who are undereducated, unskilled, and subject to discrimination or other special handicaps. However, the activities described in the cases are not limited to the disadvantaged; they  also include efforts to bring about an improved transition from education to work; more productive use of midcareer and older workers, including steps to smooth the transition from work to retirement; wider reliance on part-time work and other alternative work patterns to make more employment available to youths, homemakers, and older persons; and business use of alternatives to outright layoffs in recessions. Case studies are grouped by purpose or population focus, and an overview of each group is included. (KC)",

They represent a thorough and detailed study of the problems faced by prime sponsors in the initial years of CETA. The first report, CETA in Eastern Massachusetts, covers Cambridge, Lowell, New Bedford, and the Massachusetts balance of state prime sponsors. Chapter l concerns CETA in general and in Massachusetts; Chapter 2 gives the methodology of the study. Chapter 3 discusses the administration of CETA with emphasis on the organizational factors. Chapter 4 deals with the generalizations and lessons learned on the process of implementation of CETA. Chapter 5 presents  numerical and qualitative impact and client information gathered from pre-CETA records and post-CETA performance and monitoring information. Chapter 6 summarizes in detail findings and recommendations emerging from the entire study. The second report, The Implementation of CETA in Boston, 1974-77, is a case study of the introduction of CETA in Boston. Following an introductory chapter, Chapter 2 discusses the transition period--the decentralization and decategorization of employment and training programs. Chapter 3 focuses on CETA functioning in Boston through community-based agencies, including changes, new programs, and problems with funds. Public Service Employment is the focus of Chapter 4. Chapters 5 and 6 summarize findings and conclusions and list recommendations based on  observations in Boston. (YLB)",

Main content is divided into two focuses: (1) theoretical interpretations of the differential equations which embody the mathematical model and (2) reporting and discussion of the results of preliminary data analyses. Following an introduction (chapter 1), chapter 2 presents several interpretations of the differential equations. It reviews and relates the status-attainment and differential equation models. Chapter 3 describes sampling procedures, methods of data collection, and data coding; gives operational definitions for all variables used in the report; and discusses analytic methods. Chapter 4 contains numerical estimates of the  fundamental parameters of the differential-equation model. It presents the specific form of the model used to generate the data and then discusses empirical results for white males and offers race and sex comparisons. Chapter 5 summarizes findings and sets forth conclusions. Appendixes, amounting to over one-half of the report, include questionnaires used during data collection for wave two; detailed explication of instrumentation, data collection procedures, and data coding and correction procedures used during the first and second measurement points of the study; and means, standard deviations, and correlations for variables used in the report.

Preliminary activities involved review of the project-developed Implementation Kit for Regional Coordinators, project objectives, and project components. Four special inquiries were conducted: (1) survey of local awareness, (2) survey of Project Directors, (3) survey of 1979-80 local adopters/adapters of Promising Practices, and (4) survey/interviews with the sixteen Regional Coordinators. Over two-thirds of the respondents to the Local Awareness Survey had received the Promising Practices Handbook. Most had read it. The Director  Survey inquired about means of learning about the project and opinion of local level awareness. The Survey of Local Adopters/Adapters asked about their support of the project, use of evaluation instruments, usefulness of different kinds of assistance, suggestions for future changes, and facilitating and limiting factors. Regional directors answered opinion and open-ended questions and were interviewed. Results generally indicated that the Project is successful and important. (Results of the surveys are summarized in detail.) Twelve major recommendations were made regarding the project and its continuation. (All evaluation instruments are appended.) (YLB)",

        "description":"In a national public opinion survey of more than 4,000 adults and a survey of 830 National School Boards Association (NSBA) members at their 1979 national convention, 86 percent of the public and 93 percent of the NSBA respondents endorsed vocational education. Approximately three-quarters of the public but less than half of the NSBA members were in favor of more emphasis by the schools on career preparation through vocational programs. In addition, approximately one-third of the public respondents said they would like to take vocational courses at the present time if they were available. Also, 85 percent of those who reported having received vocational training said the training was \"very useful\" or \"somewhat useful\" later in their lives. While these findings were favorable  toward vocational education, about one-quarter of both groups of respondents said that present programs prepare students for jobs \"not too well\" or \"not well at all,\" while 18 percent of the public respondents were undecided or uninformed about the quality of job preparation. Preliminary and tentative analysis of the relationship between participation in vocational training and family income yielded results suggesting that primary wage earners who had taken vocational courses had significantly higher family incomes than similar respondents with no vocational training.

A modified form of Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory served as the research design of the study. A total of 149 4-H leaders were interviewed regarding thirteen job factors: recognition; personal growth; relationships with other 4-H leaders, extension staff, parents, and other 4-H members; policy and administration; work conditions; guidance and training; and security. Percentages of motivation and hygiene factors contributing to job satisfaction and dissatisfaction were computed. Factors contributing to job satisfaction (motivating factors) were recognition, work itself, responsibility, personal growth, achievement, and relations with members and parents. Factors contributing  to job dissatisfaction were guidance and training, policy and administration, and relationship to leaders. Relationship with members and parents and achievement which served as sources of both job satisfaction and dissatisfaction functioned both as motivational and hygiene factors. Based on these findings, administrators of volunteer programs should minimize opportunity for hygiene factors to become significant to 4-H leaders.

        "description":"This technical report documents the development and initial empirical testing of a practical method for estimating the capacity of Air Force operational units to conduct on-the-job training (OJT). The method is based on a conceptual model of OJT capacity that describes the complex interrelationships among the level and quality of mission performance achieved, and the amount and quality of training provided, by an operational unit. The unit's capacity to conduct OJT is then determined as the maximum amount of training sustainable by the unit without compromising established training quality and mission performance standards. The model has been empirically tested by estimating its basic structural equations, to the extent possible, using existing data for six operational units.  Despite substantial limitations in data availability, the empirical analyses reveal, for all units studied, a persistent and strong inverse relationship between the training load of a unit and the mission performance quality of the unit. These favorable results indicate that further development of the OJT capacity estimation methodology can reasonably be expected to significantly enhance Air Force training management capabilities.

        "description":"This document presents the final report of a study of the best ways to serve persons with handicaps in preparation for work. Chapter 1 provides background and identification of research questions and the research hypothesis to be tested. It outlines major tasks of the study: (1) identify criteria used by training authorities to select the training setting for handicapped persons, (2) gain opinions of &quot;impaired&quot; workers as to where their job competencies were best developed, and (3) identify criteria which advocates presumed should be used when selecting training settings. The second chapter reviews literature addressing barriers that hinder the training of persons with handicaps, roles of persons with handicaps in contemporary society, and an in-depth discussion of the criteria  assessed in this study. Chapter 3 is divided into five sections describing methods and procedures used in each of the three sub-studies (authority, worker, advocate), quality controls imposed, and statistical procedures. Chapter 4 reports findings that indicated that most of the revised criteria were considered to have been used or should have been used in selection of training settings. Chapter 5 provides summary, conclusions, and recommendations for future research. Appendixes, amounting to approximately one-half of the report, include the questionnaires and procedural guides.

It presents a perspective on the state of the art based on reviews of the literature. Although it is addressed principally to local program developers and managers, the paper is also aimed at state career education coordinators. After a discussion of career education objectives and legislation that have affected both state and local career education programs, the ten learner goals established by the United States Office of Career Education are examined at length. These are (1) competence in basic skills; (2) good work habits; (3) personally meaningful work habits; (4) career decision-making skills; (5) occupational and interpersonal skills; (6) understanding self and  educational/vocational opportunities; (7) awareness of continuing and recurrent education; (8) consistence of placement with career decisions; (9) seeking meaning through work and leisure; and (10) awareness of methods of expanding career options. For each goal current status of research and evaluation is discussed and future needs are suggested. Recommendations are made, such as the need for increasing the quality of evaluation designs and measurement instruments. (CT)",

Readers are provided first with a brief history of the development of the concept and are presented with basic terminology. Then, because CBAE is multi-dimensional, varied notions of functional adult education are discussed and major strands of diversified program and instructional processes are described. In addition, administrative perspectives and current research issues are presented. The paper provides background for understanding the current status and direction of several CBAE programs. It reflects the current base of limited written resources and the supplementing of discussions with personal communication. It presents an overview of the nature of CBAE, the  foundations of a CBAE process, the scope of CBAE systems, teaching/learning strategies, administrative trends and issues, and the current state of the research in this area.

The paper emphasizes programs with associate and baccalaureate degree-granting institutions in the United States and Canada. It is aimed at faculty members, practitioners, administrators, and policy-makers, as well as agency or legislative personnel interested in this growing aspect of postsecondary education. An attempt is made to provide sufficient detail to answer questions most often asked by these audiences concerning the adoption of a policy on credit for prior learning and to suggest appropriate resources for further study. The practice of awarding credit for prior learning is traced in the first section. In the second, various  approaches to assessing prior learning are surveyed; included in this section is information about credit by examination, credit recommendations for noncollegiate courses, individualized assessment (study orientation, portfolio preparation, measurement and evaluation of learning outcomes, transcription or recording of credit awarded, and other institutional policies), evaluators and faculty development, special interest areas, and costs and fees. The third section discusses quality assurance and program evaluation. The last section examines future directions and implications.

        "description":"A study is reported which examines the concept of career education infusion as it has been presented in selected curriculum guides, particularly those developed for the middle school and junior high school levels. The report, presented in the form of questions and answers, is written primarily for curriculum developers responsible for planning and implementing career education. It attempts to define the term &quot;infusion&quot; and establish criteria for determining if infusion is being facilitated by the curriculum guides. A second area explored is the relationship between student outcomes in the guides and a comprehensive definition of career education. A third area examined is the concern that implementation of career education at times may not be taking the career development stages  of students into account; the report briefly examines the congruence of the outcomes and activities in the guides with appropriate theoretical career development stages. The fourth and final part of the report focuses on whether or not the major instructional components for evaluating the effectiveness of an outcome or activity are included in the guides. (CT)",

        "description":"With the recent increase in the number of students wishing to enter vocational programs and the increased pressure on accountability and efficiency, vocational educators need to reexamine their policies regarding the selection and admission of students. Several considerations that complicate these decisions are (1) open-door policies that exist in some states; (2) selection of students on the basis of their potential for employment in a training-related occupation; (3) varying philosophies of selection and admission; (4) scarcity of studies in this area since 1972; and (5) the effect affirmative action laws have had on policies and testing. Among main topics discussed are basic strategies underlying studies to identify selection and admission criteria and a review of the  literature of prediction studies and classification studies. Results of the literature review are mixed, depending upon whether one is speaking of predictive studies or classification studies. But there appears to be promise for predicting success by using information classification methodologies. Before using the conclusions of past research in developing future policies, though, it is important to remember that much of the research of the past was done before affirmative action legislation raised the issues of sex bias, race bias, or representation of the handicapped and disadvantaged.

        "description":"Continuity is one of the great facilitators of educational impact--measurable phenomena of positive or negative value which follow the completion of a project or program. It is assumed that continuity in educational research leads to accumulations of (1) research skills, (2) knowledge about previous related research, (3) contacts with like-minded researchers, and (4) data sources. It is further assumed that such accumulations increase the probability that the researcher-produced knowledge will be useful, the researcher will disseminate results, and results will have impact on (modify) educational practice. Accumulations have not come about in vocational education research because of lack of continuity (a succession of research projects which form a coherent whole). Research  projects are more likely to have impact if there is continuity of effort on the part of the researcher, continuity of goals and funding on the part of organizations which fund research, continuity of successful research results reported to consumers, and continuity of evaluations. It is further recommended that there be continuity in impact specifications. That is, the format for specifying actual impacts should reflect the format for specifying intended impacts. (YLB)",

Two-thirds of the respondents reported that, as teenagers, they had established approximate ages for marriage; most expected to be married by age 25. Women who expect to marry see single life as temporary, and may delay making life changes that could be affected by future marriage. By age 30, two-thirds of the respondents had changed their perceptions on the likelihood of marriage. Although marriage remained a possibility, most respondents saw it as less likely than in the earlier past. Many changed their life styles as they approached age 30. A return to school was the modal form of change. Singles are often asked to account for why they have not  married. The reasons they give depend on the person asking, the situation, and their satisfaction with life. Most are happy with their present life styles and anticipate adjusting to being single as they get older. A few anticipate that lack of companionship might lower future life satisfaction. (NRB)",

College students (N=96) were randomly assigned to four cells of the experimental design. Subjects in cells (A) and (B) participated in the construction of a set of behaviorally-anchored rating scales (BARS) of five aspects of college classroom teaching performance, while subjects in cells (C) and (D) performed a control task. Later, subjects in cells (A) and (C) were exposed to a rater training program, while subjects in cells (B) and (D) performed a control task. All subjects then evaluated five standardized simulated professors using the BARS. Training significantly reduced the overall elevation of the ratings; participation did not.  Neither participation nor training significantly reduced the variance attributable to the category of behavior being evaluated. Both participation and training significantly reduced variance attributable to the professor being rated. Participation significantly increased the Category x Professor effect while training did not. There were no significant interactions among the treatments with regard to effects on any of the above characteristics of ratings. Findings suggest that, for these four characteristics of ratings, participation and training operate independently of each other. (Author)",

        "description":"Understanding how and why college education contributes to effective job performance may be helpful in preparing students for the world of work. Personal accounts of college graduates place college education in the context of other learning experiences that occurred before and after the college years. Seventy companies representing a variety of employment settings selected 524 respondents who exhibited very good job performance. Extensive history questionnaires filled out by the respondents illustrate patterns of development that led to successful work outcomes. A comparison of graduates of the mid-sixties and mid-seventies shows how various life experiences may contribute differently to various career stages. Responses from both groups indicate that the work-related benefits of  college do not occur in isolation but, rather, build on earlier life experiences and provide a foundation for growth. A variety of college experiences can enhance work effectiveness in many ways. The profits to be gained from college education also depend on the students, their selection of courses, approach to learning, and ability to capitalize on what they have learned. Respondents counseled against overspecialization, emphasizing the importance of flexibility and adaptability. (NRB)",

It assumes that the urgency and complexity of rapidly growing age-linked problems demand informed approaches to their solution. Second, the model assumes that such solutions could be met, in part, by better utilization of existing research knowledge. Third, it assumes that transfer of research knowledge in aging could be facilitated by investigating recent literature, determining what sorts of factors impede or promote that process, and including them in a set of recommendations for gerontology. These factors are discussed in terms of  the knowledge resource system, the user system, and link agents. This examination of the information dissemination and utilization process concludes that neither the problem-solving model (representing the user perspective) nor the R and D model (representing the provider perspective) adequately provide for the translation of knowledge into practice. The review suggests that the linkage model provides the most promising means for securing the dissemination and utilization of new gerontological knowledge. (Author/NRB)",

College students (N=44) recalled the contents of a hierarchically structured text immediately after study and again six weeks later. Total meaningful recall was better when the superordinate concepts, or cues, activated prior to study were relevant rather than irrelevant to the content of the text. Total meaningful recall was best, however, when the relevant assimilatory cues were reinstated at the time of retrieval. These findings were generally consistent with the principle of encoding specificity. Clustering analyses of the ideational patterns that were present in recall protocols supported the view that organization was the mechanism  underlying cue effects. Additional analyses indicated that the availability of cues at retrieval stimulated the importation (elaboration) of test-relevant ideas. This effect was most pronounced during long-term recall. Findings suggest that organizational activity can prompt appropriate transactions between what learners already know and what they are setting out to learn. (Author)",

The most frequently chosen career clusters emerging from the survey were Business and Office, Health and Service occupations. Females tended to choose traditional occupations. Graduates of rural schools and more males than females planned to begin work immediately following graduation. Over half the seniors planned to continue formal education. Realistic estimates of beginning income (between $6,000 and $14,000 per year) were made by 53% males and 52% of females, with females expecting lower incomes than males. Family and friends were cited as the most influential  factors in choosing future activities. Seniors felt their school had helped their social and self-development but had not adequately prepared them for jobs. Most desired more career counseling. In selecting colleges, seniors placed most value in their own judgments and little on teacher and counselor influence. Finding out which jobs were open, and having the skills and knowledge to do the job, were seen as major obstacles to employment. (NRB)",

Subjects reviewed an applicant's resume folder and rated the applicant on various scales. Subjects also attributed anticipated success or failure on the job of hired applicants to ability, effort, luck, or task difficulty. Results indicate that although health is not a determining factor in hiring or entry salary, it appears to act as a reverse bias wherein the handicapped applicant is rated higher in job-related experience, training, and knowledge of occupational area. Both sex-  and job-stereotyping were apparent to some extent.

When the wife is professionally trained and yet feels \"trapped\" by the presence of children in the home with no available transportation, baby-sitting, or part-time employment options, the family unit can suffer or the wife suffers. The counselor must be sensitive to the woman's need for fulfillment within and outside the home.

The first part deals with the effects of loss, transition, and change on the self-concept of the older person. The second part reviews needs-assessment studies of older people and presents a sample interview worksheet to help counselors assess how well an individual is adapting to a career transition. The third and final part presents group exercises to prepare counselors and other professional helpers for work with older people; case studies of older people who are undergoing the physical and emotional changes associated with aging, and who are experiencing emotional-adjustment problems centered on loss and career  transition, are keyed to specific psychosocial theories from which counseling strategies are derived.

        "description":"A special report of the National Commission for Manpower Policy, this working paper analyzes the demographic trends, labor-market experience, and special problems of older workers. Its chief purpose is to bring into focus the major policy choices involved in increasing the labor-market opportunities of older persons who are able and willing to work. Reviewing demographic data, including projections of labor-force participation, rates of occupational mobility, and indices of occupational concentration, the paper discloses that, although the position of older persons is improving, particularly with respect to education, physical condition, and financial status, a significant proportion encounter severe problems in the labor market. Older workers are concentrated in a limited number  of industries and occupations where highly structured personnel policies, together with inter-group competition, make conditions more favorable for the hiring of younger workers. As a result, there is a growing interest among older persons in improving their employability and their employment opportunities. A number of tables are included. (Author/CS)",

        "description":"The social psychology literature largely ignores attribution patterns made by both sexes of differing generations on an activity with salience for both sexes. \"Parenting\" is an activity with such salience. In estimating parental success for stimulus situations involving parent-child interactions, undergraduates and their parents were virtually identical. With respect to parental failure, the data suggest that some of the gender-related attribution patterns found for other failure situations hold true, and that \"generation\" is an important variable to consider in analyzing attribution patterns. Parents, in contrast to their children, tended to avoid explaining parental failure in terms of disqualifying factors such as an unhappy childhood, poor health, and inadequate education.  Males of both generations made substantially more use of the factor \"Child's Fault\" as an explanation of parental failure. Females were more inclined to explain failure in terms of bad luck than were their male counterparts. (Author/CS)",

        "description":"Intrinsic motivation and self-reinforcement can be used identically to explain behavioral persistence in the absence of external reward. Yet the relationship between these concepts has not been adequately explored. Since intrinsic motivation appears to be dependent on an interesting task and self-reinforcement independent of task, it was hypothesized that factorial manipulations of reinforcement (external, self, or none) and task (interesting versus uninteresting) would permit an examination of the relationship between intrinsic motivation and self-reinforcement. Subjects (N=60) rated the interest value of the three tasks while observers recorded the time required to complete the tasks. Results indicated that, for an interesting task, external reinforcement led to the least  free-time activity, no reinforcement led to the most, and self-reinforcement yielded intermediate activity. For the uninteresting task, external and self-reinforcement led to greater activity than no reinforcement. Self-reinforcement led to equivalent activity in the interesting and uninteresting task conditions. Findings suggest that arousal is a possible mediator of self-reinforcement and intrinsic motivation effects. (Author)",

        "description":"Several theoretical approaches have been offered to explain the phenomenon of reciprocity: trust-liking, social exchange, and modeling. The emphasis of previous research on self-disclosure reciprocity (descriptive reciprocation), the intimacy of the facts an individual reveals about him- or herself, stems largely from the fact that these investigations have structured the circumstances for disclosure in terms of the exchange of information. It was hypothesized that if the circumstances were changed to a conversation or if participants were concerned with increasing their attractiveness to another, other forms of reciprocity including affective reciprocity, the strength of the emotions revealed, the topical reciprocity, the degree to which a response addresses topics previously  raised, might be more pronounced. Results from an experiment varying the circumstances for disclosure and the intimacy of disclosure initially received from an experimental confederate indicated that the structural difference between information exchanges and conversations was a major determinant of topical reciprocity. Affective reciprocity was influenced primarily by the desire to increase one's attractiveness. (Author)",

The subjects orally read stories containing ten altered words, with a single letter substituted so that another word was formed that was anomalous within the sentence. The first study used different orienting instructions to manipulate subjects' response sets and measured awareness of the passage modifications. Results indicated that variations in responding to the altered words were not related to ability or instructional orientation. The variations were related to subjects' self-reports of strategies adopted to deal with  anomalies and their ability to identify the altered words. In the second experiment the task demands were made explicit in order to examine the relationship of information processing demands and reading ability. Good and poor readers were equally able to conform to demands for contextually appropriate reading responses, but poor readers were less able to suppress contextual information when accurate reading was required. The results of this research run counter to the conception of poor readers as insensitive to contextual information. (Author/RL)",

Participation structures in the reading lesson were found to resemble those in talk story, an important speech event in Hawaiian culture. Methods for pinpointing similarities between home and school speech events showed that relationships between the two events were generally isomorphic, rather than identical in nature. The results strongly suggested that cultural congruence in school settings may exist in the absence of topical similarity to speech events in the children's culture. In other words, it may be more important to  adjust how teachers teach rather than what teachers teach. (Author/RL)",

(3) Questions are asked at a variety of levels, ranging from factual and literal to interpretive and critical. (4) Instruction is responsive, with the teacher's questions growing out of the preceding responses of the children. When the lessons of a teacher whose instruction incorporated all of these features were compared to those of one whose instruction showed only the third and fourth features,  it was found, with minor exceptions, that the level of student achievement-related behaviors was much higher in the lessons of the first teacher than in those of the second.

The first section reports the results of a survey of 267 beginning teachers, 47 college instructors in teacher education, 44 school administrators, and 205 supervising teachers to elicit their perceptions of the state of teacher preparation and concludes with a list of topics for further research. The second section presents the proceedings of a conference of the Queensland board of teacher education that recommended the following as a follow-up to the survey: (1) there should be a closer working relationship between schools and teacher training institutions in the preparation of teachers for the  teaching of reading, and (2) training in the teaching of reading should be regarded as a continuous process throughout a teacher's career. The third section lists the course outlines offered in the teaching of reading and associated skills by ten Queensland teacher training institutions. Appendixes present survey information, including samples of the questionnaires. (AEA)",

        "description":"A study varied a formal testing situation to encourage verbalization in black, inner-city nursery school children. The children were asked to identify items from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test in either a test situation (looking at the stimulus jointly with an adult) or a &quot;need to know&quot; situation (looking at the stimulus alone). It was predicted that the children would give longer, more linguistically adequate responses in the sole perception condition than in the joint perception condition. The results supported this prediction. Sole-perception children produced more words and utterances than did joint-perception children, as well as more well-formed short answers and full sentence responses. They also directed more nontask-related verbalizations to the adult. Joint  perception children produced more highly elliptical responses, gave more responses in which the tense did not correspond with that of the question, and used pronouns without prior reference more frequently than did the sole-perception children. The sole-perception children also produced more accurate responses. The findings suggest that changes in situational features can result in more valid measurements of a child's language ability and knowledge. (Author/FL)",

Specifically, the experiment examined whether, at the age when reading instruction typically begins, children are capable of appreciating stylistic properties of text that are almost universally edited out of instructional materials. Thirteen children were briefly exposed in a naturalistic setting to two works by each of five authors of children's stories. When they listened to tapes of a third work by each of the authors, six of the children were able to correctly identify the authorship of three or more of the five stories. The other seven children identified one or fewer correctly (three of these did not complete the task).

There are two sets of skills that are particularly important to teach. The first set includes comprehension monitoring skills that involve readers' monitoring their continuing processing for possible comprehension failure and taking remedial action when failures occur. Comprehension failures can occur at various levels, including: particular words, particular sentences, relations between sentences, and relations between larger units. For each kind of failure, there are specific remedial actions readers can take. The second set of processing skills that can be taught involves using clues in the text to generate, evaluate, and revise  hypotheses about current and future events in the text. In teaching these processing skills, the teacher should first model these skills by reading and thinking aloud and then gradually turn over the processing responsibilities to the students.

Furthermore, reading times and probe reaction times on a secondary task were longer when subjects were processing text segments containing information of the type addressed by questions. These results can be accounted for by a &quot;volume of attention&quot; theory asserting that readers selectively allocate a greater volume of attention to question-relevant information, and that a process supported by the additional attention causes more of the information to be learned. This theory was found to account for somewhat more than  two-thirds of the indirect effect of questions and one-third of the direct effect of questions. (Author/RL)",

The student's preinstructional strategy for mastering the task is observed and the subskills that the student uses spontaneously are analyzed. (2) Instruction in the study skill task is designed in a way that allows the student to see the limitations of the spontaneous strategy and the advantages of the method being taught. (3) The method of instruction should reduce the load on working memory to the  lowest possible level. Subskills should be divided into the smallest concept packages. When these three steps are used, most study skill tasks can be converted from traditional individualized or group instructional designs to a personalized, developmental design.

The analyses showed that the authors of these books tended to focus totally on the familial aspects of the shared experiences of black people, a rather narrow focus. Another important finding was that many of the writers were consistently writing about the deplorable ugliness of ghetto life, a view not representative of the whole black community. Although many of the stories introduced social problems, they did not develop the problems to the extent that children would be able to learn from reading about the experiences. It was evident from the study that writers of young adult novels  for blacks have an obligation to present youthful readers with sufficient choices upon which to generate goals and values. Children's books that purport to be about black people, especially black adolescents, must portray these shared experiences with authenticity to promote a better understanding of and appreciation for the uniqueness of black people.

In order to plan appropriate and effective oral communication environments, teachers need to be aware of the factors that shape and influence communication environments or situations. There are three scales or continua of determinancy that can be used to describe how a speech style matches a talk context. Teachers will want to create different talk contexts, and therefore encourage the use and development of different speech styles by manipulating the factors of group size, relationships among group members, and physical arrangements of groups. Such arrangements could lead toward the use of intimate, casual, consultative, and formal speech styles. Learning  can take place in all four contexts and, by attention to factors such as group size, speaker-listener relationships and distancing, the type and nature of children's previous experiences, and the type of subject matter, teachers can create for their students real contexts for appropriate communications.

Intended to assist those educators who wish to see the implications of each type of curriculum spelled out in practical detail at every grade level, the book also is meant to be a resource for those working within one of the paradigms as well as a practical introduction to the paradigms for those who have not had much exposure to them. The paradigms are (1) the process or student-centered model, (2) the heritage or traditional model, and (3) the competencies model. Following an introduction that provides background of the project, the essays are presented in five sections devoted to these levels of education: prekindergarten  through grade five, grades six through nine, the high school, the community college, and the four-year college. Each section contains a general essay and three essays discussing the three paradigms. (RL)",

Articles in section two, \"Language Growth in Educational Environments,\" center on creating in the school environment a context that will foster the further language development of children. Some articles focus on the beginnings of reading and writing in the very young child; others present implications for language arts education--speaking, reading, writing--applicable to the full range of students in the elementary school.

Examples of how three native American groups (Oglala Sioux, Piman, and Navaho) have used poetry in healing illustrate the power of language, the content and structure of healing poems, and the comparative use, construction, and performance of native American poetry relevant to Western theories. A great deal more remains to be said about the function of language, especially poetry, in the healing practices and theories of different cultures. Much can be learned by investigating the education and qualifications of the poet, the content  and standards of individual poems and sequences of songs, and changes in ceremonial practices in response to new needs within the culture. The introduction of poetry into Western psychotherapeutic practice, if it is to be successful, can well benefit from the sophisticated theories and techniques developed by cultures that prize the value, power, and beauty of the word.

Students proceed in a three-step process and are required to check with the teacher at regular intervals. The first step is to choose a subject and make a list of topics on that subject, the second step is to organize the list, and the third step is to produce a first draft of a paper from the list. Student papers are kept in a folder and a sequence of writing assignments is followed by all students. The laboratory teacher also has procedures to follow. The teacher cannot spend more than  a minute with a particular writer, but must read the writer's work rapidly, say something, and move on--somewhat like a shop or art teacher. Teachers follow a response pattern in which they (1) look at content to be sure it is concrete and specific, (2) check form and organization, (3) work with the writing of sentences, and (4) pay attention to individual words such as spelling and diction. Student response to the program has been exceptionally positive. (MKM)",

Fifty-seven of the 328 teacher-participants at a one-day, university sponsored conference on the teaching of written composition were asked to log their time and to evaluate each session they attended. The teachers were able to choose from 20 workshops, five demonstrations, and three talks.  Sessions were provided for all grades, kindergarten through university level. Analysis of the teachers' responses supported the first four stereotypes: the teachers tended to be experienced, to teach in the lower grades, to be female, and to be interested more in specific teaching ideas than in general discussions. The responses also partially supported the fifth stereotype. (FL)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the nature of the relationship between grammar and pragmatics--specifically, between the rules of a language and the principles for using language. It argues that knowledge of language itself plays a small, primarily enabling part in people's ability to communicate effectively and that a large share of communicative competence is the ability to infer a speaker's plans, goals, and purposes from his or her utterances and to plan and execute speech in such a way that such inferences are most efficiently made. The paper demonstrates, first abstractly, then with an extended example, the complexity of the choices involved in making a simple hypothethical utterance. Next, it describes how certain kinds of nonlinguistic knowledge must be involved in making these  choices. It also characterizes three kinds of linguistic knowledge: (1) knowledge about language proper (grammar), (2) knowledge about the use of particular forms, and (3) knowledge about communicating. Finally, it discusses some of the implications of this characterization. (FL)",

        "description":"In a discussion of the attempts of the organized workers' photography movement in Weimar Germany to redirect the use of photographs in everyday life, this paper analyzes photographs published in the &quot;Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung,&quot; (AIZ) a large and successful picture magazine that emphasized a left-wing, humanitarian approach. The paper points out that Willi Munzenberg, the founder of AIZ, and those who worked with him stressed the social function of photography, defined the camera as a weapon in the class struggle, and saw the worker-photographer as the eye and the conscience of the proletariat. The paper also notes that, in contrast to the bourgeois press, the AIZ and similar publications stressed the subjectivity of photography and encouraged workers to recreate and share  their social and political environments through the publication of their photographs. In analyzing the photographs, the paper concentrates on the style of worker/photographers, with particular attention to family, documentary, and journalistic photographs. (Author/FL)",

The first study, a National Assessment of Educational Progress and Speech Communication Association pilot project, indicated that there was potential item bias based on minority ethnic group response. However, no real data on the students' verbal ability was available to substantiate possible explanations. In the second study, two packages of listening items, each approximately 35 minutes in length were developed, and a 25-item vocabulary test was administered to estimate verbal ability. Recording of the listening items was made by individuals using network English. The  results indicated that there was a positive correlation between listening ability and verbal ability, suggesting that the differing responses of minority and nonminority students in the first study could be attributed to differing levels of verbal ability, rather than item bias.

Prior to studying a particular novel, the instructor gave students an assignment that would involve a particular literary technique used by the author of the novel. By allowing the students to do what the author had done, the instructor enabled the students to understand the author's writing processes and thereby to better appreciate the author's style and his or her particular novel. In addition to enhancing their appreciation of literature, the exercise improved the students' creative and expository writing by (1) providing contexts and audiences other than  classroom and instructor, (2) assisting the students' imaginative identification with the author, and (3) freeing the students of many of the harmful restraints they may have been taught in earlier writing contexts by creating in them a sense of themselves as writers. Based on this experience, the instructor proposes a recombination of the presently specialized areas of literature and writing instruction. (HTH)",

Results indicated that scores on the two tests correlated significantly only between the vocabulary section of each test and the total scores. Results also indicated that on the Nelson-Denny test the students' average score was close to the sixtieth percentile and on the criterion referenced test the students' average score was just over 82% correct. While female students performed better on the  Nelson-Denny test, no differences by sex were found on the criterion-referenced test.

One class period is enough, most students can construct the  parodies from these topics \"cold.\" Each group is encouraged to develop its parody solely for the entertainment and approval of the other members of the class.

        "description":"Data from similar questionnaires were used to compare the high school yearbook programs that produced All-American ratings in the 1969 and 1979 National Scholastic Press Association competitions. Responses for the two survey periods suggested that many aspects of the programs' successful yearbooks have remained unchanged during the past decade, although there have been some significant changes. Highlights of the results of the comparative analysis were as follows: (1) The 1979 yearbooks had more pages, cost more, sold to a smaller percentage of school enrollment, and had more difficult financing problems (depending on advertising revenue and extracurricular fundraising) than the 1969 yearbooks. (2) The number of schools offering beginning journalism courses did not change  significantly from 1969 to 1979. (3) A greater percentage of yearbook staff members attended summer workshops in 1979, with staffs receiving more specific help on their own yearbooks at these summer workshops. The two survey periods reflected little change in the characteristics of students working on the yearbooks. In 1979, fewer yearbook advisers had complete control over staff selection. Photography remained the greatest problem area in yearbook production. Female teachers were more likely to advise yearbooks than were males in both time periods. A larger percentage of 1979 advisers held masters degrees, and more than a third had at least an undergraduate degree in journalism. (RL)",

        "description":"A frequent complaint about the quality of health care delivery is that physicians often do not listen to their patients in consultation sessions. Studies indicate physicians show a tendency to listen only to patient discourse that the examiners had initiated, and to ignore questions and comments that the patients had initiated; that physicians argue with patients over the clinical meaning of descriptors used by patients; that physicians spent more time talking to infants rather than to the infants' mothers; and that the average physician spends very little total time listening to patients. Among the reasons cited for this lack of listening are the physicians' uncertainty about the diagnosis made, difficulty in listening to persons who do not share their level of medical  expertise, or the impossibility of living up to the unrealistic expectations made by the patients. A communication course that could be built into the curricula of medical colleges should include such goals as (1) increasing the competencies the physician brings to the interview scene; (2) reducing feelings of threat; and (3) equipping the physician with techniques that allow the patient to solve the dilemmas that infuse the interview.

        "description":"The most efficient and pragmatic conceptual system of viewing theatre work is through a communication model. This model is opposed to two other general conceptions of theatre and drama. The first is based on the notion that drama makes aesthetic demands and has requirements of its own that the artist must meet, even though it has no existence except in the thoughts and behavior of human beings, while the second view promotes only the artist's financial, educational, or therapeutic profit and leaves out audience awareness as a key factor. The communication model is a functional approach in which each moment of the play is seen to be not only purposeful in itself but also contributing to a grand purpose and to be manipulating the experience of the audience as precisely as possible  toward predetermined ends. It is possible to make plays that are believable but meaningless, in which the moments convince but do not knit together into a coherent structure of significant behavior. The generation and manipulation of significance is the factor that separates artist-created behavior from the general run of behavior in &quot;real life.&quot; Directors or designers who fully understand the functional approach have the basic tool that allows them to move out of the realm of inspiration and chance and into the realm of craft.

        "description":"Directors of plays can make rehearsals interpretively productive, but they must first reject directorial approaches such as beginning rehearsals without analyzing the script, projecting images of the play as it is read, and using the script merely to summarize meanings, static themes, morals, and nothing more. Making rehearsals interpretively productive requires prerehearsal interpretations that ask &quot;why&quot; over and over again until every perceivable moment of the script has been fully rationalized and reconciled with every other moment into a coherent &quot;action to be communicated,&quot; not merely an action to be executed before an audience. The most useful way for the director to formulate this action is in terms of final cause: that is, as a web of understandings of the communicative  job to be done, of the impact performance that they should have on the audience moment by moment. During rehearsal, this sketchy cognitive structure of how the play should be communicated should be tested, revised, and fleshed out. In rehearsal, the final test of a script is &quot;apprehensive rightness&quot;--an intuitive realization that the show does, indeed, make sense, is fully coherent, and will affect the audience in a powerful and meaningful way.

        "description":"A history of American women dramatists is provided in this paper with emphasis on the period 1960 to 1980. It is noted that by 1960 several American women had earned sizable reputations as dramatists; that prior to 1960, especially in the 1920s and 1930s, they had offered both commercial and experimental pieces; and that, like their male counterparts, they treated social issues when society at large seemed interested in such issues. Significant shifts in these patterns in the decades of 1960 and 1970 are discussed: (1) women playwrights now tended to cluster in alternative, noncommercial theatres off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway such as Ellen Stewart's Cafe La Mama; (2) black women playwrights emerged as a major new voice in the American theatre; and (3) after 1970, feminist  playwrights began to surface and find production, beginning with Megan Terry of Open Theatre and Myrna Lamb's \"Mod Donna.\" (MKM)",

Of the 4,341 schools responding to the survey, 76% indicated that they offered a speech course and of these, 32% indicated that they required the course. Overall, the findings showed that the offerings of speech communication curricula have not changed in the past 15 years. The basic course was a semester long and was offered only once a year to a combination of ninth or tenth through twelfth grade students. The average section had 20 students and was generally 55 minutes long. Although a combination of topics (including oral interpretation, debate, mass media, and drama) were  usually taught in the basic course, public speaking dominated the course. The most frequently cited textbook was \"The Art of Speaking,\" by Elson and Peck. Drama was the most frequently offered advanced and extracurricular course. The majority of teachers of speech courses had five or fewer years of experience and 70% of all speech teachers had English as their teaching assignment. Forty-four percent of the teachers indicated graduate work in progress, with 33% having their master's degrees. The teachers did not report strong affiliations with professional associations. (FL)",

The purposes of the investigation were to determine whether each anchorman would exhibit specific kinesic behaviors associated with audience perceptions of positive bias, negative bias, or neutrality; and to discover whether the two men displayed common kinesic signals when they were perceived as positively biased, negatively biased, or neutral. As a first step in the study, 58 viewers were asked to watch 22 video taped segments involving each anchorman. Each segment consisted of one story that dealt with a specific person or event. The viewers then completed a bias rating instrument, which gauged their impressions of the direction and degree  of bias evidenced by the anchorman about the person or event in each story. As a second step, six segments (the two rated most positively, the two rated most negatively, and the two rated most neutral) were coded using a kinesic notation system. The final step was a frequency tally, in which the number of times a movement occurred in each segment was noted. The findings showed that each anchorman did exhibit kinesic behaviors consistent with the audience's perception of his direction of bias. In addition, specific kinesic behaviors associated with audience perceptions of bias or neutrality were found to be idiosyncratic. (FL)",

        "description":"A theoretical model was tested for its ability to explain persistence and delayed credibility (or \"sleeper\") effects in attitude change via persuasive variables. The model predicted opinion effects from two major components: a multiplicative effect of message repetition and credibility, and a simple effect of time since receipt of message. The subjects, 124 college students, read a cover story, a speaker description (the source credibility manipulation), and one of three messages advocating federal control of education. Four time increments were selected for measurement of opinion, varying from immediately after the treatment to six weeks later. Thus, the students were presented with variations in repetition and credibility and their opinions were assessed over time. The  experiment yielded data supporting the viability of the time explanations, but failed to support the hypothesized multiplicative effect on opinions. Problems in inducing manipulations may have contributed to obtaining only partial support for the model. The results suggested the need to reevaluate previous research. (RL)",

The purpose of the experimental investigation was to determine whether the specific shapes, colors, and placement of visuals within a picture frame affected viewers' abilities to perceive, describe, and retain them and whether or not such an asymmetrical composition was preferred. Four tests were prepared and administered to a total of 47 randomly selected college students in basic communication classes. It was found that the viewers' ability to perceive and readily describe certain visuals within the left or right side of the visual field was greatly dependent on the shapes and colors of such visuals. The retention and recall of visuals  was more accurate when the visuals were unique in their shapes, outstanding in their colors, and probably when placed within the left visual field. The viewers' preferences for the total compositional structure of still images was affected by the asymmetrical placement of the visual elements on the left-hand side of the visual field.

        "description":"That a play has one central action which is its formal cause is the most influential interpretative idea to emerge among theatre writers since the old model of situation/incident/complication/climax/denouement. Unfortunately, the action concept has been insufficiently developed, excessive hopes have been pinned on it, and it has become a reductive threat. One way of properly handling the concept of action is to consider the definition of the action of a play as the \"master psychic event\" of the play. In this way, the play is seen to exist only as mental events in the audience and as sign-potentials of the playscript. The play does not have an action, but is perceived as being an action. The interpreters of plays, variously the actors and directors, do not observe the actions but  invent them. As part of the process of reducing the ambiguity of specific signs to be seen by the audience, these interpreters test possible syntheses of individual perceptions into a functionally integrated structure of meaning. There need not be only one response to a play's action, even at the conceptual level of master event. Because it operates at a level \"close to the script,\" constant reference to the play as an action tends to serve as a corrective on more abstract levels of meaning. (RL)",

Children in all three samples were asked questions about how much they played with handicapped and nonhandicapped children both at school and at home. Pictures were taken of each child in the selected mainstreamed classrooms, and the children in these classrooms were shown the  pictures of their classmates and asked how often they talked to or played with the pictured child. Only one of the six hypotheses was supported, indicating that orthopedically handicapped children were less integrated into overall communication networks. Those children who were mainstreamed did have more contact with peers outside of school than those who were not mainstreamed. The network analysis procedure appeared to be an accurate index of communication patterns, and the use of photographs in the process increased reliability and children's willingness to participate.

Evaluation itself appears to be worthwhile, both as a way of measuring principal performance and of improving it by focusing attention on how principals are doing. The best evaluators appear to be teachers. District personnel and outside observers can also make useful evaluations. Principal self-evaluations are not very objective. Quality (how effectively principals perform key competencies) is more important than quantity (how often they perform them). Evaluations should focus on competencies that make a difference in the quality of education schools provide; key competencies are not always what educators think they are. Staffing and curriculum and instruction are important areas of leadership,  and implementing and evaluating are key functions. The best evaluations are made by large groups of evaluators using precise instruments. Moreover, principals, who are, after all, the group being evaluated, should have a say in the kind of evaluation program that is used. Principals who help with the process and understand how it works will perceive that, despite its problems, evaluation is an opportunity, not a threat. (Author/IRT)",

In part 2, the topic &quot;the public humanist&quot; is explored. This part looks at the challenges Montaigne chose to face and advocates that state humanities programs undertake similar challenges. It discusses the humanities as defined by Congress and whether humanists ought to &quot;dirty their hands&quot; in the public arena. Humanists are urged to overcome their wish for privacy and enter into a study of public issues. One author, in exploring a public role for the humanities, advocates that  projects be created to honor the humanist and that humanists be willing to leave the ivory tower and talk to the public.

        "description":"An analysis of the general trends in nationwide educational planning in third-world countries shows that most educational plans to date have largely been limited to simple forecasting. Political and social factors that affect decisions on educational expansion have not been incorporated sufficiently into such forecasts. There continues to be a need for better quantification of what exists in the educational systems of most countries, within both the formal and nonformal sectors. Especially lacking, however, is good knowledge of the qualitative aspect of education as it relates to the aspirations of individuals, communities, and governments. New economic development strategies, such as those that stress employment and income distribution, will increasingly affect what happens in  the education sector and suggest that educational planning must be linked more closely to new concepts of development. The future probably lies in many small incremental changes through continuous research and development strategies linked to planning efforts. Each country must develop its own capacity for continuous educational planning, research, and development in the search for education that has the quality, relevance, and efficiency appropriate in the national context.

Under a grant from the Women's Educational Equity Act Program (WEEAP), this model selected, trained, and placed women with proven administrative ability, which resulted in the hiring of 10 of the 13 interns as administrators after completion of the program. This report discusses the need for individual and systemic change; how Project ICES was developed, implemented, and disseminated; who was involved; and some of the experiences of those who participated. The ICES program consists of four elements: (1) internships, providing  on-the-job training as well as the opportunity to demonstrate administrative competence; (2) certification, guaranteeing that each participant would have the necessary credentials upon completion of the project; (3) equity-leadership, offering workshops concerned with potential problems and conflict resolution tactics; (4) the support component to deal with problems associated with tokenism and to reduce feelings of isolation. The model was implemented through three component organizations: a university, a state education agency, and a state-wide administrator professional organization. (JK)",

The study attempted a statistical analysis of the actual distribution and utilization of funds for the fall terms 1975 through 1978. It also aimed to identify current budgeting and management practices that interfere with the delivery of quality education. A third goal of the study was to make recommendations that would effectively increase the worth of monies available by raising productivity and flexibility. Data were taken from board of education documents and interviews with principals, superintendents, and central office administrators. The study was based on the premise that the principal should have more flexibility and more accountability in  administering the school and distributing resources. Following the discussion of the allocation of funds to high schools, six areas needing reform or improvement are discussed: differentiated staffing, management practices at central divisions of the board of education, contract provisions, disincentives in the formula for the improvement of attendance, flexibility in the expenditure of funds, and the equitable distribution of funds. Finally, there is a discussion of a proposed per capita allocation formula. (Author/JM)",

Symposium participants heard Dr. Arthur Wise of The Rand Corporation, Dr. Guilbert Hentschke of the University of Rochester, and Dr. Robert Scanlon, secretary of education in Pennsylvania. Dr. Wise concluded that policy intervention from federal and state government and from the judiciary have contributed to the bureaucratization of the classroom and that these changes are creating profound and unanticipated changes in American education. Dr. Hentschke  maintained that the issue of equality in the delivery of educational services cannot be separated from the issue of productivity and that policy-makers need to examine both issues to determine whether the net benefit has been worth the net cost. Dr. Scanlon concluded that the crisis in American education is not one of low productivity but of diminished confidence of the community in the educational system and that the challenge today is to build or restore that confidence.

However, it is not clear that these legislative efforts will result in implementation programs that fulfill legislative intent. Throughout the United States legal challenges from students adversely affected by testing programs have been initiated. While still in the courts, these cases point up the difficulties in design and implementation efforts compelled by legislation requiring minimum compentency testing. The legal issues on which this recent litigation is based present conflicting legal mandates to those charged with the responsibility of effectuating minimum competency testing programs. This paper focuses on the relationship between state  accountability and the child's educational rights and provides a set of guidelines for educators who seek to avoid the pitfalls of litigation involved in the contradictions between legislative and judicial mandates.

Data were gathered from 16 districts (urban, suburban, and medium size city), both through questionnaires and on-site interviews with teachers, teacher organization officers, supervisors, principals, assistant superintendents, and superintendents. Studied was the role of supervision (rather than the position of supervision) consisting of inservice programs, teacher evaluation, curriculum improvement, and instructional supervisory services. From analysis of the data, several best bets for  improvement of supervisory services emerged: decentralization, building principals' further involvement in supervisory service, defining supervision so as to eliminate the evaluative aspect, and increasing opportunities for teachers to receive supervisory services of all kinds.

The project was a statewide survey to determine how the Ohio public informs itself about public education and to identify factors contributing to the public's trust and confidence in education. The project included a review of the existing literature on how the public gets information about schools, design of a survey instrument for identifying how the Ohio public informs itself, and a statewide telephone survey of households. The report includes the results of the review and of the survey, and AEL's recommendations to the Ohio department of education about how to use the results. Perhaps the most important finding was that the  strongest supporters of public education are the parents of children in the public schools. Since people without school-age children now outnumber parents of school-age children, it is argued that the primary task is to achieve more effective communication with the part of the population that does not have school-age children.

It assesses the factors affecting the origins and expansion of national educational systems; the factors influencing the organizational structure and ideologies of systems of mass schooling and higher education; and the effects of expanded educational systems for individuals, groups, and societies. It finds that the institutionalization of mass schooling is associated with nation-building processes in the eighteenth century, while universities originated in medieval Europe under papal sponsorship. In the post-World War II era, educational expansion is weakly influenced by national structural characteristics and seems to have its impetus in the rise of a transnational  world culture. Participation in this wider civilizational network may explain the increasing convergence (especially at the lower levels) of educational organization and ideology. Education positively affects individuals, low status groups (women, for instance), and societal development. These effects may reflect the world-wide rise of educational credentialism. The paper concludes by advocating more explicitly comparative research that directly tests institutional-level explanations. A bibliography is included. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"This paper contains a review of the research to date on the impact of collective bargaining in elementary and secondary education. The areas reviewed include the impact of collective bargaining on wages, salary structures, class size, resource allocations, and decision-making processes in the school systems. Other areas covered relate bargaining to the use of impasse procedures and strike activity. The issues of scope in collective bargaining and public participation are also examined, as is the impact of bargaining on teacher-student contact and teacher morale. A number of problems with the current research in these areas is discussed, including problems of definition and methodology. The final part of the paper is an indepth analysis of recommendations for the directions of  future research. Research priorities are delineated, along with estimates of research feasibility in various areas. (Author)",

These include changes in school organization, student attitudes toward their schooling, the level of crime in schools, the disparities in school financing between school districts in the United States, and the transition from school to work. In addition, the report compares conditions between the U.S. and other developed countries. (Author)",

Among findings were that the number of CRFs doubled between 1973 and 1977, thus verifying the impact of the deinstitutionalization movement; wide variations in facility size and the extent to which states use community living arrangements to serve mentally retarded people were two notable trends; severity of  retardation and age of client served in CRFs varied across states, however, the most frequently identified resident in the nation was the young moderately and mildly retarded adult; and nationally, the average cost for residential care was $15.70 per day per resident which included costs of room, board, care, and personal items.

A second section presents research findings for the following areas: general predispositions and individual differences of the infant's contribution to mental health, effective environments for mental health, the  infant-caregiver interaction, and the development of the infant's attachment to a caregiver. Risks for development and clinical interventions are highlighted in a third section. Among conclusions in a final summary are five factors involved in individual vulnerability versus invulnerability in mental health--multiplicity of stresses; alterations of adverse environments after the early childhood period; temperamental, sex, and genetic differences; intrafamilial relations; and the wider social environment.

Variable features were compared with background factors such as age, sex, geographical provenance, clan membership, and previous educational experience, in order to determine any correlations or effects. In addition, samples of the children's utterances were submitted to a panel of adult Navajo speakers to obtain their judgments on appropriateness and grammaticality of the forms used. Finally, interview data were analyzed to discover possible effects of English bilingualism on the students'  competence and proficiency in Navajo. Analysis was also carried out on the English data to determine interference and order of acquisition of selected features. (Author/JB)",

There are two problems: (1) What standard or orthography will be adopted? (2) What standards of style will be developed? Usually, there are several different writing systems for any one Amerindian language, and it will be up to the schools to develop standards of spelling and punctuation. The second problem is more closely related to the bilingual education issue. Given the lack of literature in Amerindian languages, a model for developing writing style in a native language is needed. In an ideal bilingual education system, the child learns all cognitive skills, including writing, in the native language while studying  English as a second language. Eventually, the skills developed in the native language can be transferred to English. The positive reinforcement of the native language can also promote the child's self-image as a speaker of it. The lack of materials in American Indian languages makes this difficult, but it is felt that the children themselves will eventually determine, through their output, acceptable writing style in their native tongues. English writing style would then be taught separately. (PJM)",

Two also report narrow but notable shortages of research capability in certain exotic languages.

Models currently employed in computational linguistics have a semantic basis and are goal-directed. The basic model is an associative cognitive network. The basic inventory of concepts of the system is given in the systemic network, which is organized into paradigmatic, syntagmatic, and componential structures. Since events happen in particular places at particular times, there is also an episodic structure. The gnomonic system defines abstract concepts over episodes. According to Phillips (1975), discourse coherence must be considered on two levels, the episodic and the gnomic. A discourse which engenders episodic and/or  gnomonic expectations which are not then fulfilled is incoherent. A lower limit on coherence may be defined as a discourse so ill-formed that it makes no sense even to its creator. The upper limit on coherence is set by the most powerful creative minds. Between the two limits, discourse analysis, from the point of view of the computational linguist, probably requires nothing less than a full-blown computational theory of the human mind. (JB)",

        "description":"A technique for Latin instruction has been developed which uses the Programmed Learning for Automated Teaching (PLATO) computer system. The program, which conjugates Latin verbs and declines nouns and adjectives, represents an improvement over traditional computer teachers. While older systems only told the student when he made an error, the PLATO program can tell him what kind of error he has made. There are several benefits to this. Once the computer is provided with a set of noun and adjective bases and case endings, it can combine these elements to produce correct Latin forms. A small amount of computer memory is needed to produce a great number of Latin forms, thus combining the contents of many lessons into one. Another benefit is error analysis. Since the computer knows  what kind of error the student makes and tells him, the student can concentrate on his problem areas. As the computer tabulates the different types of errors, the instructor can discern problem areas by studying relative frequencies of these errors. The program thus assists Latin instruction at both ends, and can be a valuable tool for pedagogy. (PJM)",

        "description":"Two hundred nine Puerto Rican students in East Coast colleges, from mixed bilingual backgrounds, were administered four matched pairs of deductive reasoning tests in Spanish and English. Measures of reading comprehension in these two languages were also collected. Results indicated that performance on logical reasoning tests in each language can be significantly predicted by measures of reading comprehension skill in the language of the test and that the pattern of prediction is very similar across languages for any pair of reasoning tests. The relationship of a few selected background characteristics of subjects to reasoning test performance was found to be mediated through measures of reading comprehension skill in the language of reasoning tests. Discrepancy between level of  performance on Spanish versus English reasoning tests was most apparent for subjects found to show the most discrepancy between reading comprehension skills in Spanish and English. Finally, substantial statistical evidence exists that solution of logical reasoning problems in Spanish and English may involve common thinking skills that are psychologically discriminable from reading comprehension skills.

        "description":"In a verbal memory study of language development, third- through sixth-grade children read and orally recalled short, expository passages which were presented in three syntactic paraphrase forms: (1) complex sentences with preverbal elaboration such as complex subject nominalizations and relative clauses, (2) complex sentences with postverbal elaboration, and (3) simple sentences. Syntactic analysis of the children's best recall samples (those showing high semantic recall) revealed that third through fifth graders tended to paraphrase the target information in simple sentences, regardless of the complexity of the material they had read. Sixth graders, however, maintained the original syntax more often than younger subjects, suggesting a better recall memory for syntactically  complex features of discourse. The results corroborate previous findings showing that children's speech in the upper elementary grades shifts towards greater structural complexity. As suggested by Ingram (1975), such a shift may reflect important developmental changes in the linguistic strategies children use during this age range for producing complex sentences in connected discourse.

Participants were freshmen studying English as a second language during an eight-week period. Twenty-four students were divided into a control and an experimental group. The experimental group practiced sentence-combining exercises in addition to the exercises used by the control group. The study tested the following hypotheses: (1) Students in the experimental group would show significantly greater syntactic development than students in the control group. (2) Students in the experimental group would show greater overall writing improvement than students in the control group. The first hypothesis proved valid;  the second hypothesis proved to be invalid. In addition to a discussion of the study itself, the report includes a discussion of recent controversies over the use of sentence combining and its adaptation to the foreign student population.

The tenacity of Indian languages and the importance they have for their speakers are demonstrated by the endurance of the languages under enormous pressures to assimilate. Although the languages have survived, they are by no means healthy, and many face extinction. The approaches, resources, ideas, and goals discussed are based in part on the experiences of Indian groups and in part on the theoretical insights of linguists, education specialists, and other social scientists.

The supply data are aggregated by 11 educational clusters, and employment demand data are aggregated by eight occupational clusters. Analysis reveals imbalances in the supply of, and demand for, graduates of higher education in the food and agricultural sciences. When total supply is related to total demand for each of the eight occupational clusters, shortages of qualified graduates appear to exist through 1985 for five clusters: scientific and professional specialists, manufacturing and processing scientists and engineers, sales and service representatives and purchasing agents,  administrators/managers/financial advisors, and miscellaneous agricultural specialists. Supply approximates demand for agricultural production and management specialists, and exceeds demand for media specialists and educators. However, several supply deficiencies were identified for educators. Information is presented on supply/demand relationships by occupational cluster, degree type (agriculture and agriculture-related), and degree level (associate, baccalaureate, master's, doctoral, and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine). Suggestions for future research on this topic are presented, and additional information is included on international employment opportunities for food and agricultural graduates.

Suggestions concerning admissions include the following areas: criteria, other ways of assessing ability, forms and admissions packets, fees and  the prohibitive costs of applying, other problems in admissions policies, and deterrents in the admissions office.

Within those categories are subcategories: indicators for short-range planning, and those for long-range planning. Some examples of long-range indicators over which the institution has little control are: shifts in community demography and labor demand, enterprises targeted for government subsidy, occupational trends, changing student profiles, and trends in student interests. Short-range indicators for conditions over which the institution has little control include: manpower markets and enrollment, four-year colleges offering two-year  programs, average student loads, and budget uncertainty. Long-range planning indicators over which the institution has some control include: physical campus environment, proportion of budget funds from soft money, and a decrease in community college transfer students. Among the short-range planning indicators with some institutional control are: admission standards and policies, hiring from within, unmet program needs, program mix and potential clientele, increasing unit costs, increase in percentage of part-time faculty, percent of faculty teaching outside their primary fields of specialization, regular faculty assigned to unusual teaching hours, staffing formulas, early retirement policies, teaching loads, registration policies, career counseling, placement of graduates, budgets for  supplies and travel, faculty salaries as a proportion of the budget, and fees for selective services.

An essay by Paul Lauter, \"The Campus,\" outlines some of the forces on campus making for change in college curriculum and feminist scholarship. These forces are categorized as \"pushes\" (women as consumers of education, existing programs providing special services for women, statistical studies of women's progress through education and into careers) and \"pulls\" (exciting developments and strong interest in feminist scholarship). Florence Howe's \"The Curriculum\" outlines the history of women's higher education in the United States and its effect on the development of curriculum in women's studies. It is noted that women's studies are necessarily  interdisciplinary and share the critical elements of general education: in short, they prepare students to make informed, ethical judgments that allow them to participate in social, political, and cultural life. It is proposed that the strength of women's curriculum grows from the relationship it projects between past and future, thus supporting the true function and responsibility of the university. (MSE)",

Solmon evaluates the prospects for nonacademic jobs for humanists, scientists, engineers, and social scientists, based on three separate studies. Projections on the probable major of undergraduates are examined to indicate the demand for faculty by subject field. Information is provided on the number of PhDs produced each year in selected humanities fields; employment of PhDs by field, type of employer, and primary work activity; and overall job satisfaction by employment sector and field of PhD. Recommendations are offered for current graduate students. In \"Robots or Reinsmen: Job Opportunities and Professional Standing for  Collegiate Administrators in the l980s,\" Robert A. Scott suggests that one probable growth area resulting from faculty job shortages is in mid-level administrator jobs. New types of administrator roles are described that will likely be created in response to increasingly powerful external agencies. Young faculty who fail to gain tenure and older faculty who lack students because of lower enrollment are probable new sources of middle-level administrators. The more experienced mid-level managers, seeing dwindling rewards and incentives in academe, may in turn be attracted to middle-management jobs in private industry and government. (SW)",

Among the findings are the following: life goals that reflect altruism and political interest declined most in importance, whereas business-related goals grew most in importance; men had more leisure time than women; professional majors had the least leisure time of all the majors; and the most  popular leisure activities were spending time with family, engaging in hobbies, sports (for men), and reading. A strong positive association appeared between job satisfaction and satisfaction with leisure. Humanities graduates had the lowest job satisfaction and the lowest satisfaction with life in general.

        "description":"The impact of the Middle Income Student Assistance Act (MISAA) program was evaluated through analysis of financial aid to cohorts of students before and after MISAA, a longitudinal examination of a sample of students before and after its enactment, and a macro-level analysis of the effect of MISAA on the relationship between income and aid. The sample of 4,092 students at 91 four-year colleges and universities were surveyed before (1978-79) and after (1979-80) enactment. It was determined that MISAA's impact was not uniformly felt across the various levels of student income: there was a greater impact upon middle-income students than upon low-income and upper-income students. This result was due primarily to the increased availability of Basic Educational Opportunity Grants: the  percentage of recipients and the average awards increased. There was also a systematic tendency for middle-income and upper-income students to receive a greater number of awards from Guaranteed Student Loan and College Work Study programs after MISAA was introduced than in the prior year. A trend toward a reduction in the proportion of National Defense Student Loan recipients among low-income and middle-income students was observed. It is concluded that the federal assistance programs were able to reach a broader spectrum of students after enactment of MISAA while still maintaining the federal government's commitment to low-income students. The MISAA caused a change in the distributional pattern of awards as well as a change in the amount of aid to recipients. Information is presented on  the research methodology, and sample survey instruments are included. (SW)",

The majority of Fund grants remain geared to serving adult women students, enhancing the career aspirations of traditionally aged women students, developing materials on women's contributions to culture and society, and incorporating them into the curriculum. However, recent activities are more focused, more sophisticated in their change strategies, and demonstrate greater differentiation in the service provided. Similarly, the Fund has given several recent grants that follow up on earlier work toward integrating career and liberal arts education.  In addition to offering more carefully delineated activities, several new grants focus on second-stage activities that build on previous work. Unfortunately, along with the increasing differentiation and specialization of women's projects there has been more fragmentation of programs. Projects and budgets for 1976-78 are listed, and descriptions of some current projects are presented. Current projects focus on educational and career opportunities for working women and working class women, educational television directed to women at home, campus-based programs for reentry women, development of a women's studies program for 12 colleges, development of a curriculum on women's literature concerning the pioneer days, and development of projects to help women enter male-dominated fields.

Highlights include these: Total enrollment  increased 7.8 percent from fall 1972 to fall 1979, with some decline in the past year; applications and admissions are also increasing. Numbers of faculty declined corresponding to the past year's enrollment decline, but overall in the past eight years, percentage of faculty with earned doctorates has increased from 37.0 to 41.8 percent. Earned degrees granted have increased for the second consecutive year, with curricula restructured to meet newer distribution of job opportunities for black graduates. On the average, 90.2 percent of the students receive financial aid, and in the past year tuition has increased by 11.9 percent, to $1,888 on the average. Endowments continue to be strengthened.

The proposal is based on the 1976 Partridge Committee report, which claims that the autonomy of the five teachers colleges has resulted in unnecessary duplication, competition, and fragmentation of effort, and which advocates repeal of the Teacher Education Act of 1972. Issues concerning the size and nature of institutions and prospects of the teachers colleges, generally and individually, are considered. The administrative structure of the proposed College of Advanced Education, and other possible options and their academic and administrative implications are considered. Among the recommendations  are the following: (1) the Teacher Education Act be repealed and the Western Australian Teacher Education Authority be disbanded; (2) new legislation be enacted to establish the colleges as independent self-governing institutions, subject to existing state legislation and the authority of the Western Australian Post Secondary Education Commission; and (3) the new legislation provide for certain changes in the responsibilities and composition of College Boards. Appended materials include extracts from the Teacher Education Act 1972-76, information on enrollments in colleges of advanced education in 1977, and a listing of approved courses at the colleges for 1978.

It was found that the reasons given by students for attending universities in the two countries are very similar, in spite of the fact that the systems of higher education in these countries are very different. In addition, the patterns of enrollment that have developed throughout the twentieth century show remarkably parallel trends, with the region immediately surrounding the university sending proportionately fewer students to the institution while areas at greater distances have increased their role in the composition of the student body. It is suggested that the resultant patterns of enrollment at English and U.S.  universities can be described as being a function of distance decay and may be explained to a large extent by the use of the potential model.

Four aspects of educational computing at minority institutions were examined: (1) degree programs related to computers and the productivity of these programs; (2) access to computers; (3) use of computers, especially applications in courses; and (4) staff for degree programs related to computer science and costs for computer installations. The fourth inventory from Hamblen's series of inventories of computers in higher education provided the database for these analyses. Findings suggest that the under-representation of certain  minorities in the computer professions seems less a problem of access to computing resources than of access to relevant degree programs and faculty members.

        "description":"A study was conducted by the Air Force to determine the extent to which takeoff/landing skills learned in a simulator equipped with a night visual system would transfer to daytime performance in the aircraft. A transfer-of-training design was used to assess the differential effectiveness of simulator training with a day versus a night computer-generated image (CGI) visual display. Twenty-four novice student pilots were divided into three groups: day, night, and control. The day and night groups received three training missions in the Advanced Simulator for Pilot Training (ASPT) on takeoff, straight-in approach and land, and touch-and-go. The control group received standard syllabus instruction (that is, no ASPT). Transfer to the aircraft was assisted by instructor pilots on two  aircraft sorties performed during daylight conditions. Results of the study indicated that (1) student performance improved significantly on the takeoff, full stop straight-in, and the takeoff portion of the touch-and-go; (2) there were no differences between the day and night groups as assessed by instructor pilot performance ratings; and (3) there was no tendency for performance to be differentially influenced by the differences in day and night scenes.

Fifty-four undergraduate bilingual students from a Puerto Rican university, who had a high degree of proficiency in the use of English but were native speakers of Spanish, were matched according to English proficiency scores and randomly assigned to one of six treatment conditions receiving externally paced audio-slide, English instruction complemented by one of three levels of pictorial elaboration (simple line drawings, simple line drawings with word labels, or word labels alone). Forty-eight  hours later subjects received a self-paced, 80-item evaluation test measuring four different areas of cognitive knowledge (drawing, identification, terminology, and comprehension); subjects also recorded the amount of time spent interacting with each task test. Achievement scores indicated a significant pictorial elaboration test task interaction. Conclusions were also drawn about the processing time data. (Author/LLS)",

The question of whether or not color as a variable in the design of instructional materials enhances learning has been approached by researchers in a variety of ways, and this paper categorizes the conclusions drawn by the various researchers. For example, one category is devoted to the effects of using color in instructional materials designed to teach verbal tasks (in nonsense and meaningful word tasks), while another is devoted to the research done on the effects of color in instructional materials designed to teach visual tasks (in passive or active materials). Additional  categories include the effects of color as it relates to information processing and memory systems, affective study of color, color in task tests, the relationship of color and time, and the efficiency of color.

The dimensions of pleasure and arousal are seen as closely related to those of evaluation and activity in a number of studies. A third dimension related to potency is also apparent in the studies cited. The model of learner interest which is proposed is based on research which shows a 3-factor structure of emotion, and on an analysis of the concept of learner interest. The four factors in the model (pleasure, arousal, competence feelings, and self-determination feelings) are related to the evaluation, activity, and potency dimensions of semantic differential research. The model may be useful as a conceptual tool to  enable one to make finer distinctions than is possible with a single dimension ranging from boredom to high interest. As a guide toward the solution of instructional problems, the model would enable more precise diagnosis of motivational deficiencies in instruction. Further, it could be used with educational games and simulations, and in the design of responsive educational media. (MER)",

Conceptually, the techniques were divided into attention-getting and attention-directing and into learned and unlearned cues. Subjects were chosen to reveal any developmental trend. Conclusions reached were that most influencing techniques used in audiovisual presentations can have an impact upon the behavior of retarded as well as normal learners. Motion, an attention-getting cue, had a strong effect for both EMR and  normal learners. Further, printed or spoken instruction to look at an object, an attention-directing cue, made significant difference in both recognition and eye movement patterns in favor of the target object. It was also noted that spatial location in the visual field, especially the upper central position in a frame, has impact upon attention to an object. The most consistent effect of attention-influencing techniques in fixed-pace media was on eye movements, which caused learners to look more quickly and for a longer time at critical information.

A posttest-only, internal-external control group design was used with three sixth grade classes serving as subjects. All classes utilized a \"step\" approach to math instruction, where students advanced through a pre-determined sequence of math skills at individual rates. Two classes, each taught by the same teacher, were used to measure treatment effects. One class served as an internal control group, receiving only math instruction. The other class received math instruction and systematized feedback. The remaining class, taught by a different teacher, served as an additional external control  class. It was included to control for possible teacher bias and received only math instruction. At the end of 12 weeks, all students were administered a 25-item test. A comparison of the scores of the three classes indicated that feedback is of significant value when applied in a systematic manner. The study confirmed the effectiveness and practicality of feedback based programs in \"real world\" settings. (Author/LLS)",

Ninety-two students at Pennsylvania State University were randomly assigned to four treatment groups. They were told the purpose of the study, assigned instructional booklets on a self-paced, individualized basis, and tested on the four criterion tests immediately following the completion of the experimental treatment. Findings indicated that simple and elaborate visual cueing techniques were equally effective in  facilitating student achievement on the criterion tasks, and selective reduction of visual step size was superior to the use of larger step size in terms of total learning and tasks involving drawing. No significant conclusions could be drawn regarding the combination of elaborate visual cueing and reduced step size or treatment groups in terms of instructional efficiency. (Author/CHC)",

Both countries are using largely imported modern communication media. The studies analyze the role of mass media in cultural life, social integration, and national development. While the context, approach, and methodology of the two studies are quite different, the initial questions had much in common: What are the effects of transfer of technology? and What is the impact as well as the content of the media? The Australian study found that modernization is not necessarily a beneficial process. This is also confirmed by the Indonesian study, which laid more  emphasis on the relationship between communication, social change, and development. Both studies indicate that, if modern communication technology is to be useful and efficient, its content and message need to be adjusted to the capabilities of reception, understanding, and possible use made by the population.

        "description":"This review of the literature on undergraduate libraries, the historical context from which they arose, and their status at the end of the 1970's points out that a long tradition of lack of concern for undergraduate bibliographical needs was broken dramatically in 1949 by the construction of Lamont Library, the Harvard undergraduate facility. Although designed to solve problems unique to Harvard, Lamont was an exemplary construction that soon captured the imagination of the academic library world. It became the model for a rash of new libraries aimed at satisfying &quot;unique&quot; undergraduate needs. These libraries proliferated during the 1950's and 1960's, a period of accelerated growth in academe. By the 1970's, however, the general financial retrenchment of American colleges and  universities had virtually halted new construction. Further, the thesis that presumed the needs of undergraduates to be somehow &quot;different,&quot; as well as the advisability of facilities effectively segregating them from the rest of the academic community, came under attack in the professional literature. Few undergraduate libraries were built during this period and several were closed or converted to other uses. A bibliography of 24 references is included. (Author)",

The data, collected for students who had at least one active unit in either full- or short-term classes, profiled students by: sex; zipcode residence; veteran status; new, continuing, or returning status; student academic background; day or evening attendance; ethnicity; age; and program of study. Major findings indicate that the typical ELAC student for both semesters was a 19-year-old, female, Chicana, day student carrying a business administration-related major. While there were no significant differences in day/evening ratios, ethnic breakdowns, and age distributions  between the two semesters, there was a 159% increase from Spring to Fall in the number of students who had not previously attended college. The percent of students in each of ELAC's 25 academic programs varied from one semester to the next, but business administration, liberal arts, administration of justice, and nursing remained the strongest curriculum areas for both Spring and Fall. The study report presents a series of tables illustrating proportional demographic changes from one semester to the next. (JP)",

Selected findings, based on a 100% response rate, indicate that 58 of the colleges charged student health  fees ranging from a mean of $4.25 per semester for full-time students to a mean of $2.18 for part-time students. On the average, 28.7% of the fees went toward accident insurance, and the mean maximum claim payment was $9,107. A variety of services other than insurance was provided by the fees, including health education and psychological counseling. Respondents indicated increases (up to 700%) in the number of clients and physician availability as a result of fee imposition. Student complaints, reported at only 8.6% of the colleges charging fees, ceased after one or two semesters. The study report analyzes findings for each interview question; data tables are provided.

The report first examines the intent of the bill, which was designed to provide financial assistance to developing institutions of higher education, and then discusses the movement for the recognition and improvement of Black colleges which, during the 1950's and 1960's, set the stage for the bill's passage. Problems encountered since 1965 in interpreting the phrase &quot;developing institution&quot; are then discussed, including the debate over whether to include community colleges, the insistence of many Black leaders that priority be given to small,  four-year colleges, and the various criteria recommended and/or used to determine institutional eligibility. Next, the report examines alleged abuse of the Title III program, including funding control inadequacies and inconsistent selection procedures pointing to favoritism. Recommendations put forward by the Carter administration for the improvement of the Title III program are then presented, followed by a discussion of the definitions for a &quot;developing institution&quot; proposed by Black leaders, community college spokespersons, and Hispanic advocacy groups during 1979-80 congressional hearings.

Indeed, emphasis on staff development alone may have negative effects in that such an approach neglects the need to adapt the organization to the new skills acquired by personnel and is ineffective in dealing with problems such as non-existent goals or inadequate communications channels. To promote organization-wide changes, managers must diagnose current organizational problems, assign them a priority, and propose, implement, and evaluate alternative strategies for their solution. The implementation of such a process may be  impeded by: failure to admit that problems exist; conflicts between currently employed management styles and the problem-solving, participative approach of organizational development; the resistance of managers to outside intervention; the lack of tools appropriate for the community college level; costs; and the lack of sufficiently trained persons. To encourage and expedite the acceptance of organizational development, staff development practitioners and university professors should call attention in the literature to the need for organizational development, offer training sessions, and make efforts to secure funds.

The study sought to develop a composite profile of these students at three stages of academic development: entry level, matriculation, and point of exit. Major characteristics of this profile indicate that, at entry, 53% of the full-time, first-time students were female and that 40% were White, 34% were Hispanic, and 24% were Black. Most (81%) were from Dade County, and 85% enrolled with the intention of earning a two-year degree. At the end of the first fall term (matriculation stage), the students had earned a grade point average (GPA) of 2.39. This average  increased to 2.62 for the 60 students who remained through the end of the succeeding fall semester, and decreased to 2.43 for the 29 students who continued on through the end of the third fall term. At the end of four years, 34% of the first-time, full-time students had graduated, with 22% going on to the Florida State University system.

        "description":"As part of a study conducted to develop an appropriate methodology for evaluating its vocational curriculum, Miami-Dade Community College (M-DCC) asked selected students, faculty, and employers to rate the effectiveness of the college in preparing students for accounting, electronics, and broadcasting technology careers. The study involved the preparation of a list of desired competencies for each of these vocational areas and the incorporation of these lists on three survey instruments. Students, faculty, and employers in each vocational area were asked to indicate, on a five-part Likert scale, the adequacy with which the M-DCC curriculum addressed each occupational competency. Survey findings, based on responses from 150 students, 16 faculty members, and 16 employers, had only  limited research significance due to the unwillingness of many employers to respond and the fact that current students, rather than employed graduates, were included in the survey because of time and cost limitations. Yet, the survey methodology itself proved valuable, in that it provided a basis for comparing the perceptions of students, instructors, and employers on the same set of questions. The study report presents a series of tables illustrating item-by-item responses and includes the competency lists developed for each vocational area. (JP)",

        "description":"A survey of the 494 entering students who received merit scholarships in Fall 1979 under Miami-Dade Community College's (M-DCC) Emphasis on Excellence Program was conducted to determine: (1) the students' sources of information concerning M-DCC and the scholarship program; (2) the financial status of the recipients; (3) the honors activities they engaged in during high school; (4) the students' educational goals; and (5) the problems they encountered during registration. Major findings, based on an 83% response rate, indicated that of the recipients (who all graduated within the top 10% of their high school class), 61% learned about the scholarship program through college mailings and 49% had family members who attended M-DCC. While 59% had planned to attend M-DCC prior to  learning of the scholarship program, 140 recipients probably would not have enrolled at M-DCC without the scholarship incentive. Financial data indicated that approximately 25% of the students received additional need-based financial aid, and that 75% planned to work while attending school. The majority (66%) earned honors credits while in high school, and all planned to earn either a Bachelor's or Master's degree. The problems most often encountered by the students during registration were filled classes (22%) and general difficulties (36%). The survey report analyzes findings on a series of tables; the questionnaire is appended. (JP)",

        "description":"Although field work can be an effective means of increasing student awareness of a particular topic and fostering research skills that are difficult to develop in a classroom, field trips are too often conducted as dreary, meaningless sightseeing tours. This pitfall can be avoided by organizing field work activities using a six-stage systems approach which relates the subject to be studied with desired educational outcomes. During Stage I the instructor determines the topic of the field work and assesses study locations and activities in terms of their illustrative and educational potential vis-a-vis the desired educational objectives. In Stage II, administrative preparations, such as gaining institutional consent, determining costs, scheduling the activity, and making  reservations, are made. During Stage III the students are prepared for the field work through an introduction to the topic in question and a discussion of the data acquisition skills that will be required. In Stage IV, the field activity itself, the students participate in observing, measuring, recording, and analyzing the field environment. Stage V offers a series of classroom follow-up sessions, and Stage VI provides the instructor with feedback via student evaluations of the experience. This descriptive essay includes charts illustrating this systems approach to field trip planning. (JP)",

A geographic, economic, and demographic profile of the Pilbara precedes a summary of its post-secondary educational demands as reflected in enrollments in para-professional, adult, apprenticeship, and college preparatory courses offered locally by the Technical Education Division (TED) and through correspondence courses. Enrollments in these courses are analyzed in terms of the corridors and towns in which the students live, and the socioeconomic, geographic, and communications factors are discussed which  led to the proposal that two colleges, serving two distinct sub-regions, be established. Proposals are presented for the nature of these institutions, including provisions that they remain independent of TED, develop strong counseling services, retain an open-door admissions policy, provide a comprehensive curriculum, and act as community cultural centers. Finally, the report discusses the legislation required to establish the colleges; examines their characteristics in terms of mission, curriculum, staffing, student services, funding, governance, and facilities; and recommends the evaluation of the current apprenticeship system.

In the first paper, James J. Zigerell reviews the following considerations in designing a television-based course of study for a national market: (1) the problem of combining discrete program units with instructional materials and organizing them to achieve measurable instructional goals; (2) the characteristics of the adult students who make up the largest market for telecourses; (3) the types of telecourses needed to meet market demand; (4) the major problems involved in planning and designing telecourses; (5) production costs; and (6) future trends.  Next, Thomas W. Hobbs discusses the history and objectives of the Florida Community College Television and Radio Consortium and examines its efforts to locate, select, and adapt appropriate materials. Finally, Dee Brock traces the growth of the popularity of telecourses, explains the reorganization of the Public Broadcasting System (PBS), and examines its projected role in providing a national delivery system for telecourses geared toward adult learning. The paper also discusses the potential role of a national organization of two-year colleges that use telecourses in the planning and operation of the delivery system. (JP)",

Selected findings indicate that: (1) most of the students were unmarried (88%), female (63%), and under 21 years of age (65%); (2) approximately the same proportion of students declared a major in the liberal arts (45%) as in vocational areas (44%); (3) nearly 75% were new to higher education; (4) 60% had graduated from Oahu public high schools; (5) only 111 students received financial aid; (6) the average financial aid award was $1,496; and (7) females received financial aid at a ratio of  approximately three to one over males. Placement test results indicate that 729 of the students needed remedial work in English, and 1,004 required remedial work in mathematics; however, less than 50% of the students enrolled in a remedial English or mathematics course.

Chapter One includes a discussion of how parents and teachers learn from each other. In addition, the physical, social, emotional and intellectual development of children are examined. The importance of establishing a curriculum early in the life of the child is explicated in Chapter Two. The way children learn as a result of home environments and the benefit of home-school communications is also explored. Special consideration is given to helping children develop positive behaviors early in life and also on involving them and their caregivers in better utilizing human and material resources. Chapters Three  and Four discuss the basic roles of parents and teachers and how these roles effect the home-school relationship. Changes in the parenting process and in the teaching process are examined. Chapter Five contains an explication of the major goals parent-teacher groups need to attend to. In Chapter Six a family-school systems approach to the teaching-learning process is described. Finally, an appendix is included which enables the reader to review ideas about parent involvement.

Subjects differed significantly on achievement, with those in the formal setting doing better. With IQ as the covariant, however, setting differences were not significant for achievement, anxiety, or self-concept. Sex  differences were significant for all variables but self-concept. The achievement of low anxious students was better than that of high anxious students in both settings.

        "description":"Between July 1978 and June 1980 a program evaluation was undertaken in Pennsylvania in order to measure compliance with state day care licensing regulations. The evaluation involved approximately 1000 licensed/approved child care centers and 50,000 children. Statistical data indicate that by the period April to June 1980 the statewide compliance percentage was well above 96%. Compliance in individual centers ranged from 63% to 100%. Although no significant statewide differences between private and public centers were found, there were slight regional differences. Approximately two-thirds of the centers completed evaluations in both fiscal years. Variation across regions again was found in the pretest to posttest comparisons, but all regional totals increased. The statewide  increase in compliance was statistically significant. In the second fiscal year (1979 to 1980) a scoring protocol was implemented. Each questionnaire item had a weight assigned to it in order to measure relative risk to children. By the fourth quarter of the second fiscal year there were only eight (out of 275) items on which fewer than 90% of the programs were in compliance. The eight items were predominately in the child health component and involved screenings and immunizations in particular. Levels of non-compliance are reported for the following immunizations: DPT, Polio, Measles, Rubella, and Mumps. Correlations between unit cost and compliance level as well as between program size and compliance level also are reported. (Author/RH)",

If fighting between siblings is bothersome, stop it. Don't lecture, moralize or nag. Once the unpleasant behavior is stopped, look for possible causes and ways of dealing with it. Children's versions of disputes and other troubles should be acknowledged, even if they are wrong. For instance, preschool children who indicate that they feel left out can be helped if adults give them individual attention and participate with them in an activity they really enjoy. It is important to reassure a child that attention will be given to each individual person's unique needs. Resist the temptation to motivate children by comparing them to others. Children can help  parents understand other children. Parents should genuinely listen to their children's insights and suggestions and let them know their insights have warranted notice and reflection. Children should be taught to take pleasure in one another's good fortune. They consistently should be reminded of their unalterable or irrevocable belonging to their parents and to each other. To do so strengthens their inner sense of safety, which is perhaps a prerequisite for the development of the capacity for brotherly and sisterly love. (Author/RH)",

The SPEAC Preschool Unit is divided into three subsections: (1) foods for growth and development; (2) food selection and consumption for health; and (3) food in relation to cultural, social, psychological and physiological aspects of life. The Teacher Workshop materials assist the teaching staff in implementing the nutrition curriculum by increasing teachers' awareness of children's habits and attitudes, acquaintance with the SPEAC curriculum, lesson planning skills and cooperative  abilities. The Parent Unit involves parents in a workshop of nutrition activities, program explanation, menu planning and basic nutrition information for the young child and suggests how to coordinate nutrition experiences and learning at the child care site and in the home. A 10 session/20 hour Workshop for Child Care Center Cooks involves cooks, preschool children and staff in nutrition education activities, promotes cooks' awareness of adequate nutrition for young children and meal planning abilities, and focuses on the operation of child care food service centers.

The principle objective of the program is to provide nutrition education and increased understanding of the role of the Child Care Food Program through increased opportunities for preschool children to participate in nutrition related learning activities. The program was designed to (1) improve the preschooler's dietary habits, (2) increase parent's, teacher's and others awareness of nutritional needs, (3) increase participation in child nutrition programs, and (4) integrate nutrition education into existing preschool curricula. Field test sites in which the program was implemented include two family  day care homes, 16 child care centers and eight public school early childhood home economics and/or parent education programs in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Program implementation involved the integration of a nutrition curriculum into existing programs, workshops for parents, cooks, and field test site participants, inservice training to describe the program and provide feedback to field test participants, and the dissemination of program results to community agencies and professionals. Project materials, including a literature review, an annotated bibliography, a curriculum and a slide/tape presentation, as well as evaluation instruments were developed. Evaluation results indicate the program was effective in increasing participation in and understanding of nutrition education activities.  Related materials such as curriculum writing and site selection procedures are appended. (Author/RH)",

Evaluation of the food service curriculum package was accomplished in part by a pre- and post-test given to program participants and to a group of food service personnel not involved in the program. Evaluation of the preschool curriculum package tested the effective utilization of Child Care Food Program Meals and learning experiences as tools for teaching good nutrition habits to preschool children. Increased acceptance of foods served under the US Department of Agriculture's Child Care Food Program was seen as evidence of improved  nutrition habits of preschool children. The acceptance or rejection of these foods was measured operationally by using a Food Acceptability Inventory to count the number of children at each site who either accepted or rejected foods served. The program evaluation sought to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in food acceptance between preschool children in the child care programs that participated in the SPEAC program and those that did not. It was possible to reject this hypothesis for three of four food groups, with breads and cereals the exception. Food service workers involved in the training did not show comparable gains in nutrition knowledge. (Author/RH)",

Volume conservation was induced in twenty-one 8-year-old non-conserving children by a procedure that combined two sources of conflict. First, the competing schemes used in making decisions on volumes were aroused; second, the non-conserver was made aware of a conserving peer's judgments at strategic points in the training. The training effects were specific to the conservation of quantity, weight, substance and interior volume. These concepts depend on the assimilatory schemes brought into conflict by the training program. The findings suggest that training based on conflict arousal between schemas, and made more salient by peer interaction is an effective stimulant to development.  (Author/MP)",

The author lists positive and negative effects of this technological advancement for children, and discusses the need for research to resolve government policy issues of regulation, and industry-policy issues concerning program  development, consumer selection and economic viability. The author takes the position that government and industry both have an obligation to inform consumer parents and their children of the possible impacts of the new technology in terms of how it is used and how much it is used with children of different ages and capabilities.

Posttests on the BSAS were collected in March of the following year. Results obtained from anlaysis of the pretest  and the posttest showed that students of teachers who used the TET in the classroom experienced an increase in positive attitudes toward school as a whole and toward their teachers in particular.

A third objective was to assess the influence of parents' teaching behaviors, including distancing strategies, on the children's representational competence. Participants in the study were 120 families that varied with respect to number, spacing, ordinal position and sex of children and parent education-income level. Discriminant function analyses and analyses of variance  indicated that both parents and children from one-child families differed from those from three-child families and that child spacing and SES were often involved in interactions that produced significant differences between groups. Regression analyses indicated that parental beliefs and behaviors and parental distancing behaviors and child outcomes were related to one another above and beyond demographic characteristics. Results of path analyses generally supported the model of the family in which parental distancing behaviors affect children's representational competence and children's ability level, and in which parental education and age and number of children affect parental beliefs.

The play materials, five sets of nine pieces which fit into five formboards, could be used as puzzles (convergent activity) or play blocks (divergent activity). All children participated individually in three 10-minute sessions. After the third session, each child was given two divergent and four convergent problem-solving tasks. There were marked differences in play behaviors with convergent and divergent materials. The formboards  directed children playing with convergent materials to spend two-thirds of their time filling the formboards.

Consistent with predictions generated form this model, sample nondepressives displayed superior recall for self-referenced, nondepressed-content adjectives. Recall for mild depressives, however, failed to benefit significantly from self-reference judgments (i.e., judgments in answer to the question, \"Does this adjective describe you?\"). Medium depressives exhibited enhanced recall for self-referenced depressed- and nondepressed-content adjectives. Results offer an empirical demonstration of the role played by the self-schema in human information processing. In particular, the findings suggest that  depressives employ a self-schema in personal information processing, but one which may differ in several ways from that of nondepressives. Further research might explore cognitive distortions or peculiarities in the depressive's evaluations, judgments, and descriptions of other individuals. (Author/CS)",

Suggestions to teachers for examining the ideas, the relationships between ideas, and the structural qualities of texts include: (1) ideas might be examined by first isolating the essential understanding students are expected to derive from a text, then examining the extent and nature of support for these understandings provided within the idea units of a text; (2) relationships between ideas might  be evaluated in terms of the probability with which the relationships are readily understood, implying that factors such as context, background knowledge, and reader purpose should be considered; and (3) the structural qualitites of expository text might be examined in terms of the ease with which ideas can be mapped hierarchically and relationally.

        "description":"The position that the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) provides a data base that is compatible with various definitions of literacy and standards of competencies and can make a contribution to our understanding of the complex and controversial problem of literacy is supported in this paper. The paper notes that since the NAEP has surveyed a national sample of four age groups over a period of years since 1971, it is well suited for looking at a broad sample and providing longitudinal information. Other advantages of the NAEP for studying literacy that are cited are its comprehensiveness across many areas of study and functional skills, its breadth within single content areas, its covering of affective and background variables as well as achievement, and its  ability to respond to new emphases, such as the proposed 1979-80 reading and literature assessment that has new exercises emphasizing comprehension of various kinds of texts. The use of the NAEP data base for the assessment of functional literacy conducted by NAEP in 1974 and 1975 for the National Right to Read program is discussed as an example of the use of the NAEP data base.

Three first grade and three third grade Anglo teachers and three first grade and five third grade bilingual teachers were videotaped as they gave regular reading instruction to their students. At the third grade level, two of the bilingual teachers gave instruction in English and three instructed in Spanish. The questioning strategies of the teachers were coded as to (1) direction of question, (2) type of question, (3) content of question, (4) questions asked by the teacher without giving students a chance to respond, (5)  student response, and (6) teacher corrections of student responses.

Eight English monolingual, seven Spanish monlingual, and eight bilingual students participated in the study. While being videotaped, each read a story, first from his or her current reading book and then from reading materials especially prepared according to the language group the student was in. The sessions were then coded using a miscue analysis system that was adapted by adding or deleting categories. The results revealed that the students  relied more on graphic information than on contextual information while reading. A trend toward increasing the use of contextual constraints of the text was found that seemed to be consistent with an interactive view of reading. In general, it was found that monolingual English readers used more contextual information than either the monolingual Spanish readers or the bilingual readers. (FL)",

        "description":"Two representative samples of expository prose from sixth grade textbooks (one in science and one in social studies) were analyzed for clarity of explanation. Four text criteria were applied to the analyses: structure, unity, coherence, and audience appropriateness. The results of the analysis suggested that many children's textbooks are not clearly written. It was proposed that the procedures commonly used by authors to make texts easier to read (shorter sentences, easier vocabulary, less detail, and use of condensed explanations of ideas) may instead cause the text to be even more difficult to comprehend. The effect of poor quality text on how well children learn to read and comprehend text may also be very great. A third suggestion, based on these research results, is that  poorly written texts may develop undesirable student attitudes toward reading texts. To combat these possible effects of poorly written texts, it was proposed that editors and publishers monitor textbook production more carefully, that teachers evaluate texts carefully and help students develop textbook reading skills, and that authors of textbooks pay closer attention to structure, coherence, unity, and audience appropriateness. (The response of one of the publishers of the textbooks that were evaluated is attached and is followed by comments from the editor of this report series.) (RL)",

A study was undertaken to discover the effects of inclusive/exclusive language on college students' reading comprehension, their determination of the quality of written materials (perceived human interest), and the likelihood of their adopting inclusive pronoun usage after reading materials containing it. Three hundred fifty-eight students were randomly assigned to one of three language conditions: (1) exclusive \"he,\" (2) noncontrived inclusive \"s/he,\" and (3) contrived  inclusive \"tey.\" After reading one of three experimental passages, the subjects were administered tests measuring comprehension, perceived human interest of the materials, and likelihood of adoption of the language form used.

The subjects were 65 college students whose reading levels ranged from grades 9.8 to 16.0. The subjects read three reading passages (eighth, twelfth, and sixteenth grade reading levels), marking their progress through the passages at 30-second intervals. To make the purpose for reading constant, subjects were asked to complete a word recognition task after reading each passage. The data revealed an almost normal distribution of interval scores around each subject's average reading rate, lending  support to the position that internal variation of reading rate was minimal. The subjects reading above the twelfth grade level tended to maintain their average reading rate for passages at the eighth and twelfth grade levels. When data for these subjects included the passage with the sixteenth grade reading level, not a single subject maintained their average reading rate.

Specifically, it investigated (1) the ways in which individuals build theories about events as they experience them; (2) the number of events an individual must experience, and how similar those events must be, before he or she begins to generalize about them; and (3) how the content of an event knowledge structure changes as it becomes based on increasing amounts of experience. Eighty-nine graduate students were given descriptions of events to read. The number of events (one, two, three, or four) contained in the stories and the level of their similarity were manipulated. The subjects were asked to write &quot;what happened&quot; in the stories they had read and these responses were  then content analyzed. The results showed that subjects exposed to only one event tended to write episodic scripts, with concrete details about the event. Subjects exposed to two or three similar events wrote somewhat more abstract scripts, and those exposed to four similar events wrote the most abstract scripts. Less evidence of generalization was present when subjects read two, three, or four dissimilar events. The findings suggested that the content of inductive theories changes as those theories become based on increasing amounts of supporting evidence. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"To understand the contributions of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) toward solving the problems of literacy and equity, this report addresses two questions: (1) How can NAEP provide useful information concerning educational equity and standards of and levels of literacy, particularly with regard to linguistic and ethnic minorities; and (2) What kinds of data can be collected and analyses performed to chart changes in literacy over time and provide clues about the types of programs required for improving literacy? Divided into three parts, Part One explores differing conceptions of literacy, ways in which NAEP can address certain of them, ways in which NAEP can serve as a proving ground for literacy measures, and potential enhancements to the current NAEP  model; Part Two explores NAEP's contribution to equity studies as a descriptive data base and a source of analytical inquiry; and Part Three examines trade-offs involved in potential enhancements of the current design. Appended are a discussion of trends for two kinds of literacy, a sampling of equity graphs, tables and statements, and NAEP publications in reading, writing and literature.

These and other factors have been reflected in recent Federal Communications Commission notice and proposed rules, in the &quot;Public Telecommunications Financing Act of 1978,&quot; and in the various proposals for the rewrite of the Communications Act. The main participants in this debate have been members of the communications  reform, policymaking, and professional public broadcasting communities. The debate has revealed changes and some inconsistency in policy toward public broadcasting, which appear to be leading to a softening of federal support for the system, to its continued politicization, and to certain public service losses. These difficulties suggest the advisability of reassessments among all involved parties--the reformers, the policymakers, and the public broadcasters. (Author/FL)",

It was hypothesized that three types of constraints (structural constraints, transitional constraints, and self-constraints) would be present to various degrees in four types of newspaper readers: regular readers, regular nonreaders, past readers who had quit reading (droppers), and past nonreaders who had begun reading (adders). These four types of readers were present in a sample of 1,201 people surveyed during both the 1974 and the 1976 election campaigns. Operational indicators included education and income for structural constraints; age and residential, marital, and occupational changes for transitional constraints; and campaign interest, campaign activity,  attention to public affairs, and political activity outside the campaign context for self-constraints. Overall, the constraints model held up well under testing. As predicted, structural constraints accounted for stable nonreading. Transitional constraints, particularly those associated with youth and mobility, predicted changes in readership status. Directional changes, as represented by the adders and droppers, were associated mainly with indicators of self-constraints. The data were also consistent with expectations that self-constraints would be a function of structural factors, the strongest indicators of readership status. (RL)",

Thirty-two Starch-scored liquor ads taken from 1976 and 1977 issues of \"Time,\"\"Newsweek,\" and \"Sports Illustrated\" were analyzed by three male readers. Starch is a syndicated research service that measures readership through the use of an aided-recall technique to establish the amount of attention given to a particular ad. The readership scores for each ad generally represent interviews with one hundred or more readers whose demographic characteristics match those of the audience of the magazine in which the ad originally appeared. The subjects were individually instructed to study  each ad carefully and, based on an \"overall impression\" decision rule, to identify it as employing either nonsensical or sexual humor (according to definitions of the terms developed from research literature). Although no readership differences were found for male readers who remembered seeing or reading some part of the liquor ads, a significant difference was found for male readers who remembered reading more than half of the ads' copy. The findings suggest that ads employing nonsensical humor are potentially more effective in attracting male readers to \"read on\" than are ads employing sexual humor. (FL)",

Many classroom practices (selection of materials, book report/test syndrome, and ineffective assignments) can be detrimental to the pleasure in reading and the building of a desire for continued interest in books. An environment can be created in which students feel comfortable about discussing their responses to their reading, including such approaches as (1) reading groups--developing small reading interest groups that suggest to students that one reason for reading is the opportunity to share reading experiences with others; (2) oral and dramatic activity--providing an aesthetic dimension and aiding comprehension and appreciation; (3) writing  activity--encouraging the student's response to what has been read without dwelling unduly upon critical reaction; and (4) media activity--making the study of literature more interesting by adding a dimension that is part of students' lives. Rather than teaching literature as a depersonalized object that has little relevance to the students' lives outside the classroom, teachers must acknowledge the great importance of the reader's personal response and the text.

A number of court cases involving photographers illustrate several tenets that photographers should try to follow, including the needs to understand privacy law, to know how captions  under photographs can make them libelous, to use consent forms in all photographic work, to register photographic copyright, and to occasionally talk to local attorneys about current issues in media law.

Some aspects of the lesson that do not correspond to our current understanding of the composing process are (1) providing no time for the conception and incubation of ideas, (2) allowing no opportunity for the use of expressive language, (3) assigning topics of little interest to the students, (4) using an oversimplified formula for composing, (5) relying on a stiff form of outlining as a necessary first step in composing, and (6) attempting to improve writing by focusing on the elimination of errors. Teachers must help students realize that writing is a process of discovery, a way of  revealing their own thoughts. They must also keep in mind how varied the writing process can be, both from writer to writer and from task to task. The writing program should be flexible enough to accommodate the composing processes with which students have experienced success, while at the same time providing them with opportunities for experiencing alternate strategies which they may adopt as part of their personal repertoire.

One hundred twenty-three college students enrolled in a basic public speaking course completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory, which measures a person's femininity, masculinity, or androgyny, and the Pearson Response to Sexism, which measures an individual's perceptions of the differences between sex roles. Throughout the quarter-long course, the students were randomly assigned to critique the speeches of other students. Approximately ten people critiqued each of the speakers. At the end of the course, ten critiques of male  speakers and ten critiques of female speakers were randomly selected for each evaluator and the total points assigned to each speech by the evaluator was recorded. The results showed that feminine females tended to be more lenient in their criticism than androgynous persons, who, in turn, were more lenient than masculine males. In addition, sexist evaluators were more harsh than were nonsexist evaluators. A high correlation between sex and sexism demonstrated that women were most often nonsexist and that men were most often sexist in their evaluations. (FL)",

Kanter's assumption that all tokens (individuals who enter a work environment where their gender is numerically scarce) respond in a similar manner to token conditions, although evidence exists that males and females respond differently. An interpersonal simulation was run to test both males and females under three different sex ratio conditions. Subjects were 122 librarians--42 males and 80 females. These subjects role-played situations in which they were members of minority groups in the ratios 19:1 (skewed), 6:1 (tilted), and 1:1 (balanced). Effects were measured using the Situational Communication Apprehension Measure (SCAM), because  responses in extreme ways would be evidence of perceived performance pressure. The degree of numerical imbalance was found to be linearly related to performance pressure, and males felt significantly less performance pressure than females under the highly skewed sex ratio conditions. Overall, Kanter's theory was supported. (RL)",

Correlational analyses failed to support the hypothesis. There were no significant correlations between rhetorical sensitivity and measures of understanding at the  individual level.

Data for the investigation were taken from an earlier survey of the communication patterns and organizational activities of that city's Hispanic-American residents. Interview data gathered from 388 respondents were analyzed to determine two types of political behavior (voting and nonvoting activities) and media exposure. Socioeconomic background data were also analyzed (sex, age, years of residence in the United States, level of education, and income). The analysis revealed that political participation of Hispanic Americans, both voting and  nonvoting activities, was not equal across ethnic groups. Results with respect to one background variable, years of residency in the U. S., indicated that with the passing of time, the Hispanics in general might become more involved in political activities. In addition, the findings suggested that the effects of mass media exposure are important for understanding and predicting how each ethnic group may or may not participate in United States politics.

        "description":"Since a fundamental problem of acting--fear--is a fundamental human problem, the basic job of acting teachers is to help their students become the kind of people who can act. Acting teachers need to help their students cast off their fears, free their bodies and their imaginations, and learn all the skills of self-knowledge, self-control, and perception so inhibited by fear and by the ego-trap that fear generates. The way acting teachers can accomplish all these things is by going to the experts in the fundamental sciences and technologies of human behavior to get the necessary information, tools, and skills. Without necessarily adopting the notion of therapeutic techniques, acting teachers need to adopt the therapeutic concept of intervention--interacting with another person to  change that person's behavior, beliefs, and attitudes. The challenge of such a teaching attitude is that acting teachers will need to re-educate themselves, learning techniques such as Alexander Lowen's bioenergetics, T'ai Chi, anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, first aid, CPR, speech science, neurobiology, kinesics, proxemics, and semantics. These studies are essential to acting teachers because they presume to tinker with people's bodies and minds at profound levels. (RL)",

A series of exercises allows students to discover how they may use their own impulses, responses, and past experiences to bring immediacy, spontaneity, and authenticity to the structure of memorized language. The exercises integrate improvisation into a training program not as an end in itself, but as a means toward making a student a better actor. The exercises also facilitate the transition between improvisations and scene work, moving students from improvisations that are designed to free a personal responsiveness to inner  impulses toward maintaining the same freedom of personal responsiveness within the structure of a memorized scene. Students can be led through exercises that begin with physical warm-ups, to games like &quot;follow-the-leader&quot; and &quot;here and now&quot; word game, to open scene dialogues in which students learn that there is no one way a line should be read, and, finally, to memorized dialogue.

This project was intended to apply research and development products to local school problems; to develop a problem-solving and product selection process usable by local schools and to organize a linkage system making national, state, and other external resources available to local school personnel. Seven projects serving over 300 school locations in 20 states were operated under the RDU program from 1976 to 1979. Preliminary findings from a study of the program suggested that engagement in RDU program activities would promote school improvement. Several variables were examined to determine which were important to the impact of the RDU program at the school level. Such  variables included characteristics of the research and development products chosen, degree of modification of externally developed products, strategies selected for problem-solving, amount of coordination with outside experts, and techniques used during product implementation. These variables were found to be more powerful predictors of success at implementing innovations at the local school level than was school &quot;readiness&quot; as measured by previous experience with innovative efforts, federally funded programs, or use of externally developed research and development products.

Federal education programs work almost exclusively through the local education agency (LEA). Federal programs can work only if the LEAs can meet the aggregate requirements they impose. The burdens imposed by federal programs are of two kinds: administrative and financial. Administrative burdens are the demands placed on LEA personnel in interpreting federal rules, planning and implementing services required by the rules, and accounting for the use of funds. Financial burdens are the demands placed on funds from local and state revenues. This paper creates an agenda for analysis of the aggregate effects of interactions of federal programs. It, first, identifies for each of  the major federal programs the features that may interact with other programs; second, identifies possible problems that those interactions might create; and third, defines questions for research on the implications of those problems for the effectiveness of federal education programs.

A major contribution of the study is its focus on Academic Learning Time (ALT) as a measure of learning. ALT is the amount of time a student spends engaged in academic tasks of appropriate difficulty. The study began as a search for information on which to base policy decisions regarding desirable competencies for beginning teachers. For a variety of reasons the study began to focus on second- and fifth-grade mathematics and reading and on experienced, rather than beginning, teachers. The book is divided into three parts with 14 chapters, each by a different author or group of authors. The first describes and analyzes the findings of  the study and connects them to a growing body of literature on the importance of time as a key influence on learning. The second explores what the study might mean to teacher educators, staff developers, teachers, and principals. The third section moves the research findings into the schools; a teacher and a principal describe how they use the findings. In addition, policy-making and dissemination are discussed as two essential concerns of large-scale research on teaching and learning, such as the BTES. (Author/MLF)",

Chapter 1 analyzes the concept of individualization. The chapter includes paradigms that may be helpful for examining some of the current programs in use. Chapter 2 treats administrative arrangements, curriculum materials, and delivery systems for selected comprehensive systems of individualization. Chapter 3 draws on research and evaluation studies to answer the question What do we know about individualization that can guide practice in schools? The fourth chapter offers suggestions to principals and teachers for individualizing instruction in their own schools, and an epilog  stresses the need for teachers to expand their abilities to respond to the needs of learners.

        "description":"In 1969, in &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines,&quot; the Supreme Court declared that both students and teachers were entitled to exercise their constitutional rights while in school. The purpose of this dissertation was to discover whether the propositions and the philosophy of &quot;Tinker&quot; have been used by state and federal courts to support intellectual freedom in the schools. The first two chapters survey various interpretations of the purpose and importance of free speech and examine the importance of intellectual freedom for education in a democratic society. Against this background, cases involving issues of intellectual freedom for teachers and students in public schools are then analyzed. Consideration is given to how the courts have balanced the preferred right of free speech with the  unique needs and purposes of public schools. It is concluded that the major importance of the Tinker case has been its recognition and reassertion of a philosophy that respects children's individuality and uniqueness. Judging from the relevant cases reported between 1969 and 1979, the degree of support that intellectual freedom has been given by the courts does not appear outstanding. (Author/JM)",

It funds a wide range of items, from school library acquisitions to innovative projects on art education and teenage pregnancy. The major objectives of this study were to describe how the Title IV program operates in states and local school districts; to assess Title IV as an example of a consolidated program strategy; and to use Title IV as a basis for understanding the role of the states in implementing federal education policy. Data sources include a survey of Title IV program officials and state advisory council members in 50 states, surveys of public and nonpublic school officials in about 600 local districts, and fieldwork in eight state departments of education and 24 school districts. The study  supports the following general conclusions about Title IV: (1) Title IV is a popular, well-run program that is praised for its flexibility and ease of administration. (2) Title IV did not result in consolidated management of former categorical programs. (3) States and local school districts vary in the substance, management, and quality of Title IV-B and Title IV-C activities. (4) Small IV-B and IV-C grants can induce substantial improvement in local practices. (5) Title IV participation of eligible nonpublic school students is uneven. (Author/JM)",

Two broad sources of information were used: contemporary research and development by other researchers, and direct investigations by the project staff. Introductory material is presented in the first chapter. Chapter 2 considers the rationale, evidence, and opinion bearing on why evaluations are done; the confusion and argument engendered by general demands for evaluation; and the audiences to whom evaluations are addressed. Chapter 3 addresses the question of how  evaluations are executed. Chapter 4 covers the organization of evaluations and the capabilities of evaluators, and chapter 5 considers quality of evaluations. The way evaluation results are used is considered in chapter 6, and case studies on the use of evaluative information are included. Chapter 7 covers recommendations. An extensive bibliography concludes the report. Legislative and management background, and research strategies are contained in the appendixes. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"The paper reviews various types of definitions of learning disabilities and presents the specific operational definition that was used in a study involving 1,105 adolescents on the relationship between learning disability and juvenile delinquency. The definition of learning disability is analyzed in terms of its principal components, types of approaches used, and varying levels of conceptualization. The fundamental presumptions of the definition are discussed in terms of the variability in their interpretation. The central cause of the learning problem is then examined, the focus being placed on the variance in the types of areas stressed and the levels of conceptualization used to describe the nature of the cause. Various modes of classification are presented and exemplified in  different remediational approaches. Against this background, the authors present the operational definition that was used in the study on learning disability and juvenile delinquency. First, the conditions under which data collection took place are discussed and the test data used in the study are presented. The paper then attempts to answer a series of questions using the data. Questions are directed toward analyzing how the measurement of the concept worked. Various factor analytic and correlation studies are discussed. (Author/SBH)",

        "description":"The paper summarizes several approaches to the identification of learning disability and then discusses the nature of learning disability in the context of competing hypotheses as possible explanations of insufficient or unsatisfactory achievement. Because learning disability may only be inferred as a cause of unsatisfactory learning, the information requirements of adequate diagnosis are postulated, and a researchable theoretical network of relationships is presented. Learning disability is seen as a breakdown either in the neurological process or a result of some physically damaging event or situation, or as an impairment of mental functioning as a result of a profound deprivation of stimulating environment. The latter alternative is seen to be highly speculative, but to afford  a possible explanation of cases of disability which do not show signs of neurological impairment. The complexity of learning disability is recognized by this approach and suggestions are made for studying the phenomenon. (Author/SBH)",

Teachers were generally satisfied with the Master Plan and saw improvements in parental involvement, the individualized teaching style, and student self concepts. Factors responsible for unsuccessful cases were reported as class behavior problems, motivation problems, and attendance problems. Integration of the learning development class (LDC) was less successful than the integration of the resource specialist class (RSP) student. Among findings related to  integration were the following: the LDC student was usually integrated for physical education; at nearly all levels more RSP students than LDC students said they had friends in the regular classes; approximately half of the LDC students said most of their friends were in the LDC room; the use of labels appeared to be at a minimum; the stigma that the students attached to special education appeared to be at a minimum, except for the intermediate LDC student; the special education students generally agreed that they were being helped; and the RSP and high school LDC students were satisfied with their placement, but nearly half of the elementary LDC students and nearly three fourths of the intermediate LDC students did not agree with their placement.

        "description":"Social, aptitudinal, and attitudinal factors that influence acquisition of a second language can also have an effect on the subsequent retention of that language. &quot;Retention&quot; is the maintenance or improvement of proficiency in a language following its acquisition. A study by G. Edwards shows that long-term retention of linguistic and communicative competence in a second language for bilinguals is a function of: (1) successful prior or initial learning, (2) opportunity to use the information initially acquired, and (3) interest in using this information. Past research has concentrated on social factors of language acquisition rather than language retention. However, since retention depends on language competence, those factors that affect competence will also affect retention.  These social factors include: (1) positive orientation toward the language group; (2) attitudes toward the learning situation; and (3) learner motivation. Of these three, motivation is the main factor linking attitudes to achievement. Additional factors are the individual's willingness to participate in activities to promote retention of the language, the perception of the prestige of the native language, and the individual's self-image when using the native language.

        "description":"This report discusses the effectiveness of current programs and personnel policies in federal agencies with respect to foreign language needs. Overall, the United States has about 16,700 federal positions requiring language skills. The General Accounting Office (GAO) found that the foreign language competence of American personnel abroad is less than adequate for maximum effectiveness and efficiency, though some agencies are better than others. This inadequacy is attributed to the fact that the system for defining foreign language skill requirements is insufficient or nonexistent, and improvements are needed in foreign language assignments and in training policy and procedure. Low foreign language proficiency limits job performance, but efforts by federal agencies to meet  language needs are hampered by: (1) inadequate planning which places insufficiently skilled people in language-related positions, (2) inadequate language training, (3) unforeseen turnover in these language-related positions, and (4) the fact that second language skill is only one of many capabilities an employee needs. Recommendations are given to help improve personnel policies and practices, language training programs, and the process for determining foreign language requirements. (PJM)",

        "description":"Four problems in children's paired-associate memory were addressed: (1) reappraisal of the presumed developmental trend in presentation mode effect during grade-school years, (2) identification of the locus of this developmental effect, (3) evaluation of the influence of combined presentation (verbal plus pictorial) relative to pictorial presentation on the storage and retrieval of pairs, and (4) evaluation of the influence of combined presentation relative to verbal presentation. Five hundred seventy-six children (144 each from kindergarten and grades 2, 4 and 6) memorized 32 pairs of common nouns by the study-test recognition procedure. Results indicated an increasing superiority of pictorial over verbal presentations during the grade-school years. This Grade x Presentation  Mode interaction was observed in the storage phase of task performance but not in the retrieval phase. Combined presentation did not influence either the storage or retrieval of pairs relative to pictorial presentation but did enhance the storage of pairs relative to verbal presentation. A developmental trend in combined presentation relative to verbal presentation was observed in the retrieval of pairs such that retrieval was facilitated by combined presentation with older children, while presentation mode did not affect retrieval for younger children. Results are discussed in terms of dual coding and elaboration theories of paired-associate memory. (Author/JB)",

Section One is a general introduction to error analysis and interlanguage studies, aimed primarily at students writing their theses and at practicing teachers with little experience in these fields. Section Two presents a list of the journals referred to in the bibliography. Section Three, the bibliography proper, includes some 800 items on error analysis and interlanguage studies, covering the period from 1970 to 1979 (including also a few &quot;classical&quot; papers from the late 1960s). The two most important criteria for inclusion are that items have been published and that they are in English. Books and articles on contrastive analysis are included only if they deal with either or both of the two linguistic fields in question.  Review articles are included. Bibliographical items are not categorized but are arranged alphabetically according to author, chronologically for each author. Section Four presents a list of other bibliographies in the field, arranged chronologically. (Author/JB)",

Two hundred eighty-four respondents represented the commercial, health, and municipal domains. Positive responses (indicating employment of personnel skilled in languages other than English) were received from 41% of businesses, 60% of health care facilities, and 79% of municipalities, thus from 43% of total respondents. The survey revealed the following trends: (1) 85% of positive responders have employees with foreign language proficiency; (2) fewer than 25% of employers include an item on language proficiency on employment applications, and fewer than 20% would consider such proficiency for promotion; (3) the most important language in all categories  was Spanish, with Italian, German, and French appearing less than half as frequently (this discrepancy was less pronounced with business respondents); (4) change in client attitude brought about by foreign-language-skilled personnel seemed most important in the health field (52%); and (5) 62% of the businesses felt that expansion might increase their needs for language proficient employees.

The first part of the study constituted a linguistic study of the family situation to discover the lexical repertory of the child in his or her native language, Basaa, as well as in the French language used in school. The second part took account of the fact that the child grows up simultaneously in two worlds, the African cultural milieu and the educational milieu. The child's native culture forms the child's understanding and organization of meaning; the educational milieu uses a language whose  form and content imply many realities totally foreign to the child. Part three compared the data from Cameroon children with similar data from French children as well as vocabulary of the native language and the language of the school. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"Three experiments were conducted to determine how children assign meaning to a multiple-meaning word in a sentence context. Fourth-grade children were given sentences in which a key word carried a meaning other than its \"primary,\" or most familiar, meaning. Two types of multiple choice questions could then follow: in the first type, the secondary, or \"correct\" meaning, and the primary were among the choices. The second type had only the secondary meaning among the choices. Findings show that when the primary meaning was among the choices, it was chosen by the children, even when it was inappropriate to sentence context and the children knew the secondary meaning. This would indicate that children were not attending to sentence context, but to individual words. They correctly  chose secondary meaning when it appeared without the primary meaning. Training was then conducted to determine which of two methods was more effective for teaching meaning: teaching contextualization or teaching individual words. Findings show the former to be better. Two explanations are offered: (1) grade-school reading instruction focuses more on individual words rather than extended discourse, making contextualization difficult; and (2) ability to contextualize may be due to the child's knowledge of different meanings of a word. Thus, context training is more effective for meaning learning. (PJM)",

The Department of State met the problem largely by lowering required proficiency levels rather than by increasing language skills. The Information Agency's percentage of appropriately filled language-desiqnated positions actually decreased, although language-designated positions represented a larger percentage of the Agency's overseas staff than they did in 1972. To improve language capabilities, it is recommended that: (1) assignment procedures allow adequate time for language training before the assumption of posts, and that strict  criteria be developed for granting training waivers; (2) the system for determining language-designated positions be based on actual job requirements and the positions be periodically reviewed; and (3) a system be developed to ensure that persons who have the greatest need for post language training are identified and given priority training.

        "description":"The meaning of children's lexical innovations is distinguished from the forms they rely on to convey meaning. Children require knowledge of the context in order to judge how the meaning of their innovation can be conveyed to the addressee. This contextualization is often achieved by default, since children tend to limit their early conversations to the here-and-now. Learning to assess what the addressee does and does not know is one factor children must attend to as they acquire the conventions of innovation. The word forms of lexical innovations seem to be acquired in a predictable order, with productive forms being mastered earlier. Children also attend to the semantic coherence of the new forms they are constructing, and regularize the lexical paradigms. This results in  choosing, for instance, a single form for all agent nouns. Other principles also operate in the acquisition of the word formation rules for a language. (Author/JB)",

Instrumental analysis of the children's spontaneous speech showed that they had distinct distributions for voiced and voiceless stops at all three places of articulation and that there was very little overlap between voiced and voiceless cognates. Comparison of words uttered in isolation with words uttered in a sentence context revealed that these children had shorter VOT values in running speech. Reanalysis of data from younger children showed evidence of such modification according to context at age 1;9. However, even at age four the data were not completely adult-like: compared with adults, the four-year-olds had longer mean VOT  values, there was a greater range of values, and there was less modification according to sentence context. The four-year-olds' data were interpreted as further evidence for the position that in producing voiceless stops in terms of mean VOT values, children first overshoot adult values and then only gradually draw them back towards adult values.

Twenty-four English-speaking children aged 4;0 to 5;0 were given three experimental tasks which investigated their ability to segment initial consonant clusters into phoneme-length units: (1) in a segmentation task they gave the first sound of initial cluster words; (2) in a grouping task they made initial cluster words a separate category or a subset of a larger category of words beginning with the same sound; and (3) in a symbolization task they used colored blocks to represent the sounds in initial clusters. The children were aware that words are composed of smaller segments and treated the segments as discrete units before they could identify the number of segments in a word. Data support the  hypothesis that children treat clusters as units before they segment clusters into component singletons. The ability to treat the cluster as composed of two parts and to relate these parts to singleton sounds correlated with the children's prereading knowledge. (Author)",

This approach tends to reduce the restrictive workings of the &quot;affective filter.&quot; Just how powerful that filter can be is illustrated by the poor results of Spanish programs in the public schools of El Paso, Texas. In this city, students undergo traditional FLES training, which amounts to hundreds of hours of Spanish instruction over a period of six years. Still, the effect of the program is to teach failure through the repeated reinforcement of awareness of communicative incompetence. Furthermore,  a linguistic continuum of native and non-native Spanish speakers exists in El Paso, rendering nearly impossible the separate placement of Anglos who would benefit from a classroom environment free from the implied intimidation of those who speak at least some Spanish at home. An aural-comprehension approach would effect a high degree of individualization, permitting real progress for each student and freeing students from what amounts to a burden to perform. (JB)",

Eight English-French bilingual adults were presented pairs of letter strings and had to decide whether both strings were words. Half of the trials contained English-French word pairs which required a \"yes\" response. Of these, half were translation pairs and half were semantically unrelated English-French word pairs. Reaction times for the translation pairs were found to be significantly faster than those of the semantically unrelated word pairs. When this result is compared against a similar monolingual lexical decision task, it is found that the magnitude of this semantic facilitation effect is much larger, both in absolute time  reduction and in the proportion of variance accounted for by the manipulation. The presence of this semantic facilitation effect indicates that the meanings of words from different languages are organized in a common area of bilingual semantic memory. (Author)",

The history of restriction and tolerance of non-English-speakers is set forth. The second section is an examination of the existing bilingual education legislation set forth analytically, but with some attention to the evolution from 1968 to 1974 and then 1978. Breadth of coverage, purposes, program design, the allocation process, the application process for program grants, and  program administration are discussed. The concluding section addresses the questions raised by Congress and recent reports which suggest future directions and issues for bilingual education. (JB)",

Two groups that work with Spanish-speaking recruits responded to a questionnaire. Results indicated that: (1) the Navy needs an ESL training program, (2) the Defense Language Institute's English Comprehension Level test should be used to screen recruits for ESL training, and (3) all recruits who speak English as a second language and who have had no prior U. S. education should be referred automatically to the ESL program. An economic analysis was also conducted.

Specific recommendations begin with the adjustment of physical classroom conditions such as lighting, temperature, seating, and acoustics. Individual needs and abilities should be defined in terms of prior education, sex, time elapsed since formal education, and previous exposure to foreign languages. Individualized instruction should be emphasized. Instruction will be relevant to older learners if material is drawn from the lives of people  their age. Self-pacing should be emphasized instead of speed. The contract approach to attainable short-term goals can be useful. Concentration will be enhanced by breaking material and study periods into short units. Visual and vocal reinforcement will facilitate memorization, and new structures will be absorbed if they are integrated into those already known. Finally, the teacher may find that anxieties will be reduced if he/she is ready to take on the role of counselor and is sensitive to difficulties. (JB)",

New opportunities also exist, since the pool of educated women and minorities has increased, and that group has an increased awareness of its political clout. It is important now not only to maintain the base of affirmative action programs already existing, but also to superimpose a new concept that encourages institutions to act more positively rather than simply try to correct previous imbalances and problems. Programs should be structured to concentrate on the  most motivated individuals and institutions, and to provide incentives rather than disincentives. A new sense of purpose and a new strategy for action are essential to all these efforts (MSE)",
