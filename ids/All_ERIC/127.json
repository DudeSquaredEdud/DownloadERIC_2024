        "description":"This monograph reviews recent literature pertaining to two-year college humanities curricula and instruction. Separate sections consider foreign languages, literature, philosophy, religion and ethics, the appreciation and history of the fine arts, history, political science, cultural anthropology, area and ethnic studies, and interdisciplinary humanities. The major influences on humanities education in two-year colleges have been the transfer institutions' fluctuating requirements and the students' desire for pragmatic programs. The humanities are not widely emphasized in two-year colleges; their role as perpetuators of liberal arts holds a priority status far below career and adult education. To maintain enrollments, the colleges have taken steps toward the pragmatic with  conversational foreign languages and interdisciplinary approaches. As it is recognized that the majority of students are not transfer students, instruction is shifting away from attempts to parallel university courses and teaching methods. The influence of the student on humanities curricula was reviewed in an earlier monograph in this series (JC 750 400). (MJK)",

        "author":["Cohen, Arthur M."],
        "description":"Institutional research (IR) in community/junior colleges in past years has been limited to gathering data for external agencies, concentrating on raw demographic data and student flow studies. IR should be directed toward providing data for administrative decisions and for successful maintenance of college operations. In spite of the heavy demands of state agencies and administrators, IR directors should consider their broader audiences in the education field. By careful reconsideration of methodology and theoretical bases, they could put more rigor into their studies. Better studies would be facilitated by organizing college records for easier computer cross tabulation, by pretesting survey instruments on members of the sample pool, and by selected population sampling.  Concentrated effort on a carefully chosen population should result in an 80 percent return, and these results are more valid than those obtained by flooding the mails with questionnaires. Given the well-documented demographic changes in two-year college populations, the IR director has the opportunity to research how the college might change to meet the needs of these new students, how the students' learning sytles can be accommodated, etc. He has the ability to translate vague college goals and student aspirations into useful designs for study.

        "author":["Amburgey, Lillian"],
        "description":"Decentralized counseling was a foremost consideration of college administrators during the planning of the first campus of J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College (JSRCC). However, since the college opened in September of 1973, a myriad of problems have developed which must be solved if a successful program of decentralized counseling is to be achieved. This document explores these problems and their solutions. Results of a preliminary survey of the attitudes of JSRCC administrators, faculty, counselors, and students towards a decentralized counseling system are reported. Also included are the results of a survey of current practices and innovations in counseling at selected two- and four-year colleges and an examination of related educational research. The author concludes that  decentralized counseling helps maximize a student's college experience and is one method that achieves a modicum of success in bridging the existing gap between an institution's personnel and instructional functions. A postscriptual report discusses the status of counseling services at JSRCC one year after this study was undertaken and offers suggestions for further program modification, fund utilization, and staff development. Organizational charts and the survey forms are provided, and a bibliography is appended. (Author/JS)",

        "author":["Allan, Beverly"],
        "description":"This paper proposes that a sound articulation procedure is one which facilitates the student's progress toward the baccalaureate degree in the shortest possible time and in a manner conducive to proper academic standards. Transfer students face problems of admissions discrimination, inappropriate counseling, insufficient preparation, nontransferability of both academic and vocational courses, and lack of financial aid. When the two-year college tries to parallel the four-year institution's program too closely, it may lose students who would benefit from other methods or who must compensate for weak backgrounds. Based on a review of statewide articulation agreements in other states, the recommendations for Virginia are: (1) no associate degree student can be guaranteed entry into  a particular program, but admission to some state senior college should be assured; (2) each senior institution should publish a list of equivalent lower division courses given at its major sending institutions; (3) these sending institutions should design their programs in cooperation with their receiving senior colleges; and (4) state senior institutions should not require any additional lower division work, provided the student does not change majors. This plan leaves each institution autonomy, while implying that a two-year transfer program must be accountable for the future success of its students. (Author/MJK)",

        "description":"Because an open door admissions policy results in a student body which varies greatly in background and developed capability to learn, the individualization of instruction is a top priority of El Paso Community College (Texas). In an attempt to determine the effects of two specific aspects of individualized instruction on the achievement of students in a music fundamentals course, the investigator used a sample of two groups of students during 1974-75. Fall semester students received self-paced instruction by programmed text and optional individual tutoring sessions, while spring semester students in the same course were additionally offered a series of group instructional sessions covering the same content as the text. In both courses students were evaluated by  criterion-referenced tests for each of seven textual units. Resulting data showed an apparent superiority in achievement for the spring semester group. The study concludes that, for courses in music theory, a program which provides each student with a choice between self-paced programmed instruction and group instruction will lead to higher levels of achievement than will classes which are limited to one individualized learning strategy only. Recommendations for further research are made and research data, bibliography, and a literature review are included. (Author/JS)",

        "description":"The steady drift toward state control of community college education is a growing issue of concern. This movement has not come from significant changes in the authority or responsibilities of the state community college boards or agencies so much as from a variety of other national and state precursors. This document attempts to establish the context of this phenomenon and then suggest recommendations for action which would address several of the emerging issues involved. These include: (1) defining and communicating the mission of community college education; (2) determining the locus of policy-making; (3) untangling overlapping jurisdictions; (4) preventing \"internecine warfare\" among post-secondary institutions in a free-market atmosphere; and (5) encouraging local initiative  in the political process. Discussed in some depth are the precursors of state control and the mission of the \"college of the community\". The major recommendations call for realistic assessment of power bases within and outside of the college, formation of a state community college agency with an advocacy role defending community-based institutions, and substantive local participation in policy-making.

The mission of this system is defined in terms of four areas: Access, Program, Stewardship of Resources, and Institution and the Community. The system is dedicated to the concept of open education with minimal cost or obstacles to the public. Ohio has developed four separate two-year college systems in the last 12 years: community colleges, state general and technical colleges, technical institutes, and university branches. The Ohio Citizens' Task Force on Higher Education made no recommendations about revamping the system to overcome the complex governance problems, choosing rather to define the boundaries of each type of college. Since expansion  in number of colleges has been curtailed, the major concern in planning is to equalize the availability of programs throughout the state. Special attention is to be given to those areas where unwarranted program duplication and unnecessary institutional competition exists. Appended is a list of technical associate degree programs available in Ohio and a discussion of the justification for inclusion of a program at any single college on the basis of demographic and manpower needs assessment for a community.

Their administrative duties included service on curriculum committees, staff selection and supervision, and responsibility for library and audiovisual budgets. More than 75 percent administered library and audiovisual services as an integrated unit, and 95.9 percent indicated some degree of acceptance for the integrated media  concept. Significantly, large numbers of the directors had library science educational preparation including graduate degrees. Few, however, had prepared specifically for a community college position and 85.6 percent indicated that an internship would have been useful.

        "description":"In view of the large post-secondary enrollments of two-year colleges, and the heavy enrollment of students from low and moderate income families, their participation in institutionally administered federal financial assistance programs appears disproportionately low. The application, state allotment, and allocation procedures do not inherently militate against programmatic participation by two-year institutions, but many community colleges simply do not apply for funds. Furthermore, two-year institutions participating in the campus-based programs are probably not requesting funds commensurate with the actual needs of their students. For comparison purposes, this paper presents an estimate of the distribution of funds under the new Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Program which  promises direct aid to students, with figures for the actual federal allocations for institutionally administered financial assistance programs (Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, College Work-Study Program, and National Direct Student Loans). At full funding of all eligible undergraduates, students in public two-year institutions should receive relatively more funds in the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Program (27 percent) than they receive through the three campus-based programs (13 percent).

        "description":"Two one-semester English courses, English 50.1 (English Fundamentals), concentrating on sentence construction, and English 50.2 (Basic Writing Skills), concentrating on paragraph development, were devised at Cerritos College (California) in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of the old English 50 (Grammar and Composition), which had combined grammar, composition, and literature. Students scoring in the lowest third on the College English Placement test were placed in English 50.1, while those scoring in the middle third were placed in English 50.2. This study evaluates the degree of student improvement in basic grammar and writing skills as a function of English 50.1. Results, based on multiple-blind pre- and post-paragraph testing of 172 students who completed the course,  indicated that 69 percent of the students improved in writing ability, 25 percent decreased in ability, and 6 percent stayed the same. The author concludes that the course improved student writing ability, specifically, ability to eliminate mechanical errors and faulty sentence structure. It was further concluded that the traditional approach of combining the teaching of English grammar, literature, and writing into one semester is not as effective in improving student writing ability as a program that divides the work into two one-semester courses. The author reviews the literature from similar research and details the methodology used in this study. A table of results, the course outline, and a bibliography are appended. (Author/JS)",

An evaluation form was devised to give a quantitative measure of the module's potential value along four dimensions: system (application of components of the learning model), approach (application of  learning principles), format (presentation medium), and content (academic material). The module was revised on the basis of the evaluation results, and was presented to a social science class.

Students are generally counseled into the programs on the basis of low scores on entry exams, and often have a history of low scholastic achievement, are returning to school after a long absence, or are educationally or economically disadvantaged. Although the programs are remarkably diverse in extent, nature, and organizational structure, they are characterized by small classes,  innovative instructional methodology, and a redefinition of the roles of instructor and counselor, assigning counseling as a part of the teaching process. The difference in organizational structure has resulted in a variety of accounting procedures; thus, little data are available regarding relative costs.

        "author":["Bowles, Bob J."],
        "description":"A random sample of 250 Hutchinson Community Junior College (Kansas) students was chosen by using the pseudorandom number generator supplied by an IBM program. Composite American College Testing Program (ACT) scores were determined for these students, and a questionnaire was administered to determine the factors affecting the students' college choice. Students were divided into three categories: academic transfer students; one, two, or three year terminal students; and continuing education students. Academic transfer students were found to have higher composite ACT scores than terminal students of either type. But the reasons and factors affecting the students' college choice proved to be statistically the same for all groups. The more pragmatic character of the community college  student is probably generated in the student's pre-college years. Emphasis on the practical application of education necessarily deemphasizes the academic achievement that is measured by the ACT. Although this phenomenon is most marked in a comparison between students of four-year institutions and students of community colleges, it is seen to carry over to the divisions within the community college itself; i.e., academic transfer students are more academically oriented than terminal students. A survey of the literature is included, and the questionnaire is appended. (NHM)",

Class size and hour and manner of instruction were held constant; students were chosen at random by the computer registration process. The sample was comprised of four Western Civilization classes; two classes of 30 students each participated in each testing option. The instructor was evaluated significantly higher by students who took objective exams than by those who took combination objective/subjective examinations. In view of the students' stated preference for the objective test format, an instructor sensitive to his student evaluation score is likely to choose the  objective test option. This tendency is often reinforced by ease in grading objective exams. However, many employers of community college graduates have long been critical of their employees' writing skills. The universal adoption of a combination objective/subjective testing format would tend to sharpen writing and organizational skills, as well as provide a more consistent basis for student evaluation of instructors.

        "description":"Instructional, administrative, and support services for adult evening education in Massachusetts community colleges are totally supported by tuition paid by enrolled students. On the other hand, day divisions of these colleges are supported by taxation and paid for by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Thus, an adult evening division student pays twice the tuition of his day division counterpart, while a part of his tax dollar supports the day student's education. This situation has been brought about by the interpretation of the 1963 law authorizing evening classes &quot;provided such classes are operated at no expense to the Commonwealth.&quot; Because evening Divisions of Continuing Education and Community Services carry out the goals and missions of the community college, the indirect  cost for administrative and supportive services could be funded through the state appropriated budget within the guidelines of existing legislation. Direct costs, e.g. faculty salaries, would continue to be funded through tuition-generated income. This report includes a summary of the proceedings of a June, 1974 meeting of Massachusetts Deans of Continuing Education and Community Services, tables of tuition charges and enrollments for 15 community college evening divisions, and a line item budget for one such division.

The ratio of male to female enrollment has steadily narrowed until, in 1974, it has almost equalized. The percentage of students enrolled only in classes after 5:00 p.m. shows a slight, but steady decline. While 70 percent of the student body were freshmen in 1963, there has been a drop of from five to ten percent in the early 1970's. Sophomore enrollment has fluctuated over the years, as has the &quot;other&quot; category. The percentage of students enrolled in less than 12 units has increased rather markedly from 1970 to 1975, now standing at 75 percent. The percentage of students taking ten units or less shows a similar  pattern. The percentage of students planning to transfer has fallen 20 percent since 1973. Although the percentage of first-time students is comparable to 1963 figures, the variation from Fall to Spring semester has dropped by approximately ten percentage points.

Relevant comparable data pertaining to the past five years were here gathered and arranged within a new instrument that allows for a comprehensive analytical view of the academic and administrative panorama of junior college education in Puerto Rico. A general overview of the historical trajectory, educational offerings, present needs, and common problems is presented. Data were gathered through a series of  questionnaires and by field interviews conducted with administrative and academic personnel. On the basis of the information gathered and analyzed, common problems seem to include the following: high cost of tuition; inadequacy of financial aid, physical facilities, and faculty and administrative development; paucity of vocational offerings; outdated teaching methodology; fierce competition instead of collaboration among institutions. Preliminary recommendations are made, pending a future study. (NHM)",

The bulk of the courses which closed early were  in occupational areas, while the general education courses remained open until the final registration period. The time of the offering did not seem to have as much influence on closure as the day of the offering. The sooner a student enrolled, the more likely he was to complete the class satisfactorily. Day students registered in the evening in order to resolve work or class schedule conflicts, or because a required class was not offered in the day.

Three major areas in which group games might foster children's development are discussed. In the socioemotional area, the rationale is that moral development, personality development, and autonomy are enhanced by the social context of peer cooperation which group games necessitate. In the cognitive area, group games are said to contribute to the development of logical thinking by forcing children to come out of their egocentricity and to coordinate different points of view. In the area of motivation, the rationale is that children spontaneously engage in group games so that such games must be naturally motivated and can therefore be powerful classroom tools. Several  competitive and noncompetitive games are discussed specifically and five criteria for good games are suggested. (JMB)",

Initial differences between groups were controlled by matching on race, sex, number of parents in the home, number of siblings, and mother's education. Data on the 282 4-year-olds participating were gathered in three ways: (1) interviews with the mothers concerning their attitudes toward their child and their child rearing practices, (2) observational behavior ratings of the child by the primary caretaker and (3) games and tasks designed to elicit samples of particular types of behavior in a laboratory setting. Some of  the trends observed in the data were: (1) family day care may tend to foster curiosity, independence, and delay of gratification; (2) home-rearing may allow girls more freedom to express interest in opposite sex toys and activities; (3) late entry into a center may lead to increased parent orientation; and (4) day care experience may decrease the tendency for children to overestimate their abilities in selecting both physical and academic tasks. The overall results of the project, however, suggested that day care experience did not produce outcomes that were markedly different from home experience outcomes. (JMB)",

Measures of final ability and amount and percentage of improvement were used to determine the progress of the 76 experimental and 33 control children. Individually, the experimental children showed comparatively fewer regressions and far more  individual improvement than did the control group. It was found that Headstart teachers, given minimal training and direction, produced substantial improvement in the music ability of their children.

Distar I was used with two first grade classes; Distar II was used with two second grade classes. Children who had completed two years of Distar instruction received traditional instruction in third grade. The possible advantages (achievement in arithmetic computation) and disadvantages (inadequate word-meaning, paragraph-meaning, and arithmetic concept skills development), which were indicated in past comparative analyses of the Distar I and II programs, were reexamined. Findings suggest that: (1) the Distar program for first graders had no advantage over conventional instruction in developing oral language ability; (2) the  second grade Distar program was strong in spelling, word study skills, and possibly in arithmetic computation; and (3) at the end of the third grade, Distar pupils appeared to perform approximately at grade level with distinct strength in arithmetic computation. Recommendations, including proposed steps toward redefining Title I populations and programs, are suggested. Appendixes contain data tables and other supportive material. (BRT)",

Since children were initially selected for the Distar program on the bases of low readiness scores, performance below grade level was not unexpected. The Distar pupils overcame the discrepancy between grade placement and achievement that existed at the end of second grade, and as a group performed at grade level at the  end of the third grade. It was suggested that instruction with the Distar system might be improved by providing greater opportunity for children to develop comprehension and sight vocabulary. (BRT)",

A total of 284 children from 10 public schools participated in the study. A booklet containing suggested teaching methods, special instructional materials, alternative methods for teaching mathematical concepts, and useful references was developed for the teachers. It included a variety of mathematical activities in the areas of set theory, numeration, geometry, and measurement. Supplementary materials, such as weekly and daily plans and a materials checklist, were also included. Activities were related to the child's real-life experiences, level of competence, and  interests; and were intended to be interesting, to encourage creativity, and to be easily incorporated into typical kindergarten activities. Three inservice meetings for participating teachers were held following the pretesting of the children. The Comprehensive Mathematics Inventory was used in the study. Despite the lack of control group comparison measures, results indicated that the curriculum design was effective. (Author/ED)",

In order to address these questions, information was collected from three sources: (1) interviews with representatives of the State agencies involved in the regulation of day care facilities and with the State employees who license day care homes and centers, (2) surveys of day care operators, day care workers, and parents of children in day care, and (3) special studies designed to check on the uniformity of application of standards and the actual compliance with standards. The findings generally indicate that the quality of licensing, monitoring, and  enforcement functions all appear to be limited to some extent by insufficient personnel and heavy workloads. Four types of recommendations are offered: (1) those intended to ensure uniform application of day care standards, (2) those which would enable day care consumers to play a larger role in day care regulation, (3) those designed to achieve more effective use of personnel, and (4) those which would improve the general effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement.

        "description":"A class of preschoolers, aged 44-63 months and grouped according to age, sex, sibling position, family size and the occupation of each parent, were the subjects of a 2-part study to examine preschoolers' perceptions of mothers. In the first part of the study, each child was shown 4 sets of pictures depicting a variety of possible mother figures. The child was asked, &quot;Which of these are mothers?&quot; with no limit on the number of choices made. The findings suggest that age of the depicted mother was the most important perceptual detail and that the 'composite mother' constructed from the most often chosen pictures in each set was a middle-aged women with medium-length hair holding her child. The number of choices made ranged from 3-11 out of a possible total of 12. It is suggested  that variability and number of perceptual details which contribute to a child's concept of 'mother' is a representative measure of his conceptual development. In the second part of the study, each child was asked to draw a picture of a mother. The picture analysis suggests that: (1) boys and young children perceive mothers as more corrective than girls and older children, (2) children from blue-collar families perceive mothers as more supportive and more feminine than children from white-collar families do, and (3) childrens' perceptions of maternal role become broader with increasing age.

A third component, the parent-based program, was superimposed on the other two by involving 20 mothers of randomly chosen children who were simultaneously participating in either the center- or home-based programs. Children in all three programs were enrolled between the ages of 12 and 20 months for a 2-year period. Statistical analyses of pre- and posttest data on an extensive battery of test  measures pooled over this 5-year period showed that both the center-based and home-based programs produced significant developmental gains, but that the center-based program was significantly more effective. The addition of the parent-based program did not result in further gains for children in either the center-based or home-based programs. (JMB)",

A selection system for caregivers evolved that enabled project staff to choose competent or potentially competent caregivers 88 percent of the time.

Preschoolers were selected for the program from welfare homes where parents were working or in job training.  The developmental progress of the children enrolled in the project was significant, especially in language development. Repeated measures were also taken in cognitive, psychomotor, and social-emotional areas, and in every case, the children maintained or increased their rate of development. (BRT)",

Evaluation measures used were the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the RAVEN Coloured Progressive Matrices, and eight representative Piagetian tasks on seriation, classification, transitivity, conservation, measurement, and class inclusion. Normative longitudinal and  cross-sectional analyses were used to examine data within the general area of the acquisition of cognitive abilities; within-stage intraindividual performance correspondences, developmental sequences in task performances, experimental/control group comparisons, and sex differences in task performance.

Pretests on the three variables were administered in May and June of 1972 and posttests were administered in May and June of 1974. In addition, data related to teacher attitudes and classroom environment and practices were collected and analyzed. The results of an analysis  of covariance did not provide support for any conclusive comprehensive statements concerning the relative effectiveness of the open or the traditional instructional program. However, there was evidence to suggest that the open classroom instructional program effected positive changes in the affective areas of self-concept and attitude toward school.

A secondary study compared the characteristics of more recent transracial adopters with those of 125 families who had adopted transracially in the past. Results of questionnaires given to the 38 families and their social workers showed that families were generally well satisfied with their agency experiences. Discrepancies between reports of social workers and parents suggested that communication barriers existed and that many of the social workers had a somewhat limited understanding of the adoptive parents. The two sets of parents (present group and past group) were found to be fairly  similar in terms of attitudes about transracial adoption and child rearing. Information obtained from interviews between social workers and parents is presented in addition to data on the demographic and social characteristics, motivation for adoption, and attitudes on racial issues of the adoptive families.

Characteristics considered Machiavellian were tendencies toward manipulating other people and using other people to one's advantage. Basic demographic information was collected from 94 directors in 101 day care centers in the St. Louis area, and analyzed with scores on the Mach IV scale, which quantifies a person's general strategy for dealing with other people. Results showed that directors of proprietary day care centers tended to exhibit more Machiavellian characteristics in interaction with others, such as staff members, parents, and children than directors  of nonprofit day care centers. Whether the director directs more than one center was also found to be predictive of the Mach IV score. It was suggested that proprietary day care center directors may have to manipulate others for economic survival. (BRT)",

The program, in operation for nearly 8 years, can accommodate 60 children. Description of the instructional program was obtained through participant observation, photography, and audio tape analyses of teaching skills which facilitated children's social and cognitive development. Participant observers concentrated on interaction patterns among children and between children and teachers. The description reveals that the predominant instructional skills were telling, explaining, clarifying, and questioning (these terms are defined). Student outcomes were assessed using the Denver Developmental Screening Test and the  Cognitive, Speech and Language sections of the Evanston Screening Packet. Prekindergarten children did significantly better on two of the 32 tasks of the DDST; while children without prekindergarten did significantly better on four of them. It was felt that the program successfully modified and reduced deficiencies that may have existed in the experimental children. Recommendations are made. Appendixes (nearly one-half of the report) include a rationale for descriptions of the instructional program and copies of the screening instruments used. (Authors/ED)",

        "description":"This report presents a cumulative risk score system designed to identify high-risk infants through multiple assessments over an extended period of time. The system scores prenatal, natal, and neonatal biological events and neonatal behavioral performance in an additive fashion. Infants are assessed in the first month of life to distinguish those babies with transient brain insult from those with permanent brain injury. At 4 months and 8-9 months of age the infants are again tested, primarily on a behavioral basis. The researchers were concerned with the later adaptation of the infant to his environment regardless of any biological deficit. Therefore, a child with motor or sensory handicaps who progressively compensates sufficiently so that he does well cognitively and affectively  removes himself from the risk category. Five examples of the use of this system were presented. The researchers expressed concern about labeling infants \"high risk\" too early in life because such a label can be very disruptive to caregiver-child attachment and interaction. However, intervention was advocated for those infants with persistent developmental problems which make them vulnerable to any adversity in their environment. (Author/BRT)",

        "description":"This paper examined the case for public subsidization of child care services from the point of view of an economics theory. It was suggested that public subsidization could be justified either as a way to correct a distortion in resource allocation or as a way to change inappropriate income distribution. The allocative argument consisted of three issues: (1) whether subsidization of day care is the most economically efficient means for helping poverty children become &quot;respectable&quot; citizens, (2) how child care responsibilities cause discrimination against women when they choose to work outside the home and how changing the day care situation might help and, (3) whether a public role in day care is necessitated by parents' lack of knowledge about the quality and long term effects  of the day care their children are receiving. The income distribution argument was discussed in terms of improving long-run economic opportunities for disadvantaged children and mending inequalities between families. Specific conclusions were drawn with regard to such day care issues as tax deduction, parent education, and welfare families. The general conclusion was that substantial public subsidization of day care did not seem justified on the basis of information now available. (JMB)",

Current early education trends are discussed as a basis for planning for the future. The factor identified as being most important to a preschool child's perception of the future (his aspirations and the behaviors necessary to achieve them) is the occupational expectations his parents have for him. Women, ethnic minorities, and children of poverty-stricken families are viewed as \"future deprived\" and in need of special attention in this area now. Several things that early childhood education programs can do to help children develop a better future-focused role image are: (1) emphasize the development of coping skills, (2) help  develop the joy of learning so children will be motivated to keep on learning, (3) teach problem-solving skills, (4) help children develop a good present self-image by helping them become competent and teaching them to behave acceptably, (5) include career education, (6) emphasize cooperation rather than competition, and (7) get parents involved.

Children in both first and third grades seemed to be absent less in  classrooms where there was a higher degree of child independence, child questioning, adult response, individualized instruction, and open-ended questions and where children and adults showed more positive affect.

The programs chosen represented a wide spectrum of innovative educational theories. The range included two models based on positive reinforcement theory, a model based primarily on cognitive developmental theory, an open classroom model, and three other models drawn from Piaget, Dewey, and the English Infant Schools. Non-Follow Through classrooms were observed for comparison. Results showed that time spent in reading and math activities and a high rate of drill, practice, and praise contributed to higher reading and math scores. Children taught by these  methods tended to accept responsibility for their failures but not for their successes. Lower absence rates and higher scores on a nonverbal program solving test of reasoning were attributed in part to more flexible instructional approaches in which children were provided with a wide variety of activities and materials and where children engaged independently in activities, selecting their own groups part of the time.

Sessions were tape-recorded. The number of father behaviors occurring in a 30-minute period were computed according to 25 pre-selected categories. The children were subsequently tested on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and on a set of standardized Piagetian tasks to assess their intellectual competence. Factor analysis of the 25 categories of father behaviors yielded 4 factors for father/son interactions and 6 factors for father/daughter interactions. Significant differences  were found in the relationship between the behaviors of fathers in different social classes and the measures of their sons' cognitive functioning; but no such significant correlations were found between father behaviors and daughters' cognitive measures (although father's occupation became a significant predictor variable). Findings were discussed in terms of the child's sex role identification, and the observed differences in the behaviors fathers exhibited towards sons and daughters. (ED)",

In El Paso County (Texas), 56.9 percent of the population is Spanish surnamed; New York City has over 2 million Spanish surnamed people. These citizens are consumers and contributors of service in both the public and private sectors. Every professional able to offer service to clients in more than one language, as the need arises, is of far greater value. Recently there has been a slight resurgence of bilingual education in the United States, although too little is being offered in most areas to meet any existing need. Bilingual/bicultural education is generally defined as \"a curricular model through which the student is made competent to function socially and professionally in 2  languages, and further, becomes sensitive to the cultural, behavioral, and attitudinal ramifications of each\". When considered in these terms, the goal of instruction is not merely remediation, but the full development of the student. Therefore, the cultural component in bilingual education is, in every sense, essential. This paper discusses the rationale for a bilingual/bicultural program. A model for such a program is briefly described. (NQ)",

Therefore, the Council has never assumed the task of organising the free movement of manpower nor of encouraging movements of workers in Europe. However, once these workers are admitted into member states, it is incumbent upon the Council, in conformity with its Statute, to propose to governments measures for their protection and assistance. These measures have been the subject of recommendations to governments by the Committee of Ministers regarding: (1) living, working, and training conditions for migrant workers; (2) human and social problems; and (3) problems arising  upon the return of migrant workers to their home country. The Committee of Ministers has adopted 2 resolutions: (1) Resolution (68) 18 -- the teaching of languages to migrant workers and (2) Resolution (70) 35 -- school education for the children of migrant workers. This document consists of reports of the action taken by Italy, Belgium, Sweden, France, and Turkey in response to these resolutions. The resolutions are also given. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"Urban and rural small scale industry and employment generation in Sierra Leone, Africa were studied via a 2 phase procedure. Phase 1 data collection (March-June, 1974) involved a random sampling procedure based on locality size. The following information was obtained from each of the localities (cities, towns, and villages) and &quot;enumeration areas&quot; (200 families) surveyed: (1) type of activity; (2) number of workers, including the proprietor, hired workers, and apprentices; (3) type of workshop; (4) number and kind of machines used. Phase 1 results indicated Sierra Leone small scale industry was extensive both in terms of establishment number and employment. Establishments were found to be small (1.9 workers per industry) and predominantly rural (95 percent). Activity composition  (tailoring, carpentry, gara dyeing, and baking) varied considerably by location, an indication of the importance of making distinctions between industries in urban and rural areas. Still in progress, Phase 2 involves enumeration twice weekly of a sample of 366 industrial establishment during a 1 year period (1974-1975) for purposes of determining key structural parameters of the rural small scale industrial sector and the intersectoral linkages uniting this sector with other parts of the economy, thereby identifying major determinants of the demand for labor in rural small scale industry.

Patterns of congruency and deflection in occupational and educational attitudes and attainment were analyzed for 427 white and 268 black males. The following related phenomena were examined in terms of occupation and education: (1) aspirational levels; (2) expectational levels; (3) attainment levels; (4) the deflection and (6) the deflection between attainment and aspiration. Aspiration and expectation levels for future occupational and educational attainment were apparently &quot;unrealistic&quot; in terms of available  opportunities and appeared to be marginal when related to present attainment. Although among the whites the level of these variables somewhat exceeded those found among the blacks, both groups generally were found to have unrealistic and optimistic attitudes. It was hypothesized that unrealistic future orientations can have positive consequences in a success-oriented society for those who are not succeeding, since by projecting future achievements, they do not have to admit failure.

        "description":"Variations in the level of female political participation were examined in the context of the &quot;standard&quot; model of political participation (higher socioeconomic status, urbanism, living at society's center, increased participation) and the &quot;decline of community&quot; model (decreased group membership, increased mobility, decline of community &quot;boundariness&quot; and continuity, loss of sense of &quot;stake&quot; in community, participation). Female political participation was measured via observation of participant number and verbal response in 44 Vermont town meetings in 1970-71. Hypotheses tested were: (1) women will participate more in those towns where many women hold officer's posts than in towns controlled by men; (2) in those towns where the participation levels in politics are generally high,  female participation will be relatively higher than in towns of low participation; (3) towns with relatively high ratios of female participation will be &quot;modernizing&quot; towns. It was concluded that the &quot;standard&quot; model was ineffective for purposes of explaining female involvement in town meetings. Variables identifying towns with higher socioeconomic status did not identify those towns with higher female participation, but modernization variables did, as female verbal response was more equal than that of men in small towns with fewer family farms and population increases.

Examined were hypotheses stating size of family of orientation is: (1) positively related to size of family of procreation; (2) more strongly related to size of family of procreation among 1st born children than among later-born; (3) more strongly related to size of family of procreation among those not experiencing intergenerational change in lifestyle than among those experiencing such change; (4) more strongly related to size of family of  procreation among those satisfied with the family orientation than among those dissatisfied. Employing regressive analysis, it was found that the number of siblings in the family of orientation influenced the size of the family of procreation and that this relationship was stronger among women who were: (1) first born; (2) not experiencing intergenerational change; (3) and were satisfied, at age 16, with their parental family.

Using telephone books and directories as secondary resources, surveyors conducted a &quot;windshield survey&quot; of 81 Clinton County and 21 Tug Hill crossroads, wherein those services visible from a car were listed. Data analysis involved ordering commercial and public/professional services via the Guttman scale, a cumulative measure of complexity, which revealed the  relationship between the appearance of 1 service and that of another. Comparative analysis of the 2 areas indicated that use of the Crossroads Survey and the Guttman scale could be most valuable in the assessment of services regardless of differences in political boundaries or population factors, since a comparison of the 2 commercial scales revealed a general patterning and a rank order correlation of .77, and comparison of the 2 public/professional services scales showed a rank order correlation of .88.

        "description":"Utilizing an ex-post-facto experimental design, all occupied households located within the rural area of Canton San Carlos in Costa Rica (La Fortuna) were studied in August of 1972 for purposes of testing the hypothesis that electricity use is positively associated with level of living. Interviews with 452 heads of households (when possible) provided information on household members' age; sex; occupation and education; migration and propensity to migrate; mass media exposure; occupation and employment; land use and ownership; level of living; social participation and satisfaction with life situation. Based on data derived from the San Carlos Rural Electric Cooperative records and interviewer observations, electricity user categories were established as follows: (1) users (persons  who had access to electricity and used it); (2) non-adopters (persons who had access to electricity but did not use it); and (3) inaccessibles (persons who were beyond the reach of power distribution lines). Controlling for size of household, education of household head, age of household head, and size of farm, Belcher's 1972 level of living scale was employed for analysis. Data supported the hypothesis, and it was suggested that consideration be given to the implications for developmental investment decisions and further research. (JC)",

        "description":"Perceptions of schooling among Chicano students were compared in 1974 with those of whites, blacks, and Asians in San Francisco comprehensive and general high schools. The primary data source was a questionnaire administered to 770 students in 8 schools. Some common beliefs about the educational values of Chicano students and their parents were explored and shown to be myths. Chicano students cared about school and were not alienated from it. They saw a close link between their schooling and their future occupations. They also reported that their parents and others who mattered to them considered education important. But Chicano performance in high school did not fit this image of students who cared deeply about schooling. Chicanos entered high school relatively low in verbal and  mathematical skills. Warmth and Friendliness were used by teachers as mechanisms to control these low-achieving students. Teachers also gave more praise to students who were lowest in academic performance. Teachers' failure to set challenging standards led Chicano students to a false view of their own level of effort and skill. The students' faulty self-assessment helped perpetuate a pattern of institutional discrimination. The warm and positive acts of teachers led to the preservation of the existing structure of inequality. (Author/NQ)",

Utilizing data derived from the U.S. Census of Population (1960 and 1970) and the County Business Patterns (1959 and 1970), a national sample of 276 rural counties was examined. The variables employed were: (1) the number of county residents unemployed; (2) the percentage of families below the poverty level in 1970 (1969 income); (3) the level of manufacturing activity defined as the total number of manufacturing jobs relative to the total number of jobs in the county; (4) median age; and (5) median level of education. Data indicated that when  level of manufacturing activity was defined in terms of labor force composition, there was not a significant amount of variation in unemployment or poverty levels. Moreover, it was found that weak competitors (persons 65 years of age or older, females, persons with less than high school education, and persons not employed) did not benefit from industrial relocation. It was concluded that the Federal Government should consider a group-specific regional policy, directed toward the market-relevant resources of the rural poor and unemployed, rather than toward industry and regional development commissions.

The schematic models employed were  analyzed in terms of the following regression equation: year of total revenue or its component=level of manufacturing + population size + median family income.

These structural changes, especially in the area of occupational change, were found to be \"powerfully\" related to changes in manufacturing; however, it was surmised that since interpretation of social change is difficult at best, the relationship between industry and mental disorder is less than simple.

Emphasis was upon the determination of: (1) personal and situational factors which are explanative of the father's or son's perception of decision-making involvement and (2) the multiple effects of these factors on decision-making. Lists of father-son farm operations were obtained from county extension agents. In order to be included on the list, the farm had to possess the following characteristics: (1) operated jointly (to some degree) by a father and son, and (2) the son had to be 17 years of age or older and working full-time on the farm or intend to enter farming or take over the farm. Data were  obtained from 145 father-son farms located in 13 selected counties in Kentucky. Two scales measuring the individual's perception of task involvement and general decision-making were developed, with 12 items comprising each scale. Among the findings were: (1) older fathers perceived that their sons participate more in decisions and farm tasks than did younger fathers; (2) the son's perception of his own decision-making involvement varied directly with age; and (3) greater commitment to the joing operation was reflected in perception of a larger personal role in decision-making.

Representative samples of approximately 250 students were drawn at each level from 4 counties varying by the physical presence of higher educational institutions. Assumptions buttressing the model were questioned for this sample, and effects of SES and MA on the performance variables were hypothesized to vary by grade level. Specifically, it was hypothesized that due to the heavy screening of students by SES prior to the secondary level, the effect of MA would increase and  that of SES decrease at the gynasium level. It was further hypothesized that AP and SOI would exercise more important roles as intervening variables between SES and MA, and the aspiration variables at the gymnasium level. Data were obtained from closed-ended questionnaire items; where operational equivalents were impossible to use or were deemed less appropriate, functional equivalents were used. Working hypotheses were tested using path and path regression coefficients. SES was found to increase in importance as a determinant of EA and OA, and the mediating effects of SOI and AP between SES and EA decreased at the gymnasium level. (Author/NQ)",

Attended by approximately 1,500 people from 49 States, Puerto Rico, and Canada, the conference was divided into 12 basic subject areas, which constitute the following major report divisions: (1) Self-Government in Rural America; (2) Rural Poverty; (3) Land, Resources, and People; (4) Rural Health; (5) Agricultural Production; (6) Employment, Jobs, and Training; (7) Housing and Community Development; (8) Energy and Rural People; (9) Public Education; (10) Rural Economic Development; (11) Rural Public Transportation; (12)  Rural Justice and Legal Assistance. Major themes found interwoven among these 12 areas of concern are identified as follows: (1) the belief that sooner or later everyone will move to the cities and live happily ever after is \"factually false and morally offensive\"; (2) a new national policy is needed which recognizes the right of people to live where they choose and is sensitive to the survival of rural America; (3) Congress must redress long-standing rural inequities; (4) solutions to rural problems must be \"rural\" solutions; (5) to avoid the urban emphasis in national planning, rural \"desks\" should be established in appropriate Federal agencies.

        "description":"Twenty-seven social service agencies in Anchorage, Alaska were examined for purposes of determining the: (1) organizational structure of Anchorage social service systems, (2) impact of agency structures on Alaska Native clients, and (3) extent to which agency organizational structures reflect the interests and values of bureaucrats and professionals. Thirty-three administrators, 46 staff members, and 50 clients from agencies most closely associated with Alaska Natives were interviewed. In addition, four community planning groups were studied. The Anchorage social service system was found to have destructive consequences for its clients due to: (1) fragmented services, (2) underfunded services, (3) irresponsible referral practices, (4) lack of knowledge about Natives, (5) lack of  expectations for evaluating agency effectiveness, and (6) a ritualization of interagency planning. Among the sample clients, it was found that one-third had had beneficial agency experiences (those least dependent on the agencies); one-third could not be clearly categorized in terms of agency outcomes; and one-third had had destructive agency experiences (those most dependent on the agencies). Moreover, it was found that agencies were organized in ways that promoted and protected white interests. It was proposed that Native organizations be given the financial resources to operate social service systems for Natives. (JC)",

        "description":"Resolution of conflicts and disputes in traditional Athabascan society was based on assumptions that: (1) the authority of the leader was absolute, for as representative of both village and victim, he was limited only by the fact that the crime had to be serious enough for third party intervention and that severe sanctions demanded village consensus; (2) once called before the village authority, an individual was already determined guilty; (3) the offender was called before the village authority to redress both public and private wrongs via repentant reconciliation. Besides its authoritative character, Athabascan law entailed flexibility and deliberateness. Flexibility was manifest in formal checks on the chief's authority and the personalistic nature of legal proceedings, while  deliberateness was manifest in the lack of haste in the decision making process. Among the modern day problems posed by traditional Athabascan law ways are: (1) failure to perceive the legitimacy of white legal authority, since such authority is delegated to figures of &quot;low&quot; status; (2) lack of parallels among the laws most frequently invoked against Athabascans (drunkenness, petty assult, etc.); (3) an impersonal vs a personal justice; (4) an assumption of innocence rather than guilt; (5) lack of parallels in the defendent/prosecutor process; and (6) abstract laws.

Differing from school to school and from community to community, the most consistent rural and small schools problems are: (1) low level of instructional quality, (2) inadequate physical facilities, (3) financial instability, (4) less than desirable instructional resources and materials. Moreover, rural and small schools are not receiving their proportionate share of Federal educational funds, and State education offices are encouraging elimination of rural and small schools via financial allocation systems which reward large school districts and penalize small school districts. Despite these problems and prevalent criticism of the rural and small schools concept,  some educators believe rural and small schools can provide a good climate for positive social behaviors among children, as well as revive and improve the total social climate in America. The 11 annotated book citations and the 20 annotated periodical citations presented herein are important works dealing with aspects of the following major issues in rural and small school education: (1) finances, (2) program quality, (3) staff development, (4) community control, (5) special needs learners, (6) physical facilities, and (7) appropriation of State and Federal monies.

Data used to assess dimensionality, applicability, and correlates of community satisfaction, were derived from Putnam County, Illinois via a 1971 area probability sample survey which provided responses from 1,166 heads of households on 15 community satisfaction items. Results of  factor analyzation revealed four relatively independent dimensions-satisfaction with public, medical, commercial, and educational services. While significant differences of means were found for the medical and commercial dimension of community satisfaction among the three residential strata, an analysis-of-covariance model revealed a similar pattern of relationship between the objective indicators and each of the four dimensions of community satisfaction, indicating the need to develop social indicators based on individualized subjective evaluations of environment.

        "description":"This thesis investigated the effects of certain personal and situational variables on the acquisition sequence of graphical interpretational skills. A comprehensive learning hierarchy of basic graphical interpretational skills was prepared according to the method of task analysis proposed by Gagne, and was subjected to a series of empirical validation studies. These studies involved the preparation of a comprehensive instructional programme, with appropriate questions inserted after each interpretative skill; the same hierarchical network of graphical interpretation skills was substantiated in each of the validation studies. Subsequent studies with interstate and overseas students were used to test the possible effects of differences in curricular and cultural background, age and  nominal academic level. Each of these studies produced similar validation results. The author concludes that the acquisition sequence of graphical interpretational skills may be largely independent of the specified personal and situational characteristics examined in this research. An extensive analysis was also made of possible subdivisional skills within each of the basic intellectual abilities. In addition, this analysis involved the development of a new statistical test for the difference between two dichotomous skills. (Author/MLH)",

        "description":"Individualized Learning System Chemistry (ILS Chem) is a multi-media approach to learning basic chemical principles and their application to man's daily existence in which the student proceeds at his own rate through a series of instructional loops. This is a computer-managed, competency-based instructional system in which the individual student is assigned learning experiences on the basis of his performance. This sequence of instructional loops, primary, remedial, and enrichment, may contain readings, audio or video tapes, field experiences, journal references, films or film loops, conferences, or computer-assisted instruction modules. The computer system also permits the random generation of comparable, criterion-referenced examinations and their scoring. The results of using  this approach in Introductory Chemistry at West Chester State College during the past two years showed that the ILS Chemistry students consistently demonstrated a more favorable attitude toward both chemistry in general and their particular class than did the traditional chemistry students. There also exists evidence to suggest that ILS Chemistry students learned more chemistry than did their traditional counterparts in one evaluation and produced cognitive results at least as good as the traditional classroom in another evaluation.

        "description":"This study attempted to determine if there was a stable and preferred mode of perceptual organization and conceptual classification of stimuli which influenced the ability of female pre-service elementary teachers to acquire the science concepts presented in a general elementary credential preparation course. It is an example of ex post facto research where a measure of the science concepts presented in the course provided the criterion test (dependent variable) for the study. Considering the strong dependency of achievement upon intelligence, a two-way analysis of variance was performed, utilizing data from the Henmon-Nelson Test of Mental Ability for the other factor. A modified (adult) version of the Sigel Cognitive Style Test (SCST) was given to all females in the sections  taught over a period of two semesters. Significant SCST contrasts occurred only with the Achievement in Science factor. For high and low achievers of science concepts, the findings indicated that a person's cognitive style influences his intellectual ability to grasp and understand new meanings. In this context, cognitive style was translated as learning style. It was concluded that the study supported much of the research involving children. (Author/EB)",

Based on the assumption that language and social structure are very similar, such a program could be feasible. However, in Papua New Guinea with its diversity of cultures, and each culture evolving its own language, and language the way in which reality is represented, this surely led to confusion and misunderstanding. The author sent to all field staff a specially-constructed questionnaire related to their understanding of math/science concepts and the degree of difficulty the staff encountered  in expressing these concepts in their own vernacular. Using the resultant data, the author suggests possible approaches that could be used to deal with conceptual difficulties encountered by students. Teacher awareness, consideration of student involvement in activities and then attempting to derive a concept is a method proposed and schematically presented. (Author/EB)",

The study reported is confined to the period since Semester 1, 1972, at the University. A normal student course load is considered to be 12 points. Anything over this constitutes an overload. A marginal differences does frequently occur so this study deals with overloads of 15 points and above. A brief description of the grading system is presented. Information on overloading students, how they performed in the semester prior to that when they were carrying an overload, is presented in  tabulated form with descriptive text for each data table. Achievement of students in terms of their mean performance before and during overloads is presented in tabulated and descriptive form. It was noted that there was very little incidence of failure among overloaded students. Plans for developing a flexible procedure for determining whether students be allowed to overload are encouraged. (Author/EB)",

The focus of the current experiment was determination of the compatibility of identified rules with the knowledge of average teenagers, and of the extent to which instruction in higher order rules facilitate performance on geometric construction problems. Higher order rules were presented as flow charts defining four paths. Thirteen construction problems, each solvable by using these rules, were defined. Coincidentally, these problems involved 13 lower order rules. Thirty college students, enrolled in a geometry course, served as subjects. Two pretests, three posttests, and seven instructional sessions were used in a repeated measures  design; the sequences in which higher order rules were studied defined the treatments. Overall, findings indicated that instruction on higher order rules was effective and was relatively efficient. Sequential effects were also discovered. (SD)",

These programs should aim at development of the ability to use measuring instruments and to estimate quantities in metric terms, rather than at conversion of units. Parent education nights are also advocated. A list of basic equipment needed for metric instruction and another of journals and other  resources concerned with the metric system are provided. (SD)",

        "description":"The relative homogeneity of individual value orientations in 11 contemporary nations is the subject of this paper. In macro-sociological discussions, particularly of the polity, there are frequent assertions about the relative homogeneity of a people and of their culture, but these assertions are rarely specified or derived from quantitative empirical investigations. A review of the literature on cultural homogeneity and individual value orientations indicates that there have been major obstacles to computing societal scores of the relative degree of homogeneity in individual value orientations. A new approach is proposed which avoids the obstacles encountered in previous efforts by assuming that attitudes are a reflection of values and, thus, inferring the heterogeneity of value  orientations through a study of diversity in attitudes. Scores are computed for 11 nations and several propositions are considered in an effort to account for these national scores. In addition, suggestions are made for the application of this new approach to other levels of analysis. (Author/ND)",

Using Mertonian analysis, three premises are central to the study including: (1) pressures to deviate occur when people are deprived of access to legitimate means to attain a desired goal; (2) differential rates of deviance among groups are a function of the distribution of these pressures; and (3) four different deviations to the pressures are possible including conformity, innovation, ritualism, retreatism, and rebellion. Applying Merton's model to school behavior, analysis reveals that restriction of opportunity to achieve academic success is a major source of school deviance. These pressures to deviate are strongest  among minority racial groups with lower socioeconomic status. Response adaptions to this pressure are also patterned according to status. White, upper class students respond to the pressure with innovation, while lower socioeconomic status minority students respond with retreatism and rebellion. (Author/DE)",

The concept of &quot;legitimation,&quot; as formulated by Peter Berger and Thomas Luckman is applied to analyze several historical and contemporary educational ideas which are utilized as legitimations of social conditions. Discussion is presented on the different levels of pre-theoretical and theoretical propositions. Two considerations are 1) that ideas about schools and schooling legitimate some aspects of the institutional order, and 2) that the institutionalization of education as schools and school systems legitimates from the point of view of the general public. For both the focus must ultimately be on ideas  at the level of everyday or common sense knowledge because it is the general public for whom institutional arrangements and practices must be legitimated. Two supporting examples illustrate a) the role of educational ideas in legitimating gradations in status and income as an aspect of social order, and b) a way in which schools are legitimated in the eyes of the general public. A need for more extensive inquiry into legitimation is suggested. (Author/ND)",

The purpose of the research was to find which, if any, of the independent variables identified are statistically significant predictors of stage of moral reasoning and choice of right action, and what portion of the variance in the dependent variables is explained by the successive contribution of the independent variable. Stage of moral reasoning was assessed on four separate clusters of moral dilemmas using an interview  schedule, tape recording, and scoring of transcript according to procedures developed by Kohlberg. Choice of right action was determined by asking the subjects the right thing to do in each moral dilemma. Results showed that, although the amounts of variance explained were small, age and empathy were the primary predictors for stage of moral reasoning and biographic variables were the primary predictor variables for choice on moral dilemmas.

The author speaks mainly of highly industrialized European and North-American countries, excluding the Third World and socialist countries. For social and historical reasons, school and educational reforms are less successful than expected. School reform projects must take into account some of the more or less neglected factors. First, a thorough preliminary analysis of future reform projects must be undertaken to determine how realistic  they are. Second, it is necessary to think about unwanted, indirect social effects of any reform. Third, a better knowledge about the interconnections between school and social structure is needed. On the whole, it is important to know not only the aims, but also what is possible to accomplish in any given situation, and what the tools are that would lead to the direction sought. (Author/JR)",

Analysis of the fact that schools replicate the structure of social relations of production presents several problems, including a challenging consumption interpretation, the uncertainty of impact of schooling on noncognitive student attributes, the maladaptive role of schooling in relation to the needs of production, and the absence of an adequate data base. The occurrence of an alienating hidden curriculum, which reproduces the social relations of production through emphasis on conformity, external rewards, and various noncognitive behaviors, has been supported by Ivan Illich but refuted by Herbert Gintis on  the basis of historical, economic, and educational research. Current worker dissatisfaction is not easy to explain if it is true that classroom socialization anticipates the social relations of the work place. There is not enough current evidence to say that the structure of social relations in high school is different for students in academic tracks than it is for those in nonacademic tracks. Proposed research with track assignments as the independent variable and classroom socialization as the dependent variable hypothesizes that differences in emphasis or nonemphasis on classroom socialization behaviors will be greater between tracks than within them.

        "description":"The purpose of this monograph is to show that sufficient achievements in scaling applications have been made to justify serious study of scaling methodologies, particularly multidimensional scaling (MDS) as a tool for geographers. To be useful research, it was felt that the common methodological and technical problems that specialized researchers share with other scholars should be indicated by review of the applications, and that an adequate statement on the mathematics and heuristics of scaling algorithms is necessary. As a review of applications, subroutines in scaling programs are \"dissected\" in order to understand how certain critical parameters are defined and used. This research work is presented in three parts relating to 1) basic fundamentals of scaling, data  requirements, and algorithm constructions and problems; 2) two step-by-step examples of the non-metric section of a multidimensional scaling algorithm; and 3) a review of geographical applications of the approach in a variety of problem areas. The position of this paper is that MDS provides a useful and constructive methodology for examining the problems of preference and choice for researchers in geography. In conclusion, some problems of using MDS are mentioned and its potential uses in geography given. (Author/ND)",

        "description":"An attempt is made, in this paper, to develop a model that would apply ethnographic research techniques to public school research and systems. The model presented consists of three developmental phases. In the first phase two basic approaches to field design, either of which can be used are described: the emergent categories approach, in which the anthropologist is interested in the operation of the school; and the behavior of students, teachers, and staff, or the pre-determined categories approach, in which the anthropologist has identified an issue or a problem for study prior to the initial stages of field research. Phase two of the model consists of a description of the problems of selecting a school for research, as well as the techniques for gaining entry permission in  order to carry out ethnographic research and the processes that affect working relations with public school authorities and personnel. In phase three, anthropological issues and methods are presented, expecially participation-observation techniques. In the final section of the paper, a list of possible subjects and topics of interest to anthropologists for research purposes is presented. (Author/JR)",

These areas are discussed to exemplify an increasing impact of judicial decisions on school practices, and to support the argument that schools of education need to engage in teaching and research about law as it relates to education, including school policies and practices. The first of the two doctrines considered, the Tinker standard of \"material and substantial interference with the requirements of appropriate school discipline,\" leads to suggestions of how a decision might be reached that would affect the school's curriculum if educational theory and research were properly applied to legal theories. The second doctrine, the Morrison \"fitness to teach\" test, is  used to point out the need for certain evidence before just and consistent results can be reached. Discussion of both doctrines suggests ways of increasing the potential for pluralism in curriculum and staffing patterns. (Author/KSM)",

The classes participated in a series of 15 interrelated community resource visits with museums and used audiovisual materials. An overview describes program activities in which emphasis was on expanding student perception and establishing cognitive and visual relationships between encountered concepts and objects. The major focus of the evaluation is twofold: (1) Process Evaluation and (2) Product Evaluation. The Process evaluation  examines program implementation and operation according to plans, while the product evaluation investigates the effect of the project on children, teachers, and parents, with special emphasis on attitudinal gains. Evaluation statistics of implementation, operation, and attitudinal outcomes are included in this report. The data show that the program was well administered, teachers were successful in getting students involved in the program, and most students became more independent in their artistic expression.

        "description":"This paper attempts to aid Vermont educators in re-examining traditional education practices designed to foster responsible citizenship behavior patterns in youth, and establishes basic directions for new programs and procedures. The paper outlines behavioral objectives and goals of a new citizenship program in Vermont. It is the position of this paper that responsible behavior must be considered within the context of democracy, defined both as a basis of government and as a way of conducting human relationships. Because the educational system has not responded swiftly enough to the need for preparation of responsible citizens, it is the role of the schools to improve their performance in the following three areas: equip students with the kind of skills and knowledge necessary to  operate within the system; provide the decision-making experiences necessary for the development of mature behavior patterns; and instill the attitudes of responsibility and restraint which undergird democratic citizenship. The second area of improvement is in the methods of teaching democracy. Basic differences between the old and new way lie in the recognition that democracy is a process, not just a body of knowledge, that it draws heavily upon all disciplines, and that the values that guide behavior in responsible ways are better based on a personal discovery of the validity of substantive values.

        "description":"This volume resulted from an attempt to compile comprehensive and accurate data about the popular reaction to social change for a seminar attended by European and American social scientists. The volume contains eight papers which reflect the three objectives of the seminar: (1) a review of psychological indicators of social change; (2) an exploration of new areas of survey measurement of psychological phenomena; and (3) a mapping of research priorities. The first paper contrasts social indicators of the subjective type with the customary hard statistics and identifies areas for the development of indicators. The next paper stresses that quality implies value judgement and that experience is anchored in individual notions of adequacy. The relationship between subjective and  objective indicators is the topic of the next paper, which points to the role of the social environment as a source of subjective welfare. Various measurement and methodological questions are dealt with, in particular the issues of scale development and causal modeling of satisfaction structures. A report on the substantive research in the area of economic welfare is followed by a caution against a straightforward interpretation of satisfaction measures as indicators of well-being. Finally, two papers deal with the interaction between the individual and society from two different perspectives. The volume concludes with a summary of the seminar proceedings. (Author/KSM)",

The basic characteristic of recurrent education, a post elementary system of education, is alternation of education and activity throughout an individual's entire lifetime. Recurrent education is a fundamental principle of Yugoslavia's educational policy to enable regularly employed people to acquire higher levels of education and skills from mutually invested funds. It has a sociopolitical context because recurrent education is conceived as one of the principle instruments for achieving a socialist society. The introduction to the report presents this background,  with notes on Yugoslavia's general socioeconomic and educational situation and philosophy. Part one attempts to define the essence of recurrent education and its objectives, part two discusses implications of recurrent education, and part three lists questions and problems concerning the subject-content of the research project.

Results from the extensive test batteries constructed show that older students have a greater general readiness to make social contacts but have more negative ideas and stereotypes towards minority groups and immigrants.

The development of this resource is based on the premise that textbooks are outdated, news magazines are unpredictable, and regular newspaper coverage is rarely concentrated enough to be of real benefit for a single course. Topic Today brings together on a single page pictures, maps, statistical data, references to Canada, and descriptions that focus on a single current issue and place, with reference to specific classroom  courses.

Five of these assumptions are that ethnic studies are (1) the study of ethnic minority groups, (2) designed for ethnic minorities, (3) supplementary to the curriculum, (4) the study of strange customs, and (5) the celebration of ethnic holidays. Instead, ethnic studies should be conceptualized as a process of curriculum reform that will result in the formulation of a new curriculum with novel assumptions, goals, and means. Three major interdependent goals for curriculum reform and ethnic studies include helping individuals to clarify their ethnic identities and function effectively within their own ethnic communities, to develop a  sensitivity to and understanding of other ethnic cultures and to function effectively within them, and to develop the ability to make reflective decisions on social issues and to take effective actions to resolve social problems. With these goals in mind, ethnic studies should become a study of historical and contemporary social events from a multiethnic perspective rather than from an Anglo-American perspective. Specific steps and teaching strategies which social studies teachers can take to implement a multiethnic social studies curriculum are outlined. (Author/JR)",

The first examined some of the implications of arguments developed by Charles Reich in \"The Greening of America.\" The second was developed as an antithesis to the first and traced the implications of a renewed commitment to full employment and the preservation of the traditional meaning of work. The third depicted a blending of the values and life styles of the first two. Upon examination after four years time, the elements which induced a preference for the third alternative require  modification based on the increasing economic activities of women, the aging of the baby-boom, and the potential resource scarcities and recession. The emerging trends appear to suggest a shift from the third scenario to the second. Projections over the next quarter century and their implications are discussed. Footnotes and tables are included.

        "description":"A large-scale study of the relationship between ethnocentrism and cultural relativism was made to evaluate the effects of an anthropology curriculum on students' levels of ethnocentrism. Its hypothesis is that ethnocentrism is modified by studying anthropology and, to a lesser extent, other social sciences. The design, execution, and analysis of the study of ethnocentrism in high school students from a Chicago suburb are described as modified by the school's environment. Pre- and posttests were administered to 352 male and female subjects in the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades during the 1969-70 school year. The study has both theoretical and applied characteristics, which are derived from its goals--course evaluation, measurement scale methodological innovation, measurement  instrument development, and substantive clarification--and it has both virtues and faults from using naturally occurring groups to obtain a \"normal\" sample. Two new measures of ethnocentrism were developed; therefore, an investigation of the intercorrelation of these measures, three accepted measures, and related concepts is proposed. Questionnaires used in this study are included in appendixes. (Author/ND)",

It is a scientifically based educational system that fosters a child's natural love of learning and helps him to become a confident and productive human being. Providing a comprehensive and interdisciplinary educational experience that will enable a child to develop to his fullest potential, the Model emphasizes moral development, the arts, the sciences, equal educational opportunity, evaluation, and individualized instruction. The Model identifies five basic categories of learning. The part of the curriculum that deals with the development of learning competence is organized around these five categories of learning how to (1) move and gain maximum control over the voluntary muscles; (2) perceive through  the five senses; (3) think clearly, especially through problem solving; (4) exercise the will, producing self-discipline and the ability to develop concentration; and (5) feel and respond emotionally to any situation appropriately. Suggestions on how the Model can aid teachers, parents, and community are included. A brief history is given on how the Anisa Model developed. The document concludes with a summary statement on the Model. (Author/JR)",

Major goals of the first project were to construct and use measuring methods to determine social development of students at the elementary and junior high school levels. Major goals of the second project were to study the characteristic patterns of student democratic cooperation, the relation between student interaction attitudes and background variables, and to investigate student reaction to innovation at the elementary, secondary, and post-secondary levels. Results of the social development project showed marked stereotypes in sex-role perception and negative ideas about certain minority groups and immigrants. However, systematic school influence on social  development is starting to break down these attitudes. Results of the student democratic cooperation project showed a lack of student interest in working in cooperation groups because of limited individual influence in decision making. Also included are abstracts and annotations of 80 reports and publications analyzing the two research projects. (Author/DE)",

Public attitudes toward these two areas have currently been changing due to recent scientific and technological developments that have been threatening or have had obvious deleterious consequences. Despite these criticisms, the need for innovative contributions from the basic and applied sciences and the physical and social technologies has never been greater. Institutional difficulties which inhibit these contributions are enormous but need to be overcome if science and technology are to make more important contributions to the solution of world problems and to improvements in the state of man. Possible institutional arrangements include the development of  global models to which analysts in countries throughout the world contribute, a new United Nations organization which would conduct system studies and publish lists of urgently needed science and technology, the establishment of internationally linked science policies, a supranational team of experts, and an international monitoring system to forecast impending world crises.

Presently the impact of the working class on the public school history curriculum is not fully assessed or explained in light of other social and economic circumstances in the twentieth century. This neglect of working class history deprives a majority of students of an area of knowledge which carries the possibilities of explaining the past and making recommendations for future actions. Generally such knowledge of the working class is kept alive through the spoken word and music but is not recognized as legitimate knowledge for public school teaching. The result is ideological hegemony which is under control of the  dominant culture and is unimpeded by a critical examination of its purpose. Educational historians need to continually examine the historical process of legitimizing or delegitimizing knowledge and especially develop participatory studies of working class history and culture.

        "description":"This paper addresses some considerations about self theory and the Twenty Statements Test (TST) as they might be used to study women. Two theories have developed within the general rubric of &quot;symbolic interaction&quot; as coined by Blumer. The first is the Iowa School, or Kuhn school, which states that the self is a directly researchable phenomenon; the same procedures used in other sociological research are applicable and the self is researchable as any other social object. The TST was developed by Kuhn and his students, as a method of uncovering general self-attitudes. Conversely, the second school, or Chicago school, argues that the self is only knowable by inference and an understanding of the many roles which a person plays; thus, the self is not conceived as subject to analysis  by sociological techniques. Supporting the Iowa school, this paper justifies its approach to self theory. Secondly, a brief description of self theory and the Twenty Statements Test is provided, so that both the theoretical orientation and its technique are understood. Thirdly, certain selected examples of self theory and TST research which have considered women are presented. The paper concludes with a short discussion of suggested future directions in which self theory might proceed, and presents an argument for investigating the self within a broader investigative framework than the TST provides.

The Keller plan consists of five features: self-pacing, unit mastery, student tutors, optional motivational lectures, and learning from written material. The Keller plan appears to work well because it is consistent with at least ten educational principles for which there is some empirical support, such as active responding and specification of objectives. Keller's plan may be implemented in five stages: assessing entering behaviors, specification of course objectives, selecting resources and activities, establishing the course, and evaluating student  performance. Systematic efforts at evaluating PSI are beginning to appear. The two most extensive evaluations show that PSI students perform better on all types of examinations, have longer retention, and have more positive attitudes towards courses than students taking conventional, structure-type courses.

        "description":"A field experiment is described on the use of computer-related instruction at the college level in political science. The program modules are designed to: (1) teach a substantive body of knowledge in an introductory American government course; (2) introduce students to the basic methods of data analysis; and (3) teach elementary techniques of computer use. The substantive material and the basic concepts of data analysis were presented to a second introductory American government course in lecture format. The control group was not a course normally taught by the experimenter. Significant student achievement in methodology and computer concepts were found with the computer-developed modules. It was found that computer-related instructed students did no worse than lecture-taught  students in voting behavior topics. The document concludes with a discussion of the implications of the research for higher education. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"Five models are postulated for interpreting the three historical stages in the development of compulsory schooling in the United States. These three stages include (1) a symbolic stage where compulsory public school education began to gain strength but lacked enforcement procedures, (2) a bureaucratic phase beginning around 1900 where new organizational technologies made compulsory attendance effective, and (3) a postcompulsory phase beginning in the 1960's where the legitimacy of compulsory schooling is being questioned and truancy is rampant. Model 1 interprets the development as an evolution of the self-perpetration of a democratic society. Model 2 reflects a revisionist interpretation where society's economic elites fashioned compulsory school systems in order to produce a  stable, rational economy in which they could retain their power. Model 3 stresses socialization and nationalism where schooling creates citizens and legitimizes government hierarchies. Model 4 interprets stage 1 as a subcultural conflict where state legislators passed laws as a symbolic crusade of the virtuous. Model 5 interprets the development of compulsory attendance as the work of political interest groups including both business and labor. (Author/DE)",

For a game to be valuable from an educational point of view, it must be analytic in nature and similar in structural elements to those of the real world. The simulation experience motivates the students and gets them actively thinking and acting on intellectual questions presented by the game, develops an understanding of a process, and changes the role of the teacher from authority figure to a critic-observer. In a beginning level American government course \"Simulated Society\" (SIMSOC) is used to examine questions related to nation building, such as how will society be organized, who will make the decisions, and what type  of institutions are best. In an advanced course on the legislative process, the simulation \"Decision Making by Congressional Committees\" is used to examine factors involved in a bargaining situation when Congress is considering various legislation. In both cases the most important learning occurs in the debriefing phase of the games. (Author/DE)",

It covers the construction of the test, material, item analysis, reliability, validity, and possible future steps. The test is composed of musical recordings, determined from pilot studies, that the test groups analyzed for acoustical structure. Three versions of the test were developed to raise its reliability. Patterns of relationships instead of absolute figures are measured to show the test's validity, which is expressed in several tables in the report. Findings indicate that there are no essential differences between the total correlations and the deviations of the items in the different versions of the test. The total correlations show a  relatively low but consistent positive relation. A major conclusion is that a subject's age affects his test results very little. This seems to support the theory that musical aptitude develops at an early age. See ED 092 440 for a report on the first part of this study covering the background theory and pilot studies. (ND)",

The Association for Supervision and Development (ASCD) lectures were planned in order to ferret out a clearer body of values to give direction to thought for possible reformation of curriculum content. This booklet presents a chapter written by Harold G. Shane and reports the lectures of Jonas Salk, Robert Heilbroner, Willard Wirtz, and William I. Thompson. Some of the many facets of moral education are considered in each of the following essays, with a bearing on schooling and with suggestions for how to examine the future as  a guide to present educational decision making and development. Harold G. Shane briefly describes the values education \"movement.\" Jonas Salk draws on his scientific experiences in developing moral human equations. Robert Heilbroner presents a gloomy commentary on the human prospect, and starkly presents some of the excruciating moral dilemmas. Willard Wirtz depicts the implications of moral responsibility in a democracy and for education. William I. Thompson sketches the moral foundations he sees in a new planetary culture, and what they may suggest for educational practice. (Author/JR)",

Drawn from four different schools, 481 Parisian pupils served as the sample for the study. The students responded to a questionnaire ranking the importance of their relationships with the government and the police with seven other specific relationships including parents, brothers and sisters, friends, the opposite sex, teachers, merchants, and neighbors. The results indicated that relationships with the government and police are among the least important. For the small group that did consider politics important, there are similar background characteristics. Politics are more important for older students, boys, atheists, those who do not practice their religion, and pupils  whose fathers have upper class occupations. Atheists, Protestants, and Jews are more likely than Catholics to be highly politicized. (Author/DE)",

The distinguishing feature of the study is its emphasis on the relationship between investment in and desired number of children. The basic argument is that in determining the level of benefits they want to receive from children and child-related activities, parents view additional investments in children and additional births as substitutes. The data are drawn from a 1960 cross section of United States with counties as the units of observation. Female earnings are the most important determinant of completed family size in terms of both magnitude of effect and statistical significance. Other variables having a significant negative effect on childbirth are female education and the degree to which a  county is urban. On the other hand, median value of housing and male earnings both exert a positive influence on desired numbers of children. When economic differences are accounted for, race plays virtually no role in determining family size. (Author/DE)",

Results indicated that relative to age level differences, the motor variables of power, balance, speed, and agility change significantly from year to year, while for measures of muscular strength and endurance the pattern of change is not as clear cut. Comparisons for cardiorespiratory endurance and flexibility did not produce significant differences. An analysis of the comparisons for race differences found black subjects  superior to caucasian subjects on eight test items and caucasian subjects superior on two items.

Golf was the first sport in which women participated in the Olympics, and the first woman to achieve Olympic recognition for the United States did so by winning the women's international singles golf event in 1900. Women's tennis was included in the games of the second Olympiad, and archery for women in the third. Swimming and diving events were opened to women for the 1912 Olympics although the United States and France had voted against their inclusion. The United States did not have a women's swimming and diving team compete until 1920, at which time the U.S. team won four out of five events.  At this same Olympiad, a conflict in scheduling arose between Olympic officials and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association which prevented both men and women from representing the United States in tennis in the 1920 Olympics. Since the limited representation of American women during the first seven Olympiads, improvement can be seen in (a) performances, (b) the number of events open to women, (c) the increasing number of participants, (d) media coverage of women's competition, and (e) the acceptance of women who participate in sport.

Models of school learning by Wiley and Harnischfeger (W-H) were used in this study. The study sample consisted of fourth, fifth, and sixth graders who had complete data on the major variables under consideration and who had received any of levels one through six of the criterion referenced reading tests. Data on the quantity and quality of instruction were gathered in taped interviews given to all principals, teachers, specialists, and selected teacher aides. The analytical procedures in this study involved improving the data, reducing the number of relevant variables, and deriving the reading progress parameters. Results indicate that allocated  exposure time is related to student performance, even while controlling for school, student, and teacher background factors. This suggests that further field exploration of the factors in the W-H model are feasible and will result in refinements of causal relationships. Results also indicated that extra time spent by the teacher with the student has an effect that is tied to student ability. (The data in this report is supported by 15 tables.) (RC)",

The design of this study called for the coding of classroom behaviors by individuals highly trained in the use of the nine observation systems selected for this study. A sample of 50 taped lessons demonstrating classroom performance was obtained, and each coder was instructed to code each lesson. The materials were then returned and analyzed. Factor analysis was used to find the appropriate number of independent dimensions necessary to adequately describe the phenomenon of teacher behavior. The number of variables input into the  first factor analysis was summarized in terms of standardized scores for each factor generated. These standardized scores became the input for a second factor analysis.

The predominant view on how to conduct scientific research in pedagogics has always been based on the positivist philosophy of science. In the late 1960s, however, criticism concerning established methods of pedagogical research emerged in several European countries. Current research in these countries represents an important step toward the necessary redirection of pedagogical research. Research on curriculum and teaching should be based upon a thorough analysis of the functions of educational systems. Some promising attempts have been made along this line based on dialectical materialism. Theory and research on  the one hand, and the practice of teaching or curriculum development on the other, are not clearly separable activities if a radical perspective toward pedagogical research--one not based on the positivist philosophy of science--is chosen.

The development and emergence of growth centers has probably been the major influence in determining the scope, direction, importance and spread of the Human Potential Movement.

Within the Human Potential Movement, and more specifically within growth centers, the body has rejoined the mind in a social, humanistic emphasis on the integrated, holistic, total human being. The emergence of  growth centers in the United States during the past decade and the publication of considerable literature in the field of sport and athletics with strong humanistic emphases clearly indicate a need for deeper understanding of the meaning of physical education, body, movement, and nonverbal experiencing in the years ahead.

The mass of segment, the transverse moment of intertia of segment, the angular velocity of segment i about its transverse axis, the projected distance between the c.g. of segment i and the c.g. of the whole body, and the angular velocity of the c.g. of segment i about the c.g. of the whole body, were used in this study to develop a formula to represent  the angular momentum of a multi-segment body about one of its axes.

The athletic club movement began with the founding of the New York Athletic Club in 1866. By 1880 other clubs were well-established and the various clubs soon became more selective in terms of membership and more concerned with facilities in an attempt to become the leading athletic club. The 1890s, however, were noted for club bankruptcies and consolidations. The difficulties experienced by athletic clubs during this period were due basically to poor management and the overextension of financial resources to acquire property and  expand facilities. Although the elite clubs which survived the 1890s continued to prosper in the early 1900s, this was a period in which neighborhood athletic clubs, occupational athletic clubs, and clubs organized by other small groups specifically for athletic competition fourished. The social strata represented in these clubs was increasingly lower middle class and working class, and the clubs were generally without facilities and the social preoccupations of the 1880s.

        "description":"During the early history of amateur athletics, the large and affluent athletic clubs--mostly in New York City--took the initiative in the formation of the first associations of amateur clubs, the National Association of Amateur Athletes of America (NAAAA), and its successor, the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). Athletic clubs in New York City in the nineteenth century were stratified along religious, ethnic, occupational, political, and social class lines. These factors had a significant impact on the athletic associations and sport governing bodies. Although the NAAAA maintained that it was the national governing body for amateur sport, it was never capable of controlling professionalism and gambling, and never, in reality, a national organization. In 1888 the New York Athletic  Club withdrew from the NAAAA to form the AAU. The AAU was then the dominant association until these two organizations merged in 1890. During the next twenty-five years the power of the New York clubs in the AAU declined. However, they still maintained their influence on the AAU governing board through the hard work of several of their representatives. The New York clubs were thus able to hold positions of power in athletic club associations disproportionate with their numbers. The decisions and policies that were made therefore may have favored these larger, upper middle class male clubs. These affluent athletic clubs, however, gained a respectability for sport which it otherwise would never have achieved. (RC)",

        "author":["Plowman, Sharon Ann"],
        "description":"A review of previous research was completed to determine (a) the response of the cardiac time components of the left ventricle to varying types and intensities of training programs, (b) the probable physiological explanations for these responses, and (c) the significance of the changes which did or did not occur. It was found that, at rest, training caused a lengthening in diastole (13.8 percent), ejection period (4.5 percent), and isovolumetric contraction period (9.2 percent). The electromechanical lag shortened by 3.7 percent. Following a submaximal exercise bout diastole was 23.7 percent longer, ejection period 12.8 percent longer, isovolumetric contraction period 14.7 percent longer, and electromechanical lag unchanged as a result of training. These changes are generally  thought to reflect adaptation to stress and shifting autonomic nervous control. (A second article, \"Cardiac Time Components: Sedentary versus Active Individuals,\" is attached. This article discusses research which shows that the differences between active and sedentary males parallel the changes that training programs produce in the left ventricular time components.

Based on the assumption that the most valuable learning is founded in self-knowledge and a resultant knowledge of others, the book presents a view of teaching as helping and caring with a supportive yet flexible structure. It states that the goal of each individual is the ability to direct his/her own learning. Such an ability involves a five step process of (a) exercising personal control, (b) assessing needs, (c) setting up goals, (d) using resources, and (e) evaluating outcomes. The ideas, suggestions, models, and strategy outlines contained in the text are designed to help the reader toward a self-knowledge that will enhance his/her knowledge of individual learners, in such a  way that those learners may ultimately be made as independent and self directing as possible. The book progresses from an initial examination of the reader's personal values and positions on key questions to suggestions and strategies that may help the reader lead others toward the self-knowledge and the development of effective relationships with others that together constitute the measure of relevance. This book contains many valuing-forms to be thought over and filled in, metaphors to be reflected upon, activities, and simulations. (RC)",

        "description":"This study looks at the ways team teaching members work together, at their interdependencies, divisions of labor, and modes of coordination. It is a microorganizational study of teaching teams that looks both at factors which predict or explain how a team is organized and at the implications of these patterns of organization for (a) collegial influence, (b) team morale, and (c) instructional practices. The sample consisted of 46 teams in both open space and self contained settings, and variables were measured using questionnaire items. Most of the analysis used team level data. A series of regression analyses were used and attention was directed to whether relevant paths had positive, negative, or near-zero coefficients. Collegial influence was found to be associated with open  space and the extent of common policies or agreements made by the team members. Team morale was related positively to (a) the rate of communication, (b) the extent of common policies, and (c) the team's autonomy from external supervision, and negatively to the amount of cross-grouping used by the team. The instructional practices used by teachers were found to be related to open space, teaming, and the degree of interdependence among team members. Results indicated that autonomy, flexibility, and voluntarism were likely to produce the most successful collaborative relationships.

Whether the setting is a classroom, a field experience, an activity, or a residential treatment center, proper evaluation techniques will provide information for the determination of policies and programs. The Flexible Observation Instrument for Student Behavior (FOISB) uses different variables and incorporates them into a code which facilitates recording and allows the observing teacher to move from one student to the next in a relatively short interval of time. FOISB is particularly valuable in the evaluation of field experiences because of the short time it takes to record the needed data. The observer records the child's behavior according to (a) with whom he/she is  interacting, (b) the child's general behavior, and (c) the specific nature of the behavior. The first two behaviors recorded are used to determine the third, more specific behavior from a list of possible alternatives. (Extensive definitions of all behaviors are included.) (MK)",

The first area covered the development and testing of a classification system of skills necessary for research, development, diffusion, and evaluation in education. Telephone interviews with 58 employers of research personnel indicated that the most important skills and those in shortest supply involved the exercise of judgment. It was suggested that apprenticeship training might be the best way to develop these skills. The second area concerned employment. Employment service data were examined and the most important conclusion obtained was that whereas the number of applicants remained stable from 1968-1970, the number  of positions declined. The third area involved an analysis of characteristics of trainees in Graduate Research Training Programs under Title IV of Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Conclusions drawn from this study stated that the Title IV programs are worthy of continued support. The last area examined alternative approaches to training educational researchers. The following three training possibilities were considered: (a) a library of cassette tapes on current research topics, (b) transportable packages of training materials, and (c) simulation techniques. The possibilities for simulation techniques were particularly stressed. (MK)",

The primary purpose of the study is to improve the curriculum developer's ability to generate better adaptive materials by improving his judgment of the quality of the diagnostic portions of his material in meeting the objectives of adaptive instruction. Three measures of variables reflecting the rationale of adapting to individual differences are presented. These measures are: (a) ratio of teaching time to total time, (b) predictive validity ratio, and (c) discriminability ratio. The use of these measures are demonstrated with seven widely diverse examples of adaptive programs. Each of the three measures yielded a considerable range of values over  the seven programs, but none of the programs proved adequate on all three measures of the necessary conditions for adaptive decisions. Although adapting instruction with prescriptive tests may continue to be widely used, there is not yet an empirical basis for that use. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on Title IX, a part of the Federal Education Amendments of 1972, and its effect upon human rights in school sport. The paper is divided into three sections. The first section reviews the purpose of Title IX and the historical developments which led to its establishment. It states that Title IX was enacted to eliminate sexual discrimination in educational programs and activities, since until recent years few opportunities for women to engage in sport and athletics had been provided by society. The next section deals with the implications of Title IX as it relates to educational institutions. It states that application of Title IX to secondary school sport will take time, continued effort, and patience. The paper mentions that the generalities of the law, the  lack of specific guidelines, and the hesitancy of many administrators to respond to the need for change will undoubtedly contribute to its slow implementation. In the final section Title IX is reviewed from a legal basis. An examination of precedent-setting judicial decisions relating to discrimination by sex from a variety of perspectives is presented. In addition, a case is developed to demonstrate existing parallels between decided racial discrimination cases and possible future sexual discrimination cases. (RC)",

        "description":"This resource guide on competency based teacher education (CBTE) and competency based certification (CBC) states that the degree of explicitness required in CBTE programs and CBC programs and CBC systems is greater than in traditional programs. A CBTE program must specify (a) what the learner is to do, (b) the degree or level of competency expected, and (c) evaluation procedures. The reasons for CBTE growth are then listed as (a) growing pressure for accountability, (b) increasing focus of political action on fiscal issues, (c) the management organization movement, (d) growing stress on individualization, (e) the desire of state education departments to develop more effective certification and standards, and (f) the continued investment of federal funds in CBC. The report points  out that certification standards may be changed because of the change in teacher education programs toward CBTE. A key issue in developing CBC systems, according to this report, is whether certification is controlled by state education departments or local school districts. The report states that the two main issues involved in control are the establishment of competencies, and the establishment and operation of evaluation criteria and procedures. It is noted that while there have been many alternatives used in establishing competencies, little has occurred in the area of evaluating competencies. The remainder of this guide presents a list of some of the most comprehensive CBTE module series and an annotated list of materials on CBTE-CBC. (MK)",

The summer period is envisioned as the crucial development period for the undergraduates and the design phase for the alternative school. In September, leadership training groups could begin to implement the alternative school by selecting sites, experiences, staff, and students according to criteria exacted and established during the summer. A staff training group will develop a model orientation/staff training program that could be applied to other evolving alternative schools. A possible type of operational structure for the alternative school would be vertical age grouping. This structure has the following  four age divisions: (a) members of the program ages five through eight, (b) those individual ages nine through thirteen, (c) those from the age and grade range of the traditional high school, and (d) the leadership training team and other resource personnel. Each family will involve equal or near equal numbers of groups a, b, and c, and at least three participants from group d. Evaluation of the program will consist of personal assessments and a continuing effort to respond to proposals and appraisals with programmatic changes. (RC)",

The Mary Gresham Chair carried with it a grant of $100,000 to provide the richest possible learning resources for children. The award was made to Robert Gillette, an English teacher from Fairfield, Connecticut. It permitted the elimination of the usual red tape of administrative accounting, and allowed the teacher to make the decisions. This report tells how Mr. Gillette spent the money during the first 18 months. The money was spent on (a) training and support of teachers, (b) special pilot programs for students, (c) outreach and cooperative programs with other communities, and (d) administration of the grant. A few of the special pilot programs for  students were a wilderness leadership training program, special instructional programs, an experiential learning program in language, and a paramedic program. Some of the outreach and cooperative programs included a bilingual program, an urban/suburban cultural program, a municipal government project, and a school exchange program.

        "description":"There is a tendency to simply view alternative schools as against tests, grades, bells, seats in rows, and dress regulations. This obscures the need for alternative schools to have stable organizational structures if they are to play an important role in education. There are five stages in the development of an alternative school. They include (a) determining the appropriateness of an alternative school in the particular school system; (b) school board commitment to a formal planning process; (c) description of objectives, characteristics, and resources of the school; (d) operationalization of the school; and (e) continued self-evaluation. Of these stages, the most difficult to achieve is proper planning and operation of the alternative school. This can be aided by examining the  issues that require consideration in the planning and operation of a school. First are goals, objectives, and unique characteristics. Second are internal concerns such as curriculum, structure, teachers, and students. Third are external factors such as financing, community relations, and public image. Each of these issues should incorporate evaluation, communication, and decision making. This kind of coordination and structure can make the alternative school, not only a well-organized, on-going process, but can lead to wider use of the alternative school in the education process.

Assessment scores aid in the selection of students, in student placement, in identifying children in need of remediation, and in assessing student performance at the end of the program. Assessment scores, along with attendance records, are useful in evaluating program effectiveness and in conducting followup studies which evaluate student progress beyond the program. Assessment strategies and procedures are described which have been incorporated into SWRL's English Language and Concepts Program for Spanish-Speaking Children (LCS), a program proven to be robust at a high level of effectiveness.

        "description":"Assessing readiness among young children today implies undertaking a broad range of observations and activities in an atmosphere where children can feel comfortable and interested. Until recently, readiness meant readiness for reading. A mental age of six and a half was accepted as the prerequisite for beginning reading instruction. There has been, of late, considerable criticism of the notion of a single, global, group administered instrument to classify children as &quot;ready&quot; or &quot;not ready.&quot; Such premature labeling may result in exclusion from opportunities essential for a child's full development. Assessment in an educational setting may serve three functions: for selection, for pupil guidance, and for planning and evaluating instruction. Some systems of assessment are based on a  medical model of educational planning by using diagnostic measures and prescribing instructional treatments for individual needs. Two such systems have been developed by Educational Testing Service for assessing young children: Let's Look at Children and CIRCUS. Let's Look at Children describes a series of techniques based on a Piagetian theory of cognitive development. CIRCUS is a comprehensive array of 17 measures for assessing social competency in young children. Both systems stress a sequence relevant rather than a chronological age or normative approach to child development. (Author/BJG)",

        "description":"The controversy on the importance of children's attitudes toward their educational experiences has focused on two major questions: First, are attitudes an appropriate concern for educational systems; and second, are attitudes important as correlates of critical educational behaviors or simply as ends in themselves? This study attempted to add some insight into this education/attitude dilemma by: Developing an instrument and administration technique for primary grade pupils to operationalize dimensions of education related attitudes; and (2) Investigating relationships between this measure and behaviors which are visible components of the educational environment. With respect to the first objective of the study a 24-item instrument, showing relatively high internal consistency,  was developed. It was administered to a representative sample of pupils in grades 1-4, in Seattle Public Schools. The instrument was found to contain three factors that accounted for 36 percent of the common variance. Further, an administration procedure was developed which was usable for groups of children in the early primary grades. The administration procedure consisted of (1) a standardized video-taped administration, and (2) a response mechanism with a four choice Likert-type scale which elicited adequate scale variance down to the first grade level. The instrument failed to correlate highly with any of the validation criteria. The conclusion reached was that self-reported attitudes of primary children have little impact on other educational behaviors, specifically academic  achievement. (Author/BJG)",

There were 49,068 fourth graders, about 98 percent, and 53,662 seventh graders, about 99 percent, tested. A representative sample of the State's ninth and eleventh grade students, approximately 11 percent, were tested. The results provide a picture of the performance of fourth and seventh grade public school students in the State. Additionally, the sample of ninth and eleventh grade public school students allows their test scores to be generalized to the ninth and eleventh grade public school students in South Carolina. The Comprehensive Tests of Basic  Skills (CTBS), Form S, were employed to measure student's knowledge in the areas of reading, language, mathematics, reference skills, science, and social studies. The CTBS has been standardized on the basis of a sample of approximately 150,000 students drawn from across the nation. South Carolina student CTBS scores were compared to the national medians. The comparisons showed that South Carolina's fourth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh grade students consistently scored lower than the national median. (Author/BJG)",

        "description":"This investigation studied the effect of teaching satisfaction and related classroom environmental variables on student evaluations of instruction where the assigned instructor and course subject were held constant over two successive academic terms at a branch campus of a major state university. Scores on two dimensions of teaching, Instructor and Course, were derived from factor analysis of the class means of a 10-item student rating device administered to 1,785 subjects. Teacher satisfaction and related classroom data were obtained from a self-reporting instrument on 51 classes that were matched across terms for instructor and subject. The two factor score ratings and the 14-item self-reports of the instructors were treated as dependent and independent variables, respectively,  in multiple regression analyses conducted for each term. Coefficients of factor congruence, across terms, were .93 for Instructor and .78 for Course. There were no statistically-significant mean differences between terms for the student rating or self-report scales. There were seven common satisfaction and classroom variables that best predicted the dominant Instructor evaluation, differing only slightly each term in the order they entered the step-wise regression equation. The multiple correlations (R) for the two terms were .63 and .64 accounting for 40-percent of the criterion variance. (Author)",

The idea of multiple gradients of change provides a sharpened conceptualization and methodology for dealing systematically with the development of personal-social competencies through time. The application of this framework to a variety of life contexts may result in the discovery of interesting interactions between personal dispositions and situations which help clarify the  individuality of patterns of competence.

Members of the research team developed systematic observation schedules for each of the skills, in order to sharpen the focus of interns and their supervisors on the behaviors involved. This paper reports an attempt to extend the use of systematic observation schedules to the supervisors' classroom visits during conventional practice teaching. A conceptual framework of the professional skills was first devised, under the headings of questioning, structuring the discourse, varying the stimulus and reinforcing. A battery of lesson-sampling instruments was then  designed, using a mixture of rating scales, categories and sign systems. Studio trials with teams of three trained observers recording simultaneously from video-taped episodes of lessons taught by experienced Scottish high school teachers gave encouraging results. After revision, the instruments were submitted to a field test. Seven pairs of supervisors from a college of education observed three lessons given by each of the interns allocated to them. Instruments were used by mutual agreement within the pairs, allowing roughly half the available time. Acceptable levels of agreement were obtained, suggesting the feasibility of the proposed approach. (Author)",

A guiding principle has been that the computer is to serve the professional staff, not supersede them. Every test assembled is subject to professional review; revisions can be requested; and the items selected are held \"in limbo\" until the test has been accepted. The systems development turned out to be much more sophisticated than originally expected. It is undoubtedly more complex than would be required for  most testing situations since it is designed to handle a wide variety of tests in each subject area and the numerous constraints that are imposed on item selection by the rigorous test specifications and need for parallelism of forms that is basic to some of Educational Testing Service's (ETS) national programs like the College Board tests. In addition to a unique identification number and the classification for each item, the computerized file contains a complete history of the item's uses, up to five sets of statistics, codes for the security level and present activity status of the item, and up to 15 12-letter key words--which in the case of some verbal items constitute the complete items.

Suggestions of research problems include an investigation of variables which might be related to and affect task relevant behaviors, and an exploration of the differences between \"fast\" and \"slow\" learners.

        "description":"In planning the development of the system for computer assisted assembly of tests, it was agreed at the outset that one of the basic requirements for the successful initiation of any such system would be the development of a detailed item content classification system. The design of the system for classifying item content is a key element in systems development. Without an adequate classification system, it would be impossible to write test specifications and assemble tests that sample required content areas consistently and without undesirable redundancy. This system has a unique identification number for each item and its classification, the computerized file contains a complete history of the previous uses of the item, up to five sets of statistics including difficulty level  and discrimination index, codes for the security level and present activity status of the item and up to 15 12-letter key words--which in the case of some verbal items constitute the complete item. Whether the whole items are stored in the computer or remain in a card file for manual retrieval, the selection process of surveying the pool of eligible items and selecting appropriate ones is the same.

To this end, it introduces a specially designed instrument, the &quot;IGE Implementation Survey,&quot; which is capable of systematically collecting information on the degree to which schools which claim to be IGE, are actually operating in the IGE mode. The type of assessment proposed here, implementation evaluation, considers the developmental aspects of IGE. As such it provides improvement-oriented information to decision-makers which allows them to document where they are in implementing the IGE system, and to identify program areas where modifications and improvements are needed. To be sure of its proper role and function, it is  important to note that implementation evaluation of IGE does not preclude, nor does it substitute for output evaluation. Rather it should be considered a refinement of and prerequisite to output evaluation in that it allows for analyses and interpretations of program output within the context of possible differentiated levels of the independent variable (IGE) which may exist.

Items were constructed for each of the following categories: shapes, sizes, positions, amount, and premathematics. Among the tests that were administered to the children were word attacks, word elements, and letter names. Student and parent attitudes were also surveyed as to their opinions of the program.

The Second Year Program Test, used to judge the effectiveness of the program, was administered to a random sample of children in each of the selected classes. This test measures performance on program words, word elements, and word attack skills. This test was individually administered by laboratory staff at the end of the 1970-71 school year. Form 12A of the Cooperative Primary Reading Test provided an additional measure of the children's reading skills. Scores on the SYCSP Test indicated that most of the children attained a large  proportion of the reading skills taught during the school year. Data collected suggest that the SYCSP was highly effective as measured by the proportion of program outcomes mastered by most children. It was also effective as measured by a widely used standardized reading test. (RC)",

First, a detailed review of sample selection, weighting, and school participation showed that the data would provide a sound basis for comparing performance, and identified certain implications of the existing data for making and interpreting comparisons. Second, comparisons were made of students' high school experiences, their educational and occupational aspirations and plans, and their parents'  education and occupation. The pattern of results for the three survey samples, although obscured by differences in questions and by population trends, indicated that comparisons of test performances of the groups would be warranted. Third, a detailed design was prepared for studying the equivalence of selected tests used in the three surveys and for equating test scores on pairs of equivalent tests. Application of these equating results to the test results of the three surveys would provide the desired trend data. (Author)",

Two of the tests were group-administered and had a multiple-choice format, with one type consisting of three-choice items and the other four-choice items. The third type of test was individually-administered, constructed-response format. Both the individually-administered, constructed-response tests and the four-choice group-administered tests predicted well to an end-of-year  criterion test, whereas the three-choice tests did not. Based on pupil-performance data and teacher reactions, the individually administered tests appear to be most appropriate for use as Criterion Exercises in the Mod 2 program. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"A comparative evaluation involving two instructional programs is given, although the approach can easily serve to compare more than two programs. The steps involved in conducting a program fair evaluation of two instructional programs are: (1) Identify objectives (a) common to both programs, (b) unique to one program, and (c) unique to the other program; (2) Collect or construct test items based on the three sets of objectives; (3) Combine the test items into a three-part examination; (4) Assign estimates of importance, as explicitly as possible, to the three sets of objectives; (5) Administer each of the instructional programs to one of two randomly selected groups of appropriate learners; (6) Administer the three-part examination to both groups; and (7) Appraise results and  reach a decision regarding the preferred program. The summative evaluation scheme described here is relatively straightforward and can, therefore, be carried out with little difficulty. It can be applied to the evaluation of short-duration instructional sequences or to programs of much greater magnitude. While conceptually simple, it provides the evaluator with opportunities to employ sophisticated quantification schemes to deal with such problems as value weightings of objectives. The major purpose of the procedure is to make evaluators attentive to the differential consequences of employing instructional programs which were designed with different intentions. (Author/BJG)",

Prior research shows that less than one third of all states can provide evidence of using such data to make significant classes of decisions most frequently cited as a justification for the initiation of such programs. Yet the annual budgets for assessment programs continue to escalate. The evidence suggests that while statewide assessment programs are frequently initiated as part of accountability movements, they are seldom accountable themselves. In an attempt to deal with this problem, the Oregon assessment program has initiated a variety of innovative steps designed to insure effective dissemination and maximum utilization of annual testing results. Some of  these efforts include: extensive interviewing and research to establish a clear purpose for the program; identification of major policy questions to be impacted by assessment results; prior research to determine the most effective dissemination modes for selected decision-making audiences; widespread use of professional and lay advisory committees in the design, conducting, interpretation, and reporting of data; simultaneous release of results, interpretations, and recommendations for actions to specific audiences; initiation of a state management system to systematically utilize assessment findings in specific decisions; continuing evaluation of all dissemination and utilization strategies; and followup contacts with key decision-makers to assure utilization.

The discriminant validity of the subtests was demonstrated by a factor analysis of item scores from 3,010 pupils (a one per cent random sample of all first graders tested). A Principal components analysis, followed by varimax rotation, yielded a factor structure analogous to the test structure. Items from each of the five subtests loaded only on their own factor except for a few language development items which had secondary loadings with other factors. Multitrait-multimethod correlation  matrices were used to determine the agreement of ELT subtests with corresponding subtests in four popular readiness tests. Findings were mixed. Subtests had convergent validity with other measures of the same construct, but only the subtest with the greatest variance had discriminant validity consistently. (Author)",

Children who failed to reach criterion on the classification test were randomly assigned to one of five experimental groups, stratified on the basis of performance on both the classification and Component Test scores. Each group was given instruction on classification tasks, component tasks and/or control tasks, followed by Classification and Component Posttests. Children receiving classification instruction performed significantly better on the Classification Posttest than control groups who did not. Children who received component instruction performed better than the comparison group that did not  receive it, although the difference was statistically significant only for one of three levels of pretest performance. There were no apparent effects of classification instruction on Component Posttest performance or of component instruction on Classification Posttest performance. (Author)",

The study was carried out in a suburban school district where many students had experienced a great deal of change in their lives. At each grade level approximately 60 students who had experienced a great deal of change and 60 students who had experienced little change participated. Each student responded to the EQA instrument appropriate to his/her grade level. At each grade level teachers were asked to choose students high and low in &quot;emotional fortitude.&quot; In investigating the validities of the instruments, EQA scores of students rated high were compared with those of students rated low. The study provided some evidence for  the validity of the EQA instrument at each grade level. Validity support was gathered for the total instrument, for the Ineffective Solutions subtest, and for the Effective Solutions subtest; however, no validity support was found for the Emotional Adjustment subtest. In general, stronger validity support was found for the instruments when responded to by students who had experienced a great deal of change than when responded to by students who had experienced little change.

(3) The myth that most welfare recipients are blacks who have moved to northern cities just to get on welfare; statistics are said to show that the majority of welfare recipients are whites (48.3 percent), blacks rating 43.2 percent, and 8.4 percent are others. (4) The myth that welfare takes most of the taxpayer's money; only 1.9 percent of the 1974 federal budget is stated to have gone to all  public welfare payments. (5) The myth that hard work is the answer to the welfare problem; the Department of Health, Education and Welfare are said to have reported that less than one percent of the nation's welfare recipients are able-bodied men--13.4 percent are of old age, 0.5 percent blind, 7.6 percent permanently and totally disabled, 51.1 percent children, 0.9 percent unemployed fathers, and the remaining 26.1 percent mothers.

It is stated that in order to summarize a rather large amount of data, the paper focuses on significant differences which were found between economically poor and nonpoor families in each of the six ethnic/residence categories. It  was found that significant differences between poor and nonpoor in the two Spanish-speaking groups existed on considerably fewer traits than in the case of black or white respondent groups. Significant differences between poor and nonmetropolitan whites were found on a smaller number of 11 traits among both the nonmetropolitan blacks and the metropolitan whites studied. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This report explores some issues in the distribution of educational services to students in the tri-county area and Michigan as a whole. Specifically, it examines the allocation of two important indices of educational opportunity measured by the State Department of Education's Educational Assessment Program: classroom teachers per 1000 pupils, and professional instructional staff per 1000 pupils. First, it analyzes disparities in the provision of services to white and minority students in the State and tri-county area. Secondly, it explores the Constitutional implications of the distribution of these resources. Analysis and data are presented, it is asserted, which indicate that the Michigan system for providing certain important public education services, specifically teachers  and professionals, delivers those services in a way that produces significant disparities between minority and white students. The legal analysis is considered to clearly demonstrate that such a system is constitutionally defective unless the State can show the disparity is the necessary by-product of furthering some compelling State interest. Consequently, it is argued, the present system for providing educational services in Michigan most probably violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. (Author/JM)",

Most come into the profession full of promise, wanting to perform as student advocates. Student advocates are needed to fulfill the role of counselor. In addition, they are needed to work with teachers, administrators, parents, institutions, agencies, and other community people in helping them understand the counseling function. The Education Committee of the Education Task Force believes that the Detroit Public Schools cannot afford to have professional counselors function only as disciplinarians, record keepers and clerks. A survey of the counseling situation in  the Detroit schools reveals, it is held, that in all but a few junior and senior high schools this intolerable situation is prevalent. The Education Committee and/or the Task Force staff has held discussions with counselors, the Superintendent of the Office of City-Wide Programs and Pupil Services, the Director of the Department of Pupil Personnel Services, teachers, students, dropouts, parents, and community folk. Staff has reviewed relevant literature, noted stories in journals and the popular press, and has examined previous studies, proposals, and contractual agreements between the Detroit Central Board of Education and the administrators and teachers.

It is stated here that most of the &quot;school effects&quot; research has utilized school level variables for school resources, assuming that each student benefits equally from these resources. One source of variation around these mean school values is simply the exposure that students have to these resources. This research it is held, attempts to incorporate such variation. Data from the Equality of Educational Opportunity survey for the sixth and twelfth grades and from a survey of 20 high schools were used. The latter data set made available both a student ability measure  and attendance information drawn from school records (and not from student self-report data). The discussion first focuses on the school as the unit of analysis. In this discussion, some organizational features of the school which might influence attendance are examined. Later in the discussion, the individual student becomes the unit of analysis, and the technique of analysis of covariance is used to control for differential school level variables. Individual attendance then is viewed as a mediating variable between individual background factors, school factors, and achievement outcomes. (Author/JM)",

They are: (1) to identify common indicators of the lack of self-discipline among minority group college students and analyze them in terms of their nature and magnitude; (2) to provide an analysis of the self-discipline problems found in terms of their probable cause and effects on the students' adjustment to their total college experience, primarily from the perspective of minority group students themselves; and, (3) to recommend specific and practical suggestions that college might implement to help students who are handicapped by a lack of self-discipline to overcome it. The research was primarily  conducted on the campuses of four colleges in New York State, two being located in New York City, and two in Western New York. Two groups of college personnel were direct contributors to the research. The first group included the minority undergraduate students whose comments, opinions, and interactions compose the greater part of this report. The second group included a small and select group of minority faculty and students who assisted on occasion in developing interviewing and recording instruments, and in planning and organizing other aspects of the study.

        "description":"The stated purpose of this paper is to review some of the critical issues that arise in the planning and conduct of the evaluation of action programmes amongst the socially and educationally disadvantaged, and to suggest the means that might be adopted to overcome the inherent difficulties. The discussion first focuses on the characteristics of social and educational action programmes. Then, the functions of evaluative research are discussed. Following this, the discussion asserts that the coexistence of educational and social disadvantage in extreme forms tends to evoke programs which make either one or several interventions and assume that the interventions will make the social system work more effectively. It is advocated here, that in the planning stage, a model be  constructed into which the proposals for change can be fitted and, through which, how they work and their intended effects can be seen. The value of such models, it is stated, is that they allow each proposal to be worked out in terms of its specific objectives, the agencies of the system and the instruments of action. The discussion then focuses on \"the choice and formulation of objectives\" and \"the special status of evolving programmes\". Finally, the discussion highlights considerations regarding \"the design of evaluation experiments\" and \"the relationship between research and action\".",

        "description":"The express purpose of this presentation is with education and the technology of training strategies which relate to the conditions under which any two language systems are to be learned. It is assumed that Black English is structurally different from Standard English. It is concluded here that although the burden upon bilingual children is heavy, they are advantaged in a higher sense because monolingualism is a true form of cultural deprivation. However, monolingual development ought to be carefully studied in order to find the best route and methods for optimal progression in bilingual development. A form of bilingualism constituting reasonable and efficient conditions of progression can only be established through detailed explorations of semantic, interlingual structures. At  the present time, it is noted, such explorations are lacking. If raised under optimal conditions, the \"independent\" bilingual becomes able to transfer a large share of his first language knowledge to his second language. The \"confounded\" bilingual is still not much assisted, however. It is advocated that, regardless of whether black and white English dialects are linguistically sufficiently distinct, for the benefit and well being of many ghetto children living in a confounded linguistic environment, the two systems ought to be treated as such.

Marking the first large scale attempt of its kind, this study compared measures of academic success in terms of grades, graduation, and retention of two groups of 644 students who attended these institutions prior to 1967 and after HEOP inception in 1970. A Likert-Type Scale questionnaire administered to key officials was designed to gauge the degree of change occurring in the  college environment during the 1967-1970 period which could have affected the quality of educational experience for the disadvantaged. External changes were found to be minimal, indicating HEOP as the determining agent. Results indicated higher grade point averages and higher retention and graduation rates for program students despite their shared similarity with non-program students in economic and academic backgrounds. Given the overwhelming positive results, funding of other opportunity programs was highly recommended.

Specifically it examines the nature of the social relations that evolve when a large number of an alien population reside legally in a foreign country and present among them are a considerable number whose status is questionable or even illegal, and whose localization and expulsion from that country is actively conducted by law enforcement authorities. Illegal persons from the Dominican Republic who reside in New York are used to illustrate how illegal migrant status operates to set up certain kinds of social relations which in turn explicate behavioral patterns, attitudes, and values, which often seem  incongruous to those outside the group. Often, these behaviors frustrate and even prevent communication with institutions such as schools, welfare agencies, and law enforcement agencies, who wish to assist them. Some problems and limitations affecting traditional methodological techniques, used in social anthropology and deemed as ineffective when dealing with illegal migrants, are mentioned. (Author/AM)",

The Serrano v. Priest case covers the area of school finance, while the Swann v. Charlotte Mecklenberg and Richmond cases, along with President Nixon's proposed Anti-Busing Program constitute the desegregation area. The courts' reexamination and redefinition of students' rights reflect a problem area of school law. Court decisions reviewed are separated into two categories: substantive due process, dealing with specifics such as demonstrations,  underground newspapers, dress, damage or destruction of property, weapons on school grounds, and others; and procedural due process. To supplement the minimum standards that exist to satisfy the latter's unfixed requirements, the adoption of a procedure code to handle expulsion cases is urged. Major provisions of such a code as a way of defining student rights to procedural due process are specified. (AM)",

        "description":"This document on the Civil Rights of Students, perpared by the Educational Opportunities Planning Center, provides a synthesis of presentations made by the author and of the three discussion and answer sessions that followed at the three meetings of the School Law Conferences. Opening remarks emphasize the need for educators to respond to demonstrations of student dissent which stress the rights of individuals both inside and outside of school. Groups that advocate for students rights, among them the American Civil Liberties Union, are cited in relation to their position on key issues in this area. Noting that most violations of student rights have concerned due process, minimum standards that satisfy requirements in this area are listed. The development of handbooks describing  what students can do and what administrators should do, the formation of parent ombudsmen as go-between administration and students, and a student board of inquiry are some of the innovations undertaken by the Center for the Study of Student Citizenship, Rights, and Responsibilities, in Dayton, Ohio, which is under a federal OEO Grant to develop a model for students rights advocacy. These, along with a presentation of some cases handled by this center during its first year of operation, are discussed. Questions addressed covered specific areas such as an athletic coach's control over student hair length, in-school suspension, confidentiality of school records, right to counsel, and broader topics. Among the broader topics were rights vs. privileges, student responsibility for his  education, and what constitutes an education. (AM)",

Each year since 1966, most school districts in Ohio have conducted Title I programs for eligible students, who, for various reasons, have fallen behind their classmates in reading or mathematics. In some instances, priority needs and funding have enabled preschool education or tutoring also to be provided.

The study is said to have as its purpose the development and implementation of evaluation techniques to determine what educational practices bring about changes in students' behavior and what costs are associated with these. On site visits to each of the schools provided measures of program characteristics, including cost data. Analysis of the data included a comparison of program characteristics with 1972-73 and 1973-74 student reading achievement. &quot;Controllable&quot; program characteristics, said to describe the difference between effective and non-effective compensatory reading programs, are  indicated. These are a set of controllable factors related to student reading achievement and pertaining to school administrators and teachers, and those denoting that, when other things were equal and up to a point, more dollars per student means more achievement per student. Continuation of the program for 1974-75 is suggested with the following foci: identification of new variables that relate to achievement; extension of relationships between cost and achievement; and, investigation of the direction of the relationship between achievement and the various identified variables.

Opening remarks address the issue of racial integration and the Board of Education's commitment to its adoption as official policy. Six recent actions taken by the Chancellor to promote integration are listed, along with decisions on open enrollment and high school zoning. Although rated along with San Francisco as one of the most successful examples of desegregation in a large metropolitan area by independent studies, the flux of migration, ethnic distributions, and demography are held to deter efforts toward greater progress in integration. Testimony concludes with suggested endeavors for the implementation of the following: a  further examination of the programs for integration of the City of New York, the Board of Education, and the Chancellor; a continuation of its objective of stabilizing integrated communities and schools; demands for a statewide program of integrated communities to reduce the isolation of the urban poor and of suburban communities; and, petitions to the State Division of Human Rights to conduct public hearings for the purpose of determining what action is being taken statewide to integrate schools, housing, and other public services.

Research problems bearing on the evaluation were said to be the lack of concensus among all interviewed (every permanent member of the staff of CYSCC) as to the goals or aims of CYSCC and the inability to examine the perspectives of the various clients of the CYSCC program because of the limited resources and short-term research orientation. Research findings, organized within four broad categories felt to be important in understanding the activities of CYSCC and discussed in relation to the activities and functions of CYSCC, are as follows: Nature and scope of the delinquency problems in the  Chinatown community, the explicit and implicit goals of CYSCC, the viability of the youth services bureau model for delinquency prevention in Chinatown, and relationships between various components of the CYSCC Program and between the program and outside agencies. Two specific recommendations stemming from the research conclusions were made: (1) the establishment of an executive committee of CYSCC to allocate, fund, program, staff, and delegate rights and privileges across staff positions, and (2) a reorganization of the staff activities of CYSCC.

Following acquisition, the data was said to have been arranged in chronological order beginning with the youth's family prior to entry into the U. S., current situation, and view of the future, encompassing a section entitled the Family Background of the Chinese Immigrant Youth, the last being concerned with family SES prior to and subsequent to entry into the U.S. A section on the Chinese Immigrant Youth of San Francisco provides descriptions of who the youth are, their status in the San  Francisco schools, and how well they are adjusting to conditions in the U.S. The final section, entitled Outlook, examines general satisfaction of the youth with living in the U.S. and also their views about the problems affecting Chinese in San Francisco. A summary of major findings are provided in each section. Thirty-nine tables accompany the document and limitations of the data contained in them are stated in terms of the impossibility of generalizing on the total population of Chinese immigrant youth on the basis of the study sample.

The site was chosen because it was considered planned, heterogeneous, and located in the inner-city. The analysis is based on preliminary work carried out in the summer of 1973. This project focuses on the social and physical construction of community. It is suggested that people have spatial needs--patterned obstructions that transcend individual differences and are integrated into the social matrix where they occur. The basis for analysis was said to be mostly culled from informal conversations, off-the-cuff remarks, and a sampling of interviews with adult residents of all income levels and ethnicities; this was complemeted by observations of children at play in their home areas,  the playground, etc; and finally conversations with neighborhood Youth Corps boys and girls from Prairie Courts. It is concluded that the planned inner-city community must be considered as one element in the larger urban dynamic. There is a need, it is stated, which is documented in this report, for more adequate integration of human needs, physical or spatial needs, and human services in the planning and programming of a community.

Another categorization, adaptation projects, includes 6 programs with procedures  for implementation at reasonable cost. These programs are based on six earlier Title III projects. Eight Title III projects that have been certified by out of state evaluation teams as having met or exceeded rigorous standards of educational excellence in a national validation process are being considered for national dissemination.

Added emphasis is said to have been placed upon evaluation, dissemination of public information and program development, adoption of exemplary programs, and both money and program accountability. Two ESEA Title III funded projects in Kentucky's Region II and III have been validated as being worthy of widespread dissemination. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This cross-cultural research study, on 82 randomly sampled male urban Spanish speaking immigrants in the District of Columbia, analyzes the relationship of the immigrants' native educational attainment to occupation and to income, to assess their manpower utilization, and to make recommendations for manpower training programs. Data on economic and social characteristics found the immigrants to be more similar to the black population rather than to the Spanish speaking and white populations in the District of Columbia. A positive relation is said to exist between native education and economic success, as measured by occupation and earnings, with the first job in the native country mediating between education and economic success. Immigrants are found to be underutilized in their  U.S. occupations as compared with those held in their native countries, and those immigrants having completed a secondary education were found to be under represented in white collar positions when compared with nonimmigrants. The development of policies leading to facilitation of the tendency of immigrants to shift from the service occupations to blue collar occupations which conform to their previous experience is recommended. Chapters include background and related research, sampling procedures, characteristics of the samples, education and economic success, manpower utilization, and conclusions and recommendations. Instruments utilized are included in the appendixes. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This address focuses on the topic of open admissions and its implications for policies and procedures. A discussion, defining terms like excellence, equality, and open admissions, initiates a brief examination of issues such as institution-based and individual-based barriers to posesecondary schooling, the organization of college admissions--its trends and pressures--and the widening of access to further schooling. The results of this discussion are subsequently utilized to examine a single institution's policies and procedures. In Roosevelt University, a case study for open admission is presented through a detailed description of the setting, organization, admissions overview, admissions and barriers, and a measurement of the degree of openness. Roosevelt University is said to  represent a notable example of a private college doing its part to effect dramatic social change in the opening of admissions, by showing that policies can be fair, and procedures both humane and efficient--while at the same time accomplishing the goals for which they are established. The key to the opening of admissions is said to consist in the guarantee of mobility, not in the promise of placement into a program that is beyond the scope of one's training and grasp.

Recent trends dating from 1970 to 1974 (and in the case of income and labor force, including early 1975 figures) are examined for population distribution, income, labor force and business ownerships, education, family composition and fertility, health, housing, voting, elected officials, armed forces, and other major aspects of life, such as crime, victims, and offenders. Data analysis indicates advances in the areas of education, health, and in election to public office. Changing family composition and work experience patterns of family members, inflation, and the  downturn in the economy were found to impede progress in the areas of income and employment. The economic recession that began in 1974 and inflation were found to have serious effects on both whites and blacks, causing a sharp rise in unemployment rates, the erosion of income levels, and an increase in the number of white poor; poverty level, however, remained unchanged for blacks. The area of unemployment was said to be hardest hit by inflation. Appendixes include definitions and explanations for various terms such as food stamps, black-owned businesses, and others.

        "description":"This paper on sexual inequalities and socioeconomic achievement in the U.S. addresses the question of change in the processes of socioeconomic allocation for men and women during the period 1962-73. Data comparing married spouse-present men and their wives are drawn from an analysis of the 1962 socioeconomic stratification study, &quot;Occupational Changes in a Generation,&quot; and its subsequent 1975 replication. An examination of occupation, education, and earnings showed socioeconomic improvements for both men and women. Women were found to have attained more schooling, but their achievements appeared less associated with the circumstances of their families or origin than did those of men. Although little evidence of inequality of opportunity by sex for educational and occupational  attainments between 1962 and 1973 was found, equality of economic opportunity for women did not follow this pattern, as the process of earning attainment was found to be sharply different for the sexes, with men deriving greater benefits from family origins, education, and occupational standing. Earning returns to education were larger for both sexes. The notion of a declining socioeconomic importance of schooling was not supported by the data. These increases in the occupational and economic returns to schooling are said to support the notion that change is in the direction of the meritocracy, while the relative bearing of education versus family factors is said to be shifting to universalism.

        "description":"This study, exploring why first grade children from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, fail in school, utilized computerized techniques of statistical analysis to measure the relationships of various school and family characteristics with student achievement. Four types of schools--urban state, rural state, municipal, and private--were used to test the effect of student achievement as measured by parents, supervisors, school, principal, teacher, and class, on the dependent variables of age, and repetition on pass rates and dropout rates. A model for effects on student achievement was said to include three types: school only, parents only, and the interaction of specific parent and school characteristics. The effects of school alone were found to be low for all types of schools, while 75  percent or more of the explained variance in grades in language was based directly or indirectly on measures of the socioeconomic background of the child, such as mother and father's occupation, father's educational level, and the number of textbooks. Two areas of recommendation focused on were: (1) the development of educational policies to improve student achievement by changing internal characteristics such as the distribution of books and improvement of teacher training, and (2) the need for additional research to refine and test further hypotheses arising through the study.

Among objectives cited are the identification, contact, and counseling of 50 dropouts, 40 of whom would be enrolled in the program. Percentage requirements for class attendance and satisfactory grades, along with the development of vocational goals for each student are also specified. Two major accomplishments of the program are said to be the specific identification of mathematics skills deficiences for each student and teachers' increased awareness  of the needs and requirements for a management system for individualizing instructionl. The lack of clear comprehensive data is said to be due to initial problems with the diagnostic tool, incomplete diagnosis of students, and teachers' lack of understanding concerning the role of management. Among recommendations made are the revision and improvement of diagnostic materials and program record-keeping procedures, along with student involvement in the assessment of his/her learning need.

Further, it questions the availability of legal rights to students and parents. Three sections constitute the document: (1) an introduction discussing the nature and magnitude of the problems; (2) an analysis of the manner in which the Board of Education violates New York State laws by failing to provide adequate staff for attendance services, employment certificate procedures, auxiliary schools or dropout referral programs, and suspension and exemption procedures; and (3) an examination of the constitutional right to a suitable  education for all educationally deprived students. The latter section is analyzed in terms of a number of recent legal cases concerning handicapped children, non-English speaking students, and State institution patients, which cases are said to establish precedents for asserting a right to a meaningful educational opportunity. A discussion of what are labeled as manageable standards for effectuating judicial relief, considered under the specific headings of equal resources, bona fide efforts to provide suitable education, and attainment of minimum education standards, is included in the summary.

A series of developments, namely, the events leading up to Hobson 1, response to Hobson 1 by the schools, Hobson II and the schools' response, and evaluation of the D.C. Public Schools implementation of Hobson II, and recommendations for further efforts toward achieving equal educational opportunity in the schools, are some of the topics discussed in the seven sections constituting this study. They are arranged as  follows: introduction, the setting, events on the road to equalization, the management of implementation, resource allocation in selected D.C. Schools, a case study (1971-74), alternatives, and concluding remarks. A critique of this report prepared by the Public Schools of the District of Columbia, said to highlight particular problems with this report, and to offer information clarifying some of the misleading interpretations, is attached as part of this report.

        "description":"This report, concerning compliance, with the l967 and l971 court decisions on equal educational opportunity in the District of Columbia, summarizes the results of the first part of a two-part study, which examines the District of Columbia's Public School systems experiences resulting from the decrees on equalization expenditures in the elementary school. Citing the examination of the court's influence on educational policy as a major objective, the report examines topics such as court orders, the district's response, what happened in the schools, and alternatives to the decree, including the establishment of a centralized information system, a single equalization office, and suggested procedures for their accomplishment. Although court intervention is said to have ended the&quot;tracking system&quot;, along with a reduction in overcrowding in one area of the city, integration of faculty, and improvements in both the data base and the allocation of resources, the educational achievement of children in the D.C. public schools is said to not have improved demonstrably since the initiation of the Julius Hobson suit against the system. A critique of Joan C. Baratz's original evaluation report, said to highlight particular problems with this evaluation and to offer information to clarify some of the misleading interpretations made, is attched as part of this report.

The interest of the center in the entire career education concept stimulated it to include in this series recent views on career education of Dr. T. H. Bell, U. S. Commissioner of Education, and the newly derived career education policy of the United States Office of Education as explained by Dr. Kenneth B. Hoyt, Associate Commissioner, Office of Career Education, Office of Education. Dr. Bell's paper cites examples of the unanticipated success of career education; expresses hopes that career education will be primarily a State and local  matter; and points to the need for work to be done in the areas of improved quality, evaluation, and implementation, particularly at the high school level and among special groups. Dr. Hoyt's paper proposes career education as the response to criticisms of the present educational system, through the use of the concept of work. Basic concept assumptions are offered which will represent a philosophic base for career education, programmatic assumptions, suggestions for implementation, and specific learner outcomes which will involve basic educational policy changes.

A general methodology which will allow the teacher to use either simplified programs for anglophones or unsimplified programs for native speakers is set out. The suggested method may be adapted to fit particular classes and course objectives, but the teacher must have the desired program on video-tape and operate the videorecorder personally. An outline of basic methodology includes previewing, viewing, and followup activities. Directions are given for accomplishing individualization by setting up a viewing center. Guidelines are offered for classroom TV production; the dialogues and short plays used intensively in the new structural  and audiolingual courses can serve as a basis for student productions which provide motivation for learning and an opportunity to use the skills of listening and speaking which the students have been rehearsing. Some kinds of productions that have proven successful in French classes are outlined, and a four-page plan for a short production of about 15 minutes which involves most of the class is presented, illustrating the various techniques suggested in the booklet.

Civic literacy addresses the domain of intentional actions about political community, in a process of discovery and invention, the result of a dynamic interaction between practice and theory. The action-inquiry model of civic literacy consists of two theses and five competencies. The first thesis, the Social Justice thesis, holds that each person acts in concert with other persons to devise social conditions for realization of a good life. The second thesis, the Political Community thesis, holds that the civic literacy of each person depends upon the civic literacy of every person. The five competencies which permit the translation of the theses into a process of learning and doing are: engaging in intentional  action; maintaining or creating conditions for others to engage in intentional action; maintaining or inventing collective institutions which can adjudicate among different intentions, consequences, and strategies; discovering through civic action matters of common concern; and testing, extending, or redefining limits and boundaries to civic action through social invention. The competency of inventive action comes full circle: it is the end which illuminates the means of civic literacy, and it is the means to the pedagogy of discovery and invention. (JR)",

In addition, the study applies the theoretical basis to the practices used by the facilitator and the learner in the industrial arts laboratory. Chapter 1 introduces the topic of open education and its implications for industrial arts. It presents the background statement, the statement of the problem, need for the study, the scope and limits, methods and procedures, and definition of terms. In chapter 2 a brief historical background of the open education movement is presented, followed by an overview of the child development theory of Jean Piaget and a discussion of the rationale of open education as it applies to the facilitator, the learner, and the environment. The purpose of chapter 3 is  to analyze in detail the material presented in chapter 2. Chapter 4 synthesizes the material of chapters 2 and 3, from which characteristics for industrial arts programs are formulated. Numerous broad conclusions concerning the central theme and recommendations for the learner, facilitator, and environment are given. The document concludes with a four-page bibliography and 44 pages of supplemental materials, including a statement of guiding principles, a survey instrument, criteria for open classrooms, correspondence, and a summarizing statement by the author.

        "description":"The study investigated the diffusion of innovative farming practices from Rapid Adjustment Farms (RAF) to other farms in southeast Ohio. The RAF program, begun in 1968, introduced new technology and management practices to its participant farmers. After reviewing literature of farming programs' information diffusion, a descriptive survey was made of Rapid Adjustment farmers, county extension agents, and other farmers in the RAF area. Three dairy farms of similar tenure in the program were selected from more than 20 RAFs. A stratified random sample was drawn of 30 dairy farmers in each of three counties, with alternative farms also selected by random number. The 90 respondent farmers were asked whether they: (1) viewed the Rapid Adjustment farmer as an opinion leader; (2) adopted  RAF practices, and for how long; and (3) knew the Rapid Adjustment farmer, and in what way. The respondent farmers also gave information about themselves and their farming operations. The interview schedule was pretested in June 1974 and administered in August 1974. Major findings and conclusions of the study are presented, along with recommendations for future RAF administrative decisions. Fifty-three tables give respondents' answers to questions on the interview schedule, often with county breakdowns and statistical analysis of the data. Appendixes contain some of the tables and the interview schedule. A bibliography of materials on diffusion research is included. (SD)",

Consequently, most new developmental strategies are concerned with placing priority on those groups which are the poorest. Non-formal and adult education is more likely to have a direct impact on the urban and rural poor than formal education. An instrument of political and economic change, non-formal education plays an important role in stimulating participation in decision-making. Another area of concern for adult education is the educating of educators and policymakers which allows both the masses and the leaders to change along the same lines. Further  surveys of adult education provision are needed in order to extend coverage to the large portion of the population wihch is presently not being reached. There is an immediate need for establishment or expansion of research, training, and resource centers in adult education. An integrated approach to planning, which relates adult education to other inputs, and the need for increased involvement of the population in development planning continue to be challenges for planners and educators.

Although cadets who either practiced the task or were offered an incentive performed significantly faster on the post-test than learners who did not receive these treatments, the experiments generally indicated that instruction, when it is well-designed,  appears to be a variable of such impact that it leaves little room for improvement in learner performance that might be attributable to such refinement as practice, incentive, and feedback. Sample instructional, practice, and post-test materials and tables of results are included. (Author/PR)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to develop a screening procedure for undergraduate pilot training (UPT). This procedure was based upon the use of ground-based instrument trainers in which UPT candidates, naive to flying, were evaluated in their performance of job sample tasks; i.e., basic instrument flying. Training and testing sessions were conducted in a highly standardized and tightly controlled environment. Student performance was scored using only objective measures of aircraft control and systems management. The job sample approach proved highly successful in predicting student performance in the T-37 phase of UPT. Attrition, due to causes other than a lack of flying skill, was not satisfactorily predicted by this approach.

The study further showed that the more schooling an adult had completed, the more likely he or she would be to pursue some kind of further education. A study, in progress for more than three years, has been examining the question of what is a minimally effective core education for adults. The study has established adult proficiency levels based on real life situations, and has shown that one out of five American adults, an estimated 15 to 20 million, today lack the basic skills required to sustain themselves and their families. To find ways of reaching these adults and convincing  them that they can take hold of their own destinies, and then delivering on that promise, is a mission of the highest order in education. A plan for life-long learning should help adults find meaning and fulfillment in their living, provide them with the skills to be productive and independent, and increase their capacity to function as parents with love, hope, and guidance for their children.

The humanizing of vocational education is to recognize that preparation for employment is the price tag of the technological age. A student must learn to &quot;know thyself&quot;, to &quot;give thyself&quot;, and to &quot;support thyself.&quot; The career development continuum within the State of Ohio consists of: (1) education for career choice, (2) education for work, and (3) continuing education for upgrading and retraining. Education for work is concerned with helping people prepare for productive employment and includes a broad vocational program at the high school level and post-high  school technical/vocational education or professional education. Area vocational education centers in Ohio are full-day centers with three-fourths of the day allotted to instruction in trades and one-fourth to required academics. Other humanizing aspects are: the Occupational Work Adjustment program for dropout-prone 14- and 15-year-old students, the Occupational Work Experience program for mentally handicapped youth 16 and above, the home/family living/consumer education program, and additional programs for the handicapped and the disadvantaged.

Twenty-four disadvantaged families were sampled stratified random fashion by completion of status and area of enrollment. For comparative purposes three additional reference groups were identified and tested. The measurement techniques used for testing the variables for each group were: the Job Descriptive Index (JDI), Minnesota Satisfactoriness  Scales (MSS), Job Motivation Index (JMI), Work Alienation Scale (WAS), and the Obeisance Scale (OS). The testing procedures and design, and the results for each of the variables tested are briefly discussed.

Chapter one discusses the history of such programs over the last 150 years, especially considering the use and biases of intelligence tests during the last 50 years and the recent development of a holistic approach to intelligence. Chapter two surveys the educational programs in 29 juvenile correctional institutions in the Western U. S. which responded to mailed questionnaires regarding types of programs offered, kinds of teaching methods used, training and background of teachers and their opportunities for continuing education, and students' present achievement levels and current learning  difficulties. Chapter three discusses current issues in education for juvenile offenders, dealing at length with issues within institutional classrooms, and less extensively with the problem of linking institutional programs with the community. Chapter four discusses new objectives for integrating the school and the community into correction and presents an agenda of priorities consisting of children's rights to learn, to earn, and to live and develop. Chapter five surveys ten innovative programs in juvenile correctional institutions around the country, providing the name of a contact person for each program. (JR)",

The objectives involved: (1) obtaining predictor constructs in the areas of biographic-demographic information about the teachers and schools, teachers' perceptions of their instructional and non-instructional tasks, their perceptions of their students' behavior, and students' perceptions of their teachers' behaviors; (2) obtaining a subjective-judgment criterion of teacher effectiveness (principals' rating) in the inner-city urban and outer-city suburban areas; and (3) determining the relationships between the predictor constructs and the criterion. Six  questionnaires were used to establish both predictor constructs and criteria. The respondents were 337 high school vocational teachers in all areas selected nationwide from lists submitted by State supervisors and teacher educators, and the principals of the listed teachers. Ninety-five tables present the findings and data analysis. A discussion of the findings is followed by three conclusions and by recommendations relating to further study in search of performance-based criteria of teacher effectiveness and of dimensions of teacher behavior relating to teacher effectiveness.

The program was written for an exploratory investigation of the use of word association procedures to assess the affective and descriptive meanings workers associate with their work environments. The RCMAT program is written in Fortran IV, level G. It calculates relatedness coefficients between all pairs of up to 100 stimulus words.  Output is in the form of an S x S pair-wise matrix, where S is the number of stimulus words. Input consists of a problem card, a list of stimulus words, and each subject's response distribution for each stimulus word. Either individual or pooled relatedness coefficients may be calculated.

Industrial needs and manpower projections should be examined more critically; perhaps the work should be designed for the worker, and perhaps more attention should be directed to national and international job trends, and less to local trends. Changes in student population and Federal legislative policies must also be considered by planners. Vocational education directors have a responsibility to keep current inventories of job opportunities at local, State, national, and international levels. Consideration must also be given to the numbers of students who enter and remain in college and to the selection of vocational education teachers. More efficient use must be made of present  school facilities. Teacher in-service and pre-service programs need to be made more effective and industrial arts education and educators need to become more closely involved with vocational education.

The survey gathered information from a random sample of the general population, a representative sample of continuing education students, and 200 major employers in the region. Comparing leisure time activities and demographic data between users and non-users, the study found some characteristics comparable and others contrasting. Occupationally there were more white collar workers among the users than among the non-users, and the percentage of homemakers was nearly equal to both groups. Regarding class time and format, both users and non-users preferred evening hours and the college campus setting. Regarding financing of postsecondary continuing  education, both users and non-users favor public support for continuing education to supplement current subsidy plans. The report recommends that off-campus learning centers be established in localities more than 20 miles from an existing institution, and that financial support be offered to non-users. The report reproduces the current student survey with percentage responses, and presents the results of the employer survey in tabular form.

The research report of an investigation conducted among commissioned officers in the U.S. armed forces examines one possible underlying course of such conflicting inputs and outputs: the existence of differences in decision makers' formal education and work experience backgrounds. A decision making experiment was conducted to obtain information bearing on relationships between choice of  alternatives and education background, work experience background, and the decision maker's prescribed role. It was found that there were tendencies toward differences in homogeneity of choice and in adaptability to a change in role among individuals categorized into several educational and experience background categories. Appendixes, which provide the test instruments, education and experience background categories, and test data specifying hypotheses of common choice and change in alternative when role changed, comprise half the document.

The study determined that in the sample: most students were white, most were affiliated with either the Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish religious denominations, most were 30-39 years old, most were married, the median family income was $12,001-$15,000, a plurality were employed in professional and technical occupations, and the median highest level of education  was three to four years of college. Regarding student involvement with the credit-free programs, the study determined that: most students obtained information through brochures mailed to their homes; most students considered course topic as their prime consideration in course selection; although time of class meeting was of secondary importance, most students preferred weekday evenings; and of much less significance were location, transportation, and baby-sitter availability.

Based on interviews with four supervising teachers, a checklist of competencies was prepared and mailed to 27 vocational agriculture teachers (who had served as supervising teachers) who were asked to rank the degrees of need for mastery of each competency. The analysis of the 20 respondents indicates a great or considerable need for student teachers to have developed several competencies prior to their field work. Ratings are presented in tabular form. Nine of the highly rated  competencies (instructional planning, instructional materials and resources, conducting instruction, supervised occupational experience programs, working with FFA, evaluating instruction, counseling, maintaining community relations, and maintaining a professional role) are summarized. Recommendations stress coordination of the segments of teacher education programs and improvement of these programs.

First, in formulating performance objectives, the teacher must consider the program objectives, the characteristics of the students, and the teaching resources of the community. Second, the diversity of interests, abilities, and other characteristics of teachers preclude the uniformity of general prescriptions for all teachers. The definition of the concept of a performance objective, its basis and origins (employability of students, task analysis, and goal statements), and special considerations in formulating objectives are defined.

In grades 3-6, emphasis is on student awareness of the world of work, while in grades 7-8 exposure to the world of work is through career guidance seminars, observational activities, and elective mini-courses. In grades 9-12, students are involved in elective mini-courses, career exploration seminars, and worksite placement. Teachers write their own career  awareness lessons with assistance from the career/vocational education coordinator and then test them in their classrooms and revise them before distribution to other teachers. The Cornell Career Awareness Inventory and the Career Maturity Inventory are used to determine levels of career awareness and vocational maturity. An integral part of program development is direct teacher involvement in the process through in-service training. (EA)",

        "description":"The main purpose of the study was to develop a cooperative education plan for the Mid-Plains Technical Community College area through assessment of: (1) vocational interests of students in grades 9-12, (2) occupational opportunities of employers, and (3) various existing cooperative education programs. Vocational interest assessment consisted of administration of the Ohio Vocational Interest Survey and the Minnesota Work Values Inventory to 929 secondary students; occupational opportunities were assessed by analyzing 827 valid employer responses to an Occupational Opportunities Survey and a Cooperative Education Resources Survey. Visitation was made to all Nebraska two-year postsecondary institutions with Federal cooperative education programs as well as other selected technical  community colleges with non-governmental programs. Exemplary cooperative education programs in other States also were surveyed. Findings indicated that, despite high interest levels, only about one-third of the high school students were enrolled in vocational or business-oriented programs. Future enrollments in postsecondary vocational-technical and business schools were highly related to early identification of students. The top-ranking interest area was farming-fishery-forestry, while the greatest occupational need was in the category of services. It was concluded that training programs in the services area were needed, especially for food and beverage preparation and service. (EA)",

        "description":"The study explored the feasibility of deriving an educationally relevant occupational cluster structure based on Occupational Analysis Inventory (OAI) work dimensions. A hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to the factor score profiles of 814 occupations on 22 higher-order OAI work dimensions. From that analysis, 73 occupational clusters were identified and interpreted. Although those clusters were for the most part individually meaningful, the desired hierarchical pattern of clustering did not emerge in an interpretable form, and 155 of the 814 occupations in the sample failed to cluster in a logical manner at any stage of the hierarchical process. Several factors are considered that may have attenuated the clarity of the hierarchical structure. There is a long review of  literature and a brief description of the clusters grouped under the following occupations: technical/scientific, business/organizational, clerical, sales/service, health-related, teaching/counseling, art/decorative, stationary machine operating, service/repair of electrical and mechanical systems, environmental/earth-working, and manual. Nearly half of the document comprises appendixes treating: importance scale, occupational clusters formed on the basis of OAI-derived higher-order work dimensions, and mean work-dimension and attribute-requirement profiles for 73 OAI-derived occupational clusters.

Regarding home and family life, the majority of students lived with both natural parents, in male dominated family settings. All but one of the students were unmarried. Frequency of dating varied considerably between the sexes and the class groups. The students' attitudes toward school were neutral and expressed neither strong approval nor disapproval, but most students indicated that they would continue in school even if attendance was voluntary. A substantial number of students  rated their homework assignments as difficult. With respect to vocational and educational plans, one-half indicated a desire to graduate from college, and despite their involvement in the EBCE program, in some cases for as many as five months, many made their plans without help from anyone.

The test instrument measures attitudinal and cognitive skills which correspond with program goals, and was considered sufficiently reliable and valid as a measure of vocational maturity for the purposes of evaluating the AEL/EBCE program. The results of the administration of the CDI to the students on three occasions indicate that EBCE students performed best on the cognitive section of the test, and poorest on the first of two attitudinal sections. The report concludes that compared with a tenth grade norm group, the EBCE students' entering scores  on the CDI were low, and the rank of the subtest scores was the reverse of the expected order. The test also indicated the importance of a counselor with wide-ranging knowledge of vocational development theory and a variety of career experiences on the cognitive career skill development of the students.

Test results indicated that: students registered much greater competence in mathematics than in reading, language arts, social studies, science, and the use of sources; during the year the students' growth rate exceeded the  expected growth rate, even in mathematics, in all areas except use of sources; there were no significant test score differences between the group which participated for the entire academic year and the group which participated for only half of the year; and whether students took courses for credit or non-credit had little apparent effect on performance in science, social studies, and mathematics.

Students examined at the beginning of their involvement in the program (Group One beginning in September 1972 and Group Two beginning in January 1973) indicated a positive attitude to only one concept, education; all other concepts were viewed as neutral. The data also indicated that the attitudes of Group One students remained fairly stable during the year. A comparative analysis of  the Group One and Group Two students showed that none of the group main effects were statistically significant on any of the nine concepts, and that although some group by adjective interaction effects were found, none were meaningful in terms of the questions for which answers were sought. Of the report's three appendixes, one reproduces the semantic differential test instrument, and two provide statistical tables depicting analyses of variance for the test concepts. (Author/JR)",

Group One students (those matriculating in September 1972) took the test on all three occasions; Group Two students (those matriculating in January 1973) took it on only the latter two occasions. Thirteen significant correlations were found, indicating that the number of significant occupational and college major interests of the first group of male students (17 students) was rather stable. These correlations show that students with higher numbers of interests retained higher numbers of  interests. The number of occupational interests of the second group of females (13 students) was stable. Verification scores were stable, except for the second group of 10 male students. No significant differences were found in the number of significant interests in occupations or college majors for males or females in either the first or second groups between any two occasions.

All students were tested in February and in May 1973; Group One students (those matriculating in September 1972) had had one semester's exposure to AEL/EBCE before testing, and Group Two students (those matriculating in January 1973) had had none. In the February test, Group One students appeared to have superior psychomotor creativity and superior maturity, but were inferior in learning attitude to Group Two students. In the May test, the difference in psychomotor creativity between the two groups was  less and was not statistically significant. The difference between the groups in learning attitude, maturity, cognitive skills, personal adjustment, social adjustment, and flexibility remained approximately the same.

Students favorably compared the EBCE program with the public high schools  they previously attended. Regarding suggestions for improving the EBCE program, most frequent student responses concerned specific aspects of the proram such as providing better job experiences.

Most parents felt their child learned as much as or more than in previous programs, especially  regarding job information. Parents rated on-the-job experience as the greatest strength of the AEL/EBCE program, and transportation difficulties as its greatest weakness. More than half of the parents felt the AEL/EBCE program helped their children to choose a career. Parents' criticisms generally focused on the program's permissiveness, instructional unconventionality, and insufficient applicant screening.

In general the activity sheets were considered a good monitoring device in a highly flexible instructional program such as AEL/EBCE. Limitations arising from their use, however, were students' failure to comment on their assignments in the space provided and the instructional managers' mechanical  repetition of assignment objectives on the sheets. The evaluation of the use of activity sheets suggests the disadvantage of adapting course work to individual student interests, the need for instructional managers' developing course outlines specifying minimum skills and understandings required of students, and the possibility of adopting a more interdisciplinary problem-centered approach to instruction.

A third section on results considers students' academic achievements, career maturity, attitudes toward EBCE and miscellaneous  student indicators, and parents' and employers' reactions to the program. Two final sections present a summary and conclusion and a discussion of the evaluation. Eight appendixes which collectively comprise 25 pages include: number, title, and authors of FY 1973 EBCE Evaluation Reports; numbers of students placed at employer sites 1972-73; employer site/cluster distribution; semantic differential; activity sheet; student interview form; parent interview schedule; and parent questionnaire.

For any given State, the total amount of funds obligated in a particular fiscal year may or may not be equal to the State's allotment for that fiscal year. The two reasons for this difference between funds allotted and funds obligated for grants and contracts are: (1) that a State may reserve some of the State allotment for support of the State Research Coordinating Unit, using the remaining amount for the  award of grants and contracts, and (2) that a State could carry unused funds over and obligate them in the following year.

The report outlines the roles of various State, Federal, and local institutions; the barriers the project faced; and the motivations of people and groups responsible for creating the first regional staff development project in adult basic education (ABE).

Phase 1 developed State and regionwide  staff development systems and Phase 2 utilized these staff development systems as vehicles for disseminating innovative ideas and materials to ABE teachers at the local level. Major outcomes were: stronger leadership in State departments of education, university and college services for staff development in adult education, trainers for inservice personnel, planning committees, establishing written plans for each project, and obtaining technical expertise for the projects. Recommendations focus on the strengthening of services and programs. (JB)",

After defining the terms curriculum, development, and evaluation, the report classifies the two major forms of curriculum development as system-based (external changes brought into curriculum) and subject-based (internal changes in the content of the curriculum). Three contemporary strategies for curriculum development are: the Tyler strategy (preliminary analysis, selecting and defining objectives, selecting and creating learning experiences, organizing learning experiences, and curriculum evaluation), the DeVault and Anglin strategy, (needs assessment, development and tryout, field verification, and implementation), and the Popham strategy (goal selection,  explication of the product's mission, development of the initial product, developmental testing and revision, installation testing, and diffusion). Evaluation in product development involves both summative and formative evaluation, the latter having a major role in the development of curriculum products. Formative evaluation helps form and provide feedback information in a systematic manner and assists the curriculum development process by examining procedures and materials. Implications for further instructional product development emphasize: curriculum development as a practical matter, early dissemination, the unity and continuity of curriculum development, and the necessity of post-publication evaluation.

During much of its history, a Division of Research has been operative; the monograph surveys most of the publications of that division as well as a number of other studies performed independently of the Peace Corps. The purposes of this review are to: (1) describe the personnel selection procedure; (2) report and evaluate research on personnel assessment, selection, training, and overseas performance, (3) suggest ways of utilizing research findings; and (4) suggest specific research needs. The book disseminates information not generally available, includes a good deal of general background material about  the Peace Corps, and emphasizes numerical and empirical data. Autobiographical books or journalistic analyses have been omitted or treated briefly; some interpretive articles are discussed. The book is technical in tone and noncontroversial in nature. Only the final chapter, &quot;An Overview of Peace Corps Goals and Research,&quot; is concerned in part with value statements and summary evaluations of specific programs or of the Peace Corps as a whole.

        "description":"Today's harsh economy gives a spirit of urgency to the call for an effective harmonizing of occupational development with academic learning. Whether we as teachers or administrators are in agreement or not, the evidence is very clear that our students expect their college years to yield occupational as well as academic outcomes. It is time that we bring system and order, curricular strength, and philosophical unity to a condition that remains in many places ad hoc, unsystematic, and not consciously and deliberately responsive to the lifetime needs of learners and wage-earners. Within the past year, the College Entrance Examination Board has taken two integrally related steps toward becoming a significant force in career development during the remainder of this decade, and,  perhaps, on into the 1980's. The first consists of a State-level study of career education now in its final stages. The study is exploring a number of barriers to full implementation of career education at the State level. The College Board is also attempting to come to grips with a concrete service to the process of career education. We have studied numerous institutions across the country to identify good linkages between schools and the workplace. The list of worthy sites where career education is finding a prominent place is nearly endless. (Author)",

        "description":"The findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the Wilms study leave much to be desired. The reported results and interpretation of those results are generally not supported, nor was the design adequate either to confirm or refute the author's central hypothesis. In its present state, the report of the study cannot serve as a valid professional reporting source. The report departs from the generally accepted format of scientific reports and mixes facts and interpretations rather freely. In order to assess the study, therefore, the reviewers were forced to reconstruct it according to the logical sequence found in most technical reports, i.e., problem, objectives, method, results, conclusions, and recommendations. The review conforms to that sequence. The reviewers believe that  few verifiable results have emerged, or could have emerged, from the study because of numerous design flaws and a severe lack of the design and procedural information which would be needed to evaluate the study's adequacy. Editorializing of the author's biases and assumptions occur throughout the report, unsupported by study data. When the data do not support the author's expectations, there seems to be a tendency to dispell undesired conclusions with an alternative explanation or assumption not based on study data.

An important effort to eradicate these problems has been the Farmer's Functional Literacy Program in India. This major project relates adult education and training in modern agricultural practices. The experimental project was designed in India to develop curriculum materials specifically oriented to problem-solving rather than oriented solely to information supply. The project's five phases consisted of: an exploratory phase, a syllabus and curriculum construction phase, material preparation phase, an action phase, and an evaluation. A survey was conducted to identify crucial problems faced by farmers. From the findings,  problems and objectives were classified and selected. Remedial measures were established, focusing on these problems. The organization of the syllabus reformulated the problems in terms of positive remedial operations and transformed into units or contents which are described. The two steps in the syllabus incorporate these remedial measures for farmers and then convey skills needed for improvement. Illustrations of problem-solving approach and curriculum development are provided. A brief report of the action phase is provided, and tentative evaluation criteria discussed. (Author/JB)",

The programs' management was also evaluated. It was found that although some positive achievements have been made, the program successfully reaches only a small fraction of those needing it. In the program's first nine years, about 4.6 million adults enrolled, but only about one percent of the 57 million adults in the target population and four percent of the 15 million adults with less than eight years of schooling have participated in any given year. Through fiscal year 1972, 17 percent of the 3.5 million participants at or below the eighth grade level had achieved an eighth grade equivalency education.  Management problems include: lack of realistic and measurable program goals and evaluative criteria, misdirected recruiting, limited benefits of special projects and unsystematic dissemination of their results, lack of coordination with Federal antipoverty and manpower-training programs, and inaccurate reporting of data. The report recommends several actions (including legislative and congressional) for combating these problems. (Author/PR)",

        "description":"People function within situational contexts, and these contexts define and limit behavior. An organization is a very important context and, accordingly, produces potent forces which circumscribe and channel the activities, attitudes, and motivations of personnel. For this reason, both individual and group behavior within an organization is simply not the same as that outside of it. Carried over to management, this suggests that the first thing of which a manager must become aware is that behavior in organizations is usually the result of numerous determinants, many of which will have their source in the work context. To neglect context factors can only cause a manager to misunderstand the problem and take the wrong course for its resolution. Fortunately, the work context is one  thing that can be greatly influenced and controlled by managers. The major point of this discussion is that many problems that lead to serious interference with organizational effectiveness have their sources in the failures of organizational leaders to provide work-context conditions that are most conducive to effective performance. Three general factors that control performance in every organization are: effective management, effective leadership, and effective training. (Author/PR)",

        "description":"The jobless rate among all household heads reached 6 percent in April 1975, double the average rate over the 1963-74 period (2.8 percent), and half again as high as the previous peak (4 percent) recorded during the first half of 1963. The number of unemployed household heads increased from 1.4 to 3.2 million from October 1973 to April 1975, from 34 percent to 39 percent of the unemployed. About three-quarters of the household heads in the labor force are men heading families of two or more persons and one-tenth are female family heads. The unemployment rate for male family heads has increased two and one half times since October 1973 to 5.3 percent in April 1975, but was still much lower than the 9.3 percent rate for female family heads. The financial effects of unemployment on  the family can be cushioned by the presence of other wage earners. According to the latest information available on this subject, in March 1974 about 30 percent of the families with an unemployed head had a full-time earner, usually the wife. However it is doubtful that the additional worker compensated for the loss of income incurred by the unemployment of the household head. (Author/JR)",

It summarizes the findings and progress of several experimental projects from the initial efforts under the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962 to those still underway as the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 came into force. Drawing on experiences from the programs described, the focus of the report is on ways to provide adults with academic skills. Among the topics considered are: individualized instruction, programed instruction, diagnostic and evaluative tests, learning motivation, behavioral objectives, learning environment, teacher  training, use of tutors, counseling and supportive services, English as a second language, and projects of special significance. The report points to many unresolved problems and to the need for further research to document the teaching techniques, materials, and environments that work best for particular kinds of clients. Appended are brief discussions of related activities in manpower programs administered by the Department of Labor and of relevant research by the Office of Education. (Author/PR)",

        "description":"The paper examines the effect of military training and experience on the civilian earnings and employment of persons who have served one term of military service. Since training effects are specific to individuals and to civilian occupations, empirical problems in precisely defining the meaning of training effects arise. Additional problems in understanding and estimating training effects result from selectivity bias. Preliminary assessments of the effects of military training on civilian earnings indicate that when civilian occupational choice is ignored, military training does not seem to significantly affect civilian earnings. However, within occupations, military training does sometimes have such an effect. Having discussed these theoretical pitfalls and preliminary findings  of the project, the paper develops a model of choice from which it is possible to derive empirically estimable relationships to calculate military training effects and to impute the total returns to training in a military specialty from the occupational choices actually made by enlisted personnel. Finally, the paper discusses four problems which need to be solved before the model can be applied (treatment of unemployment, choice of critical sample sizes, survey nonresponse, and selection of civilian alternative categories), and outlines a plan for proceeding with the analysis of military training premiums.

Current vocational students regard the quality of present programs more highly than do either vocational graduates or employers. In measuring the success of vocational programs, all groups consider student satisfaction, successful job placement, skill development, on-the-job advancement, and placement in advance training programs as valid measures of success. Responses also indicate that employers, vocational graduates, and vocational students do not make extensive use of workforce forecasts, and that current students are more concerned with  increasing the placement services offered by vocational training institutions than are the other respondent groups. Regarding future directions for vocational education, responses indicate strong support for career education in the State's common schools and the organization of vocational education planning conferences for labor, industry, and educational personnel. The study concludes with a list of seven immediate and long-range recommendations. Seven appendixes which include the study plan, the four survey instruments, firms and agencies in empolyer and graduate samples, and educational institutions and classes sampled, comprise over half the document.

        "description":"The report opens with detailed summaries of historical background information for each of the groups involved and with a review of the literature on bias in textbooks in Canada, the United States, and other countries. Over a time span of six months, 211 readers evaluated 1,719 textbooks. Readers located 104 biases in 78 textbooks. The 23 biases against the aged occurred mainly in English primary texts. Bias by omission accounted for most of the 65 findings concerning labor unions; however, strong negative statements about unions constituted most of the other biases. The 16 biases against political minorities were mostly ones of omission. The investigators believed that biases against labor unions could have a strong negative effect on student attitudes. Biases regarding the aged  and political minorities, on the other hand, were not considered pronounced enough to negatively affect student attitudes. The investigators recommended objective balanced treatment of minority groups in textbooks, and the formulation of guidelines for textbook evaluation. Seven appendixes include the evaluation instrument; related biases against the French, Indians, other ethnic minorities, and women; suggestions for improving the evaluation instrument; and lists of texts containing bias.

The methodology, called the optimal allocation strategy, is employed to solve a representative allocation problem in a hypothetical enlistment year. The exercise serves to show how the value of available personnel information may be estimated when used in the most efficient manner possible. Four conclusions are drawn from the study: the value of military classification information currently available to the Air Force can be estimated in tangible terms; the value of even better classification information which could  become available in the future as a result of specific research can be estimated in tangible terms; the means for getting the most out of current available information exist; and a variety of personnel policies and programs can be evaluated in terms of both real and realizable dollar payoffs.

An analysis of six variables among lathe setter-operators showed that: present work situations among the operators varied greatly, especially regarding wages; present work situation controls (Physical conditions on the job, length of employment, entry level) also varied greatly; initial socioeconomic conditions were better for the operators than for the general population; formal educational level of the operators did not differ from that of the general labor force; the work experience of most operators was primarily industrial; and only 11.5 percent of the  operators reached the skilled occupational level without some form of specialized industrial training. A linear regression model was used to determine the effect of the six variables on wage per hour, number and difficulty of operations performed, and time taken to reach the skilled occupational level. Since industrial training is required to reach the skilled occupational level and since private schools train many more persons than do SENAI schools, some types of private school training may provide acceptable alternatives to some types of SENAI training.

These observations are based primarily on programs conducted in Iran, Tanzania, Turkey, and Zambia.

Limited to one page, the questionnaire was designed so that questions could be answered with check marks or one-word answers. Twenty-six questionnaires (81 percent) were returned. We believe the results of the survey indicate that the concept of instruction in personal finance has successfully passed the experimental stage. The course is open to business majors as well as to non-majors in 54 percent of the responses. Generally the course requires no prerequisites, and in 62 percent of the schools freshmen can take  the course. All schools responding included investments, insurance, borrowing, and savings as content covered. Student attitudes toward personal finance compared favorably with attitudes toward other courses. A surprisingly large number of respondents cited the use of case problems, visual aids, and independent assignments for instruction. The raw score results and percentages are presented. (Author/PR)",

A stratified random sample (496 students) was drawn from the Pittsburgh Public School's Occupational, Vocational, and Technical Exploratory Program. Personal and environmental factors included: (1) achievement subscores for industrial arts/home economics/business education; (2) factors of age, race, breadwinner's socioeconomic status, and home school; (3) vocational attitude maturity; (4) motivation; (5) occupational values of interest and satisfaction, salary, prestige, and security; (6) attitude scores for industrial arts/home economics/business education; and (7) student self-reports on  teacher/program/peer influence on course choices. The dependent variables were 12 career exploration courses in rank order of popularity. Computations included Pearson product moment correlation, multiple regression analysis, and Behrens-Fisher t-tests. Some conclusions were that exploratory business education courses can successfully be implemented at the middle school and that it is possible to design learning activities which appeal to a wide range of student backgrounds. Sex, race, and occupational value-security were the most frequently appearing and stable influencing variables. Career exploration course selection by preadolescents is only moderately explainable by personal/environmental analysis. (Author/EA)",

The report develops a conceptual model for integrating these approaches into a comprehensive curriculum model consisting of a linear diagram which proceeds successively from occupational clusters through function, tasks, competencies, competency clusters, and a subjective value, philosophy, and student interest screen to curriculum development. After discussing the assumptions underlying the model, the report concludes with brief discussions of the five operational phases of the model construction, and the methodology and significance of the study.

The basic idea is that the individual leader at any level expects certain behavior from his superior, his subordinates, and himself. Also, both his superior and his subordinates expect certain behavior from him. It appears that only when these expectations are known and met can true leadership take place. These monographs attempt to define the appropriate terms of the informal contract and the extent to which they are recognized and fulfilled throughout the Army. Attention is focused on four basic  leadership modules: Junior NCO leadership; Senior NCO leadership; Company Grade Officer leadership; and Field Grade Officer leadership. Data on the modules are structured so as to reflect racial characteristics and attitudes in the first two monographs: &quot;Demographic Characteristics of U. S. Army Leaders&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction with U. S. Army Leadership.&quot; The remaining monographs examine the informal contract in terms of specific behaviors for Junior NCO leadership, Senior NCO leadership, and Company Grade Officer leadership.

Industry employment trends indicate: manufacturing will suffer the greatest decrease in employment; employment in contract construction will increase substantially; employment in transportation, communications, public utilities,  wholesale and retail trade, finance, insurance, real estate, and public administration will grow moderately; and employment in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries will decline. From the occupational standpoint, the growth in the professional, technical, and kindred occupations will be substantial; the net demand in the clerical field will be the largest among the nine major occupational divisions; demand for workers in the service worker field will increase over the 1970-80 period; and among the remaining occupational divisions, all except operatives and kindred workers and farmers and farm workers will show positive growth rates.

        "description":"The purpose of the 1973 Pilot Literacy Project (Victoria, Australia) was to explore the nature of the problem of nonmigrant adults who had attended school but who considered themselves illiterate or functionally illiterate, to discover what sort of people were illiterate and to what extent, and to examine home influences and educational background. Of the 166 illiterate and semi-illiterate people involved, nearly half were self-generating starters, about one-third responded to a television presentation, and one-third were already known to agencies. The majority had primary school education and over half had one to three years of post-primary schooling. Approximately three-fourths of the group were below 35 years of age. The project geared toward a noninstitutional approach.  Tutors, refereed to as group leaders, worked as a task force operating in homes, factories, libraries, and community and church centers. The project was subsidized for 12 groups not exceeding five members. The social benefits derived from group involvement were improved self-concepts, increased employment opportunities, and group unity. Monthly workshops for tutors provided continuous evaluation, information, and support group functions. The concluding section sets forth recommendations by the Victoria Council of Adult Education to combat adult illiteracy. (EA)",

The study was undertaken to investigate the post-school employment success and selected characteristics of graduates from each of these programs. The opportunity was also provided for graduates to evaluate the effectiveness of their high school programs. The study was based on 183 (71 percent of the possible 259) graduates. Some significant findings included: a significantly higher proportion of successfully employed graduates had been  enrolled in work study programs than in any of the other three programs; female special education students are not, regardless of program, being properly prepared for post-school employment success; the unemployment rate of the special education graduate is five times greater than the regular education graduate; driver education is of great importance; and placement services were successful in placing eight out of nine graduates.

        "description":"The document comprises the final evaluation report and the fourth quarterly progress report of Operation Breakthrough, an experimental demonstration project to upgrade Spanish-speaking workers in entry-level factory jobs. Ten classes at six sites with a total of 133 students were held; 53 attended at least 50 of the total 150 hours. Classes were conducted either prior to or after working hours, although part of the class time overlapped with company time; the companies' support of the program thus involved both teacher and worker compensation. Low attendance rate was a consistent problem, but attendance figures rose the second year, due to the companies' involvement in planning, financing, and monitoring the classes. Three sets of classes operated according to the intentions of  the proposal and were found to have few operational problems while three other of the organizations' operations lacked what had been identified as essential elements. Classroom aides (company personnel) were used during the first year, but rarely during the second. They were viewed as important by teachers and administrators, allowing class flexibility and providing a resource for job-related English instruction. Conversational English was deemed important to the students. The document reports the results of interviews, monitoring visits, and test instruments. A program guide is being developed. (Author/AJ)",

The Phase 1 data for the followup study consisted of reporting student characteristics. Participation in the followup study consisted of all 38 community college districts in Illinois and 46 community colleges involving 27,663 students. The preliminary data for Phase 1 of the study were reported by each of the Illinois public community colleges and based on the number of new fall 1974 students in the occupational/career program. The reports classified these students by their curriculum, type of attendance (45.3  percent full-time, 54.7 percent part-time), sex (49.7 percent male, 50.3 percent female), and original intent for enrolling at the college (56.2 percent preparation for employment in career areas, 21.2 percent skill improvement). The preliminary report shows that although there are slight differences between the original intent of male and female students, significant differences occur between full-time and part-time students. It is concluded that followup data will be needed and can be accomplished through proposed phases 2 (withdrawal analysis) and 3 (followup and employer surveys).

Expenditures were primarily for direct educative services and supporting services. Direct educative services accounted for an estimated $25.9 million (70.5 percent). Of that total, $13.6 million was expended on English language arts, reading, and social sciences; $4.1 million for natural sciences and mathematics; $3.8 million on vocational training; and $4.4 million on other services including textbooks, cultural activities and studies, and special curricula for the handicapped. Supporting services accounted for $10.3 million (28.1  percent) of the total Federal expenditure. Approximately $4.5 million of that was spent for administration and information dissemination. A total of $203,000 was spent on program development. Expenditures for other services including testing, psychological and guidance services, library resources, and audiovisual materials, amounted to $5.0 million. Together, direct educative services and supporting services accounted for 98.6 percent of all money expended. Other services, including maintenance and operation of plant, fixed charges, ancillary services, and capital outlay, accounted for $516,000 (1.4 percent). (Author/PR)",

        "description":"Teachers and paraprofessionals working as instructors in adult English as a Second Language (ESL) programs needed special training to increase their ESL skills and subject matter knowledge. A review of the literature on adult education traces the development of the concept from the eighteenth century to the present, examines the recent particular development of Adult Basic Education (ABE) and ESL within the adult education movement, and hypothesizes that ESL/ABE instructors can improve their self-confidence and competency by participating in a teacher training instructional module. Such an instructional training package was presented to three groups (26 subjects) representing a wide range of ESL programs in Colorado and Wyoming. Research data indicated that an ESL training  package given to three test groups improved their knowledge of selected ESL goals and objectives and of related ESL teacher competency information. The data lead to such conclusions as: training packages geared toward special needs of ESL teachers of adults can result in significantly increased knowledge gains; and the learning package structure is well received by teachers of varying knowledge levels who are teaching students of varied backgrounds. The learning package script (32 pages) and course outline are appended. (Author/JR)",

Unlike standardized group tests, the alternative method is characterized by such features as flexibility in time and location of testing, variety of communication methods, and continuous feedback to students. The program's first developmental objective for 1974-75 was a field test demonstration. Preparatory steps for the field test included defining performance criteria (translating generalized competencies into behavioral terms, with accompanying performance indicators), designing assessment components (developing diagnostic procedures and procedures for assessing generalized and  individualized competencies), and designing the operational form of the assessment system. Later steps included pre-testing the assessment system (selection and recruitment of subjects and observers, and method of testing), and defining the role of the learning consultants (program development, counseling adult learners, and administering tests). The second objective, the awarding of diplomas, included gathering information on the program's first 20 graduates for later use in program revision. Objective three, the production of a final external diploma assessment package, will require additional time to accomplish. (JR)",

        "description":"The report on the implications of social changes in the United States for vocational education personnel contains five recommendations aimed at helping vocational education personnel at all educational and administrative levels in the various States to better maintain, enhance, and adjust their services to target populations within the changing social environment. The rationale for the recommendations rests on the analysis of the present-day United States as a post-industrial society, one characterized by its open social system, its sophisticated information systems, its large interrelated institutions and organizations, and its large number of white collar workers. While social changes occur rapidly in post-industrial society, cultural and organizational changes do not keep  pace. Although such lagging behind the times does not characterize vocational education, vocational educators must be aware of the need for openness in order to develop a capacity to interact with the environment bearing on the system of vocational education, and must welcome the opportunity for such interaction. Like Janus of Roman mythology, they must look in all directions in order to effectively interact with the environment. Vocational educators, especially at the administrative level, must provide management leadership expertise so that challenges to education can be more adequately addressed. (JR)",

The two sections are divided by a page listing actions which were taken in Iowa to implement the council recommendations contained in the 1972 report. The 1973 report is composed of four summarized council observations of needs and four recommendations; the sequencing of the recommendations is intended to suggest an order that might be adopted for logical, universal implementation of the career education concept. The four recommendations are: (1) that a State definition for the term &quot;career education&quot; be developed; (2)  that a plan be developed to coordinate efforts to infuse the concept in all teacher and administrator preparation programs; (3) that State curriculum guides be rewritten to include the career education concept; and (4) that a State coordinating committee develop a plan encouraging universal implementation of the concept. The second section lists the council's 1972 recommendations with a paragraph of comment by the State Department of Public Instruction following each of the 29 recommendations. (AJ)",

The topic of the 1974 report is cooperative work-study programs in the State. The Council collected information and observations by visiting 12 school systems in various sectors of the State, ranging in size from large to small, located in metropolitan, suburban, and rural communities, and including both schools that do offer and that do not offer cooperative programs. The council conversed with students, teachers, and administrators; data were also collected by the Council staff, and reviewed by the Council members for purposes of verifying or rejecting field  observations. The report addresses itself to three major questions: (1) How valid and appropriate is the State plan for career education? (2) How effectively are the needs of the people of Iowa being served? (3) To what extent have the recommendations contained in the Council's 1973 report been implemented? Appended to the report are 80 pages of data on which the recommendations were based, including graphs, maps, tables, supplementary papers, and a summary of information gleaned from the field visits.

        "description":"Experience-Based Career Education (EBCE) has been developed as an experimental program to help high school students bridge the gap between study and experience, between the classroom and the community. The key to the EBCE concept is the adult working in any local community environment who is willing to share occupational knowledge of the real world with an interested student. EBCE is a voluntary, tuition-free alternative program of full-time learning resulting in an accredited high school diploma. It differs from traditional work/education programs by emphasizing broad career and intellectual goals rather than vocational skills, by using experiential education to convey academic learning, and allowing students a greater role in educational planning. Four educational laboratories  were selected in 1972 to develop and test pilot versions of EBCE in a variety of economic and social settings: Far West School, Oakland, California; Academy for Career Education, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Appalachia Educational Laboratory, Charleston, West Virginia; Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, Portland, Oregon. One of EBCE's future challenges is to help school systems to make the changes needed to accommodate this complex innovation. The forthcoming EBCE dissemination/service plan includes regional demonstration centers, State networks, and interagency cooperation at the national level. (EA)",

In 1972-73, study committees were appointed to deal with the allied health professions of physical therapy, radiologic technology, medical laboratory technology, and the dental auxiliaries. The following year committees focused on medical record administration, nutrition and dietetics, respiratory therapy, and environmental health technology. The disciplines of this report are restricted to those for which preparation is likely to be acquired in two and four-year institutions of higher education. The three basic patterns leading to professional status  which are expected to prevail are: (1) pre-professional curriculum--associate degree (optional), (2) basic professional curriculum--academic certificate or associate degree, and (3) intermediate professional curriculum--academic certificate or associate degree. The third section of the report examines problems related to credit transfer involving criteria for admissions, credit, grades, curriculum, student services, and institutional autonomy, and then recommends appropriate guidelines. More than half of the document consists of an appendix which outlines the status and the recommendations for the transfer of credit of the eight allied health professions studied by this project.

The first phase of the study, a review of the appropriate literature, contributed to the formulation of 22 criterion statements relevant to the development of graduate study in adult education. The study's second phase involved: defining the field of adult education; developing a behavioral classification scheme for the educational objectives of graduate programs in adult education; identifying existing statements of education objectives, professional competencies, and specific on-the-job behaviors of adult educators; classifying, refining, and formulating these statements into behavioral descriptions of these objectives; and refining those  behavioral descriptions into a series of 23 statements for evaluating graduate study in adult education. Phase three involved surveying the opinions of adult education graduate students and doctorates regarding the importance of graduate study in developing professional competencies in the 23 behaviors. The phase three findings indicate that all 23 behaviors are important in the practice of adult education and that nearly all adult educators have a need for increasing their competence in these behaviors. Suggestions for improving graduate programs in adult education conclude the study, with an 11-page bibliography following. (JR)",

        "description":"The document summarizes research on the process of diffusing innovations in vocational education. The purpose was to: (1) determine if empirical dimensions of three conceptual domains (innovation, client, and strategy) exist; (2) if they exist, to identify them; (3) to describe them with empirical information; and (4) to relate the dimensions to perceived effectiveness of diffusion tactics. An interim report described the innovation and client domains; the final report identifies types of diffusion tactics and relates selected variables (types of diffusion tactics, types of clients, stages of adoption, and types of innovations) to the perceived effectiveness of these tactics. Stages of adoption are identified as awareness, interest, evaluation, and adoption. The most important  finding of the study was a significant difference in the perceived effectiveness of diffusion tactics across all stages of adoption. The ratings for stage of adoption was different across all tactics. The interaction of these two variables was also significant. Individuals in the client clusters perceived tactic effectiveness differently. Respondents in different roles tended to perceive tactic effectiveness differently. These findings empirically document the need for differential use in educational change tactics for persons in different roles and for projects in different stages of adoption. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"To identify professional education competency needs for vocational agriculture teachers in Ohio, 555 secondary vocational agriculture teachers teaching in the State during 1973-74 were surveyed. The target population was stratified into three groups: (1) four-year college agricultural education majors, (2) four-year college technical agriculture majors, and (3) non-college graduates recruited from business and industry. The study sample included 79 college technical agriculture majors, 43 non-college graduates, and a random sample of 200 professionally prepared teachers. Data were collected through mail questionnaires from 83 percent of the vocational agriculture teachers, 75 percent of the technical agriculture majors, and personal interviews with non-college graduate teachers.  Questions covered educational/occupational backgrounds of the respondents, teachers' perceptions of the importance of 256 professional education competencies, and teachers' percepts of their proficiency. The number of competencies most needed by the three groups of teachers varied considerably. In-service education needs for the 256 competency items indicated 23 items for professionally trained teachers, 99 items for technical agriculture majors, and 255 for non-college graduates. It was recommended that Ohio teacher educators/supervisors in agricultural education continue evaluation of competency needs of the three groups in up-dating pre-service and in-service teacher preparation programs.

The three levels of career awareness, career exploration, and vocational preparation became an integral part of the Comprehensive Career Education Model (CCEM) at an early stage. Eight elements were derived from eight statements which defined areas considered to be essential in career education. CVE, in cooperation with six school districts, designed and prepared some 133 K-12 career education curriculum units, 45 of which have been revised and field tested by CVE. Sixtyone other units are being revised and field tested by the American Institutes for Research (AIR). The entire set of units was intended to be illustrative rather  than comprehensive. The thrust of the AIR project has been for impact. Three groups, publishers, school administrators, and teachers, were surveyed to determine their needs and goals and their reactions to the current form of the units. The units were then analyzed and their content coded on a lesson-by-lesson basis. These data will be used in revision to prevent redundancy and assume that a coherent career education program will evolve from the revision process. Further revision and field testing will be followed by arrangements for commercial publication. (Author/SA)",

This led to the involvement of AIR in the design and development of the Comprehensive Career Education Model (CCEM). Four general constraints under which career education programs must operate are: they must be economically feasible, they must be able to operate with regular classroom staffing patterns, they must be considerate of teacher time and effort, and they must fit the needs of local users. Important factors determining the adoption of such programs are acquisition cost and teachers' and administrators' perceptions of the potential classroom utility  of the material. All these aspects, and others, will be considered in the process of field testing and revision of curriculum units for CCEM. (SA)",

The project report comprises one-quarter of the document. Appendixes range from job descriptions of the project committees to prototypical instruction guides, an orientation to their use, and an evaluation instrument for their users.

The program, which involved both teachers and students in a wide variety of career development activities, resulted in the organization of inservice programs for administrators, teachers, and counselors, and the development of career activity guides, an administrator's guide, 75 fifteen-minute television tapes, selected career guidance material, special intensive training programs for school dropouts, and a model career guidance program. An interim evaluation of the program's third year concluded that of all participating groups only guidance personnel  participated less than enthusiastically. The final evaluation of the program suggested that even though the exemplary program did not turn into a statewide project as originally planned, the program did accomplish its overall goal of exposing students to the world of work. The report concluded that the career development process needs more emphasis throughout the curriculum and offers two pages of recommendations to that effect. Ten appendixes covering 40 pages provide such information as a bibliography, sample activities, and a summary of the results of the Career Development Summer Institute. (JR)",

Pre-workshop activities included gathering appropriate resource materials, visiting existing pre-vocational and career education programs, preparing reference materials and meeting with consultants and selected school representatives. The two-week workshop brought together individuals of varying backgrounds who represented the complete spectrum of course offerings at the model school, Central Middle School (CMS), and made liberal use of  consultants, small and large group work, audio-visual materials, and field trips. Participants' evaluations were generally favorable. The workshop produced statements of philosophy and goals for the CMS pre-vocational education program, instructional units for each participating teacher, a public relations plan for advertising the program to both teachers and the general community, and proposed courses in pre-vocational education to be offered at Middle Tennessee State University. Nine recommendations summarize the workshop's findings. Fifteen pages of appendixes include lists of workshop participants, consultants, and visitors, as well as pre-vocational units for English and office occupations. (JR)",

In a three-page introduction to the problem, the author defines an affirmative action program as &quot;a set of specific result-oriented action-commitments and procedures designed to systematically achieve an equitable redistribution of both sexes (and other protected classes) within a workforce.&quot; The author further sees the program as one containing goals and timetables so that the workforce distribution takes place as soon as possible within a prescribed time period, with major program emphasis on the recognition and removal of barriers,  identification of persons unfairly excluded or held back, and action enabling them to compete for jobs on an equal basis. Disparate treatment of sexes, wage differentials, and harrassment are singled out as examples of specific charges typically needing to be filed by females in institutions without affirmative action programs or with token programs. The author also stresses open advertising policies that communicate news of specialized employment opportunities to all qualified women. (Author/EA)",

Recommendations include a continuation of the data collection for permanent profiles of the student body, a classification of students by course of study in one of three categories: college preparatory, general education, or vocational education, a followup of  no-shows to document summer dropouts, and teacher/student contract programs.

In May, 1974 about 16.1 million workers, one out of every five employed persons, reported working more than 40 hours in his/her principal job; 6.7 million of this number received premium pay for their work. Although one-half of overtime persons were white-collar workers, only one-fifth of these workers received overtime pay. Blue-collar workers accounted for two-fifths of the persons on extended workweeks; nearly three-fourths of the workers received premium pay. Male workers were almost three times as likely as women workers to work overtime. White men were more likely to  work overtime than blacks; however, black men were more likely to receive premium pay for overtime hours. A greater percentage of union members (one-fifth of all overtime workers) received premium pay than nonunion members. The proportion of employees working overtime with premium pay varied widely among different industries and occupations. Relatively little growth in the number of overtime workers was shown for the six-year period. (EA)",

        "description":"The report on postsecondary education in New York State is a general survey of general education, technical education, and professional education programs in the State's postsecondary educational institutions. The report's introductory sections present current and projected statistics on numbers of colleges and students and discuss the basic educational programs and the standardized examinations used in establishing student proficiencies in certain academic areas. The discussion of general education programs covers the various programs, including a special baccalaureate program for adults, a weekend college program, a university without walls, and the Regent's External Degree Program, at eight New York postsecondary institutions. The survey of technical education reviews the  technical programs in the State's community colleges, and agriculture and technical institutes, and the minimal offerings of the State's non-public junior colleges. The discussion of professional education describes various methods employed for maintaining professional knowledge and skill: the use of media, career ladders programs, preceptorship programs for intra-professional advancement, independent ventures, and organizational efforts toward coherent patterns. The report concludes with discussions of problems and policy considerations affecting adult education in New York State. (JR)",

Results indicated all four groups were relatively favorable toward vocational agriculture and fairly accurate in understanding its objectives. Respondents who were certified in vocational agriculture and members of vocational professional associations tended to have a more favorable attitude toward vocational agriculture. All four groups also tended to have favorable attitudes regarding teachers of agriculture; guidance counselors tended to be the most favorable. High positive relationships were indicated between teacher educators and supervisors on their department/teacher rankings.

Through a unique combination of systems engineering, group problem-solving, and peer instruction, an individualized, open-access curriculum design was developed. This design afforded the basic MP student greater flexibility and choice in the use of a variety of instructional techniques made available (e.g., videotaped demonstration, slide-tape programs, practical exercises, peer instruction, and performance tests). A prototypic unit of the course was fully developed and tested in a trial run to assess its feasibility, training effectiveness, and overall acceptance by the  instructors and students. Only minor operational problems were encountered. Instructor and student attitudes were universally favorable to the new design. An experimental group of 51 students trained in the prototypic unit on the trial run surpassed by a significant margin the performance of a control group that had been taught the same material through conventional methods. On the basis of the trial run results, systems engineering of the entire BLEC was undertaken in accordance with open-access design. (Six appendixes include various task analysis procedures.)

Tasks for both MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) were inventoried and the inventories were reduced by eliminating those tasks which are not required for entry-level duty performance. Performance objectives were written for tasks that could be feasibly and appropriately trained. These performance objectives were translated into performance measures and tests. Both programs were revised to include the performance objectives and measures. Field test, data collection, and refinement of the two training programs extended over 10 successive training cycles. The approximate number of  trainees involved were 1,000 and 2,000 respectively. Programs were refined on the basis of observation of instruction, results of formal performance examinations, and attitude indicators. The final programs resulted in high trainee proficiency levels, and favorable trainee and instructor attitudes.

        "description":"The project was conducted to find out if there was a need for an adult education program to provide instruction in job-related competencies in the basic skills of reading, writing, math, spelling, and communications for the unemployed and underemployed of Mohave County, Arizona. The report presents the procedures used to identify the persons eligible and willing to take an adult basic education course related to job skills. Results of the study show the difficulty of locating and interviewing persons who may be uneducated, underemployed, or unemployed. Of 1,100 persons who may have less than an eighth grade education 164 were identified, 76 of them from welfare, employment, or other agencies. Of this number 32 indicated that they would take the course, which would justify the  hiring of a part-time instructor. Not enough persons were located to substantiate the need for a continuing education program in adult basic education. The need for such education in Mohave County is described and recommendations for future studies are made. (MF)",

The survey instrument contained two parts: the first gathered factual and statistical information about the coordinators; the second estimated the frequency of performance and degree of importance (to which numerical values were assigned) of the 148 tasks in the broad areas of program planning and development, instructional planning, evaluation, public relations, students, and professional growth. The resulting task analysis (organized according to the broad task areas, the tasks being ranked within each area according to the median value of the  degree of importance for each of the six areas of coordination) indicated that, of all task areas, program planning and development received the highest rating of importance. Next in importance was instructional planning; public relations rated moderately important. For the other three areas, the tasks were considered moderately important, but were rarely or never performed. Nearly 100 pages of appendixes include the study instrument, the coordinators' task survey instrument, and tabulations of the degree of importance and degree of performance of the tasks. (JR)",

        "description":"The basic objective of the study was to investigate the participation of mature adult women, over age 35, in the proprietary business, trade, and technical schools in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Data were collected by telephone on the 29 registered resident-study schools of Cuyahoga County and two Cleveland-based home study schools pertaining to enrollment figures that reflect adult women's participation, the programs of study, and cost of attendance. Two institutions with more than 10 mature women enrolled were visited to obtain additional information regarding courses, facilities, and women's participation. The findings indicated that mature women over 35 years of age comprise about 2.5 percent of the total estimated enrollment of the 30 schools surveyed. Only one woman over age 35  was training for a nontraditional female job; two-thirds of the mature women enrollees were receiving training for clerical and sales occupations. The survey revealed that there are many openings available to mature women with the right skills and that proprietary schools are interested in providing such training; however, women re-entering the labor market often are unable to pay the training fees.

Each learning center used a single career theme (restaurant, library, hospital) as the foundation of the career program. The results of pre- and post-Knowledge of Careers tests administered to randomly selected students indicated that post-test mean scores were higher on all program levels, especially at lower levels, than the pre-test means. An evaluation of the program operation based on a Likert-type questionnaire administered to the teaching staff indicated their  favorable perceptions of each aspect of the program which was assessed (for example, program improvement, program effectiveness, student attitudes, program objectives, program implementation, and program administration). The report concludes with eight recommendations for improving the program. Two appendixes include the Knowledge of Careers Tests by levels and the teacher questionnaire. (JR)",

Of 735 liberal arts graduates in 1972, there were 375 respondents. The liberal arts graduates reflected a satisfactory employment rate when comparing their unemployment rates to national rates; their overall unemployment rate was 7.5 percent, ranging from a rate of 12.5 percent for unmarried males to 2.0 percent for married males. Graduates were engaged in a variety of careers (250 job titles) and showed a high level of employment, with over half earning over $10,000 a year and three-fourths listing their job as having career potential. Their  major difficulty seemed to be the long process of finding satisfactory employment. Since few of the liberal arts graduates had a job-related major, the results question the assumption that a job-related major is necessary for a satisfactory job. An alphabetized list of the careers of the responding liberal arts graduates itemizes the graduate's college major, career potential assessment, and his/her 1974 yearly salary. A raw data summary of the followup study is also included. (EA)",

Data were obtained two and one-half years after graduation, allowing sufficient time for employment stability. Findings on the 375 respondents of the 735 liberal arts graduates indicated: 85.9 percent in the labor force; overall unemployment of 7.5 percent; about 40 percent pursuing an advanced degree; employment in the whole range of organizations, occupations, and industries; 76.5 percent realizing satisfaction with their present job and 71.2  percent realizing career potential; and over 50 percent of full-time employees with salaries over $10,000.

Subjects were adult members of disadvantaged families and included all Mountain-Plains students entering office education career preparation between November, 1974 and February, 1975. Students, unaware of the experiment, were randomly placed in an experimental (calendar) or a control (no calendar) group for a six-week period. Attendance and progress hours were recorded, with the rate of progress computed weekly for each student. For the experimental group, the instructor constructed, with the student, a curriculum calendar based on established average time to complete a given package.  Design for the experiment was a post-test only control group design. The major conclusion of the study was that the curriculum calendar utilized with adults within a self-paced, individualized office education curriculum provides an effective method of significantly increasing the students' rate of progress. The majority of staff and students commented positively on the calendar; instructional time required for its use was not excessive. Likewise, the curriculum calendar was viewed as a valuable tool in minimizing student length of stay in the program, thus, improving cost benefit factors. (EA)",

The questionnaire, which is included in the report, consists of four scales: learning receptivity, discipline, indulgence dependency, and nurturance responsibility. The learning receptivity scale is designed to measure the extent to which a parent is receptive to learning about children, while the discipline scale measures the extent to  which the parent believes in harsh authoritarian forms of discipline. Indulgence dependency is concerned with the extent to which the parent believes in indulging children; nurturance responsibility is related to the extent to which parents feel responsible for believing in tasks and behaviors which are nurturant and promote maximum development of the child.

Meanwhile, law enforcement must continue its main task of investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses in which the prosecutor plays a key role. In many communities the prosecutor's job remains a political office or a part-time occupation, and the costs of these shortcomings are high. Some recommendations for upgrading prosecutorial performance include additional continuing education programs and frequent and periodic reviews of our criminal codes to keep them in step with the times. New legislative tools for prosecutors also need to be sought, and the problem of financial resources to support prosecutive  operations is a major one. Changes in the public's perception of the true nature of these problems and adjustments in the criminal justice process will enhance productivity. However, in the final analysis, the real opportunity to improve the criminal justice process exists in how prosecutors perform their duties at the local level. Prosecutors must never hesitate to follow the evidence where it leads, and there must be absolute regard for the guarantees of the Bill of Rights. (EA)",

Three sets of design criteria were used in developing SHAPES: criteria related to information discrimination and gathering; those related to validity, bias, and reliability; and those related to flexibility of information storage and retrieval. In the system, community development is defined as taking place when the priorities of different fields (individual or group actors in the community) are in relative agreement and result in effective shared  activity. The SHAPE System in operation addresses itself to four questions: Who was involved? What happened? In what contextual model should the project outcome be viewed? What were the project outcomes? These four questions together with the instruments designed to provide data for their analysis constitute the essence of SHAPES. A field test of SHAPES produced positive reactions from an outside evaluator, field agents, and community informants, thereby encouraging its further refinement and application. (JR)",

        "description":"The report describes the development and evaluation of an in-unit, leadership/management training program (based on experimental training methodology for providing Army leaders with behavioral skills and techniques) implemented within three battalion-sized combat units at Fort Bliss, Texas, in 1974. The program was organized around workshops designed to train leaders in individual and group problem-solving, management by objectives, and performance management. To evaluate the effect of the training, two survey instruments (an organizational climate survey and a skill use inventory) were developed. Seventy-six of the 92 key leaders trained were interviewed 2 to 12 months after the 60 hours of training was completed. In general, all of the participants accepted the training content  as leadership/management skills useful to the Army leader in obtaining organizational goals. Over two-thirds estimated that they had increased their on-the-job use of the workshop skills and were able to identify positive consequences. Results of the project showed no conclusive evidence with respect to hard data (unit performance), but the soft data (estimates of the effects of skill use on-the-job) suggest that with the removal of several operational obstacles the training program could prove effective on unit performance and organizational climate.

The report comprises a description of the organization of the conference and the development of the report, the chairperson's introduction; and the recommendations and conclusions of the steering committee. Discussion groups considered six questions: (1) Why educate teams? (2) Who should be so educated? (3) How should students be educated (classroom emphasis)? (4) How should students and professionals be educated (clinical emphasis)?  (5) What are the requirements for educating health care delivery teams? (6) What are the obstacles? Two papers presented at the conference on these themes are among the appendixes, as is a report of the proceedings. The steering committee's recommendations are aimed at three levels: administrative, teaching, and national, stressing the importance of recognition of an obligation to engage in interdisciplinary education, the value of clinical settings for developing interdisciplinary education, and the need for governmental and professional support of interdisciplinary education for health care delivery teams.

        "description":"The Panel on Manpower Training Evaluation has recommended that Social Security earnings data be more widely used in evaluating manpower programs, especially those that tend to serve prime-age males, such as the MDTA (Manpower Development Training Act) or NAB-JOBS (National Association of Businessmen-Job Opportunities in the Business Sector) programs. In spite of some limitations, earnings data provide very accurate and inexpensive longitudinal information that can be efficiently analyzed and provide as adequate a source of comparison groups as tailor-made sample survey studies, with the additional potentiality for matching pairs of observations on selected characteristics such as prior earnings patterns. The panel recognizes the issue of confidentiality and expects adherence to  standards set for public use of government data. The panel has stressed that evaluation is limited by the quality of information available on the population of manpower program participants. A suggested approach was to develop accurate samples rather than attempt to gather information on all trainees; however, this precludes development of accurate trainee lists for each project. A concluding recommendation was the undertaking of a study comparing the outcomes of a true experimental design to evaluate a manpower program with outcomes as measured by Social Security data.

A seventh paper provides a summary of the major themes at the conclusion of the program. All of the symposium papers deal with the principal manpower issues of supply, distribution of physicians by geography and specialty, and the role of non-physicians in the delivery of health care. Although the speakers differ on the relative importance of these problems and remedies for them, there is general agreement on certain basic propositions: (1) there is a maldistribution of physicians by geographic location and specialty; (2) there is a need for more physicians to enter the primary care specialites; (3) greater  use of physician-extenders could improve physician productivity in the delivery of health care; (4) there is little real prospect for solving distribution problems through voluntary actions taken by physicians, medical schools, or teaching hospitals; (5) simply increasing the supply of physicians will not solve distribution problems.

Based on a sample of 28,079 (11,502 Army), data were obtained from questionnaire responses at Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Stations. The questionnaire included items on endorsement of reasons for enlistment, selection of service, influences in selection of service, and various demographic characteristics. Frequency distributions and factor analysis were used and cross-tabulations were prepared. According to the surveys, the Army's main attraction has been its  ability to provide some kind of skill or advanced training to enlistees. Other findings included: (a) the proportion of Army enlistees who initially preferred another service increased 8 percent; (b) the Army gained in educational quality and lost in mental quality of its applicants; (c) age, geographic region, and educational level were the most important characteristics associated with making the Army an enlistee's first choice of service.

The three-phase mission suitability test involved examining the 2B24's advanced features in a training context, developing a new instrument training program for use with the device, and administering that training to 16 volunteer officers who had completed Army primary rotary wing training (100 hours) but had no helicopter or instrument flight experience. Results confirmed the  device's mission suitability regarding both cost (per-student saving of over $4,000) and transfer of training (instrument training concluded in an average of 6.5 flight hours, as opposed to 60 flight hours for students in the existing program). Findings also indicated that the standardization, evaluation, and quality control goals had been partially met, and that the device's design is such that their fuller achievement is likely in the future.

        "description":"Sixteen educational aims were rank ordered by 188 adult rural disadvantaged family members who were student participants in the Mountain-Plains Program. Results were examined by factor analysis and by the Thurstone (unweighted) scaling method; the factor structure was weak, indicating considerable independence for the individual items. Students ranked a feeling for other people, a continuing desire for knowledge, and emotional stability as their most important aims and a sense of civic responsibility and loyalty to America as their least important aims. The high ranking of personal/interpersonal aims seemed to be contrary to current thinking which assumes practical vocational needs to be those dominant among disadvantaged populations. The study was seen as strong validation for  the Mountain-Plains approach to meeting the needs of disadvantaged populations. (Author/EA)",

        "description":"Tracing problems observed among the Mountain-Plains student population, a trend of apparently improper or arrested personality development emerges. Observations indicate that a majority of the student population does not possess normally developed trust, autonomy, initiative, industry, sense of identity, or ability to develop intimate relationships, nor have most (in any way other than in production of children) engaged in generativity. In order to test these observations, the entering student population from summer 1973 to spring 1974, all of whom were young adult family members of average intelligence and defined as rural disadvantaged, were administered two instruments designed to measure personality traits and the basic constructs of self-actualization. The students' test  results were compared with adult norms selected from the respective test manuals. The test results indicated that Mountain-Plains students scored below normal in objective measures of trust, autonomy, initiative, industry, identity, and intimacy. While the results do not irrefutably support the arrested personality development interpretation of personal/personality problems with the population under study, the indicators are extremely strong in favor of that interpretation. Supplementary tables provide Ericksonian Ego Qualities and Age Periods, selected test scales, and personality development of Mountain-Plains students versus norm groups. (JR)",

Incentives were in the form of additional points and an opportunity to &quot;fly&quot; a formation trainer. The practice variable was manipulated by changing the instructional materials. The pretest-treatment-post-test experimental design provided data for analysis. Data revealed that neither variable (practice or incentive) significantly affected the accuracy of post-test responses, but they did affect in a positive way the  post-test rate of responding.

Survey questionnaires (approximately two-thirds return rate) were sent to one professor at each institutional graduate program included on the 1972-73 membership listing in the Commission of the Professors of Adult Education. The questionnaire consisted of three parts: program characteristics, four items on each of 22 issues related to program initiation/revision, and comments on starting a new program. An age-of-program categorization was used throughout the data analysis to identify developmental trends. Twenty to 70  percent of the programs reported problems related to 10 widespread issues: the number of professors in the program, their mix of competencies, their departmental location, the specialized adult education courses, the process for approval and modification of courses, ways to relate out-of-department courses to adult education, combined department arrangements, the attraction of able graduate students, the function of faculty research, and the chairman's role in obtaining support for the adult education graduate program. Each of these issues is described in one of the monograph's 10 sub-sections. (EA)",

Five basic organizational characteristics were used to roughly quantify attributes of the organization of the six schools studied. The characteristics were: centralization of decision-making, standardization of practices and procedures, personnel supervision, complexity of organizational structure, and staff heterogeneity. The school community was considered on three levels: attendance area, district, and State. Eight situational descriptors were chosen to characterize each school's setting: district pupil expenditure, community per capita income, community population, geographic location, eligibility  for ESEA Title 1 funds, work structure of students' families, and the location of the student population. Other, less tangible, aspects were also considered. Data collection instruments were surveys, profiles, indexes, charts, and collections of selected facts. (One hundred-fifty pages describe in detail what took place in adopting OG at each of the sites and relate the procedures to the characteristics of the sites. Forty-six hypothesized generalizations are presented concerning how and what influences facilitate the adoption of system-type innovations.

In order to expand the reach and breadth of such non-formal education programs a pilot project involving unpaid, relatively untrained village volunteers equipped with audio cassette tape machines was devised. Three villages in the Quesada Valley in Guatemala were used as the study site during July 1974. Four cassette tapes were prepared, each 22-29 minutes in length and containing information, stories, and music in a magazine-type format. Evaluations were conducted among the volunteers and the general  village populations. The study's results indicated that: in no case were the machines lost, stolen, or damaged; people in the villages listened to and learned from the tapes and acted upon what they had learned; the monetary cost of the system was minimal; the program worked as a latent training system for volunteers who became sought-after sources of information; and there were no logistical problems with batteries, tapes, or machines. The study concludes that the system can stretch rural manpower resources in rural development. (JR)",

        "description":"The paper describes an auto-tutorial methodology for training veterinary medical practitioners to perform differential diagnoses. It describes in detail the three phases of differential diagnosis: sensory pick-up, a combination of cognition and memory; categorization, the process by which diagnosticians group symptoms and signs prior to diagnosis; and inferential strategy, a combination of what diagnosticians refer to as intuition and confirmation techniques. The paper criticizes traditional methods of classroom instruction in differential diagnosis which present practitioners with informational cues in single disease categories in symptom-grouped fashion rather than in multiple disease categories characteristic of real-life situations. Students instructed in traditional methods  when confronted with a real diagnostic problem must first complete a transfer from the learned system of inforrmation (single disease categories) to the alternative system (multiple disease categories) before diagnosis can take place. The paper briefly reviews a pilot study, utilizing both graduate and undergraduate veterinary medical students, which yielded data tending to verify the transfer hypothesis. Through an understanding of the differential diagnostic process, however, simulation exercises can be constructed to teach the organization of information into multiple disease categories and the inferential skill required to utilize the multiple disease categories to reach tentative diagnoses.

Moreover, college/university orientation programs for new entering adult part-time evening students are virtually nonexistent. Recognizing the need for supportive services, Drake University initiated an orientation and counseling program for new entering adult evening students during fall and spring semesters of 1972-73. Individuals were randomly assigned to a treatment group (28 students) and a control group (27 students) and pretested and post-tested. The orientation program, consisting of seven weekly 1 1/2 hour meetings, was geared to increased self-understanding, major developmental  tasks of college students, the development of self-appraisal and self-direction, and better emotional development. A unique feature of the program was the development of a simulation game, BALANCE, to help students in their adjustment to the college experience. Statistical analysis revealed that students participating in the orientation and counseling program had a significantly higher grade point average at the end of the semester. (EA)",

Regarding adoption of group methodology, the treatment group significantly attained the training objectives.

In the study's first phase, 59 subjects from three different training programs dealing with the elderly completed the OP scale. The results of this phase indicated that attitude toward old people became more negative as age of respondent increased. From these results it was hypothesized that race and social class might also affect attitudes toward old people. In phase two a group of high school students, all at nearly the same age and educational level, completed the OP scale. Grouping the respondents according to race and class produced no consistent pattern of differences in mean scores. Grouping the two samples indicated that no consistent pattern or  increase in positive attitudes can be demonstrated by subjects' age. However, respondents having one or more years of higher education had a more positive attitude than the non-college group. Thus, among the groups tested, years of education appears to be an important factor contributing to variation in attitudes toward the aged. Sampling procedures were not random, so the results are not generalizable to a larger population. (JR)",

        "description":"Content analysis is a systematic and objective technique which reduces into smaller sub-parts existing communications. It is the analytical reduction of a text to a standard set of statistically manipulatable symbols representing the presence, intensity, or frequency of characteristics. A case study of the use of content analysis is the U.S. Forest Service's formulation in the early 1970s of a development policy for the Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois. The alternatives were: no projects, new limited access highway, combination scenic drive and trail, national scenic trail, and improve existing roads. Three hundred documents expressing public opinion were analyzed according to various categories, given a numerical score, and cross tabulated. On the basis of the  assumption that people's attitudes regarding the alternative were related to underlying concerns and factors, which when subjected to multiple correlation analysis could be used to predict attitudes, the content analysis verified the decision to opt for the scenic route over the existing road system. As a method of describing, understanding and explaining, predicting, and deciding, especially in cases where available data is not in the form required, content analysis is a reliable and valid research method and central to the development of adult education.

Cost-benefit analysis has not (1) provided managers with relevant information upon which to base their decisions, (2) provided a systematic means for making tradeoffs, nor (3) helped managers develop consistent incentives and standards to measure internal project efficiency. Three major factors must be agreed upon before developing an evaluation system: quantifiable program objectives, benefit-cost framework, and a control group to be used as a standard for estimating gains in client income attributable to the program. Som problems to be  considered in structuring mathematical models are estimating client income gain and using a national labor market survey as a statistical control. The mathematical relationship between sample survey mean, sample survey size, and the prediction of foregone income for single clients and aggregations of clients influences the prediction variance. The new design for a national longitudinal survey is a continuous work history survey based on calendar months which allows for complete recording of single employment, multiple employment, job search, training, and withdrawals from the labor force.

The first general phase of the study indicated that 42 of the 50 systems surveyed had responsibility for higher adult education. In phase two, the 12 State systems having a high degree of involvement in the coordination-control of higher adult education were grouped into three basic models: the voluntary model, the central unit plus regional organizations model, and the central unit at the State level model. Major findings of phase two indicate that a majority of the 12: play a major part in the administration and governance, conduct statewide planning, pay more  attention to planning outcomes than to actual planning, allocate functions to institutions according to their strengths and capabilities, have authority over program review, pay slight attention to resource allocation and utilization, take part in evaluation, assign jurisdiction over programing based on the nature and mission of the institution, do not provide financial aid to adult part-time students on a par with full-time on campus students, and rarely employ non-traditional formats.

        "description":"The primary purpose of this study was to replicate and extend research in the area of teachers expectancies toward an adult education population in a remedial course, the General Technical Review Course at a military base in the Southeastern United States. The students, 68 blacks, 27 whites, and 12 Spanish speakers were initially administered an achievement and an I.Q. test. Teachers (three white females and one black male) were informed that the tests were designed to identify &quot;academic spurters.&quot; Approximately 20 percent of the students were randomly designated as &quot;spurters&quot; and the teachers given the &quot;results.&quot; At the end of the course, students were again tested and teachers completed an evaluative rating form for each student. For the students, the results indicated that the  self-fulfilling prophecy may have operated for the white experimental group but not for the nonwhite experimental group. For the teachers, analyzing the data by high-low achievement within race indicated that teachers credited white students who achieved (they had more personality, they studied better, and they were more personable), but black and Spanish-speaking students who achieved were not credited (the nonwhite high achievers were not differentiated from the nonwhite low achievers). A possible explanation is that &quot;self-induced&quot; teacher biases, prior expectancies based on race, were operating. (Author/JR)",

It describes self-behavior modification through self-goal setting, self-monitoring, self-reinforcement, and self-controlled environment change. Advantages and disadvantages of self-behavior modification are also proposed. Behavior theory is then related to adult education  design, and an interactive model that can provide structure and/or freedom to individuals according to their needs to use in behavior change programs for adults is introduced. The paper also presents results of a study of the effects on new behavior development of educator- vs. learner-determined reinforcement in a reading and information handling program for technical professionals in industry, which suggest that adult learners will self-reward and that they find self-rewards more satisfactory than externally determined reinforcement.

In general social indicators deal with social factors which affect the quality of life of the population. Social scientists are recognizing the need for both economic and social indicators. Even as the need for social indicators is discussed, the problems which may be associated with their use(questions of measurement, the reduction of social indicators into economic terms, the definition of quality of life) are recognized. Typical social indicators include: health, public safety, education, employment, income, housing, leisure and recreation, and population. In assessing adult education programs with respect to social indicators, the time factor seems to be crucial. In  a model evaluation the procedure moves from focusing on a social concern (one source of program objectives) to identifying appropriate social indicators, to collecting evidence, to comparing the evidence to the social indicators. As the program is judged and referred back to the social concern, the cycle starts again, presumably at a more advanced point in relation to the social concern. All adult educators need to work to establish evaluative procedures which attend to qualitative as well as quantitative aspects of program output. (JR)",

This study attempted to assess the effectiveness of behavioral counseling. Forty elementary students were identified as unpopular and uncooperative. Twenty of them were assigned to a control group while 20 others were assigned to four groups of reinforcement counseling. The latter groups met twice a week for five weeks, and the students were assisted to increase the frequency of their rewarding and cooperative behavior while in the presence of their peers. Following treatment, the sociometric instrument was readministered to all students who were randomly assigned to  four groups of 10 Ss each. Each group participated in a series of work tasks, and observations were made of the counseled and control students' rewarding and cooperative behavior. Analysis of the results revealed no significant differences between the control and counseled groups on gain in sociometric choices or in their behavior while participating in the series of work tasks. Reasons for the failure of the behavioral procedure were attributed to problems in reinforcing students who would not behave in rewarding or cooperative ways toward their peers. (Author/SE)",

The questions and answers are primarily concerned with statistical aspects of achievement tests and the best way to interpret test results to clients, parents and teachers. The need for caution in the choice of particular tests is stressed; thus, tests should be neither too easy nor too difficult for students, and tests should be chosen by a committee who specifies the particular goals for which a test should be administered. The author notes the importance of informing faculty members about the meaning of test scores and how such scores might help them in their classrooms. Moreover, in interpreting a test score one should be aware  that a score reflects a current situation resulting from the interaction of various complex variables, so that judgements about a student's academic future should not be based on test scores alone.

Moreover, racist attitudes have permeated all levels of the educational system, preventing the development of programs that would help black students to attain higher education and thereby help their people. The federal Education Professions Development Act (EPDA) was a progressive step in re-evaluating educational goals. The EPDA California center, one of seven centers created under the program, has tried to establish an advanced degree program which has a multi-cultural curriculum designed to train a new kind of pupil personnel worker. A major stress has been on on-site instruction and an  effort to enlist effective community participation in higher education. The author suggests the need to introduce courses which reflect the cultural characteristics of all ethnic groups and explain the differences among various cultures in various parts of the country. Moreover, minority communities should be actively involved in the educational process, and financial aid to minority students should be increased. Finally, the suggested program would require a longer preparation period than do traditional programs. (SE)",

Thirty-three lower socioeconomic status (SES) black Ss and 34 Jewish upper-middle SES Ss were identified as either external or internal LOC. Half of each LOC group received an introductory passage with concrete examples and inclusive terms (the AO group) while the introductory passage of the other half  (control group) did not have any AO. Both groups received the same unfamiliar study passage followed by a 10-item test on the study passage. An analysis of variance on the scores of the latter test indicated that while the main effect of AO was not significant, AO had a significant effect only on the retention ability of lower SES students with an external LOC. There is a need for further studies using a larger number of Ss representing various grade levels. (Author/SE)",

He advocates the formation of four graded groups of patients based on the seriousness of their problems. The first is an intake group formed of newly admitted patients. Interaction in a group situation provides the psychiatrist a good opportunity to study the nature of the problems of each patient so as to place him in one of the other three groups. The second is a group for regressive patients, the most difficult cases with which to deal. The psychiatrist, with patience, understanding and support of a patient can gain his confidence and establish communication between the latter and the other members of the group, and then move him into the third  group of less serious cases. With the latter group the emphasis is on correcting distorted perception and, through creating a healthy group atmosphere, initiate emotional and behavioral change. The fourth group is formed of predischarged patients who are allowed to join outpatients and family members. In this group, attempts are made to enhance self-esteem and recondition members to their immediate environments. (SE)",

The matching process involves these steps: (1) job analysis by an industrial engineer; (2) worker examination by medical staff including medical and social tests and histories; and (3) comparison between medical and job profiles and recommendation to employer. The profile is determined by Dr. Koyl's GULHEMP method (general physique, upper and lower extremities, hearing, eyesight, mentality and personality). Both physical and job analyses are scaled to these fitness categories. Advantages to this matching system of job placement include: (1)  identification of medical problems and resulting referral and treatment; (2) sensitization of state employment agencies to the needs of middle aged workers; (3) assistance to employers in the placement of physically qualified workers to the satisfaction of both employer and employee; (4) lower incidence of illness and turnover &quot;profiled&quot; workers; and (5) a method to eliminate age, sex and race discrimination in employment.

Major issues for fact finding included: (1) the incidence of drug abuse among high school students; (2) student attitudes on drug use and abuse; (3) the nature of existing drug education programs; (4) the effectiveness of those programs; and (5) students' perceptions of their drug education needs. The groups' research findings indicate widespread usage and availability of illicit drugs, failure of existing drug education programs to affect student  drug usage, and the need for involvement of the community-at-large. The students repeatedly criticized the prevalence of a subject-matter orientation to school drug programs, instead suggesting the need for a personal-problems or social-problems orientation.

The role of a college counseling center director was seen to be that of a coordinator in the sense that he sees to the smooth and effective functioning of the center's operation. The role of the counseling psychologist must evolve within a particular framework that has three characteristics: (1) it must be consistent with the aims of the institutions, (2) it must not duplicate the functions of other personnel, and (3) it must have its  wellsprings in the nature of the student body. The role of the clinical psychologist is that of helping students work through certain existential problems while the psychiatrist diagnoses and treats referred cases, especially problem psychoses. The function of the sociologist is to define the cultural profile of the student population. All of these roles and their interrelationships with each other are delineated. (RWP)",

The hypothesis was that mediating TGT's effects on academic performance is a change in the relationship between academic performance and sociometric status of students. Subjects were 232 seventh grade students incorporated into a 2x2 design varying both competition (team vs. individual) and practice (individual vs. group) modes. Team competition changed the peer group norms as predicted, creating a positive relationship between academic performance and sociometric status, whereas no such relationship existed for students in the individual competition. Implications for the sociology of education are discussed. It was concluded that this study goes  beyond a description of effects of successful academic performance on peer group status and offers a means of changing peer group consequences of academic success.

Among the studies reviewed are ones which (1) specify at various age levels the internal consistency of the subscales; (2) report the association between the subscales and various measures of academic achievement; and (3) describe the relationship of the subscales to other measures of personality, such as &quot;faking good,&quot; anxiety and self esteem.

The concept of self-management as applied to the counselor education process and more specifically to the modification of counselor behaviors is discussed. The benefits of training counselors through self-management procedures are described. A specific plan that has been used with pre-practicum and practicum students is outlined. Each student is required to select some aspect of his or her counseling behavior and modify it according to the self-management plan. This plan suggests how a student can (1) identify a problem, (2) analyze the problem, (3) set a goal, (4)  determine and implement a strategy, and (5) evaluate the project results. Three projects that students have completed are described. One project dealt with reducing the number of times the counselor used a meaningless filler in her speech. A second project concerned a student who wanted to ask fewer close ended questions and more open ended questions. The third project dealt with increasing the frequency of empathic responses. General student reactions to the self-management projects are also summarized. (Author)",

The former is most prevalent among those who are not thoroughly trained in testing and test interpretation, and should be responded to by maintaining strict certification standards. The second reason for abuses in testing, a misdirected educational training system, could be partially resolved by strengthening the competencies of educators in such areas as how to achieve a sense of self competence and identity, how to get along with others, how to work within and with a group without losing a sense of self, how to rear children, how to use leisure time, and how to decide on a vocation. Teachers should be trained for involvement in an educational  enterprise that deals with values and people, not just academic matters. (Author)",

The present study extends the test of TGT by employing the technique in third grade classes, teaching basic language arts skills for a six-week period. Sixty students were randomly assigned to either a TGT or control condition. Students in the TGT condition were divided into leagues, and tournaments were organized around 22 simple instructional games, several of which were formed around each general curriculum objective. Post-treatment results indicate significant positive TGT effects on both the Hoyum-Sanders Elementary English Test and a treatment-specific test of  language arts skills. TGT also appeared to increase cohesion among the students and decrease the number of social isolates in the classroom. No treatment effects were noted on several scales measuring student perceptions of the classroom. The results provide additional evidence of the usefulness of incorporating TGT into the classroom structure, even with young children. (Author)",

The reasons given for failing to investigate effectiveness were: (1) methodological and criteria problems seemed unsolvable; (2) anxiety existed about discovering a lack of professional competence; (3) the intricacy of the therapy hour cannot be translated into specific criteria; (4) problems related to what type of individual does the ratings of counseling effectiveness; and (5) psychologists were unwilling to suffer the inconvenience of having to research their competence. Many felt it was an intrusion on their time, which could be better spent with clients. The over-used criteria which have uniformly failed to predict counselor effectiveness were  discussed. The author suggested therapist-specific variables in interaction when client characteristics would be a profitable area for investigation. Some small amount of work has been done here. An increased use of long-range behavioral observation of the therapy interaction was suggested. (Author)",

Teachers' professional competence perceptions were defined as the amount of information known and the degree of professional competence accorded to faculty colleagues, as measured by changes in teachers' scores on the Professional Competence Peer Opinionnaire (PCPO). Significant gains were observed in the amount of information known about the professional competence of the faculty colleagues and  in the degree of professional competence accorded to faculty colleagues at the conclusion of the study. The study concluded that teachers are interested in enlarging their effective teaching behavior repertoires. Further, when teachers have opportunitites to observe and adopt productive techniques utilized by their colleagues, the professional competence they ascribe to their colleagues and the amount of information they have concerning the professional competence of their colleagues will be increased. Focused videotape feedback teacher inservice training is believed to provide such opportunities. (Author)",

(1) Methodology and Techniques--While it is not necessary to abandon the basic techniques which are effective with any other group of individuals, there is likely to be a different emphasis upon the basic techniques and methodology because of the type of person whose behavior and attitudes it is desirable to change. Group counseling and guidance, individual counseling, play therapy, psychodrama, may each be useful in assisting and guiding disabled individuals. (2) Specific Services and Resources--Guidance services to the developmentally disabled should provide for the full range of individual needs including personal, social, educational, and  vocational aspects. These services may be provided by the total educational staff including teachers, administration, supportive services, students, parents, and community and statewide resources. Guidance services should be extended also to parents of the developmentally disabled. It is imperative that the school counselor establish a positive working relationship with educational staff, parents, and community resources, as well as know all about the various resources which are available in his community and on a statewide basis.

In addition, the number of cadets dropping out of the Academy program is at an all time high. This study considers the entire candidate counseling program as it now stands and compares it with proven techniques of professional counseling and recruiting. It is concluded that the present candidate counseling program needs major revision. Several specific recommendations are made which could aid the counseling program in meeting its objectives in the future. (Author)",

Although the full program was developed for youngsters in grade three through six, this project exposed fifth and sixth graders at the Northside School, Levittown, New York to the Career Awareness Program for a period of weeks. This Program was infused into the present curriculum. An investigation was then conducted to determine the extent to which these classrooms had made gains in the skills of creative problem-solving, compared to those in the control group. The data shows that the gain scores for the experimental students were significantly better than those for the control students in three of the four scales of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking  (Fluency, Flexibility, and Elaboration). In the elaboration scale (which is identified in this study as the scale most closely related to creative problem-solving), gain scores for females were significantly higher than those for males. The complete curriculum guide for grades three through six is appended. Objectives and lesson plans are color coded for each grade level. (Author/CJ)",

The rules are: (1) liquids and the labial glide become corresponding voiced stops; (2) the nasal prefix assimilates in coronality and backness, and becomes syllabic in monosyllables; (3) nonsyllabic nasals are deleted before nasals and voiceless consonants; and (4) a glide (/y/) is inserted before the nasal prefix and a vowel. Arguments are presented bearing on the appropriate use of historical evidence for synchronic analyses and on the constraints on abstraction in the grammar. (AM)",

        "description":"In an experiment conducted with 31 three-, four- and five-year-old Japanese children evidence was found for self-created definitions of the direct and indirect objects of verbs. Linguistic rules undergoing change during the course of the experiment were also observed. The results can be understood as showing that children are guided in their behavior by certain universals of language. Long before children master grammar they show the effects of systematic rules for the construction and comprehension of sentences. Sometimes these rules can be regarded as imperfect copies of adult rules. But often, when the two kinds of rules differ radically, the child's rules are better explained as being grammatical inventions, creations by the child which rest as much on his a priori  expectations of the general form of language as on his experience with adult grammar. This experiment is one in which the effects of several such grammatical inventions are seen. The experiment focuses on a small point of grammar, the direct and indirect objects of verbs, but a number of rules are found that are unlike Japanese, the language to which the Ss are exposed, and like certain universals of language, in particular the universal distinction between marked and unmarked categories.

        "description":"Elliptical sentence structures, i.e., restrictive sentences, play a decisive role in both the conventional and programmed approaches to foreign language instruction. Basic to both these approaches are four distinct phases: presentation, drill, contextualization, and testing. However, it has been proven that the learning process can be maximized if, when using the programmed approach, restrictive sentences are introduced during the drill phase, while such maximization can be achieved in the conventional approach by introducing restrictive sentences during the contextualization phase. Success in these critical phases is further assured when, in using either the conventional or programmed approach, audiovisual materials are employed. In that restrictive sentences are so  characteristic of everyday conversation, the medium of dialogue becomes central to the contextualization phase. To be most effective, furthermore, the dialogues should: (1) deal with typical, everyday situations, (2) lead into communication between the conversation partners, (3) average approximately six statements in length, and (4) be flexible enough to allow the partners to change topics of discussion freely. Future progress in the use of restrictive sentences in the methodology of foreign language instruction is dependent on continued research. (Author/DS)",

Broadly speaking, the less sonorous, the more contiguous, and the closer the vowel is in terms of articulatory features, the more likely it is to assimilate to the determining vowel. Investigation of the relative markedness of harmonic grades shows that the feature values: tense, low, front, and unrounded, are unmarked vis-a-vis their respective marked counterparts: lax, high, back, and rounded, leading to the conclusion that marked feature values tend to assimilate to the corresponding unmarked values. Among  the three primary dimensions, labiality is most marked, then palatality, followed by the least marked, horizontality. Neutral vowels are also briefly discussed. (Author)",

Research in the teaching of English must be preceded by research in English, language variation, and native language acquisition and by further work in descriptive linguistics. A significant problem in current language research is that the different disciplines engaging in it begin with different assumptions concerning the nature of language variation. Anthropologists and linguists consider variation normal manifestation of difference, while psychologists and educators view variation as a deviation from a norm. More emphasis should be placed on training teachers to hear, distinguish, and analyze the language of their students. Teachers must learn about the  systematic nature of language, how languages differ from each other, how they change, the difference between oral and written symbolization, and the structure of communication. Techniques used today for evaluating a child's language ability frequently discriminate against nonstandard English-speaking children. It must be remembered that every child comes to the first grade with a relatively well developed and systematic language which cannot be characterized as random or illogical. More research into the problem of stigmatized speech is also needed. (PMP)",

        "description":"It is the contention here that the &quot;prelinguistic&quot; period is an important phase of the language acquisition process. Accordingly the research reported represents an attempt to begin mapping out the types of linguistically relevant information to which a young child attends. Specifically it is hypothesized that young children are especially tuned to the linguistic information carried in the supra-segmental system of language (intonation, stress, and juncture) and that detection of such information eventually leads the child to other aspects of language patterning. The participants in the study consisted of 20 4-month-old and 20 8-month-old infants. The subjects were divided into four groups of 10 infants each, and an habituation-dishabituation paradigm was used to study their  discrimination of terminal contour. The results suggest that normal falling and rising intonation contours, including the stress marker, can be discriminated by at least 8 months. The data indicate that neither group of 4-month-old infants was able to distinguish between the presented forms. Exactly when the ability to discriminate between these features appears is not clear, except that it develops somewhere between 4 and 8 months old. Several questions remain to be answered, and further research with more sensitive habituation and conditioning procedures is in process. (Author/LG)",

        "description":"Data on the complexity of relative clause formation in children indicate that right embedding precedes central embedding in development. Previous research on the subject argues that configurations where coreferential NP's function as subjects are less complex than configurations where coreferential NP's function as objects. It appears that the most elementary relative is one where the nominal subject of the embedded relative is equivalent to either the nominal object or the nominal subject of the main clause. A proposed development sequence, where O is object and S is subject, is OS, SS, OO, SO. A study to determine the prerequisites to relative clause formation in children aged 29 to 36 months, and to test previous research, was undertaken. Forty test sentences, 10 of each of  the above types, were given to 10 children and imitation was elicited. Results generally supported prior research, and it might be proposed that the ontogeny of relative clause formation in part consists of a prerequisite ability to process conjoined simplex propositions with coreferential NP's functioning as subjects of the embedded relatives.

It also tries to trace the errors back to the influence of the pupils' first language, to mechanisms regulating the acquisition of skills in general, and to unsatisfactory teaching strategies and teaching material. The investigation is part of a large-scale project trying to establish frequencies and types of errors in oral as well as written production by the age group in question.

The test was a revision of part of an earlier test for oral proficiency in Spanish and English. The reliability of the new test was .95 for the Spanish version and .96 for the English version; but many items failed to elicit the expected grammatical constructions. English scores increased significantly with grade level, while Spanish scores varied only slightly among grade levels. Balance between mean scores on the English and Spanish versions was reached at grade 3. Test subjects were also questioned about language use and preference. The relationships between  reported language use and test results appeared to indicate that Spanish proficiency was determined by use of the language in the home. English proficiency showed some relationship to use with the peer group. There were no significant correlations between the English and Spanish version scores and only very slight relationships among the factors influencing them. Achievement in English thus appeared to be unrelated to the maintenance of Spanish for bilingual children. (Author)",

The cultural orientation objectives included an awareness on the part of the Americans of: their own culture; the hardship involved in island living; and the differences in attitudes toward such things as time and nature. A final  summary includes the notion that successful adaptation to a foreign culture depends on the individual's personality and temperament, particularly his or her curiosity, flexibility, and patience.

The most popular variety of syllabic writing for Eskimo does not have a distinct symbol for each sound and does not seem to work well in teaching the language. Another system--an extended variety--uses  combinations of symbols to represent simple sounds. The combinations, however, are sometimes ambiguous. An artificial teaching alphabet for Eskimo is now in use at the University of Ottawa. It is syllabic, similar to the extended type of writing, and eliminates the problems of the other syllabic systems. The symbols of the teaching alphabet are given here. (PMP)",

The term \"community,\" as used here, refers to the educational component of a district, local political organizations, religious groups, cultural organizations, professional organizations, civic organizations, community and public service agencies, parents, and students. The first step to involving the community in foreign language teaching and learning is a survey to determine exactly what assets are available. Questionnaires can elicit information about areas of interest from students, school staff, and other community members. (Sample questionnaires are appended to the paper.) Once the surveys have been completed, the foreign language department can  organize the following types of activities: (1) class trips, (2) foreign language fairs, (3) volunteer work, (4) work-study programs, (5) contests, (6) community welcoming committees, and (7) lecture and consulting programs.

        "description":"A revised Spanish/English oral-proficiency test battery was administered to 40 Spanish-surnamed pupils equally divided by sex at grade levels 1, 3, 5, and 7. The test battery included parallel Spanish and English versions of: (1) a 12-item vocabulary pretest, (2) a 32-item vocabulary-by-domain test consisting of four sections--home, neighborhood, church, and school--of eight items each, and (3) a 32-item grammar production test requiring 10 different grammatical operations. The pupils' performance was similar (balanced) in both languages on the home and neighborhood domains in all grades; Spanish was dominant on the church domain in grades 1 and 3, balance not being achieved until grade 7. English was dominant only on the school domain in grade 5. Spanish was dominant on the  grammar test through grade 5, with balance achieved in grade 7. The general tendency was for test scores to improve with grade level or years in school. The amount of variance in the test scores that could be reliably attributed to language use (i.e., language spoken with father, mother, friends, etc.) or demographic variables appeared small. Information about the reliability of test items and about correlations between the Spanish and English versions is given here, and the complete vocabulary and grammar tests are provided in appendixes.

The establishment by the American Association of Museums (AAM) of a national program of accreditation is an important indicator that the museums of the nation are emerging as a profession. More museums will continue to apply for participation in this accreditation program; and as the number of fully accredited institutions grows, the strength of museums on a national level will increase, lending added strength to the museum professions. This book begins with the history of the AAM accreditation, program, and continues with the definition of  accreditation for the AAM. The accreditation procedures and the visiting committee procedures are then examined. The appendixes contain: biographies and photographs of accreditation committee; official application forms; visiting committee narrative report; testimonials for accreditation; and a list of accredited museums as of May 1973.

The Student Information Form (SIF) was the survey instrument. Results indicate that the Hofstra data are consistent with the national trends in all but a few instances. Nationally, and at the private colleges, the percentage of freshmen with parents in the $30,000 or over category is increasing, while at Hofstra that percentage is decreasing. Hofstra is seeing its increase more in the middle income range. The racial makeup of Hofstra freshmen continues to remain essentially the same. However, the percentage of Jewish students in Hofstra's freshmen class has been  decreasing since 1971, the first year for which there is data. The percentage of men in the freshmen class has risen from 51 percent to 61 percent in the last four years. Business continues to be a very prominent major and career choice at Hofstra. Fewer Hofstra freshmen this year believe it is important to develop a philosophy of life or to influence social values than in past years. The fact that freshmen were offered financial assistance caused this to be the second most important reason for selecting Hofstra; academic reputation continues as the number one reason.

It is clear that the University of Tennessee is an important economic force on the local economy, accounting for some $123,787,021 in direct and $42,235,596 in indirect income created for a total local impact of $166,222,617. This represents over 15 percent of total local income. On the supply side, the human capital generated by the university was assigned a net present value of $687,896,769. Based on the direct spending ($134,463,536) by the university and its students, the ratio of the current value of university output measures in human capital terms to the cost of inputs is some 5.11 to 1. In an era when many public investment  projects are justified by a benefit/cost ratio of just slightly more than 1 to 1, the benefit/cost ratios given for educational investments at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, represent remarkable returns to society for its investment in education at the University of Tennessee.

Since 1970 there has been a legislative explosion as Congress has recognized the necessity to end sex discrimination on the campus. Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in all federally-assisted education programs. The second great breakthrough favoring the goal of sex equality is the opening of the doors of higher education to women. One of the greatest challenges is to convince women themselves that they can go beyond the role stereotype that was formed in them virtually since birth. Certainly the employment of increased numbers of women faculty members and administrators at high levels would have a considerable impact on lessening discriminatory practices. Such  a policy would give men and women students role-models of successful and respected academic women. The tasks of teaching, reorientation, and facilitation are the primary tasks of women and will remain so until the goals of liberation have become interwoven into the fabric of social consciousness.

Hence, the major purpose of this paper is to outline a conceptual framework for academic planning and evaluation related to social issues. Following a review of the significance of the changes during the sixties, a conceptual fremework is outlined. The framework is developed around a set of questions for the academic planner: (1) Does the proposed program have an intrinsic value, and if so, what is this value given the idea of higher education, the specific mission that exists at the given institution, and the fundamental nature of the social problem being addressed? (2) Does their exist sufficent administrative, faculty, and student understanding of  the problem, commitment to the specific program idea, and is there a strong indication that such commitments will remain in tact? (3) Are there harmonious relations between the administration, students, and faculty with regard to the specific proposed program? (4) Are the necessary resources available for implementing the program? (5) Can the proposed program achieve a high degree of academic quality and social consequences? The above questions are offered as a basis for decisionmaking in higher education. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"This report of the Coordinating Board's Nursing Project Council is the culmination of three years' intensive effort to provide the State of Texas with a plan on which those responsible for helping meet the health care needs can rely in determining where nurses are needed, what their educational preparation should be, and how the nurses can be utilized for maximum efficiency. The study made inquiries of registered nurses, vocational nurses, physicians, nursing students, and others who could be expected to provide information on the subject. Discussed in this report is: a profile of nursing in Texas, utilization of nurses, nursing education (needs and curriculum analysis), regional perspective, cooperative approach to meeting nursing needs, difinition of terms, and a selected  bibliography. The appendixes include statistical data on the status of nursing by region and selected copies of survey instruments used for the many surveys incorporated in this study. The intent of this report has been to provide reliable direction for agencies, institutions, and professional organizations interested in improving nursing education and delivery of health care.

The commission in this report is proposing several recommendations to the 1975 Minnesota Legislature designed to improve student access to postsecondary education, to improve the state's planning capabilities, to improve cooperation, and to improve the use of the state's postsecondary education resources. Highlights of the recommendations discussed include: (1) removal of the bonding limitation from the Minnesota State Student Loan Program; (2) authorization to negotiate reciprocal student aid agreements with state  in which a reciprocity agreement with Minnesota is in effect; (3) recognition of legitimate public service activities as an integral part of faculty responsibility and concomitantly a serious factor in promotion and salary decision; (4) appropriation to the commission of $50,000 for assessing the potential and developing plans with respect to state policy and action, on utilization of television and other educational media for delivering postsecondary education to the larger population.

        "description":"This study grew out of a desire to look at the reality of higher education within one state, one which has an outstanding record of public support for higher education, i.e., Oregon. It also seeks to complement the study conducted earlier in the year, which recommends further exploration of alternative ways of financing higher education. Briefly, what the authors tried to do was: (1) describe clearly the important components in state subsidies for higher education, (2) ascertain the relative efficiency and effectiveness of the different types of state subsidies and suggest shifts of funds among them which could produce superior results; (3) show how one particular alternative mix of subsidies could be implemented successfully in Oregon when introduced gradually over a number of  years; (4) stimulate serious discussion of the means and ends in state subsidies to postsecondary education. At present, more than 98 percent of state and local tax funds are granted directly to the college, with the remainder--less than 2 percent--going to students in the form of grants, cash awards, or as the state's backing of student loans. The author proposed that this proportion be increased to about three-fifths of the total, with a corresponding decrease in direct state funding of the institution. The proposed shifts in funding would take place gradually during successive two-year periods that would allow ample time for research, reflection, and adaptation. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"Voluntary support has been a major factor in the financing of American higher education since colonial times. Yet several recent proposals intended as tax reform measures threaten to reduce voluntary donations at a time when the nation's postsecondary institutions are in the throes of financial distress. The income tax proposals that would have an adverse impact on voluntary giving include: (1) legislation proposing that gifts of appreciated property be taxed on all of their appreciation or, in the alternative, that the allowable deduction be limited to the cost basis of the property; (2) charitable contributions to the extent attributable to appreciated property be included within the concept of tax preference; (3) the Minimum Taxable Income Proposal (MTI), which would compel  high income taxpayers to wait until the end of the taxable year before calculating their tax status. This would affect the timing and leadership of many capital efforts. Estate and gift tax proposals to higher education would also be affected. Available data indicated that the charitable deduction is an effective way of raising funds for higher education. In the absence of contrary evidence, it would seem highly inappropriate to repeal incentives to give at a time when colleges and universities are struggling to balance their budgets. (Author/PG)",

The three test groups were compared on the basis of their perception of the importance the institution accorded goals and the emphasis given to institutional functions.

This report discusses cost and efficiency in the operations of the academies and opportunities for economy in those operations. Other aspects of the study concern attrition and academic and military programs. Findings indicate a variation in operating cost due to differences in size of the student body, size and age of the institution, mission and organization of each, and student pay. Recommendations suggest that the Secretary of Defense: (1) direct  the Army and Air Force to review the staffing levels of the Military and Air Force academies to ensure that authorized strengths are appropriate; (2) monitor the services' civilianization studies to see that actions are taken to promptly convert any military positions that civilians can fill; (3) direct the services to perform the reviews required by the Office of Management and Budget and to support justifications for continued in-house operations; (4) direct the Coast Guard to study enlisted positions to determine whether civilians could fill additional military positions at its academy.

It was intended also to assist in identifying a set of outcome measures for which data acquisition procedures need to be developed. The basic methodology used in the study was a self-reported questionnaire administered through the mail. The sample of persons surveyed included top-level college administrators and state-level decision  makers. Their responses to the questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques and are shown in descriptive tables in this paper. It should be noted that while the descriptive summaries of the data represent the input of a large number of decision makers, in no way should they be viewed as standards. The document covers: the design of the study; administration of the questionnaire; response rates to the questionnaire; results of the study; concluding comments and references.

Conclusions and recommendations include: (1) The extension of collective bargaining rights to faculty should be based upon a recognition of their dual role as both employees and professionals. (2) The following principles and practices of the University system are essential to maintain a public university system with excellence and should be maintained in any collective bargaining arragnement developed for faculty: institutional autonomy;  tenure; academic freedom; merit system for salary; shared governance; and recognition of the responsibilities and authority of the Regents, president, chancellors, faculty, and academic staff. Major issues discussed in the report include: collective bargaining in higher education; collective bargaining rights, their scope and extension; specific provisions in enabling legislation, and the minority statement. Appendixes include statements from faculty, students, and staff, appearances from organized groups, and discussions with national authorities. (Author/PG)",

The study touched on five major areas: (1) the motivation and stimulation during basic medical education and during the physicians professional career; (2) the definition of objectives, selection of instructional methods, and evaluation of educational impact as they relate to the application of modern pedagogy; (3) interprofessional education programs; (4) qualitative and quantitative organizational requirements; and (5) resource requirements in the areas of personnel deployment, training staff for continuing education programs, facilities, and funding. Recommendations suggest: (1) The development of national systems of continuing education for the health professions  with clearly defined central and regional administrative authority and responsibility, and the integration of such programs with the national health care system. (2) The development of mechanisms for determining the local health needs and deficiencies of practitioners. (3) The identification and development of more realistic incentives and rewards for physicians to encourage them to engage in continuing education. (4) The development of discussion among specialists with the purpose of delineating jointly the specific objectives and processes or continuing education for the health professions. (5) The development of demonstration projects in interprofessional education. Additional recommendations are included. (MJM)",

This paper considers the use of an educational audit as a means of meeting this need. An educational audit is defined as an evaluation of educational institutions, including an assessment of programs, goals, and financial accountability. The authors point out that the relationship and educational auditing and accreditation will require the development of appropriate standards. They draw an analogy between auditing principles used by accounting firms to confirm the financial integrity of businesses or corporations and the procedures higher education institutions use  to evaluate their effectiveness. For example, if data are relevant, verifiable, free from bias, and quantifiable, the standards for accounting information and the auditing of a higher education institution would be satisfied. The authors believe it is necessary for colleges and universities to be as rigorous as possible in their institutional auditing so that the integrity of the educational enterprise will not be thrown into question and become subject to outside sanctions or controls.

Other features are the relatively simple procedures, annual repetition of the process, and specific results of a logical and systematic program and budget review. The value of institutional planning itself is evident in various ways: it (1) helps the institution progress in ways that its trustees, officers, faculty, and students consider most suitable; (2)  provides a process for institutional response to challenges in the environment; (3) presents various alternatives available to the institution; (4) becomes a vehicle for response to strengths and weaknesses; and (5) focuses on utilization of resources to best advantage.

        "description":"This is a staff paper in response to requests from administrators and trustees in about 11 states where legislatures are considering bills that will enable faculties to unionize for purposes of collective bargaining. Perhaps the most important question posed by such legislation is \"Who is the employer for the state university, a state college, or a community college?\" When the higher education community permits this question to go unanswered, the uniformed legislature often permits a state of hiatus within the university by requiring faculty to bargain with someone such as a commissioner of administration. In addition, impasses and grievances may be settled outside the authority of the university. This paper offers suggestions for shaping legislation that would be beneficial to  trustees and others interested in the integrity and ability of institutions to govern themselves. (Author/PG)",

The first step to achieve this goal would be to establish a standard system of evaluating instructional effectiveness that would have as its two major outcomes (a) reward for success and (b) guidance for improvement. Evaluation of student attitudes about instructors and instruction is perhaps the most commonly used method of assessing instructional effectiveness. The quality of student learning is another very important variable to consider. The student attitude or rating data should be presented to the instructor in an easily readable and interpretable format. Faculty  (peer) and department head attitudes and judgments should be presented to the faculty member in an easily interpretable report. If part or all of the assessments of instructional effectiveness are not highly positive, then the instructor should determine what needs to be done to improve the institutional weaknesses. These needs could then be presented in the form of a proposal. The higher level administration of both the institution and the faculty should accept and encourage the use of such a system as an integral part of the institutional reward scheme. (Author/PG)",

The revision process began in early 1974 when a large cross-section of NCHEMS participating institutions and agencies were asked to suggest changes they felt should be made in the PCS. In general, revisions were made: (1) to accommodate the unique needs of those postsecondary education institutions not adequately served by the current PCS. (2) to include activity centers needed for program planning and analysis but missing the current edition of the PCS. (3) to restructure the  PCS where needed, and where feasible, to make it a better programmatic structure and to improve the feasibility of implementation.

Two disturbing aspects of the programs's development for 1974 are discussed in this annual report: (1) The increased popularity of some offerings in the program led some states to withdraw those programs  so that more spaces would be available for their own residents. (2) Regional Student Program enrollment at four-year colleges is smaller than at universities and community colleges.

The study is organized into seven sections: (1) a description of  what is happening to traditional, accredited institutions of higher education; (2) definitions; (3) case of quality control of external degree programs and nontraditional study; (4) assessment of state legislation that might have an impact on external degree programs; (5) description of the role that the accreditation associations play in controlling the quality of postsecondary education, with an assessment of their capability to respond to external programs; (6) description of the present federal roles regulating external degrees; and (7) a summary. Supporting appendixes include a summary of the laws that govern out-of-state accredited institutions, and analysis of each state's incorporation requirements, accreditation association guidelines, and a resource bibliography.

A reason for this is that Indians on reservations pay no state income tax, and are therefore not entitled to state support, but must rely on federal funding. A model for a possible solution to this problem may be found in a program in Saskatchewan, Canada, where the province's Indian-Eskimo Association proved Indian use and need of libraries to the Canadian Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. On the initiation of individual Indian bands, the department has agreed to grant $1.50 per capita for library services if the Indians will match grants at the rate of 10 cents per capita, and if a working arrangement is  established with a larger library system. Pressure may be applied to U.S. government institutions for similar grants to Indians in the United States. (LS)",

The Center's assumptions about educational management served as a basis for the program. Special attention was given to the transfer of industry-based management concepts to education. As proposed, the second year's program for the Center would use a novel mix of proven and accepted process techniques in working on field problems and developing new intervention strategies for conducting and managing the process of education. A highlight would be an effort to influence organizational changes. The Center's quarterly reports and the Havelock model for acting as a change agent are appended.  (Author/SK)",

        "description":"Despite the support for the proposition that learning is enhanced by the reinforcement of correct responses, there remain learners who continue to fail when contingent reinforcement is administered, even though they may have the ability and be motivated to succeed. This condition, known as learned helplessness, presents a problem for instructional technology in that reinforcements do not strengthen a response. In this study, 54 subjects were given a training task that involved using a manipulandum to attempt to escape from an audible tone that was varied in amplitude from mild to aversive. It was found that subjects who were unable to escape during the acquisition trials showed the greatest decrement in performance during the transfer test. The study demonstrated that in  laboratory settings, both instructions and reinforcement contingencies contribute to the development of learned helplessness. This phenomenon may be valuable to instructional technology because it will lead to a greater understanding of the etiology and treatment of chronic failure behavior which is independent of ability on the part of school children.

Welfare was measured by the sum of producer's and consumer's surplus. It was demonstrated that any of the private market systems considered contain biases against certain kinds of programs. Bias was present with pay TV, but it was worse under a competitive, advertiser supported structure. The study results suggested that pay TV on cable, with its elastic supply of channels, offers the opportunity for more programs than can be supported by advertising, and that this has a desirable effect on viewer welfare.

During the present decade, CAI has undergone a remarkable change, due to a fair extent to two large-scale projects, PLATO and TICCIT, which differ in significant respects from earlier approaches to CAI. Some key aspects of this large-scale experiment involving PLATO and TICCIT are discussed, and some tentative conclusions, based on limited experience with actual instruction, are drawn. As an example of the use of such large systems, an automated system developed on PLATO for teaching computer  science is discussed. (Author)",

George Leonard's book &quot;Education and Ecstasy&quot; provides an interesting picture of what schools in the year 2001 may be like. He suggests that through extended computer technology students will be motivated to learn and that they will learn all basic information, including calculus, between the ages of three and ten. In the book students interact directly with the computer which monitors the student's progress in all subject areas. Children are depicted as linked directly to the computer through headphones that pick up the  child's brain signals and indicate to the computer whether the child is comprehending the lesson. The implications of Leonard's book are worthy of serious consideration despite the resistance that computer assisted instruction may face in the near future. (DGC)",

Of these, 304 questionnaires (45 percent) were returned. From the data the following conclusions could be drawn: (1) Regular listeners tend to be highly educated males with the clear majority over 30 years of age; (2) The regular listener tunes in to shortwave broadcasts nearly 17 hours per week; (3) Hobby and interest in logging distant stations were  first and second while the third, fourth, and sixth most often noted reasons for monitoring international broadcasting services among listeners related to news and information received through the broadcasts; (4) News, commentary, and documentary (in that order) were the most preferred program types among listeners; and (5) The four favorite international services are Radio Nederland, Radio Australia, BBC, and Radio Canada International.

Since circulation counts, head counts, and similar statistics have provided only an approximation of the real services provided, an opinionnaire was devised to survey the faculty about library use, quality of materials and services, and the role of the resource teacher. An analysis of the data from the survey showed: (1) the resource center (RC) as \"firmly entrenched in the teaching methodology of a majority of the faculty reporting\", (2) a desire for further acquisition of books and periodicals, (3) a need for more staff, (4) a desire for new or reinstated services, and (5) a low priority for \"maintaining order in the RC.\" The  anonymity of the survey also provided an opportunity for faculty to express some criticisms, which were helpful to the resource teacher.

Library supervisors often do not have managerial training and may consider their management role as secondary. The educational level of the staff they supervise may be higher than those in business, and the financial structure of the library prevents the use of standard industrial personnel practices such as bonuses. The supervisor must have knowledge of the tasks to be performed by the person to be supervised and of the fundamental concepts of management, including organization theory, leadership theory, and the techniques of motivation. Although not all professionals who work for libraries  supervise, the schools of library and information science should consider including supervisory training in their programs. Supervision is an aspect of professional work which requires more consideration than it has had to date; the human relations aspects of library work are in need of attention. (Author/SL)",

After educational objectives for the film were written, a storyboard was drawn up for a translation into film. A prerequisite test, pretest, and posttest were written for the unit. Before filming, the final storyboard and script were critiqued by students and additional revisions were made. Filming and editing took a relatively short time. The production was then field tested and found to be an effective instructional  device.

Underlying causes for lack of development of local history collections were also examined. A six-page, multiple-choice questionnaire was sent to the public library located in the county seat of all 93 counties in the state. The 42 usable returns were processed for computer analysis and analyzed using a STAT 08  computer program. Due to poor return rate and a faulty survey instrument, the results could not be considered conclusive, but they seemed to indicate that public libraries in Nebraska were not fulfilling their responsibility to collect and preserve the history of their area.

The findings indicated that catalogers use two general approaches in determining subject headings for local historical collections in the United States (subject or topic vs. geographical place), and that although the use of the geographical place as the primary subject entry scatters the material throughout the catalog under the names of cities, towns, churches, and the like, this type of entry is easier for the genealogist-patron to use. The system which stresses the subject or topic as the main entry or heading has predominated in library practices; however, emphasis has  recently shifted to the use of the geographical place as the primary subject entry, and in 1972 the Library of Congress changed from the subject type entry to the geographical type entry. Thus current cataloging practices do meet current genealogical user requirements to the extent that new local history materials are given a geographical representation in the library catalog. However, unless institutional policy allows recataloging retrospectively, then to that extent current cataloging practices do not meet user requirements. (Author/KKC)",

The survey was designed to gauge their attitudes toward the existence of problems in the cataloging of musical scores and phonodiscs; the rating of such problems as major; and the variances found among the catalogers relative to years of experience, college degrees held, and the size of their collections. The questionnaire consisted of 15 different categorical problem statements found in library literature. Responses came from 86 catalogers with masters degrees or better and 14 with bachelors degrees or less. Data were tested using the modified Amplified Doolittle Computer Program.  Analysis of variance revealed that the significant problem areas were: obtaining analytics for anthologies, making uniform title entries, and creating subject headings. Responses varied significantly relative to collection size and years of experience for analytics, subject headings, and expansion of card catalogs. Responses also varied relative to subject headings and college degrees held. (Author/SL)",

The postindustrial society is one in which the dominant labor activity is information processing rather than industrial production. This shift has great significance for the resolution of social problems of society, particularly in the economic sector. The information based society is a more efficient user of energy and resources; furthermore the information industry itself is not an intensive user of energy and resources. This shift also requires the re-examination of key areas of economic policy problems such as productivity, natural resource constraints, information, international interdependence, and social issues  (such as the distribution of information technology, privacy, property rights in information, and the use of leisure time). Computer telecommunication technology will impact a variety of applications areas of concern to governments: education, funds transfer, trade, consumer information, public administration, teleconferencing, and health services. In turn the structural change will require consideration of questions in relationship to research and policy analysis, economic infrastructure, research and development, network intercommunication, and right to access.

Comparisons were made of the data for the whole population, as it was obtained from the USDIM questionnaire, from an author-prepared questionnaire, from state financial records, and from personal visits to the schools. A computer program, Statistical Package for the Social Studies (SPSS), was used. Federal funds for school media  programs, length of service of principals and media coordinators were found to be associated with the level of response to the state's questionnaire. Conclusions were descriptive, and pointed out individual differences in school media programs.

A management consultant on the Glendale City Manager's staff visited Pasadena and Burbank and collected some elementary data from these libraries. Their staffing and basic organizational structure was determined. A detailed list of the functions performed at the Glendale Library was reviewed with each of the libraries, and differences in functional coverage were explored and noted. Statistics were also collected on the standardpublished measures of titles added, titles deleted, volumes added and  withdrawn, and nonbook materials withdrawn. The analysis used consisted of an adjustment for functional differences, and then the standard statistics were divided by the total number of staff, to determine number of transactions per employee. Examination of the index data indicated that the effectiveness of all three libraries was very close to the same level. (Author)",

In addition, it is suggested that the date due and overdue system be changed from a daily to a weekly system, which will reduce the clerical load, reduce the computer printout load, and allow more local flexibility in performing staff work.

At present this response is a joint effort between the CD, the Readers' Assistance Section, and the Reference Section. Under the suggested changes, the MCLS clerk would perform the entire process. The process seldom requires professional librarian skills, and its assignment to one person would considerably speed it up. It would also remove a clerical duty from the professional staff. It has been estimated that from one to four labor hours per day are being expended for that portion of the effort outside the CD. In order to accomplish this  work flow change, additional time would have to be made available within the CD. Due to constant interruptions, the efficiency of the librarians involved is not high, and therefore it is felt that fewer total hours would be required under the proposed changes. (Author/SL)",

        "description":"During the first half of the twentieth century, there was slow but steady progress toward larger units of public library service, such as county and regional systems. But there was a lag both in the conceptual and the actual development of the central libraries of these systems as strong points for direct service to readers. Librarians were first committed to reach out at the local level and to extend at least minimal service to everyone. The principle of local, direct access to libraries partially prevented attention from being paid to the quality service and subject depth of resources that a centralized system could provide. With the passage of the Library Services Act (LSA) in 1956 and the approval of new standards for public libraries, the ground work was laid to correct this  unbalanced development. Most of the earlier efforts to form larger units of service, including those under LSA, were directed toward making books physically convenient for people. Only in the last few years, due to the impetus of some forward-looking state planning and the passage of the library Services and Construction Act in 1964, has effort been focused on building strong central services and resources.

Because the needs of the community had become more complex, a new regional library was built to coordinate library operations and establish new services. Among the innovations in public library service at the new library are the intershelving of young adult and adult nonfiction, and the housing of nonprint media with print media. The library houses an auditorium with a stage and kitchen, music practice rooms, TV conference rooms with video tape capability, and a complete reproduction center. This center includes photocopy, laminating, dry-mounting, and other reproduction equipment unusual in a public library. Community information  services and bibliographic services are provided. The new program was financed through savings from previous budgets, an increased library mill levy, and $250,000 in revenue sharing funds. Patron response has been highly enthusiastic, and plans for expansion are underway. (KC)",

A general building design for future branches shows them compact and economical. Drive-in stations, parked at shopping centers, would house small collections; older mobile units would be converted into permanent branches; and minibookmobiles would service those without transportation, institutionalized patrons, and young children. Minilibraries, deposit collections, and a Mail-A-Book Service would extend the reach of the library  into outlying areas. To provide adequate staffing additional paraprofessionals would be hired.

        "description":"In recent years, television has received increasing criticism for its portrayal of the female as the passive mother, homemaker, or secretary. Recent content analysis studies of North American television broadcasting support the assertion that women have been stereotyped as second class citizens in a man's world; seldom are they presented as professionals or working wives. However, other studies suggest that the stereotyping of women on television is only a reflection of society's more general treatment of women as dependent, subjective, noncompetitive, and illogical. Few countries have come to portray the role of women in a manner consistent with the emerging role that they are actually assuming. Cuba has, in some respects, brought about such a change in the perception of the  woman's role, and women there are more actively involved in educational, professional, and political endeavors. Television's impact on women in North America is to reinforce their self-image of creatures who lack self-confidence, ambition, and rationality. Several studies suggest that the lack of achievement orientation is one result of society's stereotyping of women. While female awareness of the effect television has on perpetuating such portrayals is an important first step, there appears to be little power within the grasp of women to overcome current practices in sex-stereotyping.

To do this, the librarian should learn something about the way children are taught to read and about the problems of the poor reader by consulting the reading teacher for advice on books to read on the teaching of reading. Reading teachers should participate in the selection of books and materials, using selection aids provided by the school librarian. The librarians should provide a place for all kinds of reading and create and maintain a climate in which enjoyment of reading can flourish, with a separate room for group activities and with all facilities accessible to all students at all times. The librarian should  also participate in the reading development of the students who use the school library by selecting, interpreting, and advising students on the use of materials.

The following eight program areas are considered: trades and industrial, technical, natural sciences, health, arts and humanities, social science and public service, business contact and marketing, and business detail and office. Fifty-eight  percent of the 234,008 students enrolled in the 158 sampled colleges chose essentially career type programs, but 41.7 percent continued to elect basically baccalaureate-bound options. The fact that there was no more than a two percentage point differential between freshman and total enrollments in any one program indicates no significant shift in the attendance pattern of the 1973-74 freshmen class as compared to the total student population counted.

Only two institutions, both in Colorado, seemed to have exemplary shared-authority structures; both structures represented the entire college, not just the evening division. In addition to this survey, an opinion survey of Division students, faculty, and administration at BCC was conducted. A committee of representatives of these three groups was established to consider possible structures, the Dean of the Division was asked for his opinions, the related literature was reviewed, and the current governance structure  was analyzed. As a result of all these inputs, the authors recommended the formation of a new structure, called the All Continuing Education and Community Services Senate. The Senate will be composed of four Division students, four Division faculty, four Division administrators, and two members of the Division classified staff, all of whom will be elected to one-year terms of office. It will meet at least once each month and will make recommendations to the Dean of the Division on matters concerning Division policies and procedures. (DC)",

Previous studies of two-year institutions in New Mexico are reviewed. A historical review of two-year colleges and a legislative history of junior colleges in New Mexico are presented. Although New Mexico does not have a coordinated state system of junior colleges, enrollment in two-year institutions has increased over 200 percent during the last 10 years. New Mexico now has nine branch community college campuses, which are governed by a parent four-year college, and only one junior college, which is controlled by a junior college board elected by the junior college district's voters. New Mexico also has one military institute, three technical/vocational institutes, and five  private and six public four-year institutions. In general, two-year colleges in New Mexico have been relegated to the status of stepchild of other institutions. Because they add prestige to the communities in which they are located, branch colleges give the parent institutions additional political clout in the state legislature; this political reality must be considered in future attempts to establish junior college legislation. Another fact to be considered is that vocational/technical courses offered at the branch campuses do not generate FTE for funding purposes. (DC)",

Twenty-two institutions (69 percent) responded. In only 17 institutions were part-time students allowed to vote for student government officers. In 11 institutions evening students could not vote; at two schools evening students could vote only if they were full-time. At 13 institutions only full-time or day students could hold student government office; 12 schools reported that anyone with a cumulative average of &quot;C&quot; or better could hold such an  office. No institution reported that students could sit as voting members on institutional committees. At 13 institutions students were appointed to institutional committees, rather than elected; usually they were appointed by the student government association or its president. Only four schools reported separate student organizations for evening students. Relevant literature is reviewed, and recommendations are made. (DC)",

In the past, the processing and tabulation of results were essentially manual operations. This paper describes a recently-developed computerized system which carries out most of the processing of this survey up through the tabulation of results. The entire system is shown in a series of five flow diagrams included in the appendix. Accompanying narrative descriptions of the flow charts further explain the specific operations necessary to key off an operational student records system, collect additional data, and tabulate the results. Diagram 1 shows the method of creating a work tape, which is then edited for errors and tailored to the specific needs of the graduate followup study.  Diagram 2 shows the method of punching a deck of finder cards consisting of student identification numbers; this deck of cards ultimately becomes the reference list for the printing of mailing labels. Diagram 3 describes the mailout, remainder followup, and coding of returned questionnaires. Diagram 4 describes the updating of the Grad Bank tape, which contains data from all previous graduate followups conducted since the installment of the computerized system.

The average percentage of &quot;F&quot; grades given was 3.7 percent (range= 2.8-5 percent). The average percentage of &quot;I&quot; grades given was 2.1 percent (range= 1-3 percent). Past studies suggest that both student and faculty characteristics contribute to this five-year pattern of comparative similarities. For the fall semester of 1974-75, the total numbers of &quot;F&quot; and &quot;I&quot; grades assigned in each academic department were as follows: Behavioral Science--14 &quot;F's&quot; and 11 &quot;I's&quot;; Business--25 &quot;F's&quot; and 12 &quot;I's&quot;; Humanities--5 &quot;F's&quot; and 32 &quot;I's&quot;; Science--72 &quot;F's&quot; and 7 &quot;I's&quot;. Three years ago the author predicted that stabilized grading practices  at Harcum would lead to a rising level of &quot;lower&quot; grades.

For the 1974-75 academic year, this group included representation from such minorities as women, blacks, older students, the poor, and most other groups which have traditionally had little voice in the academic community. Recognizing that the usual status of developmental programs is low and that other members of the college community tend to ignore those in such programs, the HEAP coordinator at JCC organized &quot;The Higher Times,&quot; a HEAP newspaper. This two-page newspaper inserted in the regular JCC newspaper provides an opportunity for HEAP students to express  their views, interests, and needs, and prompts recognition of their existence. It has proven to be an effective organ for communicating the purposes of HEAP to JCC's faculty and students, and for keeping HEAP students informed of programs, plans, and activities. Also, it has resulted in increased consideration of the program. A poem written by a former HEAP student is quoted and 15 myths about educational change and innovation are questioned. (Author/DC)",

Because private junior colleges face shrinking enrollments and diminished funding for instruction, services, and activities, they must now stress cost-effectiveness and practical financial management if they are to remain vigorous. They must limit their hiring of new faculty and reduce the number of courses, small classes, and administrators. However, they will continue to be an integral and significant part of the two-year college movement if they are committed to the movement as a field in which their future lies and if they are committed to institutional purposes which go beyond competition with public two-year colleges. Also,  they must: (1) focus attention on their educational program and their services to society, (2) focus on well-rounded continuing development programs, (3) emphasize both short-term and long-term goals, (4) enlist trustees and other volunteers who believe in, work for, and give adequate support to their programs, (5) use educational objectives relevant to these times, (6) institute effective student recruitment programs, (7) work for favorable state and federal tax laws, and (8) evaluate their institutional effectiveness on a regular basis.

A review of the literature on collective bargaining, nonparticipatory governance, and faculty senate militancy is given as background for the study. Survey 1 polled 50 faculty members on their frustration with the college governance structure; 43 (86 percent) responded. A high degree of dissatisfaction with the campus governance structure was indicated. Seventy-five percent or more of the respondents agreed that: (1) governance is clearly in the hands of the  administration; (2) faculty are not widely involved in important campus decisions; and (3) faculty reluctance to participate on committees stems from the committees' lack of institutional power. Survey 2 polled all 225 faculty; 150 responses were elicited. Ninety-two percent of the respondents favored collective bargaining. Vocational faculty were slightly less militant than academic faculty, but the faculty senate was just as militant as traditionally militant groups: faculty under 41, academic faculty, and members of AFT. Faculty senate executive officers were even more militant than younger faculty or academic faculty. Although no correlation could be established between militancy and frustration, it is inferred that they are correlated. (AH)",

After examining the significance of the problem of committees and governance structure at FCC, the procedures for the surveys are set forth. To examine governance structures at other schools, 16 community colleges of various sizes and locations were examined. After a close study of the FCC committee structure, 88 faculty, staff, and students were polled on their attitudes toward the effectiveness of committees at  FCC; 67 responses were elicited. Dissatisfaction and discontent with the typical administratively-controlled committee structure is clearly demonstrated. A number of primary dissatisfactions are reported and reaction to proposed alternatives are solicited from survey respondents. Reform of the current system, establishment of a joint system of faculty-administration appointment of committee members, and the establishment of an all-college or unicameral senate as an alternative to a committee system are discussed. Percentage responses to key questions of the staff survey are reported, and recommendations are made. (Author/AH)",

        "description":"This document presents a method of determining the best location for a potential satellite campus by predetermining the population characteristics of its potential students. The question is approached as a marketing problem with a geographical orietation. The test site for this project was Pierce College in the Los Angeles Comunity College District. The researcher chose to employ a geographically based information system with nationwide availability: the GBF/DIME technology developed by the U. S. Census Bureau. The foundation of this system is a computerized map of the urban area under consideration, referred to as a DIME file (Dual Independent Map Encoding), the technique by which this basic file is created. A Delphi technique was used to question 15 Pierce College policymakers  about the importance of each student characteristic variable. They were asked to list as many population characteristics as they could to describe the student groups to be served by the new educational facility. Tabulated responses and a copy of the author's first report were then sent to each participant for review and further suggestions. After two iterations of the administration of the instrument, a substantial amount of convergence as to item importance was evidenced. (DC)",

The hypothesis of this study is that non-traditional students who take advantage of the total Extended Opportunity Programs and Services (EOPS) package will perform better academically than those who utilize only financial aid. A review of literature concerning non-traditional students, teachers of non-traditional students, and developmental programs precedes discussion of the study. The GPA's of 50 students who were on academic probation and subsequently received the full services of EOPS were compared to 50 students who were on academic probation and received financial aid and/or book grants but did not receive peer counseling or tutorial services. Data were obtained  from mid-term and final grade reports for Fall 1973 and Spring 1974 semesters. The data show that the average GPA for EOPS students who received full supportive services tended to improve significantly; their collective GPA rose from 1.61 to 2.53. Those who did not receive tutorial and peer counseling services did not significantly improve their GPA's. Flow charts of monitoring procedures for those students receiving full services and those receiving only financial aid are appended, as are GPA reports for each student studied. (Author/DC)",

Results indicate that SAC students had lower GPA's and higher course withdrawal and college drop-out rates than students at the other colleges studied. Fifty-seven percent of the SAC students withdrew during the semester or discontinued their enrollment for the next semester, as compared to 40 percent of the students at all colleges studied. Interestingly, SAC students who discontinued their enrollment after one semester had higher GPA's than SAC students who continued and higher than  students who discontinued their enrollment at the other colleges. Although SAC full-time students withdrew from individual courses more often than SAC part-time students, they were more apt to re-enroll the next semester. SAC's part-time students tended to have a higher college drop-out rate than part-time students in the other colleges studied. Also, SAC issued fewer No Credit grades than the 32 other colleges.

One hundred and eighty (30 percent) of the 599 students enrolled, or recently enrolled, in certain advanced evening courses in the Business and Technical Arts curricula in the spring of 1974 responded to a survey questionnaire. Results indicated a wide variation in the degree of relevance between course work and current employment. Of the 15 Surveying students responding, 14 were currently employed; all 14 indicated that their course work was job-related. At the other extreme, six of the nine respondents in Tax Accounting said that their  current jobs were not at all related to their course work. Seventy-six percent of the employed respondents felt that their jobs were related to their vocational education courses. Respondents' marital status, sex, dependent-independent status, educational attainment, and current involvement in school or employment are also noted.

The author claims that education for today's world must be life-centered and life-long. What is needed is a dynamic relationship between learning and life. The life-centered curriculum must focus on that point where the individual interacts and transacts with the environment. The author recommends the establishment of a competency-based curriculum leading to an  associate degree in Life-Centered Education. The units of the curriculum would be built around the essential life roles of individuals in the community. Life-centered education would be concerned with ways that the individual might express his/her individuality and autonomy while making the necessary transactions within pervasive life roles. Methods of curriculum implementation, including selecting the target groups and training community college personnel to act as advisory groups, are included. (DC)",

A peer helper at VWCC is a student attending the college who has been trained and evaluated as being effective in specifically defined interpersonal helping relationships. Peer helpers provide services as an adjunct to those services provided by the VWCC counseling staff. After initial failure to develop a successful training program, the VWCC counseling staff developed an innovative modular training program. Each module is an independent unit focusing on particular cognitive, skill, and/or affective requirements of a specific task. Sixteen training modules are included in the program and are listed in the appendix. The assumptions underlying the general  aspects of the program are: (1) there does exist a common core of facilitative conditions or relationship-building skills that is characteristic of all helping interpersonal relationships and (2) a helper must have skills and knowledge or a response repertoire adequate and specific for the task to be performed. Means for evaluating the individual participants in the program are described. An extensive bibliography used in developing the VWCC program is included. (Author/AH)",

The Advancement Studies (developmental studies) Department at Central Piedmont Community College has developed a system for student reaction to the persons (teacher, student), properties (content, materials, time), and processes (instruction, evaluation) of each course. A Student Reaction questionnaire consisting of four questions relating to the structure and organization of the course, ten questions relating to the student's emotional reaction to the course, and two spaces for write-in responses, was developed by the Advancement Studies Department (ASD). This  questionnaire is administered to students in all department courses during the fifth week of an eleven week quarter; because they are machine processed, results are available by the end of the sixth week. Following a literature review and an analogue model of systemic analysis for education, the new system and the results of its first administration are reviewed. Results indicate that all eleven courses are more oriented to processes and properties than to persons, and that courses receiving high student ratings tend to have high retention rates. Student reactions to each of the eleven courses are detailed and recommendations for the improvement of each course are made. (DC)",

The FTE's produced by individual course enrollment would constitute the unit of measure for institutional funding. This report illustrates the procedure for administering phase four of Catalog development: establishing objectives for each course and stating them in behavioral terms. Instructors of Human Relations from 14 institutions participated in the  development of a unified course with state-wide applicability. The objectives of the project were: (1) to analyze the current status of the course as it is taught at each institution; (2) to identify objectives of the course which will provide for both uniformity in a state system and flexibility at the institutional level; (3) provide experiences for instructors in the development of individualized learning modules; (4) produce modules; and (5) plan for the continual development of the course via a model of participation.

Since ELAC was founded 29 years ago each new discipline has been established as a separate department; at the time of the study 27 such departments were reporting directly to the dean of instruction. At the direction of the college president, the dean of instruction led the department chairmen in a study of the historical development of college instructional organization, an appraisal of the existing effectiveness thereof, and a survey of the organizational pattern of 25 similar institutions in California. Both the survey and the search of the literature disclosed a marked  preference of instructional administrators for a division or divisional/departmental structure of 10 or fewer units. A transition to this system at ELAC was considered too disruptive. Recommended instead was a grouping of the existing departments under two or three assistant deans each of whom would be given line responsibility for limited and specific functions and elimination of the evening division as a separate administrative entity. Additional organizational changes were also recommended. Appendices include organizational charts, questionnaires, duty statements, and related reports and recommendations. (Author/AH)",

A hypothetical cluster college, Everyman Community College, is presented as a structural model. Students are members of a cluster and a center. Each center comprises approximately 400 students broadly grouped around a career category, such as medical services or education-related careers. Clusters of four or five centers are organized into broader  categories such as life processes or human relations. Alternative possibilities for cluster themes are noted. A suggested staff breakdown for both center and cluster, and a projected nine year calendar of incremental growth are provided.

Following separation from the San Francisco Unified School District in 1970, the Community College District was established with two parts, the City College and an Adult Division offering neighborhood adult programs. Since accreditation is limited to institutions, only the City College was reviewed in the 1968 accreditation report, in which criticisms of unresponsiveness to the community were made. Subsequently, the District's adult centers grew to become seven Community College Centers, each directed to a special constituency, such as the  handicapped, the elderly, or recent immigrants, and offering both credit and non-credit programs. In the 1972 accreditation visit, both the City College and the community programs were reviewed; as a result, both the City College and the District itself were accredited. Nonetheless, application on behalf of the Adult Division for federal financial aid for its full-time day students was denied: the Division was not an institution. In response, the District has reorganized under a fictional umbrella organization, San Francisco Community College, with two segments--the City College and the Community College Centers. Petition for student financial aid has been resubmitted and approval is expected. (BB)",

        "description":"Evaluation of the State Department of Finance enrollment projection techniques suggest they have become less accurate over time in projecting community college enrollments. In light of the continual growth of the California system, accurate enrollment projection techniques are needed if colleges are to be effectively planned and managed. The basic system of enrollment projection employed by the state, &quot;BD-240,&quot; which applies participation rates and grade progression ratios to counts of recent high school seniors, does not take into account trends toward part-time and evening enrollments or the increasing age of enrollees. Improved projection techniques should incorporate the number and character (age, sex, mobility, etc.) of service area population, local socioeconomic conditions  (unemployment rate, etc.), and the changing policies of the particular college/district and nearby postsecondary institutions. Preliminary analysis of the results of BD-240 estimates since 1968 suggest that they typically have underestimated total student enrollment and overestimated weekly student contact hours for day-graded activity. Four options for future projections are presented, and enrollment projections based on the BD-240 and the four options are shown through 1985. State and selected district enrollment figures are noted, and the Community College Board of Governors policy statement on enrollment projections is appended. (Author/AH)",

Twice as many women as men were sampled. Analysis of the data revealed that these women were more like four-year college women than &quot;new students&quot; at two-year colleges. The majority of women studied were 18 or 19 years old, single, and white. Nearly half of both their mothers and fathers had completed some college. While attending college the women depended on their parents for financial support and did not work. Their most common majors  were liberal arts, health sciences, or secretarial science. Unlike four-year college women, however, their occupational choices resembled those of their fathers more than their mothers and they anticipated continuous commitment to work. They selected their careers for special interest, opportunity to work with people, and ability to be creative. True role innovativeness was expressed by only one-fifth of the women sampled. Pertinent literature is reviewed, data is presented, and recommendations for improved counseling services are made. The questionnaire and the interview format are appended. (Author/DC)",

In December 1973, it was decided to use a modified Delphi technique to project enrollment (and subsequent income) for the 1974 Fall quarter. In the interest of expediency, this process was conducted at a series of meetings where the participants were present. Participants included the Dean of Instruction, the Dean of Student Services, the Admissions Officer, the Coordinator of Planning and Development, and the chairman and one faculty member of the department being considered. The participants estimated a Fall 1974 enrollment of 779, which compared  favorably to the actual enrollment of 786. However, the estimates were not accurate in projecting the proportion of part-time and full-time enrollment. Whereas projection was made for 602 full-time students, actual full-time enrollment was only 480, and whereas projection was made for 177 part-time students, actual part-time enrollment was 306. Since subsidy is received on the basis of FTE, these inaccurate projections led to inflated budget expectations. (Author/DC)",

        "description":"In order to measure the academic success/failure rate of students reading below the ninth grade level, all freshmen students entering Cosumnes River College were given the Nelson-Denny Reading Test during college registration in August 1974. Of the approximately 650 students tested, 113 (17 percent) scored 41 or below; this score corresponds to a grade placement score of eight years and nine months reading ability. By the end of the semester, 69 (61 percent) of these 113 students were subject to probation, on probation, or had withdrawn from college; 70 students (62 percent) had a progress point average (PPA) of 1.99 or below, less than a &quot;C&quot; average; and 42 students (37 percent) had a PPA of .99 or below, less than a &quot;D&quot; average. Students who were tested as reading at the eighth  grade level (8.1-8.9) and who also enrolled in a remedial English course showed a failure rate of 33 percent as compared to 59 percent for students who were tested as reading at the same level and who did not enroll in a remedial English course. Students who were tested as reading at below the eighth grade level failed at the same rate (64-70 percent) whether or not they enrolled in a remedial English course. Further results indicate that reading level is a good predictor of academic success for students who take six or more units, but is a poor predictor of success for students taking five units or less.

There is a general increase in the number of foreign students enrolling over the last three years, particularly for students enrolling in eleven or more credit hours.

As a followup to this study, student responses regarding their GPA at the original four-year college were compared to their GPA as shown on official transcripts. Of the original group of 134 respondents, only 105 had transcripts on record, hence on the followup study, N=105. The mean GPA indicated by student response was between 2.4 and 2.5. This was significantly higher than their actual mean GPA, which was between 1.9  and 2.0. 42 of the respondents had correctly stated their GPA, 45 had overstated it, while only six had understated their previous record. Subclassifications of reverse transfer students were created to see if certain categories of student had more severe academic problems than others. These subclassifications included academic majors at four-year institutions, hours attempted at the four-year college, age, sex, and hours worked while attending the four-year college. No significant differences in previous academic success could be found between the various subclassifications. (AH)",

        "description":"In 1956, the central administration of the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) established the Learning Resources Laboratory (LRL), then known as TV College. At the time, the televised courses offered by LRL allowed regular students to enroll in courses filled or not offered on campus, allowed out-of-district suburbanites to enroll in the college, and provided education for shut-ins, housewives, the disabled, and prisoners in local prisons. By 1973, however, the City College system had added new campuses, and suburban areas had created their own community colleges, so that a large part of the need for LRL had diminished. Furthermore, declining CCC enrollments had led campus faculty to resent the competition presented by LRL. Believing that the innovations of LRL could benefit CCC  students, the author designed a study to determine the extent to which present LRL administrative communication processes had laid the groundwork for improved cooperation. His conclusions were that personnel below the central administrative level of LRL functioned as clerical workers and had no share in policy making, and that there had been no attempt to coordinate the efforts of LRL with those of CCC, inasmuch as LRL had isolated itself. He recommends that coordinators of LRL at the CCC campuses have more responsibility for decision-making so that they will be motivated to further the goals of LRL on the campuses. The questionnaire, a summary of responses, and diagrams of the communications networks are appended. (DC)",

The high school senior group was expected to reflect the perceptions of the community. Total usable responses from each group  numbered 53. The perceptions measured were: (1) COM has a black enrollment which is greater than the community; (2) COM is an institution with a liberal philosophy and a faculty of almost universally liberal opinion; (3) COM is opposed to religion and possibly atheistic in its philosophy; (4) COM is primarily a trade school; (5) COM is excessively easy in its instructional programs thus making them of doubtful quality. The existence of all five perceptions were confirmed in both populations to varying degrees. No significant difference was found between populations.

The failure to give weight to variables such as number of preparations, number of students served, committee and other noninstructional assignments is usually due to the lack of a formula that will quantify the effects of these variables. Virginia Western Community College has developed two formulas for quantifying faculty workloads. One was developed by a faculty committee and the other by the Institutional Research Office. The guidelines and formulas for both models are presented, and a comparison of the formulas is conducted using actual samples of faculty workloads. Both formulas were judged as being sufficiently easy to apply, but often the workload  classification of a faculty member would depend upon which formula was used. Further study to determine the feasibility of the formulas is recommended. Sample workload calculations for thirty faculty members from various departments are appended. (Author/AH)",

Ten institutions reported that they do engage in cooperative efforts with churches through the office of community services, such as use of church facilities for extension classes, on-campus religious counseling, etc. Nine colleges reported cooperative efforts with churches through their office of student personnel services, the most prevalent of which were student  religious groups or clubs recognized by the student activities office, and space offered to the clergy for on-campus counseling activities. Religion was studied as a part of existing courses at 11 colleges, nine colleges offered specific courses in religion, but none of the 14 schools had a separate religious studies program or department. Steps taken to initiate a cooperative program between a local college and area churches are detailed. The survey questionnaire, cover letter, and an article pertaining to the church-college relationship are appended. (AH)",

This study was designed to examine the internal political structures within which the policies and procedures of assessing experiential learning were developed by other colleges, and to recommend a course of action for DCCC. Questionnaires were sent to 30 institutions belonging to the Cooperative Assessment of Experiential Learning (CAEL) Assembly; of the 15 institutions responding, six--New College of California, Northeastern Illinois University; Sterling College, Webster College, College of Saint Rose, and State Technical Institute of Memphis--were chosen for case studies. Using these case studies, plus applicable data obtained from other  respondents, the policies, procedures, and politics are summarized in terms of the following problems: Faculty Related, Business Office, Registrar, Admissions, Accrediting and Transfer, Publicity, and Obtaining a Program Director. Involvement and articulation of all parties from the earliest possible time, plus a participatory governance structure to shape and develop policy revisions, seems to be the key to early acceptance and successful development of a system of assessing experiential learning. A literature review, the six case studies, a chronological list of the steps to be taken by DCCC, the questionnaire, a summary of responses, and two tables describing program costs are also included.

        "description":"Hagerstown Community College (HCC) in Maryland has developed a number of new programs to serve clientele in the surrounding area who in most cases cannot or would not attend classes on the main campus. One such client group is the inmate population at two State prisons in the area. Programs for the inmates are selected on the basis of available associate degree job placement opportunities or ease of transfer. Evaluation of the program, based on approximately 200 participants, produces guarded optimism. The most notable finding is the positive impact of the program on the tendency of the prisoners to become recidivists. An Administration of Justice curriculum has been established at three satellite centers to serve officers from the five law enforcement jurisdictions in the HCC  area. HCC is also involved in a unique relationship with a local proprietary business college. The proprietary school has chjcabstlinesbrowardcommunitycollegebccinaachjcabstlineslines contracted HCC to provide instructional services in the areas of arts, sciences, and social sciences. A satellite center which as of Spring, 1975, had 161 enrollees is located at Fort Richie, a local military installation. HCC also participates in the Maryland College of the Air television network as a means of serving another population of non-traditional learners. The two objectives HCC hopes to reach through these programs are access and efficiency. (Author/AH)",

Respondents consisted of 52.4 percent females and 47.6 percent males. The average female respondent was 30 years old, had been employed at BCC for one or two years, was unmarried, and held an associate degree or less. The average male respondent was 40, had been employed at BCC for five or six years, was married, and held a master's degree or more. It was found that 76.9 percent of the staff respondents, 43.2 percent of the faculty respondents, and 21.1 percent of the administrative respondents were female. Results indicate that an individual's position level and age were the  strongest determinants of that person's perceptions of the status of women at BCC. Administrators indicated a more positive view of women and their abilities than did staff faculty. Staff and faculty perceived that women were receiving equitable status at BCC, whereas administrators felt that females were not being equally rewarded. Student respondents were undecided about most items. Older respondents tended to be more traditional in their opinions of what women should and should not do. Differences of opinion related to the variables of sex, education level, marital status, and length of employment at BCC were also found. (DC)",

The project is an educational effort to accelerate the development of children, 12-52 months of age, by providing developmentally enriching experiences in a controlled environment which enhances the growth of sensory, conceptual, and language abilities. Four principal components constitute the PRIDE Project: (1) The Center Early Learning Program, (2) The Home Early Learning Program, (3) The Cognitively Oriented Prekindergarten, and (4) The Parent Involvement Program. The Center Early Learning Program is the primary component of the PRIDE Project and consists of a 2-year sequence, beginning at the first level with a group  of children between 12 and 20 months of age, with participating children being brought to the center each weekday for developmental sessions with a teacher and aides. The Home Early Learning Program consists of a 2-year sequence with children 12 to 20 months of age, in which children are visited in their homes by individual tutors. The Cognitively Oriented Prekindergarten forms the third year of the center-based preschool programming and involves children previously enrolled in the Center and Home Early Learning Programs. The final component, the Parent Involvement Program, provides instruction to disadvantaged mothers in children's health care and mental development. Each of these components is discussed and evaluated in this report. (CS)",

Findings show that contrary to the principle, asynchronous emergence of stage-related skills appears to be the rule rather than the exception. Children appear to grasp the relevant relational skill before they grasp the corresponding classificatory skill: transitivity is understood before class inclusion; double seriation is understood before double classification; ordinal number before cardinal number. It is suggested that the specific asynchronies  considered are not isolated idiosyncratic phenomena but instead are part of some underlying pattern in the growth of human logic that is not yet fully understood. It may be that the ontogenesis of logical thought mirrors the axiomatic development of logic itself. (Author/CS)",

        "author":["Brainerd, Charles J."],
        "description":"This paper presents a study of the relationship between compensation and conservation in 80 children, ages 5-6. Findings are compared to those of an earlier experiment which was designed to determine whether or not prior knowledge of the compensation rule increases kindergarten children's susceptibility to conservation training experiences. It is suggested that the key finding of the first experiment (a correlation between pretraining performance on a compensation test and posttraining conservation performance) could have been an artifact of a spurious correlation between these two variables and an uncontrolled third variable (pretraining conservation performance). The previously reported experiment was replicated with the third variable controlled. Results of the present  experiment provide no support for the hypothesis that prior knowledge of compensation does not predict relative trainability. (CS)",

        "description":"The purpose of the present study was to determine whether infants categorized as demonstrating good or poor neuromuscular integrity (voluntary motor abilities reflecting movement coordination) would show differences in use of sensory motor schemas. Subjects were 26 full-term (10 males, 16 females) and 10 premature infants (6 males, 4 females) between 31 and 37 weeks of age, who were not neurologically impaired. Infants were classified for evidence of good or poor neurological integrity on the basis of their interaction with a single red cube. A total of 11 operationally defined behaviors involved in the infant's initial approach and manipulation of the cube were coded as being a good or poor response using criteria based on clinical judgment, developmental norms, and Halverson's  study of grasping. The results of this study indicate that the quality of fine motor behavior influences the way normal 8-month-old infants use objects. The evidence suggests that infants with good neuromuscular integrity tend toward greater use of manipulative schemas, while infants with poor neuromuscular integrity tend toward greater use of visual schemas.

        "description":"This report is an attempt to analyze the aggression which occurs within extended dyadic interchanges of parent and child, husband and wife, or sibling and peers. An argument is made for a \"performance\" theory of children's noxious behaviors based on the assumption that most children, exposed to modeling and reinforcing contingencies through which they learn the techniques of coercive behaviors, differ with regard to performance rates. It is proposed that it is necessary to search for the immediately impinging stimuli associated with altered probabilities in ongoing noxious behaviors. These stimuli may be found in various dyadic interchanges between the child and other family members. Studies based on across-subjects' daya are reviewed which show networks of controlling stimuli  for many noxious behaviors observed in family interactions. A pilot study using an extensive series of intraindividual data for one boy is described. The data replicated the stimulus network findings for noxious behaviors as well as the construction of response classes. The interactions between extended interchanges of response class and maintaining stimuli are described in a probability tree. The latter demonstrated the impact of the environment on the child as well as that of the child on the environment. (CS)",

        "description":"Three different socioeconomic groups of mothers were studied to determine the similarities and differences of their responses to typical behaviors of their children, aged one to four, in order to gain insight into differences in the socialization process. The three groups were: (1) black, low-income, inner-city mothers of 35 children (Group I); (2) white, upper middle-class, suburban mothers of 26 children (Group II); and (3) mothers of 14 children, whose background was blue-collar and of recent European origin (Group III). The mothers participating in the study were individually interviewed with the Implicit Parental Learning Scale (IPLET). Mothers were asked to respond to 45 items of behavior, typical for a child's age and asked to indicate whether she would encourage or  discourage the behavior or whether the behavior would make no difference to her, and then to indicate what she could actually do in response to the behavior. Analysis of maternal responses indicated that many encouraging, supportive responses were common across all classes. The differences among the three groups in maternal styles of teaching were summarized by characterizing the modes of response of Group I as physical, in Group II as cognitive, and in Group III as emotional. To help clarify the meaning of the differences in patterns, the life circumstances of each group are compared. (CS)",

A Total of 64 subjects, 8 boys and 8 girls from each of the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth grade levels, were selected from a public elementary and middle school in suburban upstate New York. Subjects were given five concrete tasks, representing each of the logical groupings studied extensively by Piaget and Irhelder: (1) primary addition of classes (class inclusion), (2) secondary addition of classes, (3) multiplication of classes, (4) asymmetrical addition of relations (seriation), and (5) multiplication of relations. Five formal tasks, representing the integrated group and  lattice, were also given: (1) flexibility of rods, (2) oscillation of a pendulum, (3) equilibrium in the balance, (4) hauling weight on an inclined plane, and (5) projection of shadows. It was tentatively concluded that cluster analysis, using these Piagetian tasks, is an effective way to identify concrete and formal operational children. Results suggest that it is possible to form groups of children which are relatively homogeneous, from a Piagetian point of view. (CS)",

Two issues are analyzed: (1) the comparative effectiveness of various types of modeling procedures for changing rule-governed behaviors, and (2) the interaction between observational learning and the developmental level of the observing child. It was concluded from this series of studies that cognitive models are more effective than exemplary models. In addition, exemplary models were found to be capable of eliciting constraint-seeking questions (which help in \"narrowing in\" on a correct answer) from children who already possessed the generalized format of such questions within their repertoires. However, exemplary models have proven to be ineffective in  provoking such questions among children lacking the covert search strategies and conceptual partitioning behaviors which go into constraint-seeking. Cognitive modeling has been effective in bringing about constraint-seeking in children who, by virtue of being in the initial phases of the transition from hypotheses-scanning to constraint-seeking, do not possess the component skills underlying constraint-seeking. Cognitive models, in addition, have effected increases not only in constraint-seeking but also in problem-solving efficiency. (CS)",

Subjects were three 13-week-old infants. Operant techniques were used to modify the general activity level of the infants with the mother serving as a social reinforcer. Infant behavior was observed and recorded under four conditions: (1) Baseline (B) (no social reinforcement); (2) Noncontingent Baseline (NCB) (social reinforcement every two and a half to five seconds regardless of infant's activity); (3) Contingent Reinforcement for Activity (CRA) (social reinforcement for any  increase in activity); and (4) Contingent Reinforcement for Non-Activity (CRNA) (social reinforcement contingent on the absence of activity for two seconds). Each CRA condition increased the frequency of activity bursts from the immediately preceding B or NCB condition, regardless of whether or not it contained social reinforcement. Data suggests that the target age for prevention/elimination of 'hyperactive' tendencies should be in early infancy. (CS)",

To modify disruptive behaviors, the aid of the child was enlisted in the preparation of videotape on \"working hard at school.\" A complex self-modeling technique was employed which involved a combination of modeling by the teacher, instructions and reinforcement from the teacher, reinforcement from peers, and vicarious reinforcement. It was expected that the combination  of these behavior change variables would produce a change in behavior, and as a result, an improvement in self-esteem.

Also investigated were developmental trends, including expected superiority of older children in recall and spontaneous formation of stable organizational groupings. A third area of study concerned the possibility that younger children benefit more than older children from induced organizational strategies. Subjects were 48 male and female public school students from the second and fifth grades. The children were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions which varied with the two different sets of instructions regarding categorization and recall. Results are presented for recall scores on the first recall test, recall over trials, subjective organization, and sorting  consistency. The results indicate that instructions to maintain spatially consistent categories and higher recall over trials were effective in producing more consistent categories and higher recall over trials for children of seven and ten years. A positive relationship between consistency in sorting, recall, and number of intertrial repetitions is suggested by the results and while instructions to maintain consistent categories seem to be an important factor, the possibility that the presence of a spatial cue also influenced obtained results cannot be overlooked.

Background information on the project describes the ideological basis of such a program, the importance of including parents in their children's education, basic assumptions and goals of the project and preliminary fieldwork. The project focused on getting teachers and parents of disadvantaged children together as equal participants in the children's education. Interviewers obtained pre- and post-group participation reactions from both teachers and parents. Analysis of these reactions is presented both quantitatively and qualitatively. Attitudes studied included those of  teachers toward themselves, their profession, their classroom children and the children's parents; and those of the parents toward their children's education and their own feelings of self worth. Generally, the parent-teacher discussion group approach seemed to bridge cultural gaps which had existed between parents and teachers. Portions of transcripts of both interviews and group sessions are included, as well as an outline of topics used in the discussions. (ED)",

        "description":"The two studies reported here investigate the impact of prosocial TV programs and rehearsal techniques on children's learning or acquisition of program content and on performance of behavioral adoption. Subjects for the studies were 73 kindergarten boys and girls who were predominantly middle and lower class. The children saw four 'Mr. Rogers' programs or four neutral programs on consecutive school days. Each of the four television programs was followed by a 15-20 minute training session. Two types of rehearsal were explored for children who saw the prosocial television programs: verbal labeling and role playing. Two principal measures were designed to evaluate learning of program content: (1) a Content Test (36 items with two alternatives each) administered on the last day of  television viewing and training, and (2) a Puppet measure which provided an index of the child's verbalization of program themes. In the second study, a measure was taken of the children's inclination to engage in helping behavior in an actual experimentally controlled classroom situation. An overview of study findings indicated these conclusions: (1) Both types of training (verbal labeling and role playing) following prosocial television enhanced learning and performance of prosocial content; (2) Verbal labeling had greatest impact on verbal measures, particularly learning for girls; (3) Role playing was more effective, particularly for boys, in facilitating the performance of nonverbal helping behavior; and (4) The combined training condition often led to elevated scores for both sexes.

The characteristic psychological reactions of the child are described in terms of guilt, rejection failure, resentment, anxiety, self concept, self pity, and hostility. Suggestions are given for the parent and teacher to help children adjust to the divorce situation in a sound and healthy way. The necessity for adult preparation and emotional support of the child is emphasized. Guidelines that are important in explaining divorce to the child are outlined, along with several possible responses a child may feel when false explanations of parent absence are given. Individual case studies illustrate how children can be helped and counseled during and following divorce situations. The  manner in which the child is prepared, counseled, and worked with during the divorce situation is a determining factor in a child's adjustment. (CS)",

A Central Joint Committee for Pre-schools will be set up to advise both the Board of Health and Welfare and the Board of Education. Within the individual municipalities, pre-school activities are to be the responsibility of the central social services committee, although, according to the government bill, the various forms of pre-school activity will be guided by a uniform educational approach. The approach is based on interplay and cooperation between children and adults, children and children, and adults and adults. A description of the organizational model, as set by  the 1968 Commission on Child Centres, includes discussions of full- and part-time pre-schools, the staff team, the latest available statistics on enrollment, projected expansion figures, and commissions appointed to review the conditions of pre-school children.

After each goal is identified, the importance and relationship of the goal to  current classroom kindergarten practices is discussed. It is suggested that the contemporary kindergarten using these four goals as a procedural framework can provide for the maximum growth of the 5-year-old child. Educators are urged to reexamine their goals in order to guard against one-dimensional planning in kindergarten programs. (CS)",

A major assumption to be tested is that exploratory children function more effectively in open classrooms. Other information to be documented includes: (1) different patterns of functioning; (2) the changes in functioning patterns over time; and (3) teacher interaction with more and less exploratory children. Supplementary investigation will focus on sex differences and socioeconomic differences in open classroom behavior. The project is planned to extend from September 1973 through December 1975 and will involve the study of 60 first graders  identified as exhibiting a high or low level of curiosity and exploratory behavior through teacher rankings and individual sessions. The majority of the data to be analyzed will be collected through intensive classroom observation. Main variables to be examined include involvement with materials and activities, teacher-student relationships and interaction patterns, peer relationships, experience of mastery, and pleasure and involvement in the classroom experience.

Chapter Three briefly explores parent expectations for school-age child care programs as expressed in interviews with parents conducted during a larger study of Region X child care services. Chapter Four presents some of the important planning considerations in developing school-age care programs, while Chapter Five sets out several general models for school-age care programs which combine the most successful  features of existing programs with various other cost-saving features. These recommended models for school-age care programs are: (1) Recreation and Leisure Time Program Coordination Model, (2) Community School Based Model, (3) Family Day Care Services Coordination Model, (4) Family Day Care Home/Neighborhood Parks Model for Full Day Summer School-Age Care, and (5) Residential Cluster Model with \"Cultural Enrichment\" Cmponents.

The study is subdivided into four parts: (1) some principles in Piaget's system (the epigenetic principle, the genetic circle, and the decalage concept) are discussed in relation to language development; (2) the basic psychological functions of Piaget's theory are briefly summarized in their relationship to both cognitive and linguistic development; (3) the concept of structures or schemes as described by Piaget are examined with regard to their relevance to linguistic structures; and (4) the preverbal development of several classes of contents or concepts and their early  verbal equivalents are explored. Close parallels are demonstrated between aspects of cognitive development theory and the independently established principles of language development. Since the phenomena of cognitive development appears prior to language acquisition, and since close analogies between both developments are evident, it is concluded that the prior cognitive acquisitions form the bases and molds for later linguistic advances.

Current criticisms of Piagetian theory and associated educational recommendations are reviewed and it is concluded that adopting a genuine Piagetian perspective conveys mixed blessings upon the aspirant educational innovator. The major valid principles which may be derived from the Piagetian system include: (1) an awareness of intellectual product/process distinctions, (2)  a recognition of the crucial role of play activities, social interaction, and associated peer group processes, and (3) the essential stipulation of self-initiated active involvement as the primary determinant of intellectual development. The third principle provides the fundamental continuity between Piaget's views and the numerous open classroom and self-discovery learning approaches to educational innovation. (Author/CS)",

        "description":"Trait-Treatment Interaction (TTI), a research method for observing experimental effects of treatments on subjects of different aptitudes and learning characteristics, is suggested as an effective evaluation tool to provide evaluators and educators in compensatory education programs with information about which program is best for different kinds of learners. The premise of TTI research is that different instructional conditions work best when matched with selected learner traits, with \"trait\" defined as any characteristic of the learner that increases or impairs his probability of success in a given treatment. The methodology of Trait-Treatment Interaction (TTI) as outlined provides an alternative of the dilemma of control groups; and a proposed evaluation design is presented  using Campbell's terminology of invited-accepted, invited-rejected, and uninvited. To tap the interaction of learner characteristics with instruction, the invited-accepted are tested and blocked or grouped on relevant learner characteristics, and then, within each block, randomly assigned to a treatment. The goal of this TTI factorial design is to develop alternative instructional programs for compensatory education which produce optimal educational payoff among pupils assigned differently to these programs on the basis of learner characteristics.

Facets of child behavior were examined during the period of single-word utterances and early multiword combinations with a view to elucidating certain cognitive aspects of early language. The temporal sequencing of development in these areas was analyzed and compared in five females aged 14-19 months. The infants, observed monthly in the home for 40-minute periods over a 1-year span, were presented with a standard set of toys and engaged in free play and conversation with their mothers. These sessions were videotaped, and language and play were analyzed. Study findings  indicated consistent patterns of vocal imitative behavior and symbolic development. Symbolic play level was predictive of linguistic behavior. The use of language to code precursors of operational intelligence was remarkably consistent for all children observed. It is suggested that cognitive skills developed during the sensorimotor period form the foundation for these patterns of development. (CS)",

Manpower policies dealing with the economic opportunity of residents of rural, nonfarm areas often overlook two important aspects of the problem: (1) Uniform national, monetary, and fiscal policies at the Federal level, and specific policies dealing directly with individual households and firms at the local level, leap-frog over the regional, multicounty dimensions of the problem. (2) Policies often depend on indirect routes of attack with a consequent favorable multiplier effect. For example, we promote growth in centers of economic activity and hope for multiplicative benefits in  the hinterlands. Manpower policies need to be evaluated in terms of actual and anticipated impacts on: (1) the overall national economic climate; (2) individual firms and households; (3) geographically dispersed populations; and (4) the community facilities and institutions of the economic region in which the target group lives, shops, and works. Manpower policies need to be implemented with an understanding of the regional variations in unemployment and underemployment pointing more directly to target populations and relying less on indirect policies with hoped-for benefits.

Although some were conceived and conducted for purposes other than the analysis of status attainment processes, a powerful synthesizing perspective would be to treat them as studies of components of incomplete general attainment models. This study focused on the stability of and the mutual dependency between occupational and educational achievement attitudes. Path analytic techniques for two-variable panel analyses developed by Heise (1970) were combined with data collected in a three-wave panel of nonmetropolitan Southern youth over a 6-year period (1966-72). This modeling technique was applied alternately to occupational aspirations and expectations, educational aspirations and  expectations, occupational aspiration level, and educational aspiration level. The same variable observed at each wave was treated as hypothetically different variables. Some findings were: (1) mean aspirations measures at each wave were consistently larger than the corresponding expectational measures; (2) from the statistical perspective of simple prediction, prior levels of achievement attitudes yielded a moderate prediction level of subsequent measures; and (3) post-high school projections were considerably more stable than projections observed during high school.

Focus was on whether industrialization comes in different phases and whether its impact on the rural poor varies during each phase. Nonmetro labor markets (counties more than 50 miles from the central city of a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area--SMSA) of the South and Indiana were compared. Data were collected through: (1) statistical time-series (mainly the &quot;Census of Manufactures&quot; and the &quot;Census of Population&quot;) and (2) field interviews. In each of six multicounty areas (selected because their nonfarm employment had either grown very rapidly in the 1960's or they had both &quot;success&quot; and stagnating counties)  industrial development and antipoverty workers were interviewed in July and August 1974 on the process of industrial development and impact on the poor in their area. Some findings were: (1) distinct stages existed in industrial characteristics, poverty impact, immigration, and community industrial planning; (2) two phases of industrial development were low-wage and labor-intensive and medium-wage and less labor-intensive; and (3) the two phases of industrialization differed in poverty impact--a greater percentage of workers hired were poor in the first phase than in the second.

In each school the committee made several observation visits; interviewed students, teachers, administrators, and parents; and analyzed school documents. In general the committee concluded that the Cincinnati Public Schools have failed to meet the educational needs of many Appalachian children, since teachers reflected little knowledge regarding student heritage; counselors and administrators anticipated only 50 to  70 percent of the Appalachian students would finish high school; students expressed anxiety about moving from one school to the next; and there was little evidence of district concern for Appalachian students. Committee recommendations included: more inservice programs emphasizing heritage awareness; special minicourses emphasizing the unique heritage of the urban Appalachian student; development of articulation programs designed to ease the transition from one school to another; eradication of the prevailing educational/vocational assumptions about Appalachian students; and the development of better home/school relationships.

        "description":"Situated on the Sierra Madre's western slope is Zacapoaxtla, one of the 222 municipios in the State of Puebla, Mexico. From prehispanic times, Zacapoaxtla has been a &quot;region de refugio&quot; where groups of American Indians cluster, isolate themselves from the rest of the world, and maintain their cultural traditions insofar as the national economic and political organization permits. To the south of Zacapoaxtla is the village of Xalacapan, the largest and oldest village of the entire municipio. Nahuat is still the most prevalent Indian language spoken. Yet, during the last decade, there has been a considerable reduction in the number of monolinguals in Indian languages and an increase of bilinguals in an Indian language and Spanish. The rural schools in the State of Puebla have a  long history of interventions by civil and religious authorities concerned with the education of the Indians. From the revolution in the second decade of the 20th century, through the years of Cardenas' socialist regime, to the enthusiastic literacy campaigns of the 1940's there have been dramatic changes in the village life and in the school. This ethnographic study describes the rural school in the Nahuat village of Xalacapan in Zacapoaxtla. The school's history from 1893 through 1973 is discussed. (NQ)",

Each place was designated as growing, declining, or stable. Of the 118 growing and declining places, 52 grew and 66 declined. Correlation between growth and decline of Texas' NMI places and size of place and the geographic variables of urban influence, accessibility, and regional location were then examined. NMI places were further classified into regions, and regional growth patterns were examined using four declining and three  growing regions. Findings were: (1) places remote from the Interstate Highway System tended to decline; (2) location in close proximity to a growing urban center favored growth; (3) places with relatively high proportions of their labor force engaged in manufacturing tended to grow, while those with agricultural and mining industries tended to decline. Using the three labor factors and two geographic factors, predictions for 1960-70 growth were made and then tested against actual changes. As prediction accuracy was 70 percent, predictions were also made for 1970-80. (JC)",

The commission sponsored the first Arizona Indian Water Rights Conference to discuss water rights which affect Indian reservations. Attending the conference were tribal leaders, State and Federal  government officials, and leaders of State and national Indian organizations. Tribal leaders from the Ak-Chin, Camp Verde, Colorado River Tribes, Fort McDowell, Navajo, Hualapai, Kaibab-Paiute, Fort Mohave, Salt River, Fort Yuma, and Gila River Indian Reservations discussed their status on water rights. Legislation and other areas of concern on the national level which affect Arizona tribes were also discussed. This report presents the discussions held at the conference. (NQ)",

Outdoor education is being used as an educational experience related to and involved with all segments of the curriculum. The rapid growth of the junior/community college has resulted in an increase in the variety and number of physical education programs (both required and elective) which are helping to educate students to love, enjoy, care for the outdoors and preserve the physical environment. Survey questionnaires were sent to 113 2-year colleges listed by the Blue Book of Junior College Athletics for Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Of the 67 responses, 49 offered programs in outdoor education. This survey indicated current  developments in college education and organizational patterns of college systems utilizing a variety of outdoor education activities in their physical education and recreational programs. For example, at Dean Junior College, activities are presented as part of an elective general service program for nonmajors with skill and technique courses for physical education and recreation majors.

Group interviews were used with procedures varying according to physical facilities of the schools involved and the administrators' decisions. In 1972-73, 16 schools were selected from the original sample which would best represent the original sample. There were 5,396 questionnaires returned in 1966-67 and 3,122 in 1972-73. Among the findings were: (1) the proportion giving a high ranking to  getting married and raising a family increased for black and white males and black females but decreased from 34.1 percent to 30 percent for white females; (2) the average number of children wanted decreased from 1967 to 1973 for both racial groups and sexes; (3) there was a marked increase in the percentage of sophomores indicating that they expected to have no children; and (4) there was a decrease in the percentage of all race and sex groups except black males indicating that they expected to have three or more children.

It seeks to strengthen and stabilize tribal governments while continuing to maintain and fulfill its trust responsibilities. BIA trust responsibilities consist of protecting the Indians' land, water, minerals, forests, and other resources. Some positive accomplishments regarding these responsibilities have been the three-stage format for inventorying water resources affecting reservations; the Catalog of Rights Issues, which identifies a multitude of Indian rights problems; the Menominee Restoration; and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.  In the area of education, new initiatives are emerging such as more community involvement. Indian services provided by the BIA include: (1) the Tribal Government Development Program, which encourages the growth of self-determination by using program funds to establish effective tribal governments; (2) the implementation of the court decision which restored the off-reservation fishing rights of 14 tribes in western Washington State; (3) housing for Alaska Natives; (4) faster action on roll appeals; and (5) development of tribal resources, such as setting up new enterprises and expanding old ones.

The basic premise behind this 4 year college program is identified as &quot;belief that persons native to a community and trained in that community are best prepared to teach in it&quot;, since these students learn while they teach in 10 rural Native villages, though their course work is derived from Anchorage (University of Alaska and Alaska Methodist University). Evidence of the need for ARTTC is attributed to increasing demand for localization of Alaska's 4 entity educational system (the Alaska State Operated School System; the Bureau of Indian Affairs Schools; city schools; and borough schools) and demand for Native rather than white teachers, since traditionally there have  been few trained Native teachers, the ARTTC program having only recently (1972) graduated 23 of its 54 participants. Weak and sometimes unrelated education courses, the distant professor (Anchorage), and communication and cost problems are cited as program weaknesses. Program strengths are identified as use of: a cross-cultural curriculum, a community based program, an external degree design built around a learning team, and a combination of Native and non-Native peoples working together in small learning groups based on the team leader role.

        "description":"After the fur trade reached the Ojibwa during the early 17th Century, tribe structure and function rapidly changed. The intensity of social life increased as the Ojibwa and neighboring tribes gathered to exchange fur pelts for European items. Trade became so important that intertribal hostilities arose and an almost unrestrictive slaughter of animals occurred. Ceremonials included great quantities of surplus goods which were exchanged or destroyed at multitribal gatherings. As beaver declined, they found it increasingly difficult to procure sufficient quantities to obtain trade supplies. In order to survive, the Ojibwa were forced to adapt to a hare and fish subsistence. Neither these resources nor the trapping requirements allowed for the maintenance of large hunting groups  characteristic of former years. The altered environment and external conditions of trade tended to mold the nature of social groups while setting limits on their size and the extent of territory which they could &quot;exploit.&quot; The functional basis of unilineal society was destroyed. The Ojibwa had to readjust their adaptive strategies to conform with survival requirements. In most cases, they chose survival under deprived conditions over extinction. Faced with the need to adapt to a situation where only survival was the reward, they showed flexibility in altering subsistence style, organizational networks, and cultural motifs so as to exist and expand.

        "description":"Recognizing the persistence of the cultural underlay permeating West Virginians' life styles today, this study determined: (1) which cultural values identified with Appalachian culture are endorsed by West Virginia Extension Agents and reflected in their work; (2) which of these cultural values reflect a distinctive Appalachian subculture; and (3) the extent to which endorsement of these values is associated with effectiveness in extension work. The reflection and endorsement of 9 selected Appalachian cultural values (familism, neighborliness, love of home place, individualism, personalism, Modesty, being one's self, sense of humor, religion) in educational programming of extension agents were assessed is West Virginia (an Appalachian state), North Dakota (a rural state), and New  Jersey (an urban state). Field agents in the 3 states were given a Kluckholn type questionnaire and a Likert type attitudinal scale. Comparison of means, frequencies, and percentages of response to the instruments were utilized for analysis of differences between states and groups within states. Some findings were: (1) West Virginia agents were sensitive to and endorsed Appalachian cultural values, especially the individualism cluster; and (2) differences in the endorsement of Appalachian cultural values among the 3 states' agents indicated the continued existence of an Appalachian subculture.

        "description":"The proposition that Appalachian religion persists because it is performing a significant function as a mechanism helping the adjustment of people who due to modern changes, have become dislocated socially, economically, and psychologically was tested. Religiosity was defined on the basis of 4 variables: (1) religious beliefs; (2) need to use religion as a buffer to the outside world; (3) preference of religion as a way of life; and (4) church participation. Also tested were 3 sets of hypotheses dealing with: (1) the 4 religiosity aspects and socioeconomic and sociopsychological dimensions; (2) the sectarian, non-sectarian dichotomy; and (3) religiosity and community size and migration to the city. Approximately 1,100 male household heads from Mineral, Hardy, and Raleigh counties  in West Virginia were interviewed. Clusters from the counties were selected on the basis of community size; region of state (mining, non-mining, northern and southern part of the state); and socioeconomic status. The hypothesis that the dispossessed, deprived, and alienated resulting from the upheaval of social and technological change in Appalachia would be those exhibiting the greatest need for the support of religion, was substantiated by the data. The aged, poor, less educated, alienated and infirm, all ranked significantly higher in religiosity than did the socially well-adjusted. (NQ)",

        "description":"Several things need to be considered when designing a bilingual curriculum for and with the Navajo community. The major consideration should be the involvement of Navajo parents and the leadership of Navajo school boards. The curriculum should be developed from the Navajo point of view about their world. Designers of a bilingual education curriculum also need to consider the: (1) community's makeup, aspirations, goals, and needs; (2) skills, attitudes, values, and goals which the community desires for its students; (3) school community relationship; (4) school's relationship with external agencies (i.e., the State, Tribe, Bureau of Indian Affairs); and (5) Tribe's attitude toward bilingual bicultural education. Curriculum designers should have some data which reflect the  bilingual program's intensity; whether this intensity would require them to reflect a goal of uniliterateness or promote biliterateness; and whether the program and, therefore, the curriculum would promote full bilingualism. When designing the curriculum, the Navajo calendar, importance of the home, cultural behavior differences, and teacher qualifications must be taken into account. This paper focuses on the educational process developed within the Rough Rock Demonstration School, a community based educational program on the Navajo Reservation in northeastern Arizona. (NQ)",

At one extreme of the dimension were inner cities of greater metropolitan areas; at the other extreme were totally rural counties without direct proximity to a metropolitan center. The socioeconomic characteristics of each county were compared for 1970 and for 1960-70 trends. Comparisons were made of the differences between the total population and the minority population as to: (1) the limitations imposed by the age and education structures; (2) the employment opportunities they offer; and (3) their incomes and economic prosperity. Socioeconomic characteristics examined included population distribution and growth, age, sex, family structures, geographic mobility, education, labor force  participation, occupational status, income, and incidence of poverty. Data were collected from the 1960 and 1970 Censuses of Population. Counties were grouped into 10 residence categories to delineate them into metro and nonmetro categories by size of the metro area of which each metro county is a part, and by number of urban residents and geographic proximity to a metro area for rural areas. Findings indicated that the population of totally rural nonmetro counties, compared with that of other counties, had a relatively low level of current socioeconomic status and future potential.

Means emphasized were: (1) environment  contrast; (2) physical activity; (3) the intentional use of stress; (4) a small group context; and (5) the employment of newly acquired knowledge and skills. Major goals were identified as (1) enhancing self-concepts; (2) understanding the self, with special emphasis on identification of strengths; (3) reorientation toward aesthetic appreciation and environmental awareness; (4) an understanding of leadership, the use of authority and followership; and (5) internalization.

Family planning associations, affiliated with the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), have been organized in 29 Latin American countries. The Victor-Bostrom Fund has provided millions of dollars annually to IPPF; and with the base provided by these funds and private contributions, IPPF has obtained support from 13 governments and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. This report consists of a series of articles related to population and family planning in Latin American America. Among the topics discussed are: The Demographic Explosion in Latin  America; The Significance of the World Population Conference; The UNFPA in Latin America; Teaching Demography in Medical Schools; Mexico Chooses Family Planning; Family Planning: Hope for a Nation; Ethical and Religious Aspects of Family Planning; Oral Contraceptives; and Venezuelan Family Planning; Winning Government Support.

As a result of this, most students have little knowledge of natural resources and their management. Since these students are the future decision-makers of the country, it is important that they have an understanding of the environment and its interaction with all factors, natural or man-made. It is because of this concern for the future that this activity guide was developed. The activities in the guide include a variety of disciplines including science, math, art, communications, and social studies. Designed for teachers, the guide includes a rationale for the process and problem-solving approach to learning that is used in  these activities, and gives a detailed explanation as to its most effective usage in the development of lesson plans. Most of the activities, with some modification, can be adapted for most grade levels, though they are appropriate for older students in original form.

Seven goals were proposed, among them were  establishment of an environmental education coordinating committee, developing and implementing pre- and in-service environmental education programs for all teachers, and requiring all schools to establish outdoor laboratories. Procedures for the implementation of the goals and priorities for implementation are considered. (TK)",

In the latter, students were placed in groups of four members; half of all class time was devoted to teacher presentation of material, and the other half to group activities. The members of a group were encouraged to cooperate with each other by dividing assignments, peer teaching and other techniques. Groups competed against each other for test scores (groups were given scores equal to the sum of the members' scores). The investigator found no significant difference in achievement between students  in traditional and experimental classrooms. Changes in attitudes toward mathematics, and the effective interaction of groups varied between groups. (SD)",

The main thrust of the project has been to develop materials for teachers of mathematically uninvolved students, with emphasis on performance levels equivalent to grades six through nine. The purpose of this conference was to receive reactions and recommendations from a broad spectrum of people, including directors and staff members of previous curriculum projects, supervisory level personnel from various cities, practicing teachers, mathematicians, scientists, and educators. Conference plans included five initial working groups on: content, applications, diagnosis and evaluation, didactics, and teacher utilization. This report includes an initial position paper on each topic, along with subsequent recommendations. Also included are recommendations made by secondary working groups established during the conference on the topics: organization and staffing policy, format and style, problem solving, calculators, and computers.

A review of related literature concerning readability scales and the Romey Index is included. Thirty secondary science texts were evaluated using the Fry Readability Graph and Romey's Involvement Index. The resulting data included expected grade placement of the text, calculated reading average level, reading level range and Romey Involvement Level. The results indicated a considerable range of readability level within some textbooks as well as from one text to another. Evidence also indicated that a few texts had readability levels consistently equal to or less than the grade level recommendation while some had readability levels ranging  into the college level. The Romey Index of Involvement appeared to be a valid measure of the inquiry orientation of textbooks because of the consistency of the results. (Author/BR)",

The inservice followup project involved 14 participants who lived within a 75 mile radius of the university and concerned applying the knowledge, skills, and model gained during the summer institute and then reporting the results. Participants developed instructional units consisting of specific performance objectives, pre- posttests, and teaching strategies appropriate for meeting the needs of the students in their local school  systems. Statistical analysis of the pre- posttests provided evidence concerning the amount of learning that had taken place. Additional data were obtained by applying a t-test to individual paired pre- posttest scores. Results indicated that statistically significant learning by students had taken place using the model and that this model could be applied where educational accountability is important. (Author/BR)",

There is a need to conceptualize and understand the differential boundaries between natural and social systems. Three types of problems to be dealt with range from cultural perceptions of nature, to attempts to regulate and manipulate the environment, to questions about the receptivity of various groups to new technologies. Habits of thought need to be challenged in the area of how to interpret change. Many research questions must look into the future for long term changes and solutions encompassing a century or more, rather than limited time-frames of years and decades. This more evolutionary time-frame requires new  and different concepts and units of analysis. For example, when climate is examined in a longer-term perspective major changes are found within the last 1000 years along with important variations within centuries. In addition, today's science and technology must not be recognized as universal, neutral, and value free but as a product of western culture. Some priorities for future environmental studies include the conscious attempt to place research in a larger overall time span and to become sensitive to the various cultural interpretations of science and technology.

This book focuses on alleviating the problem, making the choice easier for users of values materials. Chapter one describes a typology or classification scheme consisting of five values education approaches--inculcation, moral development, analysis, clarification, and action learning--and explains each in terms of its rationale and purpose, teaching methods and instructional model, an illustrative learning activity, and characteristic curriculum materials and programs. Chapter two presents and explains an original instrument for analyzing values education  materials in terms of their descriptive characteristics, rationale and objectives, preconditions and usability, content, procedures and activities, and evaluation. Educators can use this multiple-choice/short-answer framework to obtain in-depth analyses of values education materials. Summaries of analyses of 13 sets of materials are included, each reflecting one of the five values education approaches. The third and final chapter is an extensive, mostly annotated bibliography of over 200 student curriculum materials, teacher guides, and theoretical background materials in values education available through commercial publishers and/or the ERIC system, and classified according to the approach they primarily reflect.

Part 1 surveys the literature on attitude formation in four methodological categories: prescriptive teaching strategies; pre/post, quasi-experimental test approach; content analysis; and experimental method approach. Special attention is given to the last two methodologies. The section on content analysis includes matrices to describe five studies on the content of social studies curriculum materials. The section on experimental method in information integration, which seeks to determine the conditions leading to attitude change, concentrates on an analysis of a state adopted textbook dealing with China in order to isolate concrete examples of attitudinal and  contextual values. Part 2 of the report describes the application of information integration theory to a study that isolates and quantifies student attitudes influenced by attitudinal and contextual values in social studies materials. The results of this study show that student impressions are functions of the cumulation of value loaded materials. These results underscore the importance of balanced messages in curriculum material and of teaching basic critical skills.

The farmer is frustrated in his attempts to persuade his children to continue his life's work, the study and accumulation of a pile of manure. Trying to instill in his children his knowledge of the pile he ignores the processes of \"doing\" and \"being.\" In a second ending to the parable the farmer reflects on his own learning process and sees that his is not the master of a body of knowledge so much as a creator of his own understanding. This  time the farmer is able to teach his children by valuing and stimulating their unique styles of understanding. He, in turn, becomes for his children the model of a competent man, as they see him take in and benefit from his experiences with them.

        "description":"Public education cannot be considered an efficient alternative to industrial pollution abatement. The public education alternative stresses that an informed non-industrial public will, out of civic responsibility, bring about sufficient social pressure on the industrial sector to end pollution. However, evidence suggests that the mere presence of pollution does not guarantee salient awareness by the public-at-large. Greater dissemination of public information as a remedy to unawareness becomes inhibited by such factors as a communication gap between scientific and lay publics, incompleteness of biophysical data, and a reluctance on the part of government officials to release known information. The frequent lack of civic responsibility in the general public is caused by  differential perceptions of \"crises,\" variability in adaptation to pollution, and various factors which surround public pessimism. Other alternatives need to be studied which call for greater coordinated planning and implementation by public leaders. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"This research report presents the results of a study to determine the influence of significant others upon adolescent levels of aspiration. High school sophomores in a central Wisconsin community responded to an instrument testing ego, ego's perception of significant others' expectations, and occupational aspiration. The two hypotheses under study included the relative influence of significant others on levels of aspiration and an individual ego's perceptions of significant others' influence as a better predictor of levels of aspiration than actual expectations by significant others. The findings indicate that the more influence one is subjected to, the higher the correspondence between aspirationally-relevant content of that influence and one's own aspirations. A summary of the  findings for the second hypothesis indicates that perceptions of informational inputs are comparatively better predictors of levels of aspiration. The implication of this study is that the \"total picture\" of interpersonal influence on status aspirations is incomplete and more research is needed. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The idea of using groups, rather than individuals, as the basic building blocks for an organization is suggested in this paper. Although this idea is not new in theory, it is new in practice. To design an organization from scratch around groups appears to violate the American value of individualism. Groups, however, have advantages over individuals by providing support in time of crisis, being more innovative, making better decisions, gaining commitment of members, controlling individual members, and providing identity in a large organization. To design an organization around groups, one would follow the same procedure as with individuals in hiring, training, paying, promoting, designing jobs, and firing. Possible disadvantages that need to be considered include the increase in  negotiation time, the need for better arbitration mechanisms, escape hatches for individuals, the possibility of alienating creative highly individualistic people, the competitive conflict between groups, the leadership of the group, and the possibility that groups will become so cohesive they will be closed to new input. Yet the advantages in potential increased productivity offset the inherent disadvantages. (Author/DE)",

The described materials are available from Oxford University Press. These consist of large fold-out sheets with information, photographs, drawings, and charts; two teachers' guides that provide background information and suggested activities; and sets of slides depicting artwork from several historical periods. The developers see these materials as &quot;resource banks&quot; from which the student and his teacher can move on to further research or library work. The first unit, Exploration Man, stresses exploring oneself and one's environment and locale. The second unit, Communicating with  Others, blends the arts and humanities with the social sciences and stresses visual literacy. The third unit, Living Together, calls for cross-cultural comparisons between one's own society, a modern technological culture, two island societies of Tresten de Cunha and the Dayaks, and the historical civilization of Imperial China. This comparative approach focuses on cultural institutions that include home, family, education, law, technology, belief system, and arts. (Author/DE)",

Followup assessments also showed an increased familiarity with the Social Science Education Consortium's Curriculum Materials Analysis System (CMAS), The Educational Resources Information Center Clearinghouse for Social Studies (ERIC/ChESS), and the Social Studies Curriculum Guidelines developed by the National Council for the Social Studies. When asked about general attitudes toward  the workshop, new information gained, and impressions of workshop activities, the participants were equally positive in the posttest and followup. When queried about dissemination activities and implementation of new curriculum, 14 out of 18 of the administrators indicated positive activities in the followup questionnaire.

It is world geography with a planetary perspective--an inquiry into the nature of the planet and its dominant species, Homo Sapiens. Seven units cover the following topics on physical and human aspects of our world: astronomical perspectives; the place of earth in space and time; natural characteristics--relief, climate, and vegetation; population density and distribution factors affecting it; the needs of people; quality of life indices; economic diversity; factors affecting the diversity from an historical perspective; and future trends. The subtopics of the themes described in the course are to be filled out through  the mutual exploration of the students and teacher. Emphasis in the course is placed on individual research, creative thought, and participation in group discussion for which students are expected to keep a diary. Suggested with each unit are a variety of films; activities, particularly involving globe work; and various forms of role-play, often using the theme of a spaceship approaching the earth. Sources of films and factual data and for the global orientation are cited. (JH)",

A definite trend toward specifically including ethics and logic offers a starting point for a philosophy course as part of the general curriculum or as a separate course of study. The author begins by presenting a general analysis of the recent interest in grade school philosophy. Next he discusses the role of research in determining the suitability of philosophy as part of the grade school curriculum suggesting that a philosophy course could make a significant and lasting improvement in general academic performance. Two experiments utilizing philosophy for pedagogical purposes are currently being conducted in New Jersey and Texas. Taking stock of what is going on today, a  breakthrough of philosophy into the elementary school curriculum has occurred. Key factors in the breakthrough include the writing of the first work in children's philosophy and the founding of the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children--its publications program, curriculum development, teacher training, and research projects. Suggestions for the future of elementary school philosophy are also presented. (JR)",

A lack of reasoning ability among children is perceived and several causes are suggested -- among them a reliance on reading, math, and science as vehicles for reasoning, emphasis on problem solving rather than the preliminaries of questioning, and complacency regarding the development of reasoning because of the \"inevitability\" of development implied by Piagetian research. To allow children to perceive themselves capable of reasoning, instruction in reasoning for fifth graders is proposed. Instruction combining a discovery model and a context of \"important\" ideas is suggested. Part two of the report describes the experiment. A pilot  group of 10-year-olds, taught twice a week for nine weeks using the story, \"Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery,\" (SO 008 127), is tested against a control group. Instruction consists of reading, discussion, some role playing, and use of a video tape machine. Posttesting shows an advance by the pilot group over the control group in logical thinking and in mental maturity. A second study testing the same two groups indicates a significantly positive effect on the reading scores of the pilot group over the control group 2 1/2 years later, suggesting the long lasting effect of the teaching of logic and the need to replicate the experiment.

The methodology casts the teacher as a facilitator whose primary task is stimulating children to reason about their own problems. The discussion process with hints and guides for the teacher is emphasized. Through the process the teacher tries to bring children to perceive the points of view of others and to give reasons for their own opinions. Prerequisite conditions that the teacher needs to establish for fruitful discussion include avoidance of indoctrination, respect for children's opinions, and evocation of children's trust. Among the aims for the teaching of philosophical thinking are improvement of  reasonging ability, development of creativity, and personal development. Another goal that makes philosophical thinking a conscience activity is discovering the tools of philosophical thinking -- alternatives, impartiality, consistency, reasons for beliefs, comprehensiveness, and contextual factors. &quot;Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery&quot; (SO 008 127) is the children's story to be used as a springboard for philosophical discussion.

The story is set among a classroom of children who begin to understand the basics of logical reasoning when Harry, who isn't paying attention in class, says that a comet is a planet because he remembers hearing that comets revolve around the sun just as planets do. The events that follow in the classroom and outside of school are a recreation of the ways that children might find themselves thinking and acting. The story is a teaching model; non-authoritarian, and anti-indoctrinating, it respects the value of inquiry and reasoning, encourages the development of  alternative modes of thought and imagination, and suggests how children are able to learn from one another. Further, it sketches what it might be like to live and participate in a small community where children have their own interests, yet respect each other as people, and are capable at times of engaging in cooperative inquiry for no other reason than the satisfaction of doing so.

An individualized instructional approach is emphasized with a pupil/teacher ratio of less than ten to one. Community volunteers teach the more than 160 course offerings per year such as &quot;Messing Around with Plants,&quot;&quot;Can I See your Drivers License?&quot; and &quot;Coming of Age in America.&quot; Credit can also be earned through student volunteer work in community projects such as a community health clinic. Courses are offered on the basis of student  interest and teacher availability. Some 40-45 percent of the course offerings are held in various locations throughout the city. Student performance is evaluated with personal narrative reports from teachers, rather than the traditional letter or number grades. An independent evaluation team continually evaluates the program and indicates success in the program. (Author/JR)",

Although game theory provides a useful tool for the explanation of rational alternatives in given social situations, it should not replace humanistic inquiry. \"Good\" decision-making in game theory usually focuses on the use of cost-benefit models of rationality to maximize the players best interest, regardless of whether it is morally correct to act in that way. However, the most significant questions are not those concerned with finding the best means to an end, but of reconciling and deciding among the ends or goals themselves. Another problem concerns the assignment of numerical costs to the payoffs. The fact remains that prior  numerical measurements cannot be assigned with finality to human behavior. Students may fail to realize that game theory concerns itself with means and not ends, and that real social problems are much more complex and comprehensive. Since game theory models fail to consider the social implications of decision making, an effort must be made to examine social decisions from a humanistic perspective. It is more important for the student to knowthat his decision is a function of his conviction rather than expediency. (Author/DE)",

The intent of the paper is to alert social studies teachers to the responsibility of bridging the gap between scientific and technological knowledge and civic and managerial wisdom to understand the earth's resources. Although the accomplishments of technology are significant, technology has created many opportunities for encroachment on human rights. These threats can jeopardize constitutional rights with electronic surveillance, impair the quality of living with air and water pollution, and denigrate human dignity by assaulting sensibilities. While all three of these consequences threaten the  quality of life, it is difficult for one or a few individuals to assert their rights to prevent such disturbances. Social studies teachers have the responsibility to educate about fundamental rights under the government to avoid manipulation by an oligarchical tech-bureaucracy in the future. They must seek to answer the following questions: (1) How can technology respond to societal needs without being destructive of human values and rights? (2) What is the responsibility of individuals and institutions in managing technology? and (3) How can we achieve an acceptable balance between conflicting interests? (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The major contention of this paper is that the emphasis in developing countries on non-formal alternatives to formal schooling can be related to a major reconstruction now underway of the concept of economic development. The earlier concept of development is defined as economic growth reflected in increased gross national product, principally through industrialization. A number of variables which need to be incorporated, however, are left out of this economically based model: humanitarian and survival needs, nationalism, the growing aspirations of people in developing nations, the limits of industrialization, the role of rural development, employment as a problem and goal in its own right, and an imperative for decentralized planning. In the midst of crisis characterized by  greater demand, higher costs, wastage in sequential schooling, and a growing educated unemployed, education must cater to the demands of modernization: basic literacy, manpower training, and a professional elite. The shortcomings that have required a new look at development and the shortcomings in education suggest a way of establishing priorities for implementing non-formal education. Special attention should be given to low-cost, short-duration, need-based, aspiration-accommodating, employment-linked, decentralized, and highly distributive education. Further, wider use of local resources, established oral traditions, and an immediate reward structure are features to consider. (JH)",

Within these subsets non-formal education is differentiated from formal education by a more loosely integrated structure capable of accommodating the three subsets. &quot;Non-Formal Education: Problems and Promises&quot; looks at institutions anthropologically and defines non-formal education as a planned instructional design using both overt and convert procedures in a more flexible environment to teach goals determined by regulated policy. Using this definition the essay discusses non-formal education's implications for development aid, its potential  for achieving developmental goals, and its inherent problems. &quot;An Operational Approach to the Definition of Non-Formal Education&quot; reviews the following contextual elements: changing development goals, limited resources, underdeveloped populations, government and accounting agencies, formal schooling, accepted reward structures, and communications media. A pragmatic definition reflecting the needs posed by these elements is that non-formal efforts are outside the formalized, hierarchical structure of the graded school system, yet, are deliberately planned. Their &quot;non-formality&quot; resides in their locational and organizational aspects rather than their purposes, pedogogy, or status. (JH)",

This mode comes from the assumption that a modern nation has special knowledge to assist a developing one. A different mode for intervention is suggested, however, one that requires the intervening nation to explore the institutions that already function within a society and build on them toward development goals. &quot;Educational History and Non-Formal Education: A Methodological Strategy&quot; sets out to articulate an historical study of education and to organize the inquiry along the lines of a search for similarities between  educational arrangments and extra-educational variables. Education is cast as a dependent variable in a system where change in techno-economic arrangements generates change in social organization and in ideology. A typology is developed that matches primitive, modern, and traditional social units with techno-economic arrangements, social organization, and ideology, and with educational activities (enculturation, skill transfer, and knowledge transfer). This typology, delineated as a format for a cultural history of education or as a step toward an anthropology of education, is considered remarkable in that it does not automatically reveal a particular categorization for non-formal educational activities.

In the future there is a need to find out more about the structural properties and construction of learning environments and to achieve a better fit between educational means and ends. Eight structural elements that affect learning environments are listed: the age mix and social composition of the adults and children; the nature of the reward structure; the proximity of the situation to action, meaningful work, use, and normal living; the timing of the experience with respect to employment; abstract versus concrete content; and  the duration of relationships. &quot;Systemic Capacity as a Problem in the Design of Alternatives to Formal Education&quot; presents a hypothetical schooling model made up of the &quot;givens&quot; of schooling. These givens include evaluation, schooling as means rather than end, certification, time-performance accounting, literacy, content specificity, pedagogical transactions, and demand for an acculturating mechanism. The systemic capacity, or range of things that the learning environment can do, is gauged by possible variations in these givens.

This document in the series assumes that there are cross-cultural applications for non-formal, educational research and searches for ways and means of effecting those applications through training support programs. Six steps are identified for the design of an international training support program: (1) identification of manpower needs, (2) design of training experiences to meet the needs, (3) selection of training participants, (4) design of programs and selection of training institutions, (5) conduct of the training, and (6) use of the new trainees. A reliance upon formal  documentation to communicate training needs from the field to the training institution emerges when the six step model is related to previous experience in training support for formal education. In non-formal education the lack of such communication and the existence of other characteristics which mitigate the effectiveness of the six step model result in the recommendation for a training support \"network\" approach. The approach stipulates early involvement of training institutions in need assessment and strategy formulation, envisages a major in-country training thrust balanced with training abroad as needed, and provides necessary network structure.

In recognition of this social order Universal Primary Education (UPE) was instituted in 1957. The system, quickly overburdened, produced greater social differentiation and unemployed literates and then collapsed. Land reforms and the availability of capital through the government are helping to create a rising rural middle class as one means of meeting these manpower problems. Also, a new  UPE for 1975 is being introduced within a national development plan where the role of education is to create and improve &quot;human capital.&quot; Recommendations to help avoid the problems of an educated unemployed population produced by the first UPE include the recruitment of an adequate number of teachers, curricula oriented toward the developmental needs of the society and based on the nuclear family as a pre-elementary socializing agent, quality standards for the rural schools, in particular, and retraining in agriculture or small business for those who leave school.

According to the author, although bad minority literature and materials are abundant, good materials are being produced. Teachers and librarians need to become aware of the Mexican American materials which reflect the history, heritage, contributions, and pride of the Mexican American people. The first section deals with a statement of the current availability of good and bad resource materials on the Mexican American. The second section focuses on bibliographic listings of available materials for K-12 students, in both literature and social studies. A list of descriptors used  in the ERIC system and subject headings of bibliographic indexing are also included. Section 3 discusses the cataloging problems related to Mexican American materials. An annotated list of 16mm films concludes the bibliographic sources. The last two sections give suggestions for bulletin board displays and arts and crafts. (Author/JR)",

The topical organization of the material ranges from Europe Today--to illustrate the themes underlying Europe's cultural development--back to The Ancient Western World for an historical sequence through The Middle Ages, The Age of Transition, Modern Movements in Intellectual, Political, and Economic Change, and Modern Attempts To Resolve Fundamental Problems. In an introduction on how to use the syllabus, the teacher is advised of the basic themes in Western tradition--social cohesion vs. individuality, urbanization, change, and the equilibrium between change and cultural heritage--and of the terminology used in the syllabus--concepts, understandings, and generalizations. The understandings, characterized as the&quot;ends toward which the examination of the facts is directed,&quot; are filled out by suggested types of study and by leading questions. Teachers are cautioned to require of their students rigorous evaluation of the ideas and theories under discussion and to approach the syllabus itself both critically and flexibly.

Objectives, in fact, may be at a general, specific, or competency level, but it is impossible to begin to write any of these until a course configuration (format) has been developed. Construction of a course configuration facilitates the determination of differing levels of course components; the writing of the appropriate type of objective as well as suitable instruction and evaluation of each component; and, significantly, the integration of content and student performance to facilitate effective and efficient learning. Furthermore, the configuration provides a form of quality control, i.e., a systematic basis for modification and  revision. (Author/JH)",

Thirty-nine superintendents, principals, supervisors, and university educators examined seven new elementary curricula including Taba Social Studies Curriculum Project; Our Working World; Family of Man; Man: A Course of Study; People and Technology, MATCH units; and Social Science Laboratory Units. A record of the daily activities and other aspects of the total programmatic efforts of the conference were recorded by a documentation  committee. Pre-post inventories measuring program objectives found that familiarity with materials, information sources, curricula materials analysis, needs assessment, and implementation increased measurably by the end of the conference.

        "author":["Sorensen, Roselie"],
        "description":"In this paper some comparisons are made between the British Primary School system and the American school system. For example, the role of the British headmaster/mistress is considerably more powerful than the role of the American principal in areas concerning curriculum content, school personnel, use of auxiliary personnel, scheduling of classwork time, and daily activities. The British teacher's role--less participatory than in the United States--seems defined as a balance between providing ideas and facilitating independent work to reinforce direct teaching. British primary teachers, however, are now organizing to change some of the traditional power base. Curriculum content seems less structured and sequential; the teaching day is not as rigidly scheduled; and most schools do  not appear equipped physically or intellectually to respond to total student choice of curriculum. Other differences from U.S. schools were observed in teacher tenure and retraining, student use of time, and organization of recesses. However, integration of the content areas does seem more prevalent than do interdisciplinary studies in the U.S. It is a myth that the British primary school system is an answer to American educational problems. Cultural differences make it impossible to superimpose British designs on American schools. This report concludes with references and an appendix containing reports by headmasters of three British schools. (Author/SH)",

        "description":"The evolution of educational evaluation has been significantly influenced by the assumptions and procedures of educational research which, in turn, aspires to make educational practice scientific. The concept of education connoisseurship and education criticism is posited upon a different set of techniques. Connoisseurship is an appreciative art based on an awareness of the qualities of what one encounters and a comprehension of other states against which to contrast it. Criticism is the linguistic disclosure of the encounter. Connoisseurship and criticism, already within the realm of the teacher, should be fostered because connoisseurship is capable of refinement, provides a level of consciousness that makes intellectual clarity possible, reveals new subject matter for both  theoretical and empirical research, and requires an artful use of language that must come through an appreciative consiousness as well as an understanding of educational practice. Trust in educational criticism can be generated by comparing the criticism with the phenomena being described or with what one has experienced. The acceptance of this mode of evaluation to supplement traditional education research requires the application of the concept to the classroom. (JH)",

Its inclusion in the American school syllabus has been variously modified by the considerations of several schools of educational philosophy and by the reports of a number of committees and task groups with utilitarian approaches to history dominant. The perceived inadequacy of many traditional techniques of teaching history has led to an emphasis on involving students in the use of historical method, which is best done by combining team teaching, individualized instruction, and the open classroom in a format which \"postholes\" history by utilizing a number of minicourses.

Four sets of commercially available, preschool-grade 3 level social studies-related material are analyzed with respect to (1) structural characteristics, (2) specified learning outcomes, (3) theoretical bases, and (4) degree of consistency. The degree of consistency includes a check of the integration of the foregoing three frames of reference and the results of classroom field-tests to see if the material \"works\" without the intervention of extensive teacher training.  The results of this analysis suggest some caveats to consumers and raise some issues for curriculum theorists: (1) a failure to operationalize objectives consistently within the theoretical bases and broad goals of the programs in pervasive and (2) sensitivity experience, group process training, and a firm theoretical foundation are necessary for teachers to fullfill the roles specified within the materials. Comparative data is included on the Human Development Program from the Human Development Training Institute; Dimensions of Personality from Pflaum/Standard Publishing Company; First Things: Values from Guidance Associates; and Developing Understanding of Self and Othes from American Guidance Service.

Two groups of social studies educators, one randomly selected and the other from the college and university section of the National Council for the Social Studies, received a questionnaire requesting level of economics education, attitudes toward economics education, degree of cooperation with economists, and level of interest for increasing understanding of economics. The stimulus for the study was determining the need for a program in economics designed specifically for social studies educators. The results of the survey indicate that the general background in economics of social studies educators is very weak, that  interdisciplinary activity between educators and economists is lacking, and that a high degree of interest exists among social studies educators in enriching their understanding of economics. Contained in this report are the objectives, rationale, design, results, analysis of data, and conclusions of the study.

        "description":"A meeting was held April 3, 1974, by the African-American Institute (AAI) to discuss the need for rural change and the strategies for achieving change in Africa. Participants in the meeting included two Africans who have leading roles in the economic development of their countries, representatives from 12 governmental and private agencies that are contributing to African rural development and several American specialists. The issues examined in the introduction include helping the poorest 16 of the poor nations, strategies for aiding the rural poor, factors affecting rural change, inputs to achieve rural change, and transferring successful aspects of an effective rural development to other areas. The first part of the conference proceedings focuses on exchanging information on  nine current donor agencies' programs to further African rural development. Presentations by African participants regarding rural development priorities and major issues affecting African development are discussed in the second and third part of the document respectively. Appendices include a list of participants, the questionnaire circulated to donor agencies by the AAI, and the 1973 budgets of donor agencies. (Author/ND)",

Written for use with children, but adaptable to older groups, the Sampler tries to engage the feelings as well as intellects of its users in the process of inquiry. It locates interdisciplinary environmental studies activities in the home, the neighborhood, and more remote places. A few of the specific topics viewed from those vantage points are the source of food, taking water for granted, looking closely at buildings, living things around you, garbage and trash, school sites, under the city, beauty around you, and open spaces and group areas. The Sampler provides background information, asks questions, suggests  activities, and lists community resources and reading materials on each topic. Developed particularly for Northeastern Illinois, most of the guide's activities can be transferred to other localities. The appendixes contain a glossary, local and national organizations and community resources, a reader reaction sheet, directory of publishers, bibliography, and subject index. (JH)",

The main themes of the present survey are the explicit or implicit goals of educational R&amp;D, its relation to pedagogical practice, and the part it plays in policy and decision-making. A brief summary of the history of educational R&amp;D, identifies two stages: the first relates to a period and situation where R&amp;D did not aspire to intervene directly in education and the second is characterized by a move towards direct and purposeful intervention. These stages are both very much in evidence in the various OECD countries. The chapters following the  introduction examine the different types of R&amp;D centers, experimental and development agencies, and dissemination efforts; analyze the available data on finance and human resources devoted to R&amp;D; indicate the substantive nature of R&amp;D efforts; examine the trends in policy-making and planning; and deal with current strategies for R&amp;D that are a function of the value and authority structure of individual educational and social systems.

        "description":"In 1973 a study of the national primary schools was begun in Ecuador to consider effects of school and non-school factors upon student flow and achievement, to examine the relative productivity of different types of schools, and to study the costs of primary education to the family and nation. Although other variables such as teacher preparation and characteristics of schools were studied, this paper concentrates upon the socio-economic and family variables such as parent's occupation, family's educational resources, and student's attitude toward school. The researchers examined these variables as related to student achievement and dropout rate in the various types of schools. Students in grades 1, 4, and 6 from urban and rural schools responded to a questionnaire to determine  socio-economic and family factors and to an instrument to determine attitudes. Responses by grades to items of the socio-economic instrument indicate trends which begin to show some system characteristics. In general, there is a trend for students in the higher grades to answer the questionnaire more positively on an ascending socio-economic scale. These data show differences which are really urban-rural. Lack of strong correlation between school factors or socio-economic status and pupil attitudes leads the author to think that attitude may be so culturally determined as to be impossible to separate from value orientations applicable to all formal organizations.

        "description":"This issue of Kaleidoscope, a magazine devoted to the exchange of ideas among schools and teachers in Massachusetts, describes 50 arts and humanities K-12 projects. These projects illustrate the premise that if the arts and humanities are to have their needed impact on a child's growth and development, they must not be treated as superimposed programs, cultural enrichment, or peripheral subjects but must be interwoven with existing curriculum structure. Centering on one or more of the arts, the programs interrelate all of the arts as a body of knowledge, or integrate the arts, into various subject areas. Some are worked out within the normal school budget while others have special funding. All aim at the simultaneous strengthening and expansion of the affective and cognitive  areas of learning. &quot;Creating Imaginary Worlds&quot; proposes that eighth graders use their imaginations as they construct, read about, and write about &quot;other worlds.&quot; In &quot;Tribal Rhythms&quot; a cooperative artist's group works with teachers and school children in recreating the basis of a ritual society through music and mime. To facilitate communication about these programs, Kaleidoscope includes addresses of contact teachers and write-in forms for new projects. The projects are indexed by city, grade, and subject. (JH)",

The following conditions, however, must be satisfied for behavioral objectives to facilitate instruction and evaluation: (a) the overall list of course objectives must include every outcome the teacher hopes to establish, (b) each objective must accurately describe the behavior which reflects the learning  outcomes a teacher intends to establish, (c) each objective must be stated at an appropriate level of generality, (d) each objective must be stated in concise terms, and (e) course objectives must be written and communicated to students in advance of instruction.

At least half the observation time involved the researcher's presence in the classroom for the entire school day; the remainder was done in three-to four-hour blocks. Data included interviews with teachers on their teaching goals, a questionnaire to students on the norms they perceived their teachers to emphasize, and hand-recorded chronicles of teacher behavior. Results of the study attested to the existence of norm-reinforcing behavior and documented the way such behaviors are distributed. Behaviors  representing all but one of the work norms accounted for over 50 percent of the noninstructional talking emitted by teachers, despite great variations in teaching styles. There were task, order, time, and authority norms thought to be rooted in the institutional requirements of school life and which could not, therefore, be circumnavigated by teachers.

        "description":"This study examined effects of five combinations of four instructional variables on student learning. Subjects were 168 graduate students ernolled in a course in educational research at Arizona State University, Tempe. The five versions of the instructional program used in this study were constructed from cues, examples, practice items, and feedback. Cues provided a definition of the concept to be acquired, and examples consisted of one positive and one negative instance of the concept class. Practice items presented the name of a concept class and four instances of the class for subjects to classify. Feedback combined instructional feedback and knowledge of correct response. Subjects were given a packet containing the instructional material appropriate to one of the experimental  groups; after studying the material, the student was given a 60-item posttest. The study indicates that of the four instructional components investigated, practice and feedback contributed the most to subject acquisition of concepts presented. (MJM)",

        "description":"Four patterns or generalizations about peer tutoring are discussed, including the following: (a) academic gains for the learner seem to be most uniformly produced by highly structured programs which explicitly define the content, sequence, and procedure for each lesson; (b) academic gains for the tutor seem most likely when the tutoring experience obliges the tutor to work with and manipulate the instructional content; (c) social growth seems most probable when emphasis on lesson content is removed and particpants are shown how to focus on each other's strengths instead of their weaknesses; and (d) different schools must aim their programs in different directions because of their different needs. Several trends emerged in the research suggesting three developments to be expected  in peer tutoring over the next several years: (a) teachers and administrators instead of researchers will take the lead in designing programs; (b) the vast majority of programs will continue to be need-oreinted and therefore different from one school, and even one classroom, to the next; and (c) determining how students successfully help each other may have an enormous impact on all educational practices.

Two experiments were conducted using undergraduate and graduate Ss. Neither the LC nor the assessment procedure main effects were significant in either study, and no interaction was found with the undergraduates. With graduate Ss there was a significant interaction opposite in direction to expectations. Ss overwhelmingly preferred the mastery procedures. These results are harmful to the construct validity of the I-E Scale (Rotter, 1966) and supportive of the mastery learning approach. (Author)",

A survey instrument, entitled \"Classroom Teacher Point of View,\" was constructed to assess attitudes of teachers regarding their work environments and regarding issues commonly associated with teacher militancy, union organization, and professionalization. The self-administering survey instruments were returned by 2,178 classroom teachers in elementary and secondary schools in the 1,389 California unified school districts which had an average daily attendance greater than 4,000. Results of the survey provided a basis for defining teacher militancy as a  complex of attitudes characteristically including (a) pronounced lack of confidence in school district administration, (b) general lack of support for the school principal, (c) cynical disbelief in the integrity of those in authority, (d) dissatisfaction with existing conditions of education, (e) strong predisposition toward educational change in general, (f) marked tendency to accept the processes of union organization, and (g) inclination to seek increased professional authority and responsibility.

Cultural factors were especially important in the case of the American Indian, as many Indian problems are interrelated with socioeconomic problems, resulting in poor nutrition, housing, and sanitation. Alcohol, suicide, and improper use of health facilities are devices used by Indians in coping with life's problems. Data from federal facilities for Indians show that 60 percent of homes are substandard; only a minority have running water; 39 percent obtain water from unsafe sources; and 48 percent have unsatisfactory privies. Lack of constructive work contributes to problems of mental health. Indian students present a difficult challenge due to lack of a positive self-image,  cultivated by cultural conflict. There is a need for teachers to increase their awareness of Indian customs and practices and to integrate this into their teaching. Teachers must be able to diagnose student needs and prescribe activities which will bring success. A comprehensive health education program which integrates Indian customs is needed at all grade levels, K-12. (Author)",

Due to concern over criticism of the CBTE program, the secondary education faculty completed a retreat to critically evaluate their experiences in implementing the program. This evaluation exposed gaps in the program. Some of these can be identified as a weak affective component, inadequate staff utilization, a need for greater branching within the program  (i.e., individualized instruction), and a lack of \"Gestalt\" as perceived by students. In addition, the support system needs reexamination to determine whether the program has been corrupted by the delivery system developed and implemented by the faculty; objectives need to be reassessed for integrity and then tested empirically. The retreat also resulted in suggestions of areas which the original conceptual scheme might have neglected, and a number of potential research questions to aid in further evaluation.

Since exposure to a language affects one's ability to use it, the speaker's position might affect his access to English and/or his willingness to speak it, and, therefore, his proficiency in it. It is important for a teacher to be aware of the conflicting linguistic features of Spanish and English which cause difficulty for a Puerto Rican child learning standard English as his second language.

The author gives suggestions for generally conservative researchers who want to use the methods discussed, but the second section describes alternative methods for analyzing change. The statistical techniques described are gradually being adopted by associated disciplines and are probably more appropriate for describing and predicting performance over time.

Does sport participation influence the athlete's personality? Critical assessment of the literature provides rather definite answers to these questions. Some theoretical underpinnings of personality theory are discussed which lead one to conclude that the trait approach is inadequate. New approaches are described that would allow personality to be assessed in light of reasonable theoretical premises. The atomistic view of personality will likely have to be dropped.

The analysis uses Kuhn's concept of paradigm to designate a framework which defines problems, methods, and solutions for a research community. The dominant process-pruduct paradigm in teacher effectiveness research is contrasted with two alternate approaches. A mediating process paradigm, derived from prose learning research, emphasizes the significance of student response variables as factors influencing learning outcomes. A \"culture of the school\" paradigm, emerging from naturalistic studies, stresses the development of student response mechanisms in reaction to the demands of the school environment. These response mechanisms appear to mediate teacher effects in part by  reducing the significance of variations in teacher classroom behavior. Both alternate paradigms function as powerful tools for interpreting available data and for generating research hypotheses. (Author)",

In carrying out the survey, available literature was reviewed, visits made to selected ongoing projects in the United States, and interviews conducted overseas with indigenous educational researchers in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Viet Nam, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Korea to determine the feasibility and appropriateness of this approach to meeting the educational needs of primary-aged children in underdeveloped areas. On the basis of successes already reported and an analysis of what kinds of programs would be most useful in developing countries considering their needs and resources, four general models of peer teaching were developed.  The results of the overseas interviews suggested that versions of any of the four models could be used in almost any developing country, and that no one model held particular promise for a majority of the countries surveyed. Differences in requirements, traditions, and capabilities would strongly influence the potential applicability and effectiveness of any approach. With the help of information obtained during the survey, a research design was prepared which suggested the systematic exploration of peer teaching in developing countries. (Author/DDO)",

Some factors which cause this research to be of limited use to the community are: (a) a great deal of data is unusable because it is either wrong or too meagerly supported to judge its reliability; (b) there is a lack of communication among researchers resulting in a great deal of duplication of effort; (c) Krathwohl suggests that the impact of educational research is severely limited by the size of the research and development effort in proportion to the size of the field it is intended to affect; (d) research consumers are frequently ignorant of what the researcher is doing and distrustful of her or his efforts; (e) researchers have been too hasty in generalizing findings from the laboratory to  classroom behavior; and (f) educational research often seems to have little practical application.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of feedback of CIS results to instructors. Two specific questions provided the basis of the study: (a) Does CIS feedback positively affect subsequent student ratings? (b) Does the content of the scale influence the likelihood of change for instructors receiving feedback about the scale? Twenty-nine instructors in junior and senior level education courses at the University of Texas at Austin participated in the study, with the number of students in their classes ranging from 25-45. To obtain  scores for feedback to instructors, the CIS was administered at midsemester and during the last week of the semester. At midsemester, the instructors also completed the CIS for their own teaching as they believed students perceived it. Fifteen instructors received CIS information at midsemester, and 14 instructors who received no feedback of CIS results constituted the control group. Results of the study did not support the general effectiveness of CIS feedback. A table containing the highest loading items on the CIS factor and a bibliography are attached. (JS)",

In modern educational dance, the body is used both as a means of expression and as a projection of the self. A study was conducted on whether modern dance could be used to improve the self-concept of the disadvantaged child in a school setting. Seventy-five disadvantaged inner-city elementary school girls were exposed to modern educational dance as a substitute for the standard required physical education curriculum, to which a control group of 75 girls were exposed. The goals of the modern dance class were to develop a  vocabulary of movement and the opportunity for creative, improvisational movement. The Lipsitt Self-Concept Scale for Children was administered as the pretest, at the conclusion of the experimental period four months later, and again 3 1/2 years later. Tables noting differences between the pre- and posttest scores and the experimental and control group scores are included. The data provided significant proof that modern educational dance positively influenced the child's self-concept. (JS)",

Despite this, very few experimental projects dealing with accountability have been attempted--especially in the field of physical education. A program of accountability was conducted at Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana, in the Department of Men's Physical Recreation. Knowledge and physchomotor tests were administered before and after the 10-week term. Activity areas included archery, badminton, bicycling, bowling, and volleyball. Many problems were encountered in implementing the program, but some basic elements for this type of approach to accountability were noted. These include: (a) the necessity of testing by trained and neutral testers, (b) the provision for all  instructors whose teaching would be evaluated to have a voice in determining the tests and standards to be used, and (c) the inclusion of an incentive reward system to benefit faculty whose students continually show superior learning.

The study looks first at the national situation, and then narrows its focus to the U.S. South. It concludes that if college students continue to choose educational careers at the current rate, the labor force will be unable to absorb the demand, and the students will have to look elsewhere for employment. The report offers several regional policy directions including transmitting information to college students on the staffing outlook in the teaching profession, and suggesting that higher education institutions consider the concept  of &quot;career alternatives&quot; which would prepare students for two or more career options. The report includes statistical tables analyzing the current classroom teacher demand, future projections, and a reference list. (JS)",

The program attempts to excite children about learning and to reinforce basic academic skills. The child's interest, needs, and abilities are integrated into the learning environment. The classrooms have cross-age grouping; there is flexibility of time and space, an informal room environment, and a variety of learning centers. In each classroom, the students plan their day with their teacher, fill out daily or weekly schedules, share ideas and feelings in a discussion circle, and make their own evaluation of their accomplishments and progress at the end of the day. Parents and community  volunteers participate in all aspects of the school program. Students enrolled in the program for three years scored an average of 11 percentile points higher in reading and 16 percentile points higher in mathematics than students who transferred into the program. On teacher, parent, and student inventories, the work habits, social and emotional development, and intellectual development of the students received positive ratings. (DDO)",

This resulted in a variety of open classroom situations, with alternatives for parents, students, and teachers. This paper describes two open classroom situations presently in operation at Las Posas. One is a fifth/sixth grade program; the other combines first and second grades. Six classroom teachers work together in the intermediate program. Teaching, grouping, projects, and activities are done across grade levels and class lines. Classrooms are used in whatever way enhances the teaching and learning activity being done. The primary program is  ungraded with no emphasis on age or grade. Two teachers are assisted by parent volunteers and cross-age tutors. Areas of study (language arts, math, spelling, printing, creative writing, research, science, vocabulary, geography, art, music, construction, cooking, sewing, drama, French, and Spanish) are individualized, with students working on a weekly contract basis.

The end of year report, therefore, is presented in a principally narrative form utilizing case histories and personal comments, although pertinent graphs and charts are included. Among the difficulties facing the school was the problem of imposing a necessary structure on a form which seemed to fundamentally demand maximum freedom for students, staff, and volunteers. Student behavior problems and black student transfer contributes to the school's dilemma of how to provide productive freedom without sacrificing educational and social objectives. A governing board composed of students, staff, and parents was formed in 1973 in order to  address such problems. The board, perceived effective in the function of hiring and evaluating staff, was not productive in other areas, illustrated by the fact that most school decisions were made on a crisis basis.

Their correlation matrix incorporated 46 computer generated variables. Subjects were 152 students attending Jefferson Medical College who had completed all three examinations as candidates for National Board certification. Results showed that 15 measures had a significant relationship with Part 3 performance. The authors found that measures of factual medical knowledge were better predictors of Part 3 performance than were performance-oriented or  computer-referenced measures and agreed with previous researchers that patient managemental problem measures, though intuitively appealing, are found both weak and ambiguous when subjected to rigorous statistical analysis.

In the survey a probability sample of 7,514 youths was selected to represent the 23 million adolescents aged 12-17 years residing in this country. Test results were presented by age, sex, and educational level in their raw score form to permit comparison with other studies using the WRAT. Percentile ranks and normalized standard score (T Score) equivalents of the raw scores have been included. The Cycle III HES data demonstrated a continued development of reading and arithmetic skills  through the adolescent years and as formal education increased. Girls in the age range surveyed performed better than boys on the word recognition and pronunciation task presented by the WRAT. A similar finding came from HES Cycle II program when the Level I reading of the WRAT was administered to children 6-11 years old. No significant differences between boys and girls in arithmetic computational skills were found in either survey. (Author/BJG)",

The Markov process model, enhancing a probabilistic viewpoint for the explanation of developmental data, should be restricted. Attention should be focused on the immediate context and situational setting of a subject. The situational perception of a subject cannot be divorced from a subject's active reconstruction of past experiences nor separated from cyclic phenomena and external regularities. Obligatory and optional features of a task a subject performs are viewed as a function of the immediate contextual situation. Examples center on the developmental processes of a child. (BJG)",

This is the central problem of this paper, and it is confronted by the examination of two levels of information using a Follow Through Evaluation. The first information level contains, in addition to outcome variables (achievement tests), information on child characteristics and family background. The second contains all the variables of the first plus three achievement tests given at an earlier time. Although many educators believe it is important to use a pretest to adjust posttest scores, closer inspection reveals that this process typically explains only a fraction of the variation on posttest  scores. Even if pretests substantially explain variations on concurrent variables, this does not warrant the conclusion that treatment differences based on posttests will be altered by additional information. It is concluded that a multifaceted approach may reveal the analysis or analyses best suited for a particular question. (Author/BJG)",

Teachers most commonly used their release time to plan with interns or adults, to work on classroom records, or to organize classroom materials. Evaluation of the program was difficult because of the presence of the halo effect and the absence of a criterion.

But communication with the general public, educators, and business and government leaders is essential for specialists in measurement. The success of their work depends to an extraordinary degree on the  understanding of both those whose abilities and achievements are measured and those who use the results.

The evaluation process is computer based and is similar in several ways to that used for processing and reporting the results of the Strong Vocational Interest Blank at the University of Colorado. A computerized feedback system was developed which allowed for considerable flexibility. In addition to the availability of practically an unlimited number of optional questions that are individually preprinted by computer, the chief advantage of this procedure is that each instructor of a course receives detailed and comprehensive information that is individually specific and at the same time allows comparisons with various norm groups within the university.  The instructor also receives subjective responses by students on the backside of the questionnaire which asks for the most and least effective aspects of the course and utilizes the critical incidence technique. There is a two page feedback system which gives one page of numerical and normative feedback while the second page is designed to give a verbal report (page 2 is still under development). This is another example of how the use of the computer has opened the door to a new dimension in innovation in evaluation. (Author)",

As technology increases, educational attainments can quickly become inadequate to face the demands of life and work in adult life. Many countries that are advancing technologically are finding their present adult population ignorant of these changes and how to cope with them; thus the importance of adult education is becoming evident all over the world. Planning is needed to implement the necessary concepts for establishing a thorough program of adult education. Yet planning without informative statistics would be lacking vital information. In order to meet this growing need for requested statistics, the office of statistics of UNESCO developed an International  Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) as an instrument for collecting and compiling statistics of education both within individual countries and internationally.

This booklet was prepared to assist such nonspecialists in the preparation of efficient and useful questionnaires by providing a brief, readable guide for the development of questions for management decisions. This discussion is concerned primarily with kinds of questions that elicit information about attitudes and opinions. The first step in developing a good questionnaire is to examine the context in which the data derived from the questionnaire will be used. The kinds of decisions to be made, the characteristics of the respondents, and the needs of those requesting the information are important contextual aspects. Secondly, item formats such as open-ended  questions, two-way questions, and multiple choice questions must be considered along with some of the problems inherent in using the various item types. The items designed and selected for inclusion in the questionnaire should be unambiguous, appropriate for the respondents, and not misleading. Pretesting the questionnaire affords a situation in which ineffective or poorly worded items can be discarded or modified.

The GATB consists of 12 tests which measure nine aptitudes: General Learning Ability; Verbal Aptitude; Numerical Aptitude; Spatial Aptitude; Form Perception; Clerical Perception; Motor Coordination; Finger Dexterity; and Manual Dexterity. The aptitude scores are standard scores with 100 as the average for the general working population, and a standard deviation of 20. Occupational norms are established in terms of minimum qualifying scores for each of the significant aptitude measures which when combined, predict job performance. Cutting scores are set  only for those aptitudes which aid in predicting the performance of the job duties of the experimental sample. The GATB norms described are appropriate only for jobs with content similar to that shown in the job description presented in this report. A description of the validation sample is also included.

Subjects were 78 examinees from University of Washington and Washington State University. Subjects' grade-point in academic subjects in their educational background correlated with the \"theoretical\" subscores of the test. Thus, it appeared that a candidate's ability to perform in the test situation may influence how well he performs on the licensure examination. Conversely, the scores on neither part of the \"practical\" portion correlated with the grade-point average. Whether a subject had completed a rotating externship was not  found to affect performance on the various parts of the examination; however the small numbers of former externs and the fact that their characteristics were not greatly different from other candidates made any conclusions tentative.

        "description":"Two types of sensitivity indices were developed in this paper, one internal to the total test and the second external. To evaluate the success of these statistics the three criteria suggested for a satisfactory index of item quality were considered. The Internal Sensitivity Index appears to meet these demands. Certainly it is easily computed. In addition its moderately positive correlations with other traditional statistics confirms that the ISI provides unique information and yet is not inconsistent with these indices. However, when there are a large number of masters at the pretest an alternate form of the ISI is sometimes necessary to demonstrate item sensitivity. Finally, the theoretical construction of the ISI is both intuitively understandable and similar in form to other  statistics. The External Sensitivity Index, on the other hand, does not fair as well as its internal counterpart. Although computationally simple it fails to demonstrate any consistent correlations with the traditional indices, suggesting a rather random statistic. Perhaps a single item is not sufficient to provide a stable, reliable measure of the effects of instruction. The ISI appears to provide a suitable measure of an item's ability to distinguish between those who have and have not benefited from instruction. Further, the most appropriate approach for evaluating item quality is an examination of the item in context with total test performance. (Author/BJG)",

One innovation was the introduction of the multiple choice exam. Yet even with this type of aptitude test, the majority of questions and plausible answers have become quite involved and intense. All this requires a great deal of concentration for the reader to comprehend the question as well as the four to five plausible answers all within a certain amount of time. The persons who risk the most in these situations are those to whom the language of the test is a secondary one. By citing some of the research findings that were carried out by members of NCME, the author tries to achieve an analytical and interpretative reply to these  findings. The author also makes some proposals which might remedy the errors of the testing instrument especially within the area of international studies. (DEP)",

For this purpose, the transcripts of 349 students who had graduated from the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign campus) during the academic year 1970-71 were examined. Among the more important findings were that students who gain proficiency credit tend to graduate with more total credit hours and more credit hours in upper division courses. Both of these results were interpreted as a positive benefit of proficiency testing. Students with proficiency credit also tended to graduate sooner and with higher grade point averages (GPA) than those with no proficiency credit.  However, the relationship between proficiency credit and GPA was stronger within 100-level courses than within 200- and 300-level courses. (Author)",

Although there are many problems inherent in the physical distribution of students, which complicates transportation efforts and contributes to a high student-teacher ratio, the major problem stems from administrative educational policy and fund distribution. The Ministry of Education holds the power in the Abaconian educational system. This ministry perpetuates the rote learning process by emphasizing memorization rather than creative thinking processes, and it determines a rigid school curriculum which does not offer courses relevant to the Abaconian student, such as in the area of vocational training. Certification tests serve to measure student success, though few students progress to  such a level. Factors contributing to low achievement are poor facilities, lack of educational materials, and inattention to student abilities and needs. Money allocated per pupil is extremely low, estimated in American dollars at $399.56 in 1970. The significance of this figure may be considered in conjunction with the probability that up to half of the educational funds go to administrative expenses. An alternative, open classroom, educational system is considered. (DEP)",

One of the two-stage tests yielded an approximately horizontal information function, indicating more constant precision of measurement for individuals at all levels of ability. The conventional test and the second two-stage test yielded information functions peaked at the mean ability level but dropping off at more extreme levels  of ability; however, the second two-stage test provided more information than the conventional test at all levels of ability.

During a five-year period 45 separate instruments containing over 2000 items were constructed, revised, rejected, and accepted in preparation for the present inventory. This inventory has scales which independently measure different facets of educational goals including basic skill achievement, social and health habits, feelings toward self and others, value placed on learning and human accomplishment, interest in creative activities, and methods of coping with freedom. The battery of tests was administered to 253,226 students attending 240 Commonwealth intermediate schools. Though individual names  were erased prior to test scoring, information necessary to identify general student groups was obtained through questions of sex, ability level, and father occupation. Answers were scored by both norm-referenced and criterion-referenced methods. Selection of these complementary scoring methods enhance the concept that result accountability goes beyond the school. Recognition of many experiences shaping the educational progress of an individual, however, does not detract from efforts to restructure school programs in hopes of goal attainment. (BJG)",

Achievement test items in five content areas of educational measurement were used as stimuli to be sorted by groups of students with varying levels of sophistication with the content, with the hypothesis that sorting by classes with greater sophistication would agree more with simulated target sortings than sortings by classes with less sophistication. These sortings were analyzed using partitioning procedures. Results from both studies indicated that degree of sophistication in measurement was overall a potent variable in the sorting. In addition, several misconceptions among the students concerning the content under study were revealed. It was noted that a moderate  number of students enrolled in upper-level measurement courses demonstrated what amounted to errors in knowledge in their sortings. It was concluded that the partitioning procedures were useful for studying how items are perceived by students and for determining how students organize content. (Author)",

Such a procedure could yield two classes of benefits: (a) students could learn the language of numerical probability and use it to communicate uncertainty, and (b) the learning of other subjects could be facilitated. This report describes the rationale underlying a procedure for eliciting personal estimates of probabilities utilizing a proper scoring rule, and illustrates some new techniques for calibrating those probabilities and providing better feedback to students learning to assess uncertainty. In  addition, new results are presented comparing the incentive for study, rehearsal, and practice provided by the proper scoring rule with that provided by the simple choice procedure, and concerning the potential effect of cutoff scores and prizes upon student behavior.

        "description":"Marcy Open School has developed an educational reality where students are given freedom to be creative within a structured curriculum. Reflective of this philosophy are the three priority goals developed by Marcy staff and parents which are: (1) We want girls and boys to speak, listen, write, read, and deal with mathematical concepts effectively and confidently and in order for them to gain proficiency and enjoyment, these skills should be practiced widely as the child pursues his interests and seeks answers to his problems in school and out; (2) We expect that children will take more responsibility for their own learning in all areas--social, academic, and physical; and (3) We hope that children will increase their understanding of their individual rights and the rights of  others. In order to accomplish these objectives, effort has been made to create a facilitative learning environment, which includes specially designed spaces with a variety of materials and activities and exploration of community resources. Adult-child interactions are stressed. Quantitative information on student academic achievement is based on standardized tests and qualitative information on participant evaluation. Although Marcy has succeeded in a fully integrated curriculum, questions have been raised on whether such integration is always desirable. (BJG)",

        "description":"Four experiments were conducted to examine the effects of various processing instructions on the rate of false recognition. The continuous single-item procedure was used, and false recognitions of four types were examined: synonyms, antonyms, nonsemantic associates, and homonyms. The instructions encouraged subjects to think of associates, usages (features), images, or rhymes. The only differences between the experiments were presentation rate and specific instructions included. Only the fourth experiment produced a statistically signficant instructions effect, with features, images, and rhymes instructions reducing false recognitions, of all types, and associates producing slightly more. The inconsistency of the effects over the four studies, however, suggests that a cautious  interpretation is warranted. (Author)",

        "description":"The Productive Thinking Program (PTP), consisting of 16 programmed lessons designed to develop productive thinking skills, was used as the basis of a program conducted with 546 fifth graders in 21 classes in four upstate New York school districts. One hundred and twenty students from one of these districts were involved in a modified Solomon Four Groups Design. A number of PTP stories were presented to both control and experimental groups, but the experimental group alone was invited to participate with the story characters in their adventures. The Minnesota Tests of Creative Thinking were used to assess productive thinking, with the construct validity being of major concern. Problem solving was defined in the categories of fluency, flexibility, and appropriateness of response.  In this study, three experimental groups and three control groups were set up to study the effectiveness of the PTP. There were two teacher involvement and two pre-test conditions for the experimental and control groups. Generally, the findings mildly support that the PTP was effective in bringing about differences in posttest scores on the variables studied. One explanation of these findings could be that this application of the PTP differed from that recommended by its authors. (Author/BJG)",

Although some proofs are presented, the emphasis is more on exposition of mathematical language and concepts than on the mathematics per se and rigorous proofs. Many problems are given as exercises so a student may test his interpretation or understanding of the concepts. Most of the mathematics is elementary. Each chapter begins with simple explanations and ends at a much more advanced level. Students with only high school algebra should have no difficulty with the first parts of each chapter. Chapters 1 and 2 were added as background for Chapter 3 which discusses expected values of random  variables. Chapter 4 focuses attention on the distribution of an estimate which is the basis for comparing the accuracy of alternative sampling plans as well as a basis for statements about the accuracy of an estimate from a sample. The content of chapter 4 is included in books on sampling, but it is important that students hear or read more than one discussion of the distribution of an estimate, especially with reference to estimates from actual sample surveys.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to empirically test a set of predictions implied by the Model of Conceptual Learning and Development using the concept of cutting tool. Four subtests were developed to assess a subject's ability to perform at each of four successive levels of concept attainment (concrete, identity, classificatory and formal). In addition, three subtests were constructed to determine the extent to which a subject could use the concept cutting tool to cognize other concepts related to cutting tool as being supraordinate, coordinate or subordinate, to understand cause-and-effect and other relationships when cutting tool or its attributes were incorporated in a principle, and in problem-solving situations. The subtests were designed to elicit behaviors that reflected  underlying cognitive operations that differentiated among the four levels and three uses. The subjects were kindergarten, third, sixth and ninth grade children. Each of the five major predictions specified by the Model of Conceptual Learning and Development were confirmed. The Cutting Tool Assessment Battery is included in the appendix. (Author/BJG)",

While the reliability of this measure of peer popularity is low to moderate using test-retest or split-half measures, the interview data does seem to predict other relevant measures of the social behavior of young children in interaction with their peers. It should be pointed out that sociometric status and the social characteristics of these children are not completely independent measures since the children themselves were the source of both kinds of information. Nevertheless, the relations are in predicted directions and tend to be consistent with the observational data presented in this paper.

With this increasing demand for test data, ethical considerations must be taken into account as measurement instruments are designed, administered, and interpreted. Difficulties in instrument design arise because of the complex and multidimensional nature of the affective domain. To date, the most useful method of categorizing the emotional state is through an assessment of student attitudes, interests, values, and appreciations. The most commonly used assessment technique is the self-report stimulus response selection approach which may involve a format that is forced choice or true-false. Scales include Guttman, Likert,  Thurstone, and the semantic differential. Of the numerous types of item formats and scales, all have complex problems ranging from serious validity problems to high costs. Other methods for assessing the affective domain are the Q-Sort, interviews, and unobtrusive measures. (BJG)",

        "description":"In past Head Start evaluations, cognitive measures have been weighed heavily. This has not accurately reflected the relative unimportance of cognitive program goals; child performance gains are not an objective with high priority for most Head Start programs. Evaluation planners need to weigh previously encountered measurement problems carefully and decide to adopt either a reliability-based strategy placing emphasis on careful test administration or a validity-based strategy assuming that what is needed is a fundamental reconceptualization of the measurement of cognitive effects, developing new measures. As priorities for cognitive measurement, this study argues that the new evaluation should stress readiness, cognitive process, and social competency and if it is decided to  adopt a validity-based strategy, lists of clearly defined behavioral objectives must be drawn up in those realms of stress and then to create or adopt instruments to measure these objectives. What is needed is a battery of face-valid, empirically based, criterion-referenced instruments intended to measure short-term effects. Choice of measures is integrally related to choice of evaluation design. The new evaluation might consider some departure from pre- and post-testing, instead testing three times during the year or only once at the end. (RC)",

        "description":"This paper reports the first phase of a larger longitudinal follow-up study of graduates of Youth Aliyah. At its inception in the early 1930's, Youth Aliyah was conceived as an organized campaign to attract Jewish adolescents away from Central Europe and inspire them to move alone or with their families to Palestine. During the war and immediately afterwards the rescue operation spread widely into Western and Eastern Europe. The third kind of rescue began around 1948 when a large proportion of children gathered into the Youth Aliyah framework came from Islanic countries (63 percent in the 1950's and 44 percent in the 1960's). These children and adolescents were saved not only from political oppression but also from a condition of severe economic improverishment and status  deprivation. This paper describes the cultural backgrounds of the target groups, including the socially disadvantaged and behaviorally disordered among them who are referred to herein as &quot;high risk&quot; and subject to special intervention provisions in Youth Aliyah. The effects of these special provisions and of the more typical Youth Aliyah offerings were evaluated on the basis of tests of general intelligence, language development, and social adjustment administered by the Israeli Army to all inductees. Results show that the Youth Aliyah groups compared favorably with national norms, thus attesting to the compensatory value of special total care provisions for the &quot;high risk&quot; children.

Two studies were done. In the first, focusing on teacher-mediated behavior modification, an instructor taught interested teachers in a single elementary school to carry out behavior modification projects with their pupils, and in addition to provide direct, intensive supplementary instruction in arithmetic skills to pupils in several classrooms. The school selected was located in an \"inner-city\" area. Only five upper-elementary teachers completed behavior modification projects with one or more pupils in  their respective classrooms. Self-concept data and teacher-nomination data on deviant pupils, obtained for all of the pupils in these five classrooms, did provide a basis for evaluating the reliability and validity on the self-concept measures, a secondary aim of this project. In order to obtain data on parent-mediated behavior modification, a program of parent behavior-modification training groups was sponsored in the second study, to assist interested parents in modifying problem behaviors of normal youngsters, aged 10-15, who were not receiving any other special treatment.

        "description":"The thrust of this research exploration is aimed at one of the most pressing social problems facing America today: segregation in the public schools. The school system is only one of a complex set of systems, all interrelated, that comprise the entity that we call a city. The geography of the school system--the location of facilities and the location and movement of students to those facilities--is the only observable expression of a complex geo-political decision making system. Many considerations go into the making of essentially spatial decisions that are not primarily concerned with spatial efficiency or with the physical system's day to day operation. It was for this reason that we decided to explore the nature of school location systems in the context of a hypothetical city  as a means of minimizing nongeographical influences. We have borrowed the concept of spatial efficiency in school systems. Distance minimization is the comparative measure of the efficiency of alternate arrangements. In order to partially conform to conventional wisdom on urban spatial structure, we chose a polar grid system as a concession to the classical sector and ring theories. The execution of the problem was done using the Linear Programming Algorithm from the IBM Mathematical Programming Systems package on the Pennsylvania State University's IBM/360 computer system.

It is our conviction that we must set our priorities realistically. We find that this policy does not in any way compromise our standards of excellence.

Specifically, the task force sought to collect data of an objective and subjective nature on separate incidents of conflict and tension and to organize the data in a manner which would allow for a comprehensive assessment of the nature and prevalence of the incidents; and, to identify programs and procedures that have proven effective in preventing and ameliorating conflict  on high school campuses. The task force used six major sources of information to accomplish its objectives: surveys, interviews, documents, newspaper reports, workshops, and emergency plans. The task force conducted a mail survey of over 300 California high schools and collected on-site responses to an attitude scale from approximately 1,000 persons in 32 schools.

The time span covered begins with Ebenezer Howard's work on the garden city and goes up to 1975 with a couple of books looking into the future. A list of 40 periodicals that contain literature on new communities with the most fruitful sources indicated concludes the bibliography. A new community is a form of urban planning designed to relocate populations away from large cities by grouping homes, hospital, industry, and cultural, recreational, and shopping centers to form new, relatively autonomous cities or towns. In the United States  there are about 30 of these large-scale developments in progress. Until recently housing developers have concentrated their attention on architectural and economic aspects, but now there is a shift in attention to study the social aspects involved. The idea that the physical environment is a major determinant of society and culture is questioned. The issues of job security, work satisfaction, adequate income, family life, the avoidance of social isolation, peace of mind, and mobility are more pressing than those of the physical environment. This bibliography is directed toward exploration of just such issues. (Author/JM)",

Conflict can be planned for and utilized constructively. For 10 years, in approximately 2,000 instances, conciliators and mediators of the Community Relations Service have stood side-by-side with school administrators as they struggled to restore an atmosphere conducive to learning in a school that had been fractured by racial confrontation. Each case requires its own tailoring. But there is a body of techniques and methods which can be adapted and applied as needed. One approach is early diagnosis. It's strange that in the field of education, where so much of practice is the result of research and planning, problems of  racial conflict are often left to chance. Once the research has been done, the principal can plan to overcome some, if not all, of the problems perceived. The search for solutions should not be limited to the boundaries of customary practice and traditional approaches. Business as usual is not likely to provide the answer. A poorly run school is a pushover for conflict. A well run school has the problem half licked. Planning and preparing to defuse or to deal with racial conflict might bring you 25 percent closer to being home free. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This is a report of a three-year demonstration and research project which addressed itself to three objectives: (1) To explore the need for planned, long-term foster family care for minority children as one of the services to be made available by a multiple child welfare services program in a public agency. (2) To assess the readiness of seniors majoring in an undergraduate social work curriculum to provide direct child welfare services, given certain training conditions and educational requirements. (3) To design a model for a child welfare services delivery system in a public agency that will make multiple high quality child welfare services available and accessible to children in need of them. This study was conducted in San Mateo County. A survey of all children in foster  care in the county was undertaken. For the 49 foster children served directly in this project, detailed research schedules were prepared to allow for systematic information gathering about them and their parents. Assessment of readiness for professional practice of project students involved several procedures. To develop a new delivery model for child welfare services, the relevant professional literature was reviewed by social work and management specialists affiliated with the project. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This publication prepared by the Bureau of Title 1, Elementary Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, serves as a reference source of representative Title 1 ESEA programs designed to meet the special educational needs of disadvantaged children. It is the latest Directory of Title 1, ESEA Programs 1973-1974 and, when used in conjunction with other brochures distributed by the Office of Funded Programs, gives an overview of funded projects in New York City during the past school year. This 1973-74 compendium, provides profiles of Title 1 central and district programs to share with the reader the efforts being made by neighboring school districts. In recent years the federal government has played an increasingly important role in supporting programs under Title 1 to meet the  needs of economically- and educationally-disadvantaged children. In 1965, New York City received a basic allocation of 65,133,281; for the 1973-74 school year this basic allocation has increased to $154,351,189. This increase in federal support serves to dramatize the emergence of a three-way partnership involving the federal government, the state, and the city to aid in resolving the staggering problems affecting the education of children in New York City schools.

There were 135 student and 23 adult participants in two bilingual summer school projects. The T.V. series consists of five strands each containing 13 video taped programs. A learning guide is available for each program. Three surveys, written by the researchers, were utilized in the study. These questionnaires were translated into Spanish. The pupil evaluation  instrument was administered twice during the study; after the children had viewed four tapes (pupil evaluation 1) and again following the fifteenth tape (pupil evaluation 2). Reactions from classroom personnel were elicited concerning each individual tape immediately after the tape had been viewed in the classroom and concerning the total series at the end of the summer session. The responses from these surveys were extremely positive. On this basis, therefore, it would seem that the use of this series would be a worthwhile addition to bilingual classrooms. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Large urban school districts are considered by most people to be in serious trouble because they are unable to educate children in the inner city as well as the suburban districts have been able to educate theirs. Although the state assist these districts in many ways, it has not made a commitment to the development of a coordinated plan of action. This coordinated plan of action has been determined by a national task force on urban education as an extremely necessary tool to promoting change. The districts requiring this particular attention are located in the urbanized triangle of Wisconsin, have a large minority, low income population, have a large number of children of poor educational performance, and are highly industrialized. The crises in which these school districts find  themselves are the consequences of human decisions. By finding a way of involving the individuals most likely to make those decisions as well as those most likely to be affected by them in a process of information gathering, introspection and implementation, it seems possible that some progress can be made. The proposals for doing this include the development of a Superintendent's Council and an Urban Education Advisory Committee and designation of the Deputy Superintendent to facilitate as the focal point for urban concerns.

        "description":"Ranging from information on the percentage of college students living at home to a composite picture of a typical faculty member, the following articles and charts, reprinted from \"American Education,\" November 1972 through December 1973, illustrate the nation's increased effort in education from preschool through graduate school. This rapid rise in education interest is evident in the percentage of the gross national product (GNP) spent for education. In the mid-1930's the educational portion of the GNP exceeded 4 percent. This dropped to a low 1.8 percent of the GNP, or approximately $83.3 billion, which is 40 billion more than seven years before. Young people stay in school longer, culminating in increased college attendance. Preprimary enrollment reached a new high in 1972.  Enrollment of 3-to-5-year-olds increased by almost one-third between 1964 and 1972, and the number of nonwhite preprimary enrollment rose from 44,000 to 689,000. More individualized instruction resulted from the fact that, between 1967-68 and 1972-73, enrollment rose a little more than 4 percent, while the number of teachers increased by 12.5 percent. Teachers held higher degrees in the year ending June 30, 1971. More than 95 percent of public school teachers held a bachelor's degree. (Author/JM)",

The staff includes 11 teachers, 1 librarian, 1 counselor, and 2 part-time supply teachers. Students attend DLC while remaining enrolled in their home school. The present group represents 25 high schools. Examination of the School System Objectives for 1973-74 and evaluating DLC in relation to those  objectives leaves little doubt about its efficacy. Surely the general goal is achieved. Student records indicate improved performance. The system of contract-writing attests to learner involvement. DLC's contribution to accomplishing the objective concerning community involvement can be seen in many contacts made with the community through parents in all high schools, through community resources for learning, and through community interest generated and evidenced by inquiries directed to the center.

        "description":"The purchase and preparation of data from the March 1973 Current Population Survey for New York City has been in the nature of an experiment. The U.S. Bureau of the Census in conducting its Current Population Surveys (CPS) includes a sample of approximately 2,100 households in New York City, chosen in such a way as to be representative of the city as a whole though not necessarily of the individual boroughs. It covers a wide range of data including age, sex, ethnicity, family size, income, earnings, occupation, education, etc., and these can be cross-tabulated in a variety of ways. A sample of 2,100 households is a respectably sized sample. Nevertheless, it has its limitations, especially when it is more and more finely broken down, for example, first by income groups, then by  ethnic groups, and then by family size. The degrees of variance of the standard errors are shown in the appendix. We have done a great deal of &quot;collapsing&quot; of the data as they were obtained from the Census Bureau printouts. In preparing the tables, we tried to strike a balance between reasonable reliability, on the one hand, and flexibility for the users of the data on the other hand. Whenever the Census Bureau presented medians, eg., income, years of schooling, for categories that did not require additional calculation by us, our tables show the CPS figures. (Author/JM)",

Two points are of particular interest: (1) the shift from the piecemeal English as a Second Language program to the more comprehensive bilingual programs, and (2) the development of a process by which specific training needs could be identified and acted on. The passage of the Massachusetts Bilingual Law gave the Bilingual Department a huge responsibility. The expansion of its responsibilities to include providing principles and procedures for designing bilingual  programs in individual schools for multicultural groups produced an expansion of the staff. Newly adaptive staffing patterns consisted of representatives from multicultural groups of teachers, regional responsibilities of a group of consultant-teachers, community coordinators, and guidance counselors. The staff's basic goals were to cooperatively develop, with individual schools, procedures for establishing effective bilingual education programs. They were responsible for providing program and curriculum advice, materials, and teacher training. (Author/JM)",

The scholarship in this area fell into two categories: (1) basic research on the variables which affect the entrance, persistence, and achievement of students from disadvantaged environments; (2) evaluative research which deals with the equity, effectiveness, and efficiency of programs designed to counteract the impact of these variables. While basic research has been generally adequate, evaluative research on programs has been commonly deficient  in measurement instruments; in the failure to measure effectiveness, efficiency, and equity in terms of immediate program objectives; and in the lack of systematic information and feedback systems. Research on causal variables and evaluative research on compensatory programs has been consistent in identifying lack of basic academic skills and poor study habits as the most powerful limiting factors in equalizing educational opportunities for the disadvantaged. A federally sponsored, nationally integrated competency-based developmental skills program on all levels of education is needed. (Author/JM)",

A major question being asked is how and to what extent do a student's parents, teachers, and peers influence the student's attitudes about politics, integration, career aspirations and expectations, as well as a number of other topics. A representative sample of the Atlanta Metropolitan area high schools, their senior students, teachers, and parents was obtained. The students were interviewed individually, whereas the teachers and parents filled out shorter, self-administered versions of the student interview schedule. The principals completed a questionnaire concerning details about their school: enrollment, absenteeism, facilities, requirements  for graduation, etc. In all, six Atlanta area high schools agreed to participate. Two were predominately white--one predominately middle class, the other predominately working class. The third was predominately black, and its students and their families belonged to the middle and upper classes. The fourth was about 80 percent black; here the class composition was primarily lower middle class. The remaining two schools, respectively, were one-third and two-thirds black and drew their students from the upper and the lower middle classes. (Author/JM)",

Teddie Alton, a student intern in College Discovery, compiled a &quot;Grade Distribution of Special Admissions Students (fall 1971 to spring 1974)&quot; which is attached to this document. A careful study of this chart appears to indicate that the students were responding to certain positive aspects of the program which over a short period of time produced dramatic results. In spring 1974 the steady and impressive progress over the previous five terms appeared to collapse. It was during this period that Special Admissions was going through perhaps its most difficult period. The director was physically ill and unable to maintain her leadership at the previous  level. The burden of responsibility fell on the shoulders of the assistant director, who was unable/unwilling to assume the leadership gap. During this period the students were in limbo, and the counseling which the assistant director did offer was in many situations erroneous. In the beginning of November, nine students were selected randomly and asked certain questions related to the program. A list of the questions is attached to this document. The program's greatest need appears to be in the area of counseling. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In behavioral science research, language has been increasingly seen to reflect the concepts that the child has acquired prior to, and hence independent of, the acquisition of language. Analyses based on this idea are confined largely to words that denote clear perceptual referents. Language, however, contains many terms that have no portrayable referents. If it is to be meaningful, any search for the contribution of language to thinking should be carried out in the realm where language may have unique properties for organizing experience. Some terms which exemplify, but which far from exhaust, this phenomenon, are found in question words referring to cause (i.e. why), manner (i.e. how) and time (i.e. when). Largely because the question word \"why\" occurs more frequently and  earlier than these other terms the discussion which follows is largely confined to the child's mastery of this term. Data for the first part of the discussion was collected during work with Doris Allen, a linguist who had collected bi-monthly data on the linguistic performance of a middle-class child. The remainder of the discussion deals with data gathered as part of a much broader assessment of the cognitive skills in children of three to six years of age. The materials discussed here specifically concerns a set of 44 items designed to tap the child's ability to deal with problem solving questions. (Author/JM)",

Systematic change, instituted by European governments concerned with educating millions of children, may now have more to teach us than brilliant individual successes. For these large-scale undertakings offer proof that a nation can undertake major improvements in its schools, and despite bureaucratic hazards and great variations within its population, make these improvements work. In this  regard two of the educational systems that have the most to teach us are those of England and the Soviet Union, and we are now at a point where it makes particular sense to take a second look at the changes that have gone on in the school systems of these countries over the last decade. Of the variety of lessons that the English and the Soviet systems have to teach us, overriding them all is the degree to which the education of children, especially at the primary level and earlier, requires schools that do not isolate them from their day-to-day environment or their immediate needs.

        "description":"That public education in Bedford-Stuyvesant is failing, is evident from the reading and math scores reported in this study. Approximately 78.5 percent or 45,543 Bedford-Stuyvesant children are reading below the national norm, and 80.6 percent or 46,761 Bedford-Stuyvesant children are doing math below the national norm. As the children advance from grade to grade, more and more fall behind. The authors believe the primary cause is in the educational system itself, especially the quality of teaching--not in the child, or his home, or his poverty. How does one improve public elementary education? The authors twofold answer is (1) through on-site teacher-training to help grade school and junior high teachers create individualized learning environments, combined with (2) a parent  education program to enable parents to develop criteria for judging good learning methods. Chapters 2, 3, and 5 are a reflection of the insights gained from direct experience in the Bedford-Stuyvesant educational system for periods of time ranging from 4 to 21 years. Although this study contains information on preschool education, high school education, higher education, decentralization, and various special education programs, the principal focus is on those years in school when the child should be developing those skills necessary to become an independent learner.

Subjects included 1,120 students in 12 elementary schools in Dougherty, Georgia, who were enrolled in a Title I reading project utilizing the center concept and individually prescribed instruction with 13 teachers and 13 aides. Since  these students were pulled from the bottom of the lowest academic strata there was no control group available for comparison; therefore, history of previous gain as calculated from the pretest means was used as a basis for determination of difference. Teachers were trained and supervised throughout the school year in both reading skills and management techniques. All data indicated significant improvement in the ratio of reading gains for all grade levels. It was concluded that it cost less to teach better when cost is based on amount of reading gain per dollar expenditure. (Author/JM)",

Specific objectives include  reduction of intergroup prejudice by modifying attitudes toward self and others in a positive direction, increasing self-awareness, and increasing the pupil's sense of well-being. Following field testing, activities were examined in light of teachers' comments and suggestions, with new ideas and activities added.

        "description":"During the first decade as a republic we have made some great strides in education, but in certain respects we have also fallen behind. As there are differences of opinion about what our most urgent educational priorities are, I have tried to make this a balance sheet, showing assets and liabilities without pronouncing judgment on which side is the greater. There has been one overriding and permanent gain during the past decade: there is a greater appreciation throughout the land of the importance of education as one of organized society's chief concerns. As yet, spending on education has not accordingly increased. In 1971, the Human Sciences Research Council calculated that during the 10 years ended in 1967, government spending increased at the rate of 9.6 percent per annum,  education spending at the rate of 9 percent per annum. We are at present spending about 4 percent of our gross national income on education. This is the same percentage we spent in 1953. Undoubtedly, much more could be improved if more money became available for education. Only a shortage of funds has caused a fairly considerable lag in providing school buildings for white children in the Transvaal. An even more serious shortage of accommodation exists in colored schools, where the number of pupils accommodated in double sessions has trebled in four years. (Author/JM)",

This is done to provide a systematic measure of our economic standing as a people. The bureau makes its record in two ways. First, every 10 years in the census, people are asked how much income they received in the year before Census Day which came on April first in 1970. And second, every year a sample of the U.S. population is asked about income received the previous year. This sample survey, as it is called, provides an annual record of income in the years between censuses. In 1971, median family money income rose above $10,000 a year for the first time. Allowing for inflation, the median family income figure in 1969 was nearly double the 1959 median. The Northeast had the highest  regional family income in 1971. However, the West and the North Central States were close to that level. Although lowest among the regions in median family income, the South showed the greatest income gain between 1960 and 1970. To measure the low-income group, an income scale is used that varies with a family's residence, number of persons in the family, and yearly changes in the cost of living. Those getting less than this scale are said to be below the low-income or poverty line. In 1971, the low-income line for a nonfarm family of four was $4,140. (Author/JM)",

We then studied their families to see if we cound find specific and perhaps unique correlations between the children's personalities and the familial milieu. Our preschool nursery operated in four converted apartments of a public housing development on the near West side of Chicago, an area that had been exclusively black for many years. After watching the children in a classroom and observing them in free play, we decided to group the children into three categories on the basis of our  clinical assessment of each child's competence, i.e., highly, moderately, or low competent. Our clinical background suggested that play interviews are most effective in assessing four-year-old children. On the basis of a semi-structured play interview, we were able to divide the children into three competence groupings. We examined the factors within the play interviews which contributed to our competence judgments and found it useful to consider three particular aspects of the child's play: organization, interpersonal skills, and content themes.

Over the past nine years, comprehensive evaluations of Philadelphis's Title I program have been undertaken both systemwide and project by project. They reveal that, although relatively new, Title I projects have enabled administrators and teachers to create favorable learning environments, and to reverse some of the historic trends toward drastic pupil underachievement. Our evaluations indicate also that  parental participation and positive community attitudes have increased dramatically. This volume contains the technical reports of individual Title I project evaluations. It contains extensive information about each project's rationale, expected outcomes, mode of operation, previous evaluative findings, current implementation, and attainment of its objectives.

Cahill, the New Jersey Supreme Court directed the Legislature to define the Constitutional phrase, &quot;thorough and efficient education,&quot; and to develop a system of financing the public schools that would ensure such an education to all New Jersey citizens. As a result of this decision, equal educational opportunity can become a reality in the state. But the burden is on the Legislature. What is done there will determine in large measure how soon and to what extent that goal will be achieved. This study is intended to point out the general areas in which the Legislature should act, as well as to offer models for specific legislation to deal with the educational needs of urban schools. The first section of the study concerns the problem of defining thorough and  efficient education, and the second presents some alternatives for funding. But legislative action in these areas would not be sufficient to assure the development and continuance of thorough and efficient education. Thus, the third section deals with assessment and accountability, and the fourth with corrective action. The second section provides model statutes and bills from other states. Although a number of states have made significant steps in one or more areas, the New Jersey Legislature has a unique opportunity of creating an overall approach to education. (Author/JM)",

Its major features include: equal tuition grants to all children; compensatory grants to the disadvantaged child; tuition maximum equal to the voucher value in all eligible schools; no parental supplementation of vouchers permitted; and, seats apportioned 50 percent by nondiscriminatory standard, 50 percent by lottery of their applicants. The advantages of voucher education are found to include the following: Halting the present situation in which only the rich and those with support from religious institutions can escape public schools, and in which economic class separation is made easy. Increasing economic and political power of individuals over their  children's education. Making possible not only geographically decentralized schools, but school communities based on many other shared values. Providing effective means for preventing racial and economic discrimination and for insuring the presence of adequate resources for all school children. Four other advantages are given.

        "description":"Public schools in New Jersey are financed primarily by local property taxes. This system of finance is unconstitutional, according to the New Jersey Supreme Court, and therefore it must be revised. The proposals for revision range from very slight increases in state school aid to complete state financing of schools, but all of the proposals shift at least part of the burden of school finance from local property taxes to state taxes. Thus, all of the proposals for revision provide some relief from property taxes. This paper examines the economic effects of this property tax relief, especially the effects on our hard-pressed central cities. The current system of school finance in New Jersey is unfair primarily because some school districts receive an excessive share of  non-residential property taxes. It is also unfair because it encourages exclusionary zoning and because Federal tax laws treat homeowners and renters differently. It is inefficient because the property tax, despite its appeal as a revenue source, has undesirable long-run effects on the growth of central cities. An increase in state aid to schools would reduce these inequities and inefficiencies in proportion to the size of the increase. In particular, more state aid would lower property taxes, raise property values, lower rents, and help revitalize our dying cities. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The Philadelphia experience very strongly indicates that at least in Philadelphia, and very probably in most large cities in the northeastern U.S., several factors--notably the geographic separation of the races within the city and the existence of a sizable non-public school system (Usually (Usually parochial)--preclude the effective desegregation of the public schools without large scale busing of the pupils or without some kind of mixing of white suburban populations with black central city populations. Thus, those who espouse the use of desegregation tools such as changing feeder areas, pairing adjacent schools, and offering voluntary magnet programs at particular locations to achieve racial balance in the public schools of such cities may well be deluding themselves. As of  mid-February 1975, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission is attempting to develop a desegregation plan for the Philadelphia schools. At the same time, the school district staff committee is also preparing a plan which will contain several elements from previous plans as well as the 'Academy' concept. The situation at the present time represents a significant departure in that this is the first time that the Commission has been ordered to prepare a plan. Previously, the Commission's role has been simply to review the plans prepared by the school district. (Author/JM)",

In late August, 1974, letters were sent to prospective reviewers asking them to participate. Twenty-two of the 25 prospective reviewers outside of USCCR agreed. Nineteen of the 22 outside reviewers submitted comments. One additional outside reviewer was contacted and submitted his comments. This summary is based on the feedback provided by those 26 reviewers. When the study design documents were sent to the reviewers, an  evaluation questionnaire was attached. The reviewers were asked to answer the 27 multiple choice questions, to add any needed clarifying comments in the spaces provided after each question, and to write up to six single spaced typed pages of additonal comments addressing any issues they thought to be important. The responses of each respondent to the 27 questions are given, as are the average rating for each reviewer, for each group, and for all groups together. Those results are briefly discussed and then the narrative comments made by each reviewer are summarized. (Author/JM)",

Despite the fact  that there are areas of clear disagreement, there are also areas of clear agreement. There is disagreement about whether the Commission should try to implement a study based on the Rand design. There seems to be fairly strong agreement that the Rand study, and perhaps any feasible study, will not produce many unambiguous answers to important policy questions, but a majority of the reviewers also felt that such a study could provide more reliable answers than are presently available to some of those questions.

A selection committee unanimously agreed that the proposal from the Rand Corporation was superior to the others, and in June 1973 a contract was signed with that organization. The final draft of the documents which delineate Rand's design were delivered to the Commission in September 1974. The documents were subsequently reviewed by a total of 26 persons, who can roughly be divided into four broad categories; Desegregation and Minority Student Education Experts, Distinguished Social Scientists, Federal Officials Resonsible for Desegregation Research, and U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Staff Members. All reviewers  were asked to answer a 27 question multiple choice evaluation questionnaire and to prepare additional written comments. The four multiple choice response categories were: quite good, moderately good, moderately poor and quite poor. These were coded as 1.0 through 4.0, respectively. The overall average rating was 2.37. The written comments of the reviewers reflected a wide range of opinions. Taken as a whole the evaluation of the reviewers suggests caution in using the design, without modification, as a guide for a research study. (Author/JM)",

Its largest single effort to help resolve school desegregation-related problems took place in a six-month period between August 1970 and February 1971. During that brief period, the service assigned 47 professionals to help school officials in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, and Texas to move from dual to unitary school systems. This program included: conducting activities that would promote the easing of community tensions; helping to create and promote programs and activities dealing  positively with problems incidental to desegregation; and functioning as liaison between all Federal agencies and offices with litigative responsibilities regarding desegregation and the involved school districts. Based on this experience with desegregation, if Boston is a tip-off of what is likely to happen in other northern school systems, then there is nothing in the South that is going to match that. Like it or not, come September many northern school systems are going to be desegregated. It would therefore behoove them to get on with the job which lies ahead. (Author/JM)",

And I was also to experience the immense distress of a disintegrating community. Throughout this time I was trying to encourage a climate in which each could articulate his aims and receive feedback about his behavior and his effects on others. As the book shows, my theory about what it meant to organize a school collaboratively developed important new facets  both during and after the program, eventuating in a theory of historical stages of development reported toward the end of the book. In the final chapters I return to a fuller sketch of the meaning of an approach to experience which [he] has termed 'inquiry-in-action' and 'action science.' I have relegated many traditional social science measuring techniques to relatively low visibility in this study, although interview results, questionnaire analyses, and behavior scoring schemes applied to taped conservations all appear at critical points to add persepective to the events.&quot; (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In New York the private and benevolent Free School Society began operations in 1805 because there were too few schools for the poor in the city, and it treated education as a regular separation from a seductive yet frightening world. Perhaps the most neglected and misunderstood period in the history of an organization whose activities have been examined by many scholars, the years between 1826 and 1832, stand as the Society's most vigorous time of internal change. It was then that the Society first thought to modify its practice of the Lancastrian system and began to offer special infant classes for the poor children of the city under six. Behind these reforms was an ill-fated attempt to make the Society's schools appealing and common to all instead of primarily for the poor, an  experiment which proved both unworkable and detrimental to the trustees' conception of their schools as sanctuaries for preparing children to cope with a disorderly world. In the late 1820's when the Society experimented with common schools and infant education, there was some strong sentiment among the trustees for making education a more heterogeneous, open, and stimulating experience. But the trustees' anxieties about the changes taking place in New York inclined them after only a brief fling at reform to return almost completely to their original refuge mentality. (Author/JM)",

Thirty eight teachers in Minco, El Reno, and Yukon participated in the project in 1971-72, 31 in 1972-73 and 30 in 1973-74. A target population consisting of grades two and five, eighth grade math and tenth grade language involved 1600 scholastics in 1971-72, 1200 in 1972-73 and 994 in 1973-74. The defined parts of &quot;target population&quot; were realistically evaluated in terms of measurements with a high degree of  success as well as positive reinforcement of the staff for continuation and expansion. Considering the present status of the project, all tests have been administered and students' gains and teacher payments have been established for each teacher's class. In-service training sessions have been held to assist the teachers in preparing for parental conferences and the ideographic learning characteristics of students. Conferences with teachers have been held to explain the purposes of the program. (Author/JM)",

Regardless of language dominance, the signs, objects, and pictures around the room were labeled in both English and Spanish. Through the use of two languages as means of instruction, the goal of the program is the  development of a learning program which will allow students to become proficient in comprehension, speaking and reading in both English and Spanish. The curriculum of the Bilingual Mini School focused not only on academic achievement but also on the cultural development of participating students.

Until such time that the State can demonstrate unequivocally that their statewide testing and evaluation program is fair to all groups, and that every student has had an equal exposure to quality school environments before evaluation then there should be a moratorium on testing. The State should establish a task force for the development of an Office of Consumer Affairs in Testing and Student Evaluation. The State should establish a Research and Development Office which will have the latitude to study empirical questions of teacher and pupil performance. It is most important that evaluative agencies recognize that tests and their ensuing social judgments  are instruments of racism by virtue of minority exclusion in all phases of test utilizations. Moreover since minorities have limited access to the opportunity (mainstream) structures of this society, much less policy making positions, it is obvious that decisions on criterion variables (job or education) have negligible minority inputs. Since racism has been an integral characteristic of the power brokers in this country, and the testing industry caters to the power brokers, there is no reason to assume that testing has the best interests of minorities at heart.

        "description":"To ascertain whether Title III, 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act, had affected the educational programs of the public schools in Mississippi, only that data which dealt directly with the implementation and operation of a project were utilized as sources of information. Included in the data sources were the initial proposals submitted for funding, continuation requests, end of project reports, on-site evaluation reports, and a survey sent to each project. The latter was a questionnaire involving these areas: continuation of activities, adoption of project by other schools, initiation of new or different techniques into the school system, utilization of instructional materials developed within the project, and contribution of Title III to the educational program in  Mississippi. From the information presented in reports from the different projects, treated individually in the text of the document, there seemed to be this consensus: Title III projects have made a difference in the educational programs of the public schools. In some of the schools the Title III project represented the first time certain techniques and/or activities had been implemented in Mississippi. Opportunities for experimentation and exploration, for learning new techniques, and for making indepth studies were considered as valuable adjuncts of the Title III program. (Author/JM)",

The E.S.E.A. Title III program is intended both to support vitally needed supplementary services as well as to encourage innovative and exemplary applications of new knowledge in schools throughout Arizona. An important facet of any program is the revelation of these programs throughout our educational community, the State of Arizona. Thus, a major thrust of E.S.E.A. Title III is to disseminate among education decision makers information relating to new and innovative programs, treated  individually in the text of this document. It is with the dissemination purpose in mind that the Department of Education is sharing with you &quot;Innovations in Education.&quot; The information contained in this publication should aid in creating an awareness of educational need, some solutions utilized by various districts toward meeting these needs, and to further stimulate formulation of imaginative programs which might further the education opportunities for students in Arizona.

Canton Municipal Separate School District is organized into four schools. Two schools include grades one through three; one school includes grades four through six; and one school includes grades seven through 12. The total student body is a little less than 4000 and is approximately 95 percent black.  Project LEARN was an outgrowth of the realization of two facts: (1) that students in the Canton Public Schools were, as a whole, performing far below national averages, as determined by standardized achievement tests; (2) that students have individual differences and needs as they vary in backgrounds, abilities, interests, and experiences. Based on the organization of the school system, it was decided that the first, the fourth, and the eighth grades would be logical levels at which students should be studied in an effort to determine their strengths and weaknesses and to prescribe suitable programs of learning activities.

        "description":"An effective and almost cost-free approach to the identification and amelioration of critical needs and problems of pupils, an approach developed and tested by the Consortium of Laboratory Schools of the Academic Affairs Conference of Midwestern Universities, is designed to help teachers identify through a special survey instrument the needs and problems which their pupils may have to an unusual degree, and encourage teachers to develop remedial and intervention strategies and techniques which they can apply in their own classrooms. Thus far four promising intervention procedures which teachers may select have been studied. They are: (1) Teacher(s) work intensively with a single child. (2) Teacher(s) work intensively with small groups of children with similar needs. (3)  Teacher(s) work cooperatively with parent(s) to resolve problems of their son or daughter. (4) Marshalling peer support to aid the pupils; pupils interact in discussions. Preliminary data based on the results from a random group of problems dealt with by these approaches indicated approximately two-thirds of the pupils can be expected to show some improvement. Needs and concerns are felt to be much broader than reading, writing and arithmetic; however, personal problems of pupils, such as being rejected by one's peers, being unhappy in school or having peer work and study skills, have a direct bearing on the successful mastery of academic skills.

The studies were initiated mainly at the request of policy makers in the Delta and Ozarks areas of Arkansas. Several writers have suggested that &quot;culture of poverty&quot; is a major deterrent to upward job mobility of the economically deprived. Responses to scales, and related questions, by low income groups in both regions gave little support to the &quot;culture of poverty&quot; explanation. Rather, tangible factors such as lack of suitable transportation and poor health were clearly evident. The phenomenon of high labor turnover was also clearly evident. Efforts to explain the high rates were applied to a sample of persons in the Delta.  Test questions, formulated by Herzberg in the management field, were used to see what was causing job satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The finding was that preconditions for employee satisfaction were available, but the motivators (praise, recognition, etc.) that release the better and best efforts of employees seemed to be at a low level. The evidence pointed to the need for consultants to work especially with supervisors of factory workers to create a work environment with improved social aspects. Rural industrialization cannot be viewed as a cure-all for the poverty problems of rural areas. (Author/JM)",

Because of the complex origins of child abuse, however, and of the institutional and social changes which shall have to accompany excellent practice if child abuse is effectively to be treated and prevented, issues of program and policy development are also addressed. The knowledge base about child abuse is conceptually and methodically limited. Our understanding of the problem of child abuse is broadened by several recent descriptive reports which demonstrate that childhood accidents and child abuse are temporally associated, that the parents of abused children are rarely neurotic or psychotic, and that the developmental  sequelae of child abuse and neglect are serious. Child abuse has also been observed to be associated with poverty, low birth weight, parental alcohol and drug abuse, crime, social isolation, marital stress, and unemployment. The coordinated, interdisciplinary management of child abuse may reduce the toll of reinjury while children stay in their own homes. A helpful integrating concept in the diagnosis and treatment of child abuse is the family's capacity to protect its child, either from the consequences of their own angry feelings toward him, or from the hazards of his nuturing environment.

This serves as an indicator to the reader of what kind of sources may be valuable to a given local low-income housing dispersal plan or strategy. There has historically been an overall spatial imbalance in the location of low-income households in our nation's larger cities. The relative concentration of below poverty level households has recently become viewed by a growing number of sociologists and urban planners as a major inhibiter to the fulfillment of the long-established goal: &quot;A decent home for every family.&quot;  The so-called &quot;Dayton Plan,&quot; the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Council of Government's &quot;Fair-share&quot; formula and the Minneapolis-St. Paul &quot;priority plan&quot; are several of the more famous examples of governmental attempts at dispersing low-income households to non-or-little income-integrated areas, including suburban and urban fringe areas. The enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 will reinstate federal housing subsidy programs whereby city governments will need to make obvious considerations to new future low income housing locations in order to become eligible.

Major questions focused on ascertaining if: (1) self-concept developments of a sample of entering students were less favorable than those of the general population, (2) self-concept could be improved through the group counseling technique employed, and (3) improvement in self-concept differed between an eclectic cognitive cycle and two reference groups. Secondary questions regarding the effect of treatment on interpersonal and intrapersonal facility were also addressed. Subjects were drawn from students in the program and were  assigned to various group counseling situations. Results are discussed in terms of differences between experimental subjects' entry scores and TSCS norms, differences between pre- and post-treatment TSCS scores and selected POI scales, comparison between treatment and reference groups on indicators of self-concept development, development of interpersonal and intrapersonal facility, and comparison between groups on these variables. Overall conclusions are that experimental subjects experience subnormal self-concept development at initiation of treatment, that counseling treatment positively impacts self-perception, and that the strongest impact is found in the theory focused group.

        "description":"The report gives the results of a canonical correlation analysis of the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire, Form E (16PF) and Personal Orientation Inventory (POI) scores for 299 Mountain-Plains students. The focus of the study was on population characteristic identification emerging from the canonical sets of the merged instrument descriptions. Two tables show canonical R's on the 16PF and POI scales for Mountain-Plains students and weights for canonical factors from the POI and 16PF scales. Results indicate considerable mutual validity for the scale descriptions. They are also seen to define generally unfavorable types in the population surveyed. The basic value of the study is confirmatory as regards program design in, and program emphasis on, affective development. A  secondary value will be assisting counselors in test interpretation. The authors indicate that the report should be viewed as a data summary since the format and indepth consideration for a formal research report have not yet been pursued. (NH)",

In the cognitive area a criterion-referenced approach will be used, in spite of problems associated with reliability. Item pools will be developed at the Learning Activity Packages (LAP) level. Then unit tests will be developed and matched with a performance test which will be scored dichotomously. A phi coefficient will be computed to establish the degree of correlation between the two tests. In those cognitive areas for which performance tests would be difficult or impossible to develop, attitude scales will be administered before and after classroom work. Finally a  comprehensive diagnostic test will be developed to be used as a pre- and posttest, and validated through the performance test at the unit level. Attitude scales will be developed for the testing program in the affective area. Initial items should be administered to all applicants to the Mountain-Plains program, thus providing scores for students and controls. Students should be retested when they leave, controls after the same time interval, and followup retesting carried out later on both groups. (SA)",

The factor structure was compared with that of a similar study of college students. Tables show factor loadings for 12 POI scales for both studies and partial correlation matrixes for the POI scales characterizing the three factors. Findings indicate that dimensions of positive mental health do not seem to differ markedly between college students (a young population heavily weighed with advantaged persons) and Mountain-Plains students (an older population that is 100 percent disadvantaged). The findings of highly similar factors in the two  studies is of particular importance to persons working with populations dissimilar to the largely collegiate group which has been the predominant focus of POI research. Persons dealing with other ages and social classes can now more confidently use the POI. A POI scale intercorrelation matrix for the 397 students and POI scale description are appended. (Author/NH)",

This was accomplished by comparing aspects of the seven programs by way of: (1) a collection and review of available literature and reports, (2) site visitations to four programs, and (3) personal contact with the Federal-level sponsoring agencies of the six other programs to determine their perceptions of the programs. These six programs are: Arizona Job Colleges, Inc.; Choanoke Area Development Association, Inc.--Family Development Program; Manpower Education and Training, Inc. (all sponsored by the Office of Economic Opportunity); and the United Tribes, Roswell, and Madera Employment  Training Centers (all sponsored by the Bureau of Indian Affairs). All seven programs are described and compared in the areas of history, governance, location, facilities, management/staffing/budget, target population/capacity, recruitment/placement, program, program support, research/evaluation, costs, relationship with other agencies, and plans for continuance. The study concludes that CEM4 as operated by Mountain-Plains represents the most advanced stage of the family residential educational concept and that its systematic research approach possesses the capability of revealing the concept's true worth.

Sample control and experimental student groups, randomly selected from the participating schools, were established at seven of the schools. The student population was predominantly black with 50 percent qualifying for educational aid for the disadvantaged. Career simulations were used with each experimental group while each control group was conducted with the visual format; both groups in each school were conducted by the same  teacher. Residual effects on students were measured by the results of pretesting (October 1972) and posttesting (January 1973) using Crites Vocational Development Inventory. Statistically significant differences between experimental and control groups were indicated in five of the seven schools; teachers participating in the workshop were able to produce &quot;positive change&quot; in student vocational maturity scores. Workshop participants viewed the workshop positively and reported followup implementation in career simulations.

The results indicated that the salary schedule resulted in the lowest performance and attitudes. Performance was best under the variable ratio-variable amount schedule, while attitudes were best under the fixed ratio schedule.

        "description":"The study surveyed the perceptions of selected male public senior secondary students relative to the specialized and comprehensive types of public two year post-secondary schools in Minnesota. Their perceptions of both school related and non-school related factors were determined. Further, the relative importance of these two types of factors, as perceived by the students, was investigated. The survey instrument, used in three schools, measured student perceptions concerning the students' preferred school, attendance patterns, educational program patterns, and school factor and non-school factor importance. The data are analyzed and described separately for the vocational-technical and non-vocational-technical students within each high school. Findings are tabulated and  discussed. Appended materials make up three-fourths of the document and include: (1) definitions of terms, school factors and non-school factors, (2) the research instrument, (3) tabulated research data, and (4) publications list.

Through the analysis of data from two samples, one drawn from New York City and the other from the entire nation, the document explores the determinants of worker &quot;attachment&quot; and the patterns and degree of upward mobility. The document includes a summary of the literature on internal mobility and related questions, discusses the data used (derived from the Continuous Work History Sample of the Social Security Administration), presents findings on the attachment and advancement patterns of low-income workers, and analyzes mobility patterns in three New York City industries (banking, general merchandising  stores, and apparel manufacturing). Major findings are summarized in terms of attachment patterns as related to sex, race, and age and advancement patterns. Findings noted as significant were the high degree of firm and industry attachment exhibited by females, particularly in the garment industry, and the success of males in raising their incomes. Implications for manpower policy, and suggested directions for further research conclude the document. Appended is a four-page bibliography. (Author/BP)",

The aim of the mobility project was to intervene in the migration patterns of the State so that the routes led west to North Carolina's own urban centers rather than out of the State. The document discusses: (1) the target and supply areas, (2) the effects of the Department of Labor's guidelines for target population recruitment and selection, and (3) the program's administration and operation in relation to staff functions, the mobility recruiting process, job development for relocated workers, financial assistance, and  housing (temporary and permanent). Briefly summarized are two studies--Workers Eligible But Not Interested in Relocation, and Linkages with Training Programs--and two reports--An Evaluation of the Mobility Project by Paul Johnson, and The Consultants Report to North Carolina Mobility Project by Priscilla TenPas. Findings indicate that most relocated workers were pleased with the results of their move, employers reacted positively to the program, and subsidized relocation is an important method of matching available workers with available jobs.

Case histories support the fulfillment of those purposes. There are basic methods to help the teacher use language experience and integrate it into an on-going adult reading program. The methods used at the Community Learning Center in Cambridge, Mass. are: dictation, transcription, directed writing, and free writing. Each method has certain advantages and disadvantages, and these are explained. The center places emphasis on student-created materials. They can be used to develop skill in sight vocabulary, phonic analysis,  structural analysis, and comprehension. Specific steps a teacher can employ in the use of student-created materials are presented in a case-study format. The document's appendix, \"Some Writing Ideas,\" presents several themes that were used to initiate writing exercises, explains the classroom context in which they were used, provides examples, and comments on some of the outcomes.

Teaching resources are varied. The Model Cities program is the basic source for CLC funding; the Cambridge Public Library is the center's local sponsor. The external bureaucratic framework needs improving, but the internal framework works very well. Obtaining a balance between guiding and caring and between the need for skills and for social growth provides the best environment in which adults can learn--achieving that balance is the center's purpose and process. CLC's operational viability is one of the strongest elements in its evaluation; it does need more male teachers, however. Evaluation of student progress and teaching  performance is in keeping with the center's atmosphere and takes the form of informal, day-to-day feedback. The students view their experience with the center, its programs, and staff as personally rewarding. The center has a good relationship with the community but could involve community members to a greater degree. Generally, CLC is an effective educational organization. The challenge rests in maintaining its effectiveness as it reaches out to a larger population group. (AG)",

Two assumptions are basic to the establishment of a career-oriented, multi-district program: (1) that such a curriculum will help students realize their career aspirations, and (2) that cooperation between school districts will result in a program with sufficient resources to offer a curriculum with both breadth and depth. Essential steps in program development are the assessment of students' interests and needs, and the assessment of each party's readiness to join a cooperative program. A readiness assessment instrument is offered, based on 15 factors  identified as critical to the success of the undertaking. The planning stage involves consideration of program objectives, structural organization, roles and responsibilities, and staff development. Operational tasks should be considered in terms of both the scheduling of and responsibility for specific tasks. Evaluation should be both summative and formative and should consider aims, responsibilities, and methods.

        "description":"That adults learn what they need and want to learn is as true for continuing education in the ministry as in other fields, and the question of motivation for continuing education is crucial. Significant clues to motivation can be found in the close relationship between learning and work, in personal and corporate growth, and in collegiality (sharing talents individually and collectively). We hunger to know as avidly as we hunger for air and food, therefore motivation for education is not something to be injected from without. It is a powerfully innate force which, on occasion, needs to be awakened, nourished, and channeled into learning activities which will increase competence. What conditions most vitally affect motivation? Probably most important are personal growth; necessary  time and money; reinterpretation or a new understanding of continuing education; supportive relationships and accountability (which might also be expressed as recognition and evaluation); and counsel in establishing priorities, in finding the needed learning experience, and in long-range planning. Comprehensive support systems for career development, programs which will initiate and nourish personal growth, starting point strategies, and assistance in planning should be within reach. Finally a basic faith response to life may be necessary to release motivation. (Author/NH)",

A regional approach to needs assessment was thought by four to be useful; six, perhaps; and seven, no.  Of the seven methods of needs assessment, informal feedback was used the most by both program categories. Other methods used were: formal citizens advisory council, analysis of State/national needs and interests, written surveys, contact with helping people, review of local mass media, and campus faculty/administration continuing education advisory council.

        "description":"The positive experiences of one disaffected teenager in an Experience-Based Career Education (EBCE) Program demonstrate the characteristics of an emerging program significantly different from the traditional high school; these characteristics include: a clinical mode of operation based on study and diagnosis of student needs; flexibility; cooperative analysis to select learning experiences for &quot;goodness of fit;&quot; individualization; a curriculum which defines only areas in which knowledge or proficiencies must be attained; a systemic approach which relates all the parts to the student's life-goals; use of media and technology; and a record system serving the developmental needs of the program. Community involvement, integrated guidance and counseling, and coordinated teamwork are  other important characteristics of the program. Essential problems result from the fact that it is only a partial model, rather than a complete plan for the continuous education of children. The Comprehensive Career Education Model (CCEM) is not competitive with EBCE; they can exist within the same organization and can be mutually reinforcing, once several diverse problems are resolved. Chief among these is the stabilization of EBCE, and its incorporation into the public schools as the developmental stage is completed and the program enters phases of normal funding and mass participation.

        "description":"President Ford's pledge to bring education and employers together in a new climate of credibility requires the cooperative planning of the Departments of Health, Education, and Welfare; Commerce; and Labor. Sidney P. Marland's idea of career education is receiving a new thrust. The concept of completing an education within a certain time span is out-dated. Proper emotional preparation for work as well as goal-centered plans for today's youth will involve planning from business, industry, and education. Proper occupational guidance is a basic need; career education will expose the world of work to students in the early years of their formal education. The idea of work must be central to education, and young people must be trained to think in terms of employment, yet never losing  recognition of the fact that it is the individual's view of his productivity that is fundamental to the career education concept. The cooperation of the three Federal departments is an illustration of Federal leadership to hasten cooperative efforts at the local level to develop in young Americans a sense of what work means, skill in decision making to prepare for work, and ability to find a job.

Phase two involved assessment of the vocational interests of a sample of 929 students (grades 9-12) in the Mid-Plains area. Phase three included assessment of occupational  opportunities by sampling employers in the area (827 responding) and investigation of alternative possibilities for cooperative education. The final phase was development of a plan for the provision of a cooperative education program for the Mid-Plains Technical Community College area, based on the data gathered in the first three phases.

Two complementary studies make up the bulk of the document, a general survey by W. R. Bohning (The Economic Effects of the Employment of Foreign Workers: With Special Reference to the Labor Markets of Western Europe's Post Industrial Countries) which takes as its conceptual framework the process of &quot;self-feeding&quot; immigration, and a more specific study by Dennis Maillot  (The Economic Effects of the Employment of Foreign Workers: The Case of Switzerland) attempting to integrate immigration into the development of the Swiss labor market and production apparatus. Discussion of the two studies focuses on the relationships between immigration and employment, mobility, inflation, income distribution, and the productive apparatus; and on foreign manpower and mobility mechanisms, the role of the salary range, and demand on social capital.

The initial impetus for the development of a preretirement program may come from any source: union officials, union members, company officials, community agencies, those recently retired, or even an outside agency. The first step is the formation of a special committee to develop a preretirement program. The committee performs a number of functions: (1)  recruitment of the persons expecting to retire in the next five years, (2) selection of a meeting place, (3) planning for subject matter and locating resource persons.

Included are a brief description of the project and an examination of the various operation activities; components, the development of nine objectives, their status, and their disposition; financial verification; and a projection. The document serves as a clear indicator of both the successes and difficulties encountered during the second operational year and what has been accomplished to date. The project was designed as an experimental program to help develop in-house, on-going programs in institutions and agencies which serve the handicapped and disadvantaged. Four mobile laboratories (business education, small engine repair, distributive  education, and vocational education) are staffed with teachers and aides, and deliver an alternative system of audiovisual, self-paced, individualized instruction which provides the stimuli for learning experiences involving personal interaction, exposure, training, and evaluation. The Project MODEL summer workshop attempted to (1) maintain and repair the mobile units' interiors and exteriors, (2) review the usage and operation of all audiovisual equipment, and (3) computerize the description of its instructional programs in cooperation with Project CAREER. Appended are tables showing student characteristics and services provided. (Author/BP)",

Volume One of the report provides an overview of the health manpower analysis areas discussed in relation to the demand for and supply of health manpower services. The characteristics of 56 models (described in detail in Volume Two) are outlined by way of an overview and a discussion of their applicability to health manpower analysis problems. A detailed description and evaluation of the two  large scale models follows (the Preliminary Operational Human Resources Research Center Microsimulation Model and the Simulation of Hospital Utilization and Health Manpower Requirements Model). The lengthy analysis is concluded with a presentation of 14 major conclusions based on the results of the study. Three principal recommendations are outlined. (SA)",

Four different types of employability profiles are analyzed and applied to career education curricula: (1) screening, (2) checklisting, (3) individualizing, and (4) multi-occ-ing. A systems approach (objectives, evaluations, resources) is presented to simplify the development of career path employability profiles in the typical school setting.

Data were collected from a sample of men in an institutional training program. Measures were constructed to tap four components of future achievement orientation: (1) a dispositional motive, (2) a capacity or tendency to plan, (3) the incentive value of future goals, and (4) expectations about the future. Four measures were selected on the basis of internal consistency, stability, and association with achievement related behavior. Five patterns of the motive, planning, and  expectancy measures were recoded into a Future Pattern predictor. A Multiple Classification Analysis program was used to assess the predictive validity of the measures of individual components of future achievement orientation and the Future Pattern variable for (1) training outcomes, (2) employment and wage rate at different times, and (3) job search activity. Training outcomes were predicted by all component measures and the Future Pattern variable. The implications of the findings for training and manpower policy are discussed at length. (Author/NH)",

The study was conducted to obtain a comprehensive analysis of the occupations and the competencies needed to enter, perform, and advance in agricultural and agriculturally related jobs. The four job titles were decided upon after consultation with agencies and groups in Montana whose concern was agricultural resources. Competency statements were developed and mailed to 120 employees in the job area studied. Based on an 82 percent response, data on knowledge, skills, and attitudes were analyzed and mean rating comparisons made.  Tables list and rank the competencies identified. The number of competencies identified varied among the selected job titles, but the study concluded there are definite professional, technical, and vocational competencies related to agriculture required by employees in agriculture resources job titles. Interpersonal competence ranks high across all the titles; other competencies have more specialized importance in a particular area.

The study was conducted to obtain information which would identify the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed by employees in selected job titles in the aforementioned industries in Montana. This was done through the use of competency statements, a competency instrument, and rating sheets used by trained interviewers. Responses were obtained from employees or supervisors, coded, and mean ratings were determined and ranked. The probability values were also ranked. The results of the rankings of personal qualities competencies, supervisor competencies, and the selected job title  competencies are presented in table form. It was concluded that the research model satisfactorily yielded the data necessary for the purpose of the study. It was also concluded that, although the competencies for the job titles were defined broadly, the competencies rated were important to the particular job titles studied. The need for various competencies varied across the four industries--some were common to all, others were more specific.

Completed questionnaires were received from 1,843 (54 percent) of the university faculty. Approximately 25 percent of the respondents requested special consultation about the service, suggested as being perhaps the most consequential finding of the study. Responses are tabulated and discussed in the areas of: major university responsibilities of respondents; faculty familiarity with audiovisual (AV) library resources; faculty usage of AV resources; departmental ownership of AV software and hardware by proportion of respondents;  faculty familiarity with departmental budgets and procedures for AV rental fees; faculty familiarity with sources of funding from other than university sources for AV materials and equipment; the limitation of AV use as a result of limited departmental budgets; budgetary arrangements preferred to the current ones; experience with specialized materials preparation; requests for specialized library or market searches for AV materials; rating of the service since reorganization; and classification of detailed comments. The general conclusion was reached that responses to the faculty survey provide a current and solid base on which to improve the service. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"A pilot study was undertaken for the Community Relations Commission of the employment of non-English speaking immigrants in British industry, using open-ended interviews (21 at the management level, 15 others, and 128 immigrants). Objectives were (1) to investigate the impact on business organizations of employing non-English speaking immigrants and (2) to attempt to analyze the benefits and costs of providing language training, particularly at the company level. Problems of concern to management include the effects of lack of language on job entry and promotion, and the implications of language problems for industrial relations. In-company language training has not been general, has needed support from community leaders, and has been dependent for its success on the attitudes of  management at all levels. Analysis of costs and benefits (for the individual, society, and the company) indicates that the various benefits of in-company programs outweigh the costs. Concluding that language training is a factor which could contribute to avoiding future conflict and that unless top management recognizes the need efforts to promote in-company training may be frustrated, the need for urgent, positive action is emphasized, including the provision of major resources for further language training facilities for industry.

        "description":"In an industrial society, jobs and men can be conceived of as separate entities that are brought together through a matching process. In this paper the \"goodness-of-fit\" between the individual and the job is taken as problematic and is used as an explanatory concept for both the reactions of individuals to their jobs (job satisfaction, stress, turnover) and for the response of the organization to characteristics of its members (conflict, need for control and communication). It is argued that the distribution of jobs according to characteristics sought out by individuals in the matching process (such as status, income, autonomy) is determined quite independently from the forces that determine the supply of individuals according to the value they place on various characteristics of  jobs and the skills they possess. In the matching process the outcome is determined by the relative bargaining power of individuals and organizations and the distribution of information about jobs and men. The psychological impact of discrepancies between jobs and men on individuals is analyzed as well as the reaction of organizations to various types of discrepancies. (Author)",

Results indicate that kinds of employment differ greatly for different educational levels and between the sexes. The distribution of people's aspirations resembles the distribution of actual employment with some notable exceptions. Results also indicate that the use of sex-based interest inventory norms is unrealistic because they create distributions that diverge greatly from the distribution of actual employment.

The Southwestern Cooperative Educational Laboratory (SWCEL) ABE project for the Mexican-American community developed products of high technical quality, but local ABE programs have not used them in proportion to the investment. The Texas guidance and  counseling project to improve ABE counseling developed a product which has been used extensively in Region 6, but the project was unable to carry out successful dissemination efforts outside the region. Three local impact cases (Chinatown English Language Center, Lumbee Adult Education Project, and Program for the Spanish-Speaking Community) did not involve dissemination of outcomes because of their operational orientation.

Following a brief overview of the literature related to current vocational and consumer education programs is a description of the survey instrument and the study sample--two San Diego (California) County high schools representing upper-middle and lower-middle income communities. The survey instrument is included in the document and the resulting data analyzed and tabulated. The study concludes that substantial instruction is needed in the area of consumer education and more adequate counseling must be effected in assisting the student to make the college preparatory/vocational decision. Coordination of the consumer curriculum is needed.  Finally, it is determined that a coordinated, vertical career education program embracing all grade levels would reduce the incidence of misplaced education of the community's youth in preparation for their assumption of productive roles in the community.

        "description":"The essay reviews major components of the mentor role that a facilitator of adult learning should consider in the process of helping adults to learn. It contains suggestions about ways in which a facilitator can reflect on his practices and identify ideas that will help him to be more effective. To help the facilitator better understand adult learners, generalizations about the dynamics of adult learning are presented, and some of the organized knowledge regarding educational needs of adults is reviewed, grouped in relation to four concerns of facilitators: attraction, intake, support, and retention. Considerations related to the setting for learning are offered, and suggestions are made for the development of educational objectives. To assist the facilitator's selection of  appropriate learning activities, a table presents a classification of continuing education learning-teaching methods, and several types of learning episodes are described: seminars, workshops, case studies, buzz sessions, role-playing, T-groups, and simulation. The process of organizing learning activities is explored, and evaluation procedures are described. Eighteen steps are given that a facilitator might follow to obtain a comprehensive overview of a learning episode. In his conclusion, the author lists eight ways program administrators can assist facilitators of learning to become more effective. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"The document describes the activity, study, and research involving an experimental mobility project which, both by contract and philosophy, sought to assist those individuals in Upper Michigan with relocation and/or placement, who might otherwise have been unable to compete in the migration and economic patterns in the region. Data from extensive interviews with 1,500 clients, with an average followup period of four years, are analyzed to discern patterns of mobility and wage and employment outcomes, and personal and environmental characteristics associated with mobility decisions and outcomes. Multivariate analyses of the postprogram labor force experience of respondents and AID (Automatic Interaction Detector) analyses of conditional probability of relocation are additional  aspects of the study examined. It is concluded that the project has demonstrated the feasibility of subsidized relocation for differing groups and has provided the basis for replication of activities and outcomes. Net personal economic benefits associated with relocation are substantial and appear to be maintained even when long-term relocatees return to their home areas to work. Facsimilies of questionnaires, effects of nonresponse, and a glossary of terms are appended. (Author/MW)",

        "description":"Data on the nature of recruits' postservice occupational and educational plans, and on the influence that the first few weeks of military service have on such plans, were collected in March-June 1971 at Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force sites. One questionnaire was administered at the beginning and one near the end of basic training. Results show that most recruits planned to be working full-time one year after service, but were uncertain as to the type of work they would be doing. The data suggest that 30-40 percent of the men considered their initial assignment out of line with their job plans for one year after service. Results on occupational plans for age 35 closely paralleled those for one year after service, but the men seemed to be more definite about the kind of  work they would be doing. About 40 percent said that they planned to be attending college one year after leaving service. Results generally showed early service experience to have little, if any, impact on postservice vocational and educational plans. Appended materials include the survey instrument and additional information on data collection methods. (Author)",

        "description":"The study surveyed the postservice educational and occupational plans of 3,946 first-tour enlisted personnel nearing separation from military service. Data were collected using a questionnaire administered at military sites during September-December 1971. Analyses were made to characterize the postservice plans of the respondents and to identify correlates of these plans. A large majority of the men said they wanted to enter full-time employment soon after leaving the service. Almost half indicated they already had a part- or full-time job promised. Most men expected to be in full-time work one year postservice, but 4 out of 10 were not very definite about the type of work they would be in. Although most men expect to pursue full-time work, results show a widespread interest in  further training or education. The most prominent predictor of school versus work orientation for postservice plans is current educational level, although the relationship is not linear. Only about 1 of 4 men expected to use his military job training experience either in a civilian job or in related education or training. Appended are: lists and coding of variables, information related to data collection, the questionnaire, and intercorrelations of selected aspects of postservice plans. (Author/MW)",

        "description":"The research report provides information on recruits' military occupational preferences, match of military assignments to recruits' preferences, and changes that occur in these preferences between service entry and completion of basic training. Questionnaires were administered to recruits from four services just before classification interviewing and eight weeks later after initial military assignment. Small proportions of recruits' first choices were found to coincide with initial assignments in terms of Department of Defense (DOD) occupational groups. However, over 60 percent received assignments to DOD occupational areas to which they gave relatively high interest ratings. Perhaps, for this reason, most men expressed satisfaction with their initial assignments. Recruits  considered the services did relatively well in getting and using information on aptitudes and educational background, but not so well on getting and using information on preferences and preservice work. Recruits need improved knowledge of the military work areas. Appended materials include: (1) the vocational preference questionnaire, Army after-assignment questionnaire, and Army optical scan answer sheet; (2) additional information on data collection procedures; and (3) the military occupational area and occupational group lists for Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force.

Attention is drawn to the fundamental imbalances in the Irish economy--high unemployment, a trade deficit, considerable emigration, and inflationary pressures. The document presents the conclusions of the Manpower and Social Affairs Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as an introduction to the examiners' report. The following topics are examined: (1) economic background and the role of manpower policy, (2) manpower policies and the role of the Department of Labor, (3) the  administration of regional policy, (4) the National Employment Service, (5) manpower information, (6) training and education, and (7) manpower policy in Ireland--a concluding interpretation. The examination indicates that Irish manpower policy is being used to support economic development chiefly through measures to stimulate demand for labor by the industrial development program and to improve supply through the encouragement of training and the provision of an improved employment service.

In addition, the continuous learning year calendar introduces a multiple-entry concept which is unique at the college level. The basic design combines principles of term rotation with the student acceleration concept to provide the setting for a new work experience program plus a flexible student schedule. Traditional college vacations are replaced by a series of short vacations for students in designated streams or groups. At the Institute, student vacations follow 12-week learning periods. Other  variations of the plan, however, provide recess periods at the end of eight or nine weeks. To bring together sizeable orientation groups, the multiple entry aspect has been limited to 17 entries per calendar year; at maximum, 28 streams of students would have entered by the time the first entering stream is ready to graduate. A maximum of three streams of students would be in recess, five streams in some phase of work experience program, and no more than twenty streams on campus, at any given time. (Author/AJ)",

Adult-vocational programs showed enrollment increases; adult-agriculture program enrollments decreased. Special education programs and services were designed to aid 10,571 disadvantaged persons in achieving vocational-technical objectives; similar programs and services were designed for 1,744 handicapped persons. Occupational instructional areas were: agriculture, distributive education, health, office education, technical education, trades and industry, and home economics. The programs were offered at the post-secondary and adult levels. In addition to agriculture, adult programs in home economics  and distributive education showed declining enrollments. Federal funds were used for two categories of projects: non-continuing projects (construction and equipment) in the north and western portions of the State, and continuing projects in the southeast. Nine construction projects are described briefly, and activities in special programs (research, exemplary, and consumer and homemaking) are summarized. Highlights of exceptional or model programs are included in the report, as are comments on the organization of vocational youth organizations.

Three in-service training sessions are described: (1) socio-cultural-economic backgrounds of the Chinese,  Filipinos, Japanese, and Koreans; (2) the linguistic backgrounds of the Japanese and Koreans; and (3) the linguistic backgrounds of the Filipinos and Chinese. The instructional materials section provides phonological charts, structural charts, and a sample lesson.

The first-year report outlines five specific program goals and corresponding objectives: (1) to provide comprehensive counseling services; (2) to provide immediately useful English to newly immigrated families; (3) to institute unique  teaching methods for mini-units; (4) to disseminate program information and materials; and (5) to provide evaluation of the program. Also included are: program data, an English as a second language (ESL) placement test, a shopping questionnaire, Chinese language testing materials, program evaluation documents, sample forms, and mini-course descriptions.

        "description":"The Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) is a structured job analysis procedure that provides for the analysis of jobs in terms of each of 187 job elements, these job elements being grouped into six divisions: information input, mental processes, work output, relationships with other persons, job context, and other job characteristics. Two cluster analysis procedures were used in the clustering of jobs on the basis of data from the PAQ. The BC-TRY program was carried out with the 14 overall or general job dimensions as applied to a reasonable varied sample of 3,700 jobs and resulted in the identification of 33 job clusters. The CODAP (Coordinated Occupational Data Analysis Program) was based on the scores on 21 of the divisional job dimensions for a sample of 800 jobs, and  resulted in the identification of 45 clusters. The differences in the results may be due to the differences in the nature of the job dimensions used in the two instances, rather than being associated with the clustering procedures as such. The 95-page appendix contains the tables of data (15 pages) and line graphs for the job clusters resulting from the two programs. (Author/AG)",

        "description":"The study deals with the job component method of establishing compensation rates. The basic job analysis questionnaire used in the study was the Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) (Form B). On the basis of a principal components analysis of PAQ data for a large sample (2,688) of jobs, a number of principal components (job dimensions) were identified. Scores on these dimensions, and the ratings on the original individual elements of the PAQ, were used in a multiple regression procedure for predicting the actual compensation rates of the jobs in the sample. The results of the analyses generally supported previous related research to the effect that compensation rates for jobs might be established on the basis of quantitative job analysis from a structured job analysis procedure,  but the level of prediction of compensation rates was not as high in the present study as it was in a previous parallel study. This can be attributed in part to the volatile nature of wages and salaries in the time period of data collection, and to the fact that the sample covered a wide variety of jobs from many industries and different geographical areas. It is still felt that the basic approach is valide. (Author/AG)",

Results were considered low in predictive value because of (1) the questionnaire method, and (2) the size of the population sample. Findings from the questionnaire responses are tabulated and discussed in detail. Analysis of independent variables (age, sex, education, time since client last attended YTEP, and length of stay in YTEP) led to the conclusion that clients who had the greatest amount of  education and who spent the longest time in YTEP had the highest probability of success. It was not possible to determine from the results which aspect of the YTEP program to emphasize.

Policy research is necessary, however. The image of vocational-technical education is suffering because the evidence supporting its worth  has not been collected, organized, and analyzed. Studies which have been conducted (Kaufman and Schaefer, Walter M. Arnold, Arthur M. Lee) do not attempt to measure in an analytic sense what policy produces the best results. This is the time to involve social and behavioral scientists in vocational-technical education evaluation, to convince political authorities that the data do support the conjectures, and to be an accountable member of the educational system in terms of funding and policy.

The body of the report, following the summary of findings and recommendations, contains four parts. Part 1 presents a general  description of proprietary vocational schools. Part 2 describes the missions, student bodies, and management of proprietary schools, based on case studies of several proprietary schools which were analyzed in detail. Part 3 analyzes the competition between proprietary business schools and community colleges, again based on selected case studies, and draws some conclusions about relative performance. Part 4 addresses public policy questions and research issues which derive from the study's findings, and concludes with specific recommendations related to Federal policy and funding methods.

        "description":"This study sought to determine the attitudes of guidance counselors toward the entrance of women into the profession of medicine. In order to answer this broad question two research methods were employed. The counselors were given a paired comparisons task, i.e., they were asked to make 66 choices among 12 high school students to determine who they felt would be most successful in medical school. To supplement this data, both counselors and women medical students at the University of Pittsburgh were interviewed and their answers analyzed. One conclusion reached by the study was that the sex of a potential medical school applicant was not a significant variable in the perceptions of the high school counselors when taken with other more obvious academic considerations. The data  from this study also support the conclusion that counselors do not play an active role in the student's decision-making process; rather, they facilitate it by providing information. A misconception by most counselors was that career decisions were not made until late in college, whereas over 50 percent of the women interviewed made their decisions before or during high school. Several recommendations for further study in the area are included. (Author/PC)",

Fifty-three married adult women comprised the sample group, with 30 of the women described as &quot;activist&quot; and 23 as nonactivist.&quot; Those women having a regular affiliation outside the home with a group promoting social change were termed &quot;activist.&quot; The Inventory of Feminine Values was administered and evaluated for presence or absence of the motive to avoid success. Results indicated that despite the highly favorable attitudes toward  self-actualization by the subjects, high levels of negative effect toward success in the more the more projective measures were also present. Contrary to the hypothesis, activism did not generally predict fear of success imagery, although activism did predict stronger self-orientation than did nonactivism. (Author/PC)",

A Normative model of decision rationality and measurement (Family Problem Instrument-FPI) was adapted from previous research. Tape-recorded data were provided by 27 families. Husbands and wives responded separately to family decision situations which were constructed and revised in several stages. Results indicated that attained decision rationality levels varied by problem area, by decision dimension, and by family role. In general, families reached a middle level of decision rationality, as measured within the limitations imposed by a normative model of decision-making. Based on the findings, family profiles or case studies were constructed. These may be useful to those  interested in understanding dynamics of decision-making in families of Mexican descent. The research explored possibilities of interdisciplinary-intercultural-intercommunity research effort. A caution is that results of the data analysis are tentative, and do not generalize to families beyond the study group. (Author/BW)",

Conclusions about the impact of the project were somewhat unclear because of the lack of good pre-and posttest data on changes in student behavior.

This summary of the commission's final report deals with the aforementioned topics as well as with public child welfare programs of a preventative nature and some of the problems that arise when public authorities intervene to assume custody of minor children. At the time of the survey nearly 25,000 minors were receiving care outside their parents'  homes; of that number 85 percent were in foster homes and the remainder were in various types of institutions.

Seven variables assumed to be antecedents of self-evaluation were included in the model: SES, support from the mother and from the father, the adolescent's evaluation of his/her mother and of his/her father; self-religiosity of the adolescent, and evaluation of culturally significant religious images. The model was evaluated using Catholic high school samples from five cultures: Spain, Mexico, Puerto Rico, West Germany, and the United States (n=1,069 boys and 916 girls). Results show that the same process of self-evaluation occurs cross-sexually and cross-nationally. Results also  indicate that evaluation of the parents (an indicator of identification with the parents) and identification of the self with religious images (which are valued social symbols in these social situations) are the most important positive antecedents tested. Religiosity and SES are not significantly related to self-evaluation. Father support is positively related to self-evaluation, but mother support is negatively related. Explanation of this unexpected finding is provided. (Author)",

Later experiences centered around specific exercises conducted in small groups and dyads. The overall objective was to help participants clarify and expand their own attitudes on relationships and sexuality. In the area of relationship counseling, the focus was on facilitating communication within the dyad.  Also discussed were specific interview techniques for dealing with resentments, grievances, attractions, and changes wanted in the relationship. The workshop sought to synthesize the material and apply the techniques to the participants' particular setting and personality. (Author/BW)",

The author offers some personal thoughts concerning youth and drugs. He then presents an overview of the varied and conflicting observations and opinions of people in general and students in particular in regard to the secondary school drug scene. The report offers suggestions about what can be done to improve the drug abuse situation. The monograph explores the concept of the group rap with a stress on values clarification, and describes how to set up a group rap session using the values clarification approach. There are specific procedures for a number of relevant exercises. The booklet also contains a glossary of some basic drug terminology, a listing of further  sources of drug information, and a short bibliography. The author closes with some additional personal comments, among them that alcohol abuse is another serious drug problem which cannot be ignored. (Author/BW)",

Older women students form a large minority group on many campuses today. A review of the literature suggests that these women students may experience special problems in returning to student life and may have needs for special preventative or developmental outreach programming to facilitate their educational careers. A questionnaire survey designed to assess such needs was conducted among women aged 21-57 who were enrolled at Colorado State University in spring 1974. Results indicate that highest priority needs are for convenient day care for preschool children, orientation at initial reentry to campus, social  skill training, social contact with peers, assistance in vocational choice, vocational preparation, and job-search.

Through a Philadelphia Board of Education resolution passed on October 30, 1972, approval was given for the offering of social work services to the Charles W. Henry School to help socially maladjusted pupils. At Henry School, the social workers inventoried the concerns expressed by the pupils. The workers helped students bake cookies and cakes, fashion leathercraft, and examine career options. As the students warmed up to the social workers they cogently described problem areas and accepted recommended solutions. Social workers recognized that learning styles vary from student to student--some learn best through auditory and/or visual means, and some learn best in the absence or  presence of competition. The social workers helped ameliorate student-police relations and promote intergroup relations. Although the services of the workers were scheduled to terminate the first week in May, the Home and School Executive Board voted to fund the program with its own monies for an additional eight weeks.

The school has a student body of 65, ranging between 6 and 13 years of age. The educational program attempts to be holistic in nature, utilizing three programs which present alternatives to drugs for the treatment of hyperactive children. The first program, perceptual-motor training, is eclectic in nature and includes several subcomponents. The second program, orthomolecular medicine, is described, and reference is made to research in megavitamin therapy. The third program, the open classroom approach, is described as  an attempt to channel each pupil's hyperactivity into constructive pursuits. Specific curriculum for this program is also discussed. A battery of tests was administered to the pupils during the school's first and second years of operation. Although the results of these tests provided little statistical significance, the author concluded that alternatives to drug treatment for hyperactivity do exist and should be considered.

To test these hypotheses, the author collected data from 150 students from two Calcutta colleges. Survey results reflect the following: (1) the Indian students approved of abortion; (2) religion, socioeconomic background, and education were factors affecting attitudes on abortion; and (3) religiosity remains an influential force, American Catholics being more conservative than Hindus and American Protestants, with Hindus almost as liberal as the Protestants. The report concludes that additional surveys which make  comparisons among less educated Indians and test for possible selectivity in the student groups even before college are needed in order to throw further light on this subject.

The subjects were students from a southwestern Canadian university and were stratified as to sex and amount of education. The author employed his Pill Scale, a 25-item Likert type instrument. The results show the subjects were extremely close to &quot;approval&quot; of oral contraception in terms of the Likert scale employed. The author presents five related reasons for this result: (1) the liberalizing influences of university education; (2) the increase in reported intercourse experienced by women; (3) prevailing spirit of individualism; (4) some concern about world population; and (5) the desire to achieve a higher  social status, partly through emphasis on family planning. However, the qualified qualitative reactions indicated that student enthusiasm was slightly reduced by fear concerning the pill's side effects. The author cautions that although adequate family planning programs are necessary, they will not completely eradicate unwanted pregnancies. (Author/BW)",

The author then introduces the concept of the Borromean Family, and constructs two Borromean Family Indexes, which have been found to be both valid and reliable. The empirical data collected by means of these new instruments have led to 10 preliminary conclusions and suggestions for further research. Among these conclusions are that: (1) people do not really believe that the family is obsolescent; (2) single persons appear to stress a greater balance  between familism and individualism; and (3) the Borromean theory may promote our understanding of both traditional and counterculture families.

Extended family structures have become more nucleated under the influences of urbanization and industrialization. As a consequence, caring for the aged has become the responsibility of other social institutions. This paper cites several studies which have investigated the nature of generational differences in willingness to support aged parents. While caretaker behaviors may be viewed as a kind of leadership activity, numerous empirical studies have generally failed to find any consistent trait which can categorize leaders. Caretaker role behavior and its associated responsibilities have varied consequences for  family patterns. Knowledge and hypotheses about the variables instrumental in the identification and selection of the caretaker family member might enable marriage and family therapists to deal more effectively with various problems stemming from the caretaker role.

A questionnaire was administered to a nationally projectable samply of 1,660 adults between the ages of 18 and 55 and to a representative sample of 397 high school students. The questionnaire attempted to measure the success of an extensive three-year public information/communications effort on the problem of drunk driving, sponsored by the U. S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Results indicated significant progress since 1970 in increasing people's awareness of the drunk driving problem, as well as a readiness to pay  higher taxes to support stricter law enforcement programs. The study among high school students revealed an alarming amount of drinking and driving, and almost as much involvement with alcohol-related situations as adults. The report also provides a thorough evaluation of both sample groups which can be used to give direction to future efforts to solve the drunk driving problem. (Author/PC)",

Students in Women's Studies and non-Woman's Studies classes were utilized as subjects to allow for a sample of potentially less traditional women. Questionnaires consisting of seven incomplete sentences were administered. Responses were coded according to affect implicit in the response, mention of the sex of the person in the response, and the category of responses. Results indicated little evidence for overt stereotyping, however, men are still preferred more than women as favorite people. More value is currently being placed on traditionally feminine emotional traits, resulting in a more positive view of women by both sexes than in  previous studies. Results were compared with earlier studies, and differences resulting from varying methodologies and societal change in values discussed. It was suggested that less future stereotypic thinking will be evident as people raise their self-esteem. (Author/BW)",

Three standardized measurement instruments, each designed to measure one of the above-mentioned variables, were used.

Results indicated that neither the unit on homosexuality nor the health education class, in and of themselves, affected the variables. It was concluded that, though a short unit on homosexuality might not be expected to improve faith in people or acceptance of others, such a  unit would not negatively affect gender and/or sexual identity.

Unit I consists of activities where students become aware of the implications of different occupational choices, where they explore a series of career clusters, and where they learn decision making skills and use them in expressing an occupational preference. Unit II, the exploration stage, enables the student to find out first-hand whether the role required by a worker in the occupation preferred is one that he/she  would want to adopt. In Unit III, a student who has crystalized an occupational choice will be given assistance in implementing that choice by helping him find a job, obtaining on-job-training, or enrolling in the necessary training program. Those implementing this program are urged to experiment with the activities suggested and adapt them to meet the needs of their particular students. (Author/PC)",

The material was gathered from a variety of sources for use by a variety of teachers with a variety of students; therefore, teachers should not be expected to teach everything in the book to every student. This book contains a collection of &quot;starters&quot; to make small group work deeper and more effective for participants. Because no attempt has been made to impose a schedule or specific approach to the group experience, group leaders must choose what will work for them and for their particular group. Some of the designated lessons require that the leader have training in small group work, relevant additional  course work and experience in human relations groups, The six broad categories into which the manual is divided include: (1) personal skills; (2) human relations; (3) money, Management and family life; (4) health education; (5) community and leisure; and (6) citizenship and government.

Originally these rules were devised to guide a parliament or congress in orderly procedure. In student councils and other school organizations, there is not time to consider orderly procedure as deeply as parliaments must--nor is there need for maneuvers of delay and sidetracting. Instead, student officers need a reasonably direct, straightforward guide for running a meeting. That is what this booklet is intended to accomplish. It will serve as an important and convenient reference to many student groups. However helpful this booklet will be, readers should remember that parliamentary procedure is necessary and useful only to the extent that it is learned in connection  with the function it fulfills. To study this booklet as subject matter to be memorized for its own sake would not be profitable. (Author/PC)",

Every educational experience the student has in or out of class during his formative years will help to determine what sort of adult citizen he will become. There is a possibility that this topic may excite controversy, because many people are convinced that education is mainly intellectual inquiry--fact gathering and problem solving--while many others believe that there must be more of a balance between intellectual inquiry and social experience. There is good reason to believe that this balance is once again being widely accepted by schoolmen. This guide to social activities was designed to help define what is involved in planning, administrating, and evaluating school social activities. Topics of  discusseion include: (1) the facts of life and basic considerations in planning activities, (2) involvement and administration, (3) typical social activities, (4) limitations, (5) a sample community approach, and (6) evaluation of the activity.

It can provide feedback into a program and improve it. A worthwhile evaluation, however, is often difficult to find. Before an evaluator can go to work, he must have clear in his own mind the guidelines he is to follow in weighing his data. In other words, he must realize what questions must be asked before he can expect useful and usable answers. This booklet, the sixth in the New Directions for Student Councils series, is intended to provide some insight into the appropriate functions of evaluation and to suggest some criteria against which the adviser and student officer can measure the effectiveness of a program and  decide how, when, where, and by whom it shall be done. The booklet is divided into the following topical areas: (1) the need for evaluation, (2) some principles of evaluation, (3) objectives of student activities, (4) three procedures useful in evaluation, (5) a proposed set of evaluation criteria, and (6) points to remember when doing an evaluation.

After all, the activities program cannot perform its valuable function unless it meets the interests of as many students as possible.

The administrator, the adviser, and the student officer all have important roles to play in stimulating participation, and all ought to be alert to the emotional and intellectual needs of a variety of students.

The study of group dynamics, no matter how scientific, will not provide an organization with all of the answers to all of its problems. The editors are confident, however, that if those who are involved in the student activities program understand factors that influence  group work, the result can be more constructive group behavior and more dynamic activities. Topics under discussion in the booklet include: (1) group dynamics--what's it all about, (2) effective student leadership, (3) popular theories about leaders, (4) forces active in student groups, (5) the effective student group, (6) group behavior, and (7) evaluating leadership skills.

There is tremendous competition for the community's attention, sympathy, and funds, and if education is to get its fair share of all of these, the public must be made aware of the schools' vitally important contributions to the nation's future. A forceful student council can assume an influential role in this process of community enlightenment. An honest, forthright, aggressive student council public relations program might well serve to correct any distortion that may exist in the community's view of student activities.

At a time when many new groups are appearing on the scene, espousing a variety of causes, student councils must work harder than ever to maintain their position of leadership by broadening their outlooks, redirecting their activities, and involving students--all students--in new areas of thought and activity. This booklet is an attempt to help student councils reassess existing programs, many of which have returned substantial dividends, and to find new directions for their activities programs. Many, of course, have already developed exciting new programs;  for them, this booklet will simply reaffirm their belief in the need for constant self-evaluation and self-improvement. For others, however, it is hoped that the book may spark new ideas for involvement in such areas as curriculum development, pollution control, and community service. (Author/PC)",

Many councils, ingrown after years of self-perpetuation, are failing because they no longer get through to people. Speaking to no one but themselves, they have lost their \"people-consciousness.\" And, in many cases, the silent majority of students, unheard and unhearing, have abandoned them. The author of this booklet sees a cure to this sickness of apathy that pervades both sides of many councils. It begins with the development of a new self-awareness by council members and can lead to renewed interest and involvement in council activities by members of the silent majority. In between lies a long road for  council members that demands patience, preseverence, and understanding in the face of indifference and apathy. But the rewards, in terms of new human contacts, new experiences, and an invigorated student council, far outweigh the effort. (Author/PC)",

Women were significantly more dissatisfied. The respondents did not regard the job market as a significant factor in employment.  Course work was found to have a definite relationship with the counseling activities of the graduates. The practicum was regarded as the single most valuable course by the majority of respondents.

Conversely, as a component of a larger institution or community, an agency's very existence may depend upon the congruence between its service program and the goals of the parent institution. A service program based exclusively on the interests and skills of individual staff members is not likely to produce a proactive center striving to attain its predetermined goals. There is also the danger, however, that exclusive attention to agency directionality will either stifle individual creativity and innovation or result in objectives  which may not be congruent with institutional goals. Ideally a balance between the two will exist, but that is not likely to occur by change. This paper describes a systematic procedure designed to protect staff individuality and provide for agency intentional directionality in accordance with institutional goals. (Author)",

A number of recommended changes are offered which the author believes will foster women's liberation. Sex education is suggested as an important way to promote a humanistic and experimental concept of sexuality, with emphasis placed upon the need for changing attitudes and behaviors, such as: (1) recognition of the importance of female sexual expression; (2) rejection of the double standard between  men and women; and (3) the assumption of equal responsibility on the part of both sexes in a sexual relationship.

        "description":"A review of the literature indicated a recognition that interview behavior was critical to job placement and successful employment. Previous research, however, has not specified either the structure of inverview training with the mildly retarded or the outcomes of those programs. In a recent study, 29 of 40 mentally retarded young adults filled the role of job interviewer to a moderately successful extent. This paper attempts to determine the relationship of this finding to subjects' cognitive and personality dimensions; and to subsequent employment. Thirty-four mentally retarded young adults with IQ scores from 42 to 85 served as subjects. They were minimally trained in questioning techniques and instructed to serve as job interviewers. The Ss Performance in the role of job  interviewer was measured by summing the number of experimentor-suggested questions and the number of judged relevant questions they asked on their own initiative. On the basis of preliminary findings, the use of the interviewer role task with mantally retarded young adults appears worthy of future exploration as a promising technique to evaluate social skills, particularly in the job interview situation. Success with the interview task appears related to subsequent competitive employment. (Author/PC)",

The population surveyed consisted of people not actively seeking mental health services. A questionnaire was formulated consisting of 18 items pertaining to expectations about help for personal problems. The results indicate that a significant number of these Mexican-American respondents indicated a preference for a directive, advice-giving helping person who would tell them what was wrong, come to their homes, pray for them, and try to cheer them up. The most preferred persons to do these things were the priest and the psychologist. There were few statistically significant discrepancies between the English speaking and Spanish speaking respondents. If  we accept the premise that it is best to give people the kinds of service that they want or expect, then replication of surveys such as this one should be helpful in the design of better community service delivery systems.

In addition, if records are properly kept, this basic I and R service can provide important statistical information about the kinds of problems people have and the extent of their occurrence, plus valuable information about the ability of the community to cope with these problems. For the community, the I and R center is an access point and an entryway to a large and complicated service network. It is also a point at which feedback is available concerning how well the needs  of people are being met. Topics under consideration include: (1) interviewing and information-giving; (2) using the resource file; and (3) knowing what referral is, and when it should be used. \"Caller Interview\" and referral forms are also discussed.

This article presents alternative methods to standardized testing for garnering significant information about the school environment. Three broad categories presented are school-wide, classroom and individual. To assess school environments the authors recommend using the Student Opinion Poll, a 49-item questionnaire. A number of other tools are also discussed. Two approaches mentioned to assess the classroom environment are a questionnaire approach and an interaction analysis approach. The third level of the assessment process, focusing on specific individual pupil behavior, necessitates the identification  of specific assessment devices. This process should provide a better understanding of the nature of the students' and/or teacher's problem. The motivation behind student behavior must be more clearly understood, and the assessment tools presented in this report can give some direction to this search. (Author/BW)",

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of family variables on adolescent sexual behavior and contraceptive practices. More specifically, the research question was: Could a set of parent-adolescent interpersonal variables be identified which would differentiate sexually active user (AU), sexually active non-users (ANU), and sexually non-active non-users (NANU) of contraception? Subjects were 45 females from a clinic setting--family planning and prenatal clinics--and 40 from a non-clinic setting. An attempt was made to obtain both black and white Ss from several social class levels, and data was collected from a questionnaire sent out to subjects. It was  noteworthy that six of the eight scales which met the statistical criterion dealt with father-daughter relations while only two dealt with mother-daughter relations. It seems likely that type of paternal discipline, and father-daughter communication and joint activity may be key variables to understanding and predicting adolescent females' coital and contraceptive behavior.

        "description":"Most student leaders are willing to work through the system to bring about the changes they desire, but more often than not, they don't know how. This booklet was written to respond to that need. It is an attempt to describe to high school student council leaders the personal requirements and techniques for bringing about the constructive changes they seek for their schools and student councils. The word \"revolution\" will rest a little uncomfortably for some, but it seems to the author that very revolutionary things can be brought about through the persistent use of reasonable and officially recognized processes. The basic thesis is that working through the system is ultimately more effective than fighting against it. As a technique, the silent revolution does not exist in a  vacuum; it succeeds or fails depending on the individual leader's reasons for leading, his outlook on solving leadership problems, and the development of his own leadership potential. For this reason, this booklet is an attempt not only to describe a technique but to put it in a total leadership perspective as well: why one leads, how one leads, the effects of that leadership, and the problems of self-renewal.

The author maintains that skills are observable, measurable and repeatable behaviors. He teaches these skills in three phases. First, students learn how to expand knowledge about themselves and a particular type of job by using people and things as resources. The next phase, the narrowing phase helps the students relate the career information to their value using a decision-making process. Finally, in the preparing stage, the students participate in an interview-internship with a person working in the field in which they are interested, and reevaluate their job decisions in light of their life styles and values. This manual  describes the steps taken in educating teachers and counselors in the use of the CAST program. (HMV)",

The paper notes that developmental theory may lead to two rather different legitimate implementation models and notes some interim observations from the two schools. One of the models implemented emphasizes coordinated natural social and humanistic course which encourages students to interact and cope with external realities. The second model adopts the developmentalism implied in Kohlberg's theory wherein development is the only legitimate aim of education, suggesting that the end product of education should be the growth of the child's \"natural, intellectual, and moral capacities.\" (Author/CJ)",

The personalized method emphasized student goal setting, self-selection of a variety of materials and techniques for accomplishing these goals, and verbal interaction between the students and instructor. The prescriptive approach stressed preestablished learning prescriptions based on diagnostic findings, the use of reading laboratory materials and machines, and minimal verbal interchanges between the students and instructor. Students were  randomly assigned to one of the two experimental groups. The findings supported the rationale for the implementation of individualized instructional practices with two-year college students voluntarily enrolled in reading improvement classes.

Teachers should examine certain questions about skills in learning, such as the following: What are the skills involved in learning something well? What skills are needed for discovery learning? Is it good or bad for a student to learn by discovery? What skills do creative and inquiring students or people in general possess? Teachers and the school should be dealing with non-trivial facts, those which have widespread implications, those which children can use to modify diverse  aspects of their idealistic world. The development of a quality reading program within a school must deal with such problem areas as educational change, communication patterns within the school system, personality conflicts, goal perception differences, role ambiguity, power struggles, and organization disequilibrium.

The subjects were 144 high school students randomly assigned to experimental conditions. The subjects were provided with different types of information about the theme and context of various prose passages, and predictions were made as to the relative effectiveness of the different types of contextual information. This information was provided in either verbal or pictorial form, with both concrete and abstract forms of each used. The subjects received this information either before or immediately after reading short prose passages which were also highly abstract or highly concrete. The retention measures were total words recalled, total words recalled in  order, idea units correctly recalled, and types of intrusions produced. The results indicated that subjects receiving pictorial organizers recalled more than those receiving verbal organizers, recall was greater for concrete paragraphs than for abstract paragraphs, and knowledge of the theme and context of a particular passage was shown to be critical for comprehension.

The purpose of the CSC is to provide the diagnostic, prescriptive, and consultative intervention necessary to assist referred students with serious learning problems in experiencing success in school. The CSC utilizes an interdisciplinary team approach for providing comprehensive evaluation of children who are exhibiting behaviors indicative of multiple problems which are impeding learning. Implementation of the composite remedial strategies is achieved through direct contacts with the learner and through consultative relationships with persons influential in the child's life in the systems within which a  child must function. The exchange of information and the cooperation among CSC, school, home, and community resources is a means to providing services which lead to successful experiences for referred children. The scucess of the CSC program has been documented by quantitative statistical procedures implemented in evaluating cognitive development, learning aptitude, oral reading achievement, and mental and physical health functioning.

A diagnostic procedure for screening kindergarten children and then prescribing an individualized program for each child is described. The screening battery--Prediction with Diagnostic Qualities (PDQ)--consists of nine tests: auditory discrimination, listening comprehension, general vocabulary, ability to categorize, knowledge of relationship words, picture sequencing, oral language development, and the abilities to follow oral directions and to use oral context. Children are also tested for visual and auditory acuity. Now being tested, the effectiveness of the PDQ diagnostic procedure in terms of reading achievement will not be  known for another year, but the teachers using the approach already report an impact on the kindergarten program in terms of greater specificity and individualization from the beginning of the year. By using a diagnostic rather than a predictive screening instrument, it is possible to diagnose for necessary skills and to provide instruction at each child's level of language development. (TO)",

After a review of the relevant literature, a specific study is described. The linguistic background of 648 children from 29 schools, age 10 through 12 inclusive, was measured with the Welsh Linguistic Background Scale. General intelligence was assessed with three nonverbal tests: Raven's Progressive Matrices, Daniel's Figure Reasoning Test and the Non-Verbal Test No. 2 of the National Foundation for Educational Research. Objectives were to: (1) determine which of the nonverbal tests was the most independent of linguistic background and hence most suitable for intelligence testing in mixed language areas, and (2) describe the relationship between linguistic background and test  scores. Conclusions are that: (1) none of the tests used is completely suitable for evaluating Welsh-speaking children if the results are to be compared with those of English-speaking children; (2) Welsh-dominant bilingual children scored consistently lower than English-dominant children; (3) a correlation exists between test performance and degree of bilingualism; (4) the location of a community accentuates the influence of bilingualism; (5) occupational levels and socioeconomic status must be considered when interpreting test scores; and (6) Raven's Progressive Matrices is the most independent test.

It is claimed that the situations in which a language is likely to be used and the linguistic aim of the learners should be taken into consideration when the nature of the vocabulary to be included in a second language course is determined. Recent research work in vocabulary selection for second-language learning in France, Canada, and Ireland is reviewed. The study aimed at discovering, by means of a questionnaire issued to 113 classes of adults learning Welsh, the purpose for which the language was being learned and the situations in which the newly acquired command of the language is most likely to be used. It was found that the most frequently mentioned reasons were concerned with a  desire to be able to follow news and other programs on television in Welsh and to be able to participate in social intercourse through the medium of the language. It is recommended that the planners of courses in Welsh as a second language for adults pay special attention to the vocabulary needed for understanding television news bulletins and for understanding and participating in everyday conversations among Welsh-speaking friends.

Research was reviewed indicating that the improvement in question and answer performance of a maturing child is based on the advancement of both his linguistic and cognitive abilities and that the adult systematically accomodates his speech with a child to those abilities. A categorization scheme was devised for the ranking of question types according to their cognitive and syntactic complexity and for the rating of answers according to their appropriateness and syntactic level. It is proposed that detailed analyses of a variety of adult-child question-answer interactions should provide important information concerning the theoretical  role of adult accommodation to the child's level as well as principles leading to new language training techniques.

The experimental project was begun because parents did not feel that the traditional language classes were successful in teaching their children French. The belief that native language skills would suffer, and simple resistance to French, delayed the implementation of an immersion program at the kidergarten level. It had marked success: academic achievement, mother tongue competency, and other areas of intellectual development were not hampered. By grade 7, children who had begun in the program not only performed better than peers who had been through English-only programs in vocabulary tests, reading, spelling, and language skills, but  also performed at or above the level of their French-Canadian peers in most tests of French language skills. Attitudes towards French-Canadians also improved, as well as general thinking skills, as a result of the bilingual program. Reasons for the program are outlined, including criteria for program-participant selection. The St. Lambert project is compared to other bilingual projects, and the present Canadian language situation is discussed. (CLK)",

What is taught in the United States does not reflect the current Chinese situation, partly because most of the native language teachers in the United States left China in 1949. The chages that have taken place in the language of the People's Republic, which include phonological, lexical, and syntactical elements, as well as situational ones, must be taken into account in language instruction. A student of Chinese should acquire linguistic and sociolinguistic competence and an awareness of both the pre-1949 and the post-1949 varieties of Chinese. Therefore, Chinese language teaching  materials need to deal with the sociolinguistic variants. This can be done by providing existing texts with supplementary materials that make use of a contrastive approach to present the variant usages. (Author/CLK)",

Forty-two teachers from post-graduate teacher-training schools and 131 students, aged approximately 17, from two schools, were involved. Student teachers reported that the most important cognitive skills were the ability to distinguish and repeat sentences, word and sounds, comprehension of a text, and ability to converse in English. The least important were translation ability and factual knowledge of English literature and customs. In the affective domain, the important goals were positive attitudes toward studying and speaking English, while the least important were use of  English in spare time and developing empathy and a sense of responsibility. Students' responses were generally in agreement, with listening and reading comprehension and speaking ability the most important. Factor Analys compared these results with those of inservice teachers, who considered traditional objectives slightly less important than student teachers, and audiolingual skills more important.

Plan A is a two-year program of Spanish instruction. It consists of Spanish 101 and 102 and eight four-week minicourses, including two different grammar minicourses during the first four weeks of instruction. Plan B is a two-, two-and-a-half-, or three-year program. It includes Spanish 101, Spanish 102, and also eight four-week minicourses. These courses may be taken during two, three, or four semesters. Students may choose from 12 different minicourses. Plan C is an accelarated one-, one-and-a-half, or two-year program. It enables students to complete Spanish 103 and  Spanish 104 in one or more semesters. They could take both courses simultaneously. Students receive credit on completion of eight four-week minicourses. Charts for each plan and a list of suggested minicourses are included. These alternatives may be offered in other languages.

        "description":"Thirty informants were presented with sets of clauses punctuated as in the pattern &quot;S1. If S2. S3&quot; and asked which clause, S1 or S3, the &quot;if&quot; clause modified. Independently, several linguists judged the sentences &quot;S1, if S2&quot; and &quot;S2, if S3&quot; acceptable. Missing intonational clues or improper punctuation, which frequently occurs in advertising, could force a processing grammar to disambiguate the qualification in the above. Semantic data alone prove insufficient for this disambiguation process; anaphoric and temporal relationships will serve to disambiguate in such cases, but are not always present. If Strawson's &quot;Indirectness Condition&quot; is elaborated by examining the types of non-truth-functional relationships leading from the antecedent to the consequent, a hierarchy which  predicts the informants' selections is established. This pragmatic hierarchy, causal/pseudo-causal/inductive/inductive and deductive/deductive, would aid the processing of potentially ambiguous clasuses. It is claimed that the same hierarchy could be applied to disambiguate sentences of the forms &quot;S1. If S2. S3.&quot; Further, it is claimed that this hierarchy applies within a generative grammar to limit the acceptability of conjoining arbitrary sentences with &quot;if.&quot; (Author/TL)",

The first of these, diglossia, is defined in general terms and then examined more closely in relation to its historical development in Arabic-speaking countries (i.e., as resulting from geographic, socioeconomic, and religious splittings in this area of the world). The second major portion of this paper is devoted to a synchronic comparison of the phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon of Classical Arabic and Syrian Arabic. The comparison shows that: (1) the phonology of the two varieties of Arabic is &quot;moderately different;&quot; (2) the vernacular has a simpler grammatical structure than the Classical, and is becoming increasingly synthetic; and (3)  lexically, the vernacular borrows much from Classical Arabic. The final portion of the paper discusses the need for and development of a standardized language that would dissolve the diglossic split in Arabic. The most practical and likely choice for a unified language is here offered as that dialect known as the &quot;language of the educated.&quot; This Intercommon Spoken Arabic, alreading evolving, perhaps will lead to sociolinguistic changes what will distribute literacy more widely in the Arab world.

        "description":"In a sentence containing a conjunction &quot;when,&quot;&quot;once,&quot; or &quot;as soon as,&quot; the events in the main and the subordinate clauses are understood as occurring closely together in time. This paper endeavors to uncover the subtle differences which nevertheless exist among them. Clauses headed by &quot;when&quot; can refer to a span of time, whereas &quot;once&quot; and &quot;as soon as&quot;-clauses must refer to a point in time. There is a clear correlation between the distribution of &quot;once&quot; and &quot;as soon as&quot; with respect to the verb in their clause, and the classification of verbs proposed by Vendler (1967). Further, the presuppositional nature of &quot;when&quot; is different from that of &quot;once&quot; and &quot;as soon as.&quot; In sentences containing a clause headed by the latter two conjunctions, the events in both the main and the  subordinate clauses are presupposed as starting at the point designated by the subordinate clause. The difference between &quot;once&quot; and &quot;as soon as&quot; is evidenced by the impossibility for &quot;once&quot; to connect two events which are causally unrelated. Sentences illustrating this point seem to lead to the conclusion that a &quot;once&quot;-clause gives the last in a series of events causally leading up to the event in the main clause.

The relationship between speaking and social interaction has been extensively studied by sociolinguistics. It is the purpose of this paper to: (1) briefly describe and define some of the sociolinguistic norms that have been identified, (2) show how these norms correlate with behavioral patterns observed in speaking, and (3) illustrate how drills can be devised and used in foreign language teaching to teach the interactional norms involved in speaking. The basic sociolinguistic notions  of role relationship, social situation, social interaction, language choice, and speaking are discussed. Items that lend themselves to the construction of foreign language drills are personal and transactional role relationships; congruent and incongruent social situations; metaphorical and situational switching; language choice, in terms of stable and unstable bilingualism; tones and manner of communication; channels and modes; interlocutors; and speech situations, speech events, and speech acts.

Thus it has not been able to face squarely the question how linguistic function may have evolved from animal communication. Chimpanzees' use of signs from American Sign Language forces re-examination of language origins and the evolution of progressively more highly encoded communicative systems. Linguistics has contributed to ignorance about sign languages when it has accepted an evolutionary view of human vocal and auditory organs but has called on a creation myth to account for speech and language. Not all linguists are so dualistic. Hewes, Kendon, Kavanagh, Liberman, Sarles, Wescott, and others have attempted to look at language as brain  function with both limbic and vocal involvement, in recent meetings of the American Anthropological Association, the IXth International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnographical Sciences, conferences of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the New York Academy of Sciences. A promising lead which may be empirically testable is that the gestural signal and not the all-at-once vocal signal (as in bird song) used by bipedal primates first divided into partials with nominal and verbal referents.

CAI previously encountered three basic problems: (1) the cost of hardware, (2) the lack of adequate software, and (3) the algorithmic ability of the machine. The first two difficulties have been overcome by PLATO IV. The attitude conveyed by the Goedel Theorem in the field of mathematics and the algorithmic ability of the machine are no longer the center of controversy in the humanities. The focus is on how to exploit the capabilities of the computer and how to establish a meaningful interaction between man and the machine. Thus,  attitudes toward machines have changed significantly. Theoretical problems are investigated along two parameters: computer-based and non-computer-based pedagogy. The former incorporates such questions as the various roles of the computer and which roles a humanist should assign to it. The &quot;concept of sequencing&quot; is discussed. The discussion of empirical issues includes questions such as whether or not the machine dominates man. (Author/CLK)",

The transition program and its participants are described, and the program is examined in relation to the implicit goals with the aid of comparisons with students in regular kindergarten classes. The transition program children learned English at a rate equal to that of similar children in regular programs, despite being exposed to Italian for most of the first year, and they participated more in class discussions, a sign that their adjustment to school was made easier. Parents of the transition children attended more official school functions and talked regularly with the teacher on an informal basis. These  results suggest that the program generally has been successful in meeting its goals in the short term and that the transition model is viable for children in kindergarten. Other benefits or drawbacks may not emerge until later in the children's school career. The context in which a program of this nature is implemented is extremely important. Various considerations and procedures that might be required in other contexts or with alternative program models are discussed in the summary of the report. (Author/CLK)",

Each of these elements is elaborated in Part I. In Part II some of the findings of specialists in early childhood are considered together with their implications for bilingual education. Of special relevance are the development of the child's intellect, senses, memory, and imagination.

The most important section (VI) is an annotated list of general and cultural reference sources. In effect, this is an intensive examination of reference-room holdings from the point of view of a culturally oriented foreign language teacher or student. Bibliographies, indexes, encyclopedias, handbooks, yearbooks, and directories are studied for their cultural yield. Both historical and anthropological types of cultural information emerge. Most  reference sources are accompanied by notes of particular interest to a foreign culture researcher. Key words and cross-reference headings are highlighted. Press and periodical directories, as well as the use of government documents, are vital topics. Appendix A reports an interview with a reference librarian; Appendix B offers pedagogical suggestions for exploiting travel books; Appendix C is a starter list of cultural sources by language area.

        "description":"This paper first explains the diversity of the Arab World, the unifying force of Classical Arabic, and that Modern Standard Arabic, less complicated in structure and less ornate in rhetoric, is sufficiently Different from colloquial dialects to require considerable instruction in schools. For contrastive analysis to be useful as a basis for EFL methods and materials, one must therefore answer the question &quot;What is the native language of the Arabic-speaking student?&quot; Examples of Arabic interference (often differing from one dialect to another) are given in phonology, syntax, and rhetoric. Techniques for teaching segmental sounds are suggested, as well as drills to practice linking. For the teaching of vocabulary, it is argued that since students are accustomed to analytical  procedures of learning language forms, they may enjoy and profit from exercises that manipulate base morphemes and some common derivational affixes. For the teaching of grammar, the redundant use of the object pronoun is presented (The food which we ate it was good) with sample, sequential exercises. For the teaching of rhetoric, reference is made to the influence of Arabic rhetoric and the unusual emphasis on coordination rather than on subordination. Sample exercises demonstrate guided practice of paragraph organization in English. (Author/TL)",

The sample consisted of 1,216 faculty selected from the respondents in the American Council on Education-Carnegie Commission on Higher Education 1969 national survey. Contingency coefficients on 48 variables were reduced to the 10 strongest predictors for regression analysis. Habit of professional writing is the single best predictor of total productivity, even when years in higher education, rank, and other correlates are held constant. The study also interprets productivity correlates so as to assist undergraduate  colleges in their concerns for faculty development. The data suggest that both dimensions of professional growth--teaching and research/publishing--be available and encouraged by four-year colleges. (Author)",

There is an attempt to analyze how enrollment rates have changed and to indicate the rationale for the projections. Demographic constraints to higher education are translated into economic constraints, and these are fitted into the projections. Finally, there are brief policy recommendations for types of support programs to aid the  three out of four projected potential students who would normally and should be attending college over the next ten years, but will not without such programs.

The Policy instruments examined are tuition, admissions requirements, college locations, breadth of curriculum, draft deferments, and class integration of neighborhoods. The aspects of the economic environment examined are the opportunity cost of the students' study time and the size of the anticipated earnings payoff to college graduates. The first five sections of the paper develop a theory of college attendance and then apply it to the choice and definition of variables and the seletion of functional form for the estimating equation. Section 1 examines the college entrance decision when unlimited borrowing is possible. Section 2 handles a  more realistic situation. Section 3 applies this theory to the selection of the college. Section 4 examines how planning for college influences model specification and the selection of variables. Section 5 derives the functional form for estimation and describes how the estimated parameters will be used to test the hypotheses discussed in sections 1 and 2. Section 6 describes the data and section 7 presents the results. Section 8 analyzes the effectiveness of public subsidies of undergraduate education by calculating the subsidy cost of an extra student from each of the 20 ability-by-income strata and discusses the policy implication of the results.

A growing interest in the determination of costs and their use revealed a lack of uniformity in cost definitions and cost determination methods and approaches in a language that was readily applicable to higher education. There was also misunderstanding about cost analysis and costing standards for higher education. Discussed are fundamental considerations for determining cost information, an examination of different cost methods and the conditions under which each is appropriate, and a statement of costing standards applicable to higher education. Evaluation of the quality and efficiency of academic programs involves much more than the use of cost  information. Definitions of the quality and efficiency of academic programs have not been developed and accepted on a national basis. Cost data should be related to the characteristics, the state mission, and the goals and objectives of an institution. Numerous judgments, in addition to objective, quantifiable data, are required in determining costs. (Author/KE)",

The need for an aggregate analysis of the type found in this document is twofold: (1) it presents an estimate of the total financial need that exists in an educational system; and (2) it allows the Commonwealth of Kentucky to determine areas of greatest need. To calculate the financial aid needs for a currently enrolled student in Kentucky, it is necessary to determine four factors: (1) expected student contribution or self-help, (2) expected parental contribution, (3) income distribution data for the families of the relevant group of students, and (4) expected out-of-pocket costs or total budgeted  expenses for students at the institutions they plan to attend. Presented is an analysis of the financial need for undergraduates attending seven groups in Kentucky institutions--major public universities, regional public universities, four-year nonpublic colleges, two-year nonpublic colleges, community colleges, vocational-technical schools, and propriertary schools. Models are developed under three differing sets of conditions: (1) actual 1973-74 estimates; (2) 1973-74 estimations, including the potential effects of the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Program; and (3) 1973-74 estimations based on the aspirations of educational attainment as expressed by Kentucky secondary school students.

After several changes in the corporation and some study of various state and private student loan plans and developing regulations and procedures, the corporation became operational in July 1965. Agreements were made with United Student Aid Funds, Incorporated to endorse all notes approved by the Maryland Higher Education Loan Corporation and guarantee repayment of 100 percent of the principal and accrued interest to the participating lenders in case of death, disability, or default by the student borrower, and with the U.S. Commissioner of Education to make borrowers eligible for Federal Interest Subsidy on their loans. This annual report of the corporation contains: (1) a  program summary; (2) loans approved, by month; (3) budget summary; (4) condition of research account; (5) guarantee capability statement; (6) loans approved, by county or students' residence; (7) loans approved, by lender; (8) loans outstanding, by Maryland lenders; (9) distribution of borrowers, Maryland schools; and (10) profile of student borrowers.

The regulations will be reviewed solely to see if they are consistent with the law and with the intent of the Congress in enacting the law and to decide if the regulation writers have read and understood it the way the lawmakers intended it to be read and understood. Discussed is section 431(d) of the General Education Provisions Act, which sets forth the authority for the conduct of these hearings, and which says that the bureaucracy shall be held accountable and that its  regulations will be scrutinized very carefully to see if they are consistent with the law.

The forces are: (1) Federal Government mandates to conform to new social norms, i.e., affirmative action, elimination of age discrimination, occupational safety and health, minimum wage and fair labor standards, unemployment insurance, social security, health maintenance organizations, Employment Retirement Income Security Act provisions, wage and salary controls, environmental protection, privacy laws, etc.; (2) accountability; (3) the political economy, that is,  inflation, unemployment, energy costs, and erratic investment dividends, and (4) impact of public disenchantment with colleges and universities.

        "description":"Many people tend to think of the economic problems of higher education as fiscal concern--as a business office problem in financial management. But the full scope of improvements needed in resources management to make higher education more cost-effective is much broader than mere financial control. A central part of resources management must deal with the human resources that organizations utilize. Although it is accepted as a truism that people are the most valuable resources in organizations--and particularly is this true of educational institutions--people are typically the most wasted resource. The people in our institutions are neglected and underutilized. Inadequate attention is paid to their motivation and development; more attention is focused on the physical plant and  financial resources. Three concepts should be considered when studying the question of how well institutions of higher education organize and utilize their human resources to carry out their educational functions. These concepts, which are relevant to any deliberations on improving the management of higher education, are productivity, complexity, and accountability. (Author/KE)",

The pattern of persons seeking employment and those seeking further study seem to have been changing gradually in the last three or four years. At both the bachelor's and master's level in engineering, and the two-year associate level in technology, fewer graduates were continuing their education. As usual, the Ph.D. in engineering and the bachelor in technology degree represent terminal points for practically all graduates, with only a few percent pursuing further full-time study. Among master's and doctor's degree graduates the percentage with  other plans remained at fairly high levels comparable to 1973. The strong demand was reflected in higher salaries offered to new graduates. Women graduates averaged slightly higher salary offers than men. No specialties appear to have had significant placement problems in 1974, although architectural engineering, computer science, and engineering sciences were somewhat weaker than other areas.

These organizations represent different views and constituencies including students, states, and institutions such as liberal arts colleges, community colleges, state four-year colleges, and public and private universities. So different are the interests the associations attempt to represent that they are frequently unable to agree among themselves on any but the broadest propositions. On specific questions the associations will frequently part company. Hence, they are likely to differ on the question of whether or not students at state institutions should be expected to bear a  greater share of the costs of their education, or the specific percentage of costs federal grants should be allowed to cover.

The rationale behind these models is based on the idea of a &quot;learning society&quot; that accommodates changing social and personal goals and promotes social equity. There appears to be a sharply increasing interest in further education on the part of adult Americans and a clear movement by American colleges and universities toward expanding the lifelong learning concept. Our decentralized educational structure is likely to temper some of the widespread changes advocated by proponents of lifelong and recurrent learning, but such programs will receive increased funding from  federal and state sources.

In the process of categorization and transmitting knowledge and skills, implicit and explicit values are also communicated to students. Along with these formal influences on student values, there are a variety of informal influences on students. The informal influences include personal contact with faculty and student peers. Research into the impact of American higher education on undergraduate student valuing has proven to be as complex  as the internal organization of colleges and universities, which provide a variety of potential influences on the formation of student values.

It provides a model for interdisciplinary education, developing basic cognitive skills and drawing all disciplines in probing specific problems. The necessary ingredients for a stimulating learning environment based on this model seems to be feasibility, openness, and a genuine feeling of community among all learners. Evergreen begins with no grades, no ranks, no departments, nothing to create a division and competitive learning environment. Beyond this, the school works actively toward building a sense of trust, community, and cooperative exploration. Small Coordination Studies Programs allow personal contact and a sense of group identity. Team  building activities further develop this group commitment and even the facilities themselves are arranged to provide contact and interchange. (Author/KE)",

Its model is based on team-teaching, learning contracts, small interdisciplinary seminars, and other open-classroom and unified educational learning/teaching techniques. Boston State College had been compelled to shift its academic assumptions because of financial stringency followed by a rapid expansion during the 1960's. The planning and implementation of the first segment of the test year for the Unified Studies Programs was an example of real cooperation between the faculty and administration of Boston State College. The most significant result of the program appears to be the challenge that accompanies a new venture which requires faculty, students, and administrators to rethink their goals and  priorities for general liberal arts education.

At the same time, unified education has some unique qualities that the program also tries to use: (1) a holistic perspective, (2) a unidisciplinary methodology, and (3) a quest for rigorous generalizations. Instead of learning fragmented bits of information, they begin to put things together. The aim is to produce breadth without superficiality, and to integrate life experiences with academic problem solving. (Author/KE)",

It also describes how collectively bargained agreements in general have resulted in the development of more formal conflict-resolution mechanisms in all sectors of higher education. An analysis and descriptive summary of grievance procedures at contract and noncontract institutions is provided. It is concluded that the reliance on formal authority is greater and grievance procedures more frequent in collective bargaining situations than in nonbargaining situations; however the trend is for the broader rules of public labor relations to move through all sectors of the higher education community. The need is  underscored for continuing study of different approaches to managing employment relations conflicts. Both contracting and noncontracting institutions are urged to keep thorough records of all bargaining efforts so that longitudinal studies can be performed to provide a basis for a completely systematic analysis that is not possible at the present time.

        "description":"In the mid 1970's the goals of student financial aid revolve around the idea of removing financial barriers to access and reasonable choice. Students should be able to choose an institution based on rational decision making rather than monetary considerations. To this end the Federal Government, the states, and other sources of student financial aid have developed a whole array of programs designed to move us toward the goal of equal educational opportunity. Yet the formulas differ for distributing the funds under these programs, and all too often the funds appropriated fall far short of the program purposes. For a more equitable system to be developed: (1) a student and his family must be assured early in the student's formal education that financial aid will be available: (2)  announcement of the amount of aid should be made before the student to select an institution so that this decision is not dictated by purely financial considerations; (3) to achieve equal educational opportunity, the determination of student need must be based on one method of need analysis used by all who grant student aid; and (4) sufficient funds should be provided to meet the financial need thus determined.

A major source of pressure comes from government regulations for federal student-based aid programs, especially loan programs. These regulations not only determine how the loan programs are administered but also shape internal administrative procedures affecting student-institutional relationships. Pressure also comes from students who seek to influence campus politics and programs and from student-initiated law suits that charge institutions with failing to meet their educational commitments. New institutional and organizational initiatives that attempt to provide more complete  information for students may heighten consumer awareness throughout postsecondary education, creating a more favorable climate in which students can make sound decisions about their education. This activity is implemented by federal efforts on behalf of consumers that result from the government's concern in the awarding of guaranteed loans and in fulfilling their legislative mandates.

From this data base they printed the UC Union Catalog Supplement (UCUCS-1). From 1968 to 1972, an additional set of card records was collected and preprocessed. This study determined the extent to which the new UCUCS-2 records are available in already existing University of California data bases and in a few &quot;outside&quot; data bases. A one-half percent stratified sample was drawn from each UC campus and findings revealed that 82% of the UCUCS-2 sample could be associated with some kind of unique identification number, but only 63% of the total actually had this  number on the catalog record; the others had to be searched in other files.

Hoping to replace complacency and frustration with participation and self-realization, participants encouraged teachers and other social agents to inject their communities with a sense of animation and community consciousness. This policy requires radical reforms in education, political institutions, and cultural patterns, and these changes are unlikely to occur without the assistance and  provocation of a group of agents trained in the art of social reform.

Broadcasters should be educated to make intelligent decisions and to use the media to promote a free and harmonious society.

        "description":"Because no published glossary of audiovisual terms has yet gained international currency, there is a need to: (1) explore international acceptance of a list of audiovisual terms and definitions; (2) review current efforts to do so; (3) propose criteria for acceptable terms and definitions; and (4) recommend procedures for acceptance of terminology. Consistency of definition is necessary to maintain meaningful discourse between producers, librarians, practitioners, and administrators. The goal of providing accuracy and clarity is especially important in a field characterized by prolific growth and diversity of formats. For example, the videocassette is presently available in some 20 forms, and the use of the term no longer suggests specific information about size or system  compatibility. Efforts to develop uniform taxonomies are under way in Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the United States; and the International Council of Educational Media is also developing terminology; but work remains in the development of a list which is exhaustive, mutually exclusive, unambiguous, and amendable to translation.

The individualization of instruction using instructional technology can help to answer that criticism by facilitating the optimal combination of professor-determined objectives and processes with student-determined needs and goals. New technologies and methodologies can be used to adapt the instructional process more precisely to the needs of students. Because there is a natural tension between student-determined objectives and those of the professor, it is important that any new system provide flexibility and choice so that institutional harmony can be preserved.

The effectiveness of each film was tested using three samples: one which was pretested, viewed the film, and was posttested; another which was pretested and posttested but did not view the film; and another which was tested without viewing the film. Results showed that viewing the film significantly improved posttest scores, especially for viewers of high intelligence, but the films failed to achieve the 80 percent proficiency which had been desired.

The population, socioeconomic factors, transportation system, and industrial development in KEDDO were considered. Analysis of both the CNMCLS and the Pushmataha County Antlers Library showed that while the libraries of CNMCLS did not entirely meet Oklahoma state standards, CNMCLS was providing better services than Pushmataha County. Two possibilities for reorganization were proposed: (1) a joint city and county library could be formed, or (2) Pushmataha County could join CNMCLS and enjoy the  benefits of CNMCLS's mail-a-book services; bookmobiles; centralized bookkeeping, book processing, and ordering; specialized equipment; larger book discounts; broader tax base; reference center; personnel training programs; and special programs for patrons. A specific recommendation was made that the Antlers Public Library Board of Trustees review existing policies and procedures and develop a written library policy. Appendixes include state and national library standards, CNMCLS salary and personnel classification schedules, a CNMCLS activities report, and a sample survey form. (LS)",

Findings indicated that FORTRAN is the most adaptable for a wide spectrum of computer memory sizes. The results also showed that almost half the computers used in medical work were of the large main memory type (64K to 3M), and that computer  vending was dominated by International Business Machines and Digital Equipment Corporation.

With the objective of sponsoring some alternatives to expedite change, the project focused on how advertising agencies and advertisers interact and how they create images. The results of interviews and a literature search indicated that advertising agencies continued to respond to the profit motive rather than social needs. However, there seemed to be several ways of bringing about image change. These included: (1) having large organizations, such as National Organization of Women (NOW), approach  major advertisers and advertising agencies with suggestions for change; (2) having stockholders demand a more accurate presentation of women; (3) having large organizations boycott products with particularly offensive advertisments; (4) encouraging acceptance of recommendations made by the National Advertising Relations Board (NARB); and (5) urging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to be sensitive to presentations of women in commercials. The study concluded that alternatives needed to be backed up by research data showing the image of women portrayed by the advertiser or agency. (HB)",

Their decisions are used as input to a computerized simulation of the community. Results generated by the computer are used as the bases for subsequent problems and decisions. APEX stimulates student interaction and encompasses broad decision-making areas in an integrated manner. Student responses to the course has been positive, and there are plans to add more roles to the APEX  simulation. (CH)",

The power of the dual audio was that it piggy-backed on an already existing delivery system, but difficulties derived from attempting to inject educational content into formats that were in many ways inimical to good teaching practice. Research revealed that certain methods of presentation were more effective than others, but the overall results were disappointing. (EMH)",

The other process, tuple-substitution, involves substituting for one of the variables a tuple at a time. The query processing algorithm has been developed for QUEL, the data language for INGRES. Algorithms for reduction and for choosing the variable to be substituted are given.

        "description":"This handbook lists the reasons why educators at the local level should become involved in the development of education television programs for cable television. Developed by the National Education Association (NEA), it encourages use of the cable channels set aside for education by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) before the channels are re-allocated for other uses. A brief discussion of what cable television is and how it can benefit education is followed by reasons why schools should use it and how cable TV can serve teachers, students, parents, and the community. Suggestions for workshops for teachers, how to get started in television programing, and how to get programs on the cable are presented. Ideas for funding sources are also given. (HB)",

        "description":"Educators, educational planners, and social critics convened in Toronto (Ontario, Canada) May 26-28, 1975, to discuss the role of the media, especially television, in planning for the future. The emphasis of the workshop was on political and social futures, specifically materials and situations which would enable people to gain more control over their lives. The five major themes of the plenary sessions and discussions were: images of the future; social, environmental, and physical trends; counter-trends; the colonizers and the colonized of the future; and anticipatory democracy for informed decision making. The task of the futures project was thus defined as providing materials and information about the future, and helping establish political structures to deal with it. Study  groups met and reported on three specific areas: (1) the project's purpose, (2) the means of achieving this purpose, and (3) the contents appropriate to the five major themes of the workshop. Lists of participants in the conference and in specific groups are included, as are some participants' comments on a draft of the report. (Author/LS)",

Total aggregate viewership and the relationship of viewers' ages to viewership was concentrated on. Effects of competing programs on aggregate viewership (the issue of counter-programing) was not dealt with. The relationship of program form complexity to viewership as measured by ratings was also examined. The expected preference for middle program complexity values in general on the part of viewers failed to appear. Age was found to be strongly related to the amount of viewing, and the degree of program complexity seemed to be moderately related to the age of viewers.  Changes in program complexity aPpeared to cancel one another out. Programs high in complexity were attractive to young adults; however, these individuals did not watch much television. The net effect appeared to be a rather flat response of total audience size to changes in program complexity. Noncommercial programs appeared to be less complex in form than commercial programs and their ratings suffered as a result. Also, program complexity was likely to be related to production cost.

Another device, the Visio- Substitutuion System, converts visual images to vibrations over a 10-inch area of the user's back, enabling him to sense a complete image. The Binary-coded Output Display is designed to allow reading of measuring units such as meters and counters. The technology of tactile illustration is improving, both with commercially available tactile maps and illustrations and with materials (such as aluminum foil, paper and screen,  and cellophane) adaptable to individual needs. Other educational aids useful to the visually handicapped include the abacus, the geoboard (with fixed pegs over which rubber bands are stretched to teach number theory and geometry), origami, models, mockups, and realia. Teachers and librarians thus have a variety of devices available to help improve their services to the visually handicapped. (LS)",

There are also differential psychological dimensions that represent consistencies in an individual's manner of acquiring and possessing information, for example Viktor Lowenfeld's haptic and visual types. Since specific attributes are possessed by a given form of media, this three dimensional approach gives strong clues to the reasons why certain instructional methods work well with some learners while having  either little or no effect on other learners.

Bill of Rights. This report reviews the G.I. Bill and the financial assistance it provides, and makes an extensive analysis of the fiscal impact of the passage of this new bill. It concludes that the bill should not be passed because the substantial fiscal impact involved cannot be justified; there is no overriding educational need for such an action, and residency status can now be achieved after a one-year period. Significant findings include the following: (1) of the 25,000 veterans enrolled in Washington colleges and universities in fall 1975, only 819 are nonresidents; (2) in  the U. S. as a whole, 3.3 million veterans will participate in some form of educational training program in fiscal year 1976--by 1980, this number will decline to slightly over two million; (3) the number of veterans eligible for G. I. Bill benefits is expected to decline from nine million in 1976 to four million in 1980; (4) the estimated five-year fiscal impact of extending residency status to all G. I. Bill veterans in Washington would be $3,193,764; and (5) the extension of residency status to all G.I. Bill veterans would have little if any impact on student financial aid programs. (DC)",

The first section reviews a 1974 study of Harper College English teacher ratings, which showed a correlation of .73 between the grades the teachers gave students and the ratings students gave the teachers. The second section reports the findings of a 1975 replication study which showed grade-rating correlations of up to .79. The third section provides a review of the literature in the form of an annotated bibliography, indicating that the Harper findings are typical of the findings of prior research at other colleges. Twenty-eight studies involving more than 70,000 student ratings of faculty in more than 50 colleges and universities have been conducted and published since 1954. In every  study, at least some association has been found between grades and ratings, and in a number of the studies, the association has been found to be quite powerful, with correlations ranging up to .90. The fourth section of this document discusses the implications of the findings, concluding that the widely-held belief that grades and ratings are unrelated is a myth, relying for its support on studies conducted more than 20 years ago--studies that are weak in design and execution, and sometimes less than candid in reporting the data.

This document, part I of a two-part study, describes the relative performances of selected subgroups of the Automotive Service Specialist students on the A.S.V.A.B. A total of 211 of the 217 students in the program took part in this study. Of those participating, 116 were entering freshmen, 78 were continuing seniors, and the remainder were students enrolled in a novel time-shorted degree program involving the New York State Board of Cooperative Education Services (B.O.C.E.S.). Compared with  both regional and national normative groups, the population being tested showed average scores which were: somewhat lower on the coding speed test; approximately equal on arithmetic reasoning; somewhat higher on word knowledge and space perception; and notably higher on tool knowledge, mechanical comprehension, shop information, automotive information, and electronics information. Substantial similarity in Test and Aptitude Area composite scores was found for the continuing seniors and B.O.C.E.S. graduates. Entering freshmen scored lower in both areas.

        "description":"The Program for Development of Community College Faculty was designed to provide statewide coordination and resources for individualized faculty development programs at 18 of Alabama's two-year colleges. It featured a year-long (1971-72) on-campus program of faculty development planned and implemented by certain faculty members from each community college who were designated as &quot;catalytic agents&quot; and who participated in an intensive training session during summer 1971. The program also included a time-sequenced series of evaluations which continued three years after other program activities had ended. This report describes the program in detail, outlines its budget, and presents summaries of the evaluation results. It was found that program participants became slightly more  open-minded and formed more positive attitudes toward basic community college concepts during their year of inservice training, and that it was the &quot;catalytic agents&quot; who benefited most from the program. It is recommended that any replication of this project include: (1) more lead time in selecting &quot;catalytic agents&quot; and in staff planning, (2) either more funding or a more limited scope, (3) the recruitment of at least two &quot;catalytic agents&quot; for each participating college, and (4) the requirement that each &quot;catalytic agent&quot; form program strategies before leaving the summer session. Appended are a list of participating colleges and the evaluation instruments. (DC)",

In order to identify prevalent standards for assigning teaching loads, a survey by mail of 102 California community colleges was conducted. Responses were received from 73 institutions (72 percent). Although a survey of the literature reveals that a 15-clock hour load is considered optimal, and the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office supports this standard, many deviations from this norm were found. In such disciplines as English, foreign language, and other academic areas, faculty had clearly defined patterns of assignment, from 15 to 20 hours. The most inconsistencies were found in occupational education instructors' assignments, with hours ranging from 14 to 35 per week. On the  basis of the review of the literature and an analysis of the survey results, a number of conclusions are drawn, and two recommendations are made: (1) State agencies and academic departments should establish and maintain realistic proposals of expected teaching loads; (2) Continuous assessment should be done regarding correlation of faculty teaching loads in each discipline. Survey results are tabulated in the body of the paper, and the survey instrument and list of respondents are appended. (Author/NHM)",

The 1973 graduates in transfer programs, associate of arts, and associate of science degree programs are examined in terms of: (1) types of degrees and curriculums they completed; (2) their transfer status; (3) their evaluation of the New River Community College transfer program. The 1974 graduates in occupational-technical programs are studied in terms of: (1) their success in finding employment or transferring to other institutions; (2) their opinion of the programs and training at New River. Of the 48 1973 graduates in transfer programs, over 85 percent actually transferred, a large majority of whom (90 percent) transferred to local senior colleges. Transfer grade point averages,  as compared with community college averages, showed a drop similar to those found in national studies. In the 1974 graduating class, graduates in occupational-technical programs numbered 238. Ninety-five percent of the graduates were found to be either working or attending other colleges. Within the employ group, 87 percent were employed in a field related to their area of study. Results of questionnaires mailed to graduates showed favorable responses to both the transfer and vocational programs at New River. Data are tabulated, and the survey instruments are appended.

Although a community college was orignially envisioned, the end result was a plan for a university (universidad Boricua) which will have learning centers in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Puerto Rico, and which will offer bachelor of arts, associate of arts, certificate, and high school equivalency degrees. Each learning center will be housed in a storefront-type facility in a Puerto Rican neighborhood. The proposed university will use existing resources by entering into cooperative agreements with other colleges and universities for the use of laboratories, libraries, and  gymnasiums. It will also solicit the support of local businesses in developing and implementing work/study programs. Universidad Boricua will concentrate on five major fields of study: communications technology, teaching, medical/health technology, urban renewal, and law. This report describes the planning process and the resulting plan and outlines the implementation process. A profile of Universidad Boricua and an overview of the Puerto Rican migrant are appended.

In the past three years there has been an estimated annual increase of 10 percent in the number of part-time faculty employed. Benefits of utilizing part-time instructors include: (1) The opportunity for students to study under outstanding instructors whose primary employment may be elsewhere. (2) The opportunity for instructors to use part-time employment as a means of beginning a career in postsecondary teaching. (3) The opportunity for colleges to respond quickly and efficiently to community needs within the boundaries of fincial resources available to them. Problems associated with part-time employment generally fall  into two areas: (1) Recent court decisions have resulted in enormous confusion regarding the law pertaining to part-time teachers. (2) What benefits should be received by part-time instructors as compared to benefits received by full-time instructors? This keynote address delineates the issue involved in the part-time faculty controversy, and discusses the implications of various prosposed solutions to the problems. (Author/NHM)",

This study was designed to determine the extent to which students actually receive the financial assistance presupposed in establishing their financial needs. A survey instrument was sent to a 20 percent random sample of the full-time undergraduate students at York College of Pennsylvania, a private four-year institution. Responses from independent students were not considered. Responses from dependent students were dived according to parental income into &quot;high-income&quot;  and &quot;low-income&quot; categories, which were matched by sex and residency. The amount of expected parental support was calculated according to normal procedures and was compared to the actual parental assistance reported. Of the 48 &quot;high-income&quot; (over $14,999) students sampled, only 14 received at least 80 percent of the expected parental contribution, whereas 42 of the 48 &quot;low-income&quot; students sampled recieved at least 80 percent of the expected parental assistance.

The college operates on a year-round quarterly basis, with the summer quarter being no different from the fall, winter, and spring quarters. Students can start any quarter and graduate any quarter; they can attend school continuously or intermittently, full-time or part-time. Planning for the college tied the your-round concept into all phases of the operations before the doors actually opened. Programs were developed with a minimum of prerequisites, and most courses are self-contained units. Nine-month faculty are rotated throughout the year. Registration, financial aids, veterans assistance, and other procedures have  been developed to fit a year-round program. Advantages of the year-round system include the opportunity for students to fulfill employment experience requirements during the time of year that is most advantageous from a learning point point of view, and better use of expensive facilities and equipment. Although problems such as faculty fatigue, lack of time for professional updating, difficulty in maintaining the physical plant, and misunderstanding resulting from the break with tradition have occurred, the program has been well accepted by the students and the agricultural industry.

Survey responses came from 101 institutions. A total of 1,481 full-time faculty and staff were reported hired, of whom 188 (12.7 percent) were returning from leaves of absence or sabbatical, 289 (19.5 percent) were former substitutes, 954 (64.4 percent) were new to the district, and 50 (3.4 percent) were new positions gained through special funding. Data were collected as to specific field vacancies filled. A short narrative section compares the C.E.P.A. data with that of previous years of  California Community and Junior College Association reports on staffing patterns. Trends noted include an upward trend in the expansion of student services, as reflected in an increase from 69 to 154 full-time counselors hired, and a heavy influx of new instructors in health services, vocational, and business subject fields. Within the academic subject fields, social science, and English showed the greatest increase over the previous year. The survey instrument is appended, and data are organized into two tables.

The first study reports the results of a survey sent to all students who listed law enforcement as their major field. Two hundred and four students (74 percent) completed the questionnaire which examined the students' characteristics and plans. The average age of the group was 24. Forty percent were employed in law enforcement or a closely related field, and the remainder expected to end up working for a public law enforcement agency. Overall, an interest in the occupational area outweighed all other factors for both men and women, inservice and preservice students, in motivating enrollment in the program. The secord study reports the results of  a survey sent to 147 police chiefs in Minnesota in order to determine the number of job openings in law enforcement in 1975, desired characteristics of new officers, and emerging occupations into which a person with with law enforcement interests might be directed. Most of the characteristics looked for when hiring a new officer fell into one of seven descriptive categories: job interest and ability, morality, emotional stability, understanding of people, intelligence, and personal appearance. Data are organized into tables and appended to each report. (ENHM)",

Reading, writing, and arithmetic were chosen as indices of the level of academic preparation, and a self-report inventory was selected to measure academic motivation. Although participation in the study was voluntary, the 485 students tested in 30 different classes represented 56.9 percent of the enrolled students in those classes. by using cloze procedure, it was determined that 40 percent of the students were experiencing difficulty reading their required textbooks. Sixty-seven percent of their writing samples were judged to be unacceptable for college transfer, and competency in arithmetic as demonstrated by a  subtest of the Comparative Guidance Placement Program, placed these students no better than the 45th percentile on a national norm. On the other hand, these same students appeared to be as motivated (on the basis of an Academic Motivation Scale) as other average community college students across the nation. Subsequent reports will follow this sample of 485 students through the academic year in order to identify possible relationships between the variables and performance. (Author/NHM)",

Macomb's practice of paying for additional teaching time out of general revenues was found to be the most usual practice among the schools in the sample. However, for every course at Macomb in which the contact-credit hour ratio exceeded 1:1, at least one post-secondary institution in the sample, usually a university, had a contact-credit hour ratio considerably lower than Macomb's. If Macomb adopted a lower contact-credit hour ratio, considerable savings would result, because instructors would be generating  more credit hours per full teaching load. Calculating according to the lowest ratios of the colleges in the sample, $357,504 would have been the savings in liberal arts for 1974-75. (NHM)",

Thirty surveys were mailed to students who had graduated in May 1973 from the account clerk program or the business administration-accounting program at Southwest Tech. Thirty-one surveys were mailed to those who had applied to attend Southwest Tech during the 1973-74 school year, but did not attend. Response rates were 63 percent for the graduate survey and 41.9 percent for the nonattendant survey. The private economic benefit variable studied was income after graduation. The private economic cost variables were books and supplies, room and board, fees, transportation, and foregone earnings. The private noneconomic cost and benefit variables were  satisfaction with the community, convenience, and attitudes toward education, present job, and making a decision as to a lifetime occupation. Costs are calculated and shown in tables; the average payback periods were found to be 6.97 years and 5.6 years. Since graduates have higher employment, higher earnings, and are more satisfied with their jobs and community, vocational-technical education would seem to be a worthwhile investment.

About 85 percent of the respondents had received degrees at Harper. There was a sharp decline in alumni transferring on to other colleges, a sharp increase in alumni remaining at Harper for a third year. Unemployment among the alumni rose from 1974, and the salaries of those leaving Harper was not higher than in 1974. The percentage of alumni remaining in the same field was in the 50 to 55 percent range. Compared to the last four almuni  classes, the 1975 class worked fewer hours while at Harper and spent less time on extracurricular and informal campus activities. Although the general comments made about Harper's image, services, and policies were more favorable than in previous years, the alumni rated Harper's training as only half-way between helping considerably and helping somewhat in preparing them for employment. In the managerial skills area, Harper was rated as only helping somewhat. Data are arranged into tables, and the survey instrument is appended. (Author/NHM)",

Students finishing the courses were sent different forms than students withdrawing. In all, 797 students were polled, and 626 responded, a 78.5 percent response rate.

Students taking 7 a.m. classes were more apt to withdraw than students in any other group. However, they withdrew because of personal problems, not because of the inconvenience of the time. Early morning students rated their ability to concentrate, the quality of other students, and the level of instructional support lower than the students in other groups, and tended to earn lower grades.

Ninety-one completed evaluations were returned. About 50 percent of the faculty felt that the orientation was very beneficial and should be continued as is. In 1974, 71 percent felt this way. In both years about 19 percent felt it should be discontinued. The big difference between 1974 and 1975 was that more faculty in 1975 felt the orientation should be modified to shorten the formal orientation, allowing more time for individual preparation and committee work. About 42 percent of the faculty were prevented from attending all or part of the orientation because of other commitments. In 1974 about 20 percent had  suggested meeting off campus. Although this suggestion was followed, only 34 percent of the respondents felt that it was worth the money. Thirty percent felt money would be better spent attracting top educational leaders as speakers. New faculty felt the mentors assigned to them and the new faculty meeting were very helpful.

Rather than assuming that personality characteristics or  college climate alone was the more important correlate of value change, it was postulated that the dynamic interaction of the two was the determining factor. In fact, however, no significant change in values was found to have occurred at any of the seven schools. On an aggregate basis, dropouts were found to be significantly lower on intellectual orientation than either stayers or transfers. Scholastic aptitude was found to have no significant effect on withdrawal at six of the seven schools. Data are presented according to institution, and are organized into tables. (NHM)",

        "description":"This financial report of the New Jersey community colleges is organized around a series of five topics: (1) costs and enrollments; (2) allocation of resources; (3) sources of revenue; (4) enrollment profile and output measures; (5) facilities and capital data. Each of the five sections contains quantative data from budget projections submitted by the colleges for fiscal year 1975-76 and prior years. State aid to the community colleges actually supports a full-time equivalent (FTE) student count 3 percent below the enrollment projections of the colleges. In 1974-75, in addition, there was a major discrepancy between the high actual enrollments at the colleges (60,257 FTE) and the original projections of the colleges (57,656). Latest estimates of enrollment for 1975-76 are for  66,400 FTE. However, because of state imposed FTE limitations, and elimination of the conventional state reimbursement mechanism for overenrollments, the colleges will only receive state funding for 53,129 FTE. There will be, however, a marked increase in other sources of funds, including federal, county, industry, and private. The increased enrollment appears to be part of a general pattern of overall growth in college attendance as an alternative to employment because of a scarcity of jobs. Detailed financial data are tabulated and appended. (Author/NHM)",

        "description":"This document is a 1971 master plan for the development of Nevada community colleges. The mission of the community college is seen as five-fold: occupational, university parallel, developmental, community service, and counseling and guidance. Based on projected manpower needs, the establishment of two new community colleges in Clark County and Western Nevada is recommended. These two new colleges will join Elko Community College as the foundation of the Nevada community college system. Enrollment projections for each of these three institutions are made for the 10-year period ending in 1980. Projections are based on an assessment of high school graduate interest in specific programs, and the expected effects of Nevada's public school adult education programs, of existing  post-secondary occupational programs at the state universities, and of population growth. In addition, policy recommendations are made concerning admission standards, college size, grading, articulation, budget, facility improvement, and expansion. Specific recommendations include: the establishment of an open door policy; a grading policy designed to pass students, rather than to fail them; a goal of 60 percent of total student enrollment in occupational programs; a maximum size of 5,000 full-time equated students for any community college in the state.

In spring 1975, 65 percent of the withdrawees were of non-Caucasian background, and 46 percent were male. About 40 percent of the males, and 20 percent of the females were in their first semester; and about 15 percent of the males, and 25 percent of the females were in their fourth semester or later. About 48 percent of the withdrawees had not been employed during the spring 1975 semester. Only about 26 percent were employed full-time. About 40 percent of the spring 1975 withdrawees indicated that they planned to transfer to a four-year college; 25 percent said they did not intend to  transfer; and 33 percent were not sure. These proportions have been about the same for the last four years. Corresponding figures for the entire student body were 69 percent, 11 percent, and 19 percent respectively. About 97 percent of the withdrawees felt that they were adequately served by the college, and about half expected to return. The most often stated reason for withdrawal was going to work full-time, followed by personal problems. Data are organized into tables, and the withdrawal questionnaire is appended. (Author/NHM)",

The population was defined as students who had accumulated 48 or more credit hours or had received a degree. In all, 385 1970 alumni, and 1,154 1972 alumni were surveyed by mail or telephone; 237 responses (61.6 percent) were received from 1970 alumni, and 815 (70.6 percent) from 1972 alumni. About 70 percent of this population had received a degree or certificate before leaving Harper. Career program alumni tended to remain in their fields, but transfer program alumni drifted away from the fields they had chosen at Harper. In general, the longer the alumni had been away from Harper, the more apt they were to be working at  a higher skill and salary level, and to be working further away from Harper. Sixty-two percent of the 1970, and 37 percent of the 1972 transfer alumni had earned bachelor's degrees by 1975. Overall, about 80 percent of the transfer alumni had taken at least some other courses at another college since leaving Harper. In addition, Harper's programs, facilities, and faculty were rated as to their degree of relevance to the respondents' present lives and jobs, and compared to those at other schools. Responses are tabulated, and the survey instrument is appended. (Author/NHM)",

Projected enrollments for the total College District are: 4,965 in 1975; 14,873 in 1980; 20,016 in 1985; and 32,517 in 1995. However, there are many factors which may significantly revise these projections. Thus, enrollment figures must be constantly reevaluated and their effect on long-range planning taken into account. In order that the College may fully meet the educational needs of the community, a projected balance of transfer, career, and community educational  programs should be presented. Career programs should be grouped in clusters to facilitate the use of common courses and to allow students to build one career on another. Campus core facility requirements are projected for 1978, 1982, 1986, and 1990. These are based on projected enrollment, and instructional program requirements, and include projections of square footage required and corresponding costs.

Although only 104 individuals responded to the three rounds of Delphi questioning, the survey resulted in the identification of 10 clear-cut goals which are presented in this report. (2) In order to evaluate the college's current career education programs, a follow-up survey of career graduates was conducted, along with an employer evaluation of the career graduates. In addition, an examination of career faculty qualifications was  made. (3) A plan of action was designed which gives both intermediate (3 to 5 years) and long-term (10 years) objectives for accomplishing the stated goals of career education at the college. This plan of action is designed to provide the general framework which is necessary for systematic planning, organizing, and evaluating career education activities, and is not intended to provide final procedures for carrying out these activities.

        "description":"As interest on the part of federal and state agencies increases, and legislation is enacted to prevent consumer abuse in higher education, institutions must recognize that students, as well as taxpapers, are consumers of higher education, and that the educational marketplace must concern itself with fair practices, much as business and industry have done in the past several years. The first section of this paper is a philosophical overview of the effect of consumerism in the community college. Some reasons for the development of consumer problems in community colleges are outlined, and a rationale for committing institutional resources to deal with them is given. The second and third sections deal with constructive suggestions of student affairs specialists at two community  colleges (one rural and one urban institution) for facing the problems that consumerism presents to post-secondary education. Focuses include: the need for quick action; the need to gather accurate, relevant, and useful data concerning job descriptions and future job opportunities; the need to present both positive and negative information about the college facilities and atmosphere; and the need to explore various means of dispersing such information to interested members of the community.

These descriptions of student perceptions were worded into statements for the students to rank on a five-point Likert scale, according to their perceptions of what teaching and learning roles mean. This survey instrument was administered to classes in all four divisions at Miami-Dade Community College, along with questions designed to evaluate the course instructors, and questions intended to  elicit information about the students answering the survey.

The meanings of the term structure in structural psychology, in gestalt psychology and in the structuralist movement are described, and it is emphasized that the concept of structure is a purely logical notion. Adjectives (like grammatical) serve only to modify rather than define the generic concept. Treating structure in this way implies that structural isomorphism has useful implications for work in new areas. Such analytical uses of structure are contrasted with Piaget's  conception of cognitive structure which, it is alleged, has been used as grounds for his stages. The possible fallacy of assuming a relation between cognitive structures and cognitive stages in Piagetian theory is explained. Predictions concerning timing and sequence of stages based on this assumption are contrasted with Piaget's findings. (GO)",

        "description":"This study investigated whether the acuity threshold for distant targets is elevated for infants ranging in age from 24 to 63 days. Using square wave gratings and a modified staircase procedure, acuity thresholds for each of 331 infants were determined for one or more of the distances 30 cm, 60 cm, 90 cm and 150 cm. Acuity threshold was defined as the finest grating toward which the infant directed a significant proportion of first fixations. Results indicate that these thresholds were centered around a modal grating-stripe width of 30 minutes of visual angle, regardless of the infant's age. The predominant threshold of 20 - 30 minutes of an arc was found for the 150 cm distance, and no general improvement in acuity threshold was found over the age range tested. These results are  in agreement with other infant acuity studies, showing that 1- to 2-month-old infants are sensitive to gratings of 2 cycles per degree or coarser. This value was relatively constant across large distances, suggesting that the 1- to 2-month-old infant's lens does not accommodate as a function of target distance. This finding is compatible with the evidence to date that the low visual acuity of the infant does not vary with the distance of the pattern being viewed. (It is suggested that the young infant is sensitive only to low spatial frequencies, so that there is not effective stimulus for accommodation.) (GO)",

In the first experiment a problem that was completely unfamiliar to the subjects was used, so that subjects could not base their responses on previous statements of parents or teachers. Results indicated a clear developmental difference. In order to generate plausible interpretations of this finding, an information processing model was constructed to describe the steps involved in performing the experimental task. Various developmental differences  were tested using an interactional strategy. Siegler and Liebert's regularity-without-contiguity task was analyzed and different versions presented to children of different ages. Competing explanations of the developmental difference were tested. Findings indicated that the difference lay only in the subjects' ability to overcome the influence of the blinking lights of the computer used in the experiment. The use of such an interactional design is recommended as a procedure for directly comparing the strength of factors which are hypothesized as central by different theories. (GO)",

Findings suggest that: (1) external  disequilibrium determines primarily the direction of discrepancy between existing and presented cognitive modes and is therefore an important factor influencing the direction of change; (2) internal disequilibrium relates to instability and may therefore primarily affect the amount of change; and (3) under conditions conducive to progressive change, bias distinguishes between subjects likely to advance in modal level and those likely to undergo further elaboration and consolidation of the current level.

        "description":"In this study, which examines the relationship between level of information processing and level of general socialization, a total of 90 children aged 11 and 14 years and a group of 17 adults were presented with an organizational problem: how to order simultaneously presented tasks. Subjects were individually shown a map with locations and distances marked on face-down content and time-distance cards and asked to organize the performance of several tasks which had specific time constraints. Problem solving behavior was recorded by monitoring selection of cards, chosen sequences of moves on the map, and verbal comments. Data was analyzed first by testing 3 hypotheses derived from Schroder's construct of conceptual complexity. Each hypothesis was supported showing that with  increasing age there are increases in level of proving time components of the task, in branching procedures and in the number of correct solutions. Second, the social background of the task was taken into account and hypotheses derived from this theoretical position discussed in terms of the data which confirms theoretical assumptions about the influence of level of general socialization on actual problem solving behavior. The problem was then transformed into a domino-type game and presented individually to a total of 45 subjects in age groups 11 years, 14 years, and adult. Results showed that adults need more time for solving the domino-type task but that younger groups need less time and produce more correct solutions than on the organization problems. (GO)",

Findings support the position that certain perceptual contexts are more likely to induce the child to perceive the class rather than merely the subclasses. Overall transfer results also showed  improvement but gave no significant effects for explicit compared with implicit partioning of the double class display. Experiment 2 placed into two conditions a total of 120 children in age groups 5, 7 and 9 years, each condition comprising three consecutive tests designed to test the effect of intervening double class problems on Test 2 performance and on Test 3 transfer effects. Anticipated improvements were demonstrated. Comparison of data from each experiment suggests that class inclusion is not what is at issue in part-whole comparisons.

        "description":"This document reports the case of 2-year-old girl who demonstrated verbal ability at home but who communicated through nonverbal means in the preschool classroom setting. Baseline data was collected by classroom observation for approximately 32 minutes per day during a 6-day period using an interaction process analysis format. Verbal and nonverbal categories were recorded at 10-second intervals and indicated the direction of communication between subject, peers, and teachers. Analysis of baseline data showed gestural communication to predominate over verbal communication in a ratio of 4 to 1. As a result, a 10-day period of teacher intervention was instigated to increase the child's verbalizations by an increase in teacher talk and by the utilization of wh-form questions (who,  what, when, where, and why). Praise was used to provide positive reinforcement. The 10-day period yielded little improvement in verbal responses, but continuation of the treatment produced a steady increase in verbal behavior. It was noted that without teacher help the child could maintain verbal gains, and peer reinforcement is mentioned as a possible factor in the maintained improvement in the rate of verbalization.

Provisions for children from infancy to school entrance are considered. Historical perspectives on early education and care are reviewed and examples are given of three markedly different systems which provide day care and education to young children today. The bulk of the report consists of comparisons among national systems along such dimensions as goals; composition of classes; training, selection, and supervision of staff; features of the physical plant; design of curriculum; and methods of teaching. The main contrasts  observed between the United States and other countries studied include the absence of active research and program evaluation in most other countries and a lack of self-criticism on educational issues in countries other than the United States, Great Britain, and Sweden. Preschool personnel in other countries are said to have a sense of conviction and purposiveness that may influence feeling of security in children and effectiveness in teachers. The report calls into question the assumptions of United States educators that early education requires (1) low student-teacher ratios and (2) more stringent teacher education requirements than exist in other countries. It is noted that the early childhood goals of character development emphasized abroad appear to be lacking in United States  systems. (GO)",

Subjects were 22 infants aged 3 to 5 months. Each infant was presented with a toy that moved in a small arc from side to side of a small window at the rate of one arc per second. The back-and-fourth movements occurred in synchrony with a chime. The sound was wired either to come from the front window where the toy was located or from 90 degrees to the side behind a cloth. Two dependent measures were recorded: (1) limb and body movement, and (2) visual orientation to the left or right. Infants showed increases in agitated limb and body movement when presented with the chime spatially dislocated from its  temporally synchronous visual source (the toy). Agitation was not shown when the chime and the toy were presented together in space. Infants who demonstrated adequate processing of the auditory information through accurate orientation behavior were most likely to show increased agitation. (Author/BRT)",

        "description":"This paper reports three experiments concerning methodological issues in studies on incidental learning performance which use verbal and nonverbal procedures and which appear to be hampered by differences in stimulus materials, learning opportunities, and dependent measures. The first study, using 128 children from grades 3, 5, 7, and 9, attempted to determine if differences in developmental trends using paired associate and memory tasks can be attributed to methodological differences between the tasks. The second study, using 120 children from the same grades, attempted to see whether invariance in incidental performance across age with paired associate tasks is peculiar to a criterion level of intentional performance. The third study, using a sample of 80 children, examined  whether observed developmental trends in incidental learning may be affected by the degree of difficulty of the task as defined by memory load. General findings are examined to determine if the decline in incidental performance around 11 or 12 years is related (1) to the nature of the intentional task, (2) to minimal learning conditions, (3) to relatively unrelated intentional and incidental independent measures, and (4) to a moderately difficult or demanding intentional task. It is suggested that the decline can be eliminated by criterion levels of learning and by use of a very easy intentional memory task. A viable theoretical explanation for the decline is that at this age children focus on intentional material at the expense of incidental information. (GO)",

Information was also collected on the number of children informally adopted in each house, reasons for the adoption, available alternatives to adoption, length of adoption period designated and circumstances of the parent and the parent surrogate when the child was taken in, characteristics of the child, and the relationship of child and parent surrogates with the natural parents. Data were collected on the incidence of parental request for retrieval of the child, on parental assistance in the care of  the child, on the adoption children's physical and psychological condition, and on the parent surrogates. knowledge of the level adoption system. Analysis of the data indicated that there was a high degree of satisfaction and acceptance of the informal adoption arrangement, that the children were accepted into the surrogate homes as natural children, and that legal adoption was rarely considered or sought by these rural people. It is noted that the stringent requirements for legal adoption would deny many of the parent surrogates in this study the opportunity to become adoptive parents. Improvements in income, educational and health services are suggested as solutions which would not impair the traditional social concern among such people that assures children parental love and care.

        "description":"This study examined the relationship of tutorial enrichment of cognitive processes and reinforcement of lengthened response latency to measurements of impulsivity in 3- and 4-year-old children in a typical preschool setting. In a pretest-posttest control group design, 48 impulsive subjects (24 male and 24 female) were randomly assigned to tutorial and nontutorial groups, producing eight cells with six observations per cell. Subjects were administered the Kansas Reflection Impulsivity Scale for Preschoolers (KRISP), Form A, and the Slosson Intellingence Test. Tutorial subjects then received tutoring with standard curriculum materials in two sessions per week for a 6-week period. During tutorials, subjects were provided with at least two opportunities for reinforcement per minute  for lengthened response latency and systematic search strategies. At the same time nontutorial subjects continued their usual preschool routine. After 6 weeks, all subjects were administered the KRISP, Form B. The findings indicated that impulsivity was modifiable through the tutorial process, although the process was more effective for the 3-year-olds than for the 4-year-olds. The belief in orthogonality of efficiency and impulsivity was corroborated, as were the stability and independence of the impulsivity trait. (JMB)",

Specific information about each of the programs was obtained from a retrospective interview schedule and included program objectives, facilities, staff, curriculum, parental involvement, and ancillary data. Data collected from elementary school records included  demographic information (particularly birthplace and family characteristics), school attendance, personal/social behavior, physical/health status, and school achievement as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test and the Reading and Mathematics Test for New York State Elementary Schools. The results strongly suggest that children from licensed day care programs are performing better than their peers during the early school years.

Counseling for families of handicapped children, modifying physical facilities, and providing special equipment are among the services Head Start  provides for its handicapped children. Diagnostic criteria for identifying handicapped children for inclusion in the Head Start program are provided. All Head Start programs enrolling handicapped children require staff members to have additional training.

The children then entered a special kindergarten class for one year, were kept together for 2 subsequent years in a special school situation, and entered regular third grade classes. Followup information was obtained during the third, fourth, and fifth grades. The assessment criteria used were restricted to objective measures of intelligence and school achievement, such as language use and  understanding, perceptual discrimination, concept formation, sensorimotor coordination, memory, and number skills. Final results indicate that the improvements evidenced by children in the treatment group after the preschool program gave them little or no advantage by the end of the fourth grade over their peers who did not receive treatment. Sex, initial IQ, and sociometric status showed systematic relations to patterns of later IQ scores and school achievement measures.

Most of the data were collected with the use of a critical incident technique, by which case workers from eight agencies reported selected child advocacy cases in which they had participated over a 4-month period. Information obtained from 163 of the case worker reports was coded and analyzed in terms of the advocate, client, problem, target system, objective, available resources, receptivity of target system, intervention level and method used, and outcome involved in each case. The resources used by the case worker and the receptivity of the target system involved are suggested to be especially influential in case outcomes, as portrayed by the data. The  implications of the data for case advocacy practice and theory are discussed. A review of advocacy and social intervention literature is included. (BRT)",

Data on each project's history, development, and current activities were obtained. Data were analyzed to (1) determine how such projects are started and become operational, (2) identify stages in project development, and (3) establish a strategy for evaluating each identified stage of development. From the analyses, an evaluation instrument for community-based child advocacy projects was developed and piloted on six of the 23 projects studied. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff at these six projects to determine the relative success of each child-advocacy project in terms of its planning and  implementation. Variables such as funding agency, leadership, program structure, and advocacy objectives, processes, and targets were found to be important in program effectiveness.

Local services were integrated and new services created in a variety of areas (health, housing, education and welfare) using a primarily paraprofessional untrained staff. Evaluation data were collected from on-site interviews with Advocacy Component (AC) coordinators and staff members, community agency administrators, and randomly selected families served by the ACs as well as from monthly statistical reports on contacts, referrals, staff changes, etc. The report is divided into eight sections (1) the history and development of the AC program; (2) initial objectives and their changes; (3)  activities on behalf of individual families and the relationships between ACs and the families served (including AC population characteristics); (4) family education efforts (e.g., workshops, meetings); (5) agency coordination efforts; (6) staffing patterns, staff functions, training and turnover; (7) the functional cost data analysis; and (8) conclusions. Generally, the ACs are thought to have accomplished considerable work in their communities and on behalf of individual families, but their achievements were found to fall short of the nine national goals originally set for the program.

Four locus of control scales: the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Scale, the Academic Achievement Accountability Questionnaire, the Rotter I-E scale, the Origin-Pawn measure and the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills were group administered to a sample of 74 fifth grade children over a 2-week period. Following this test procedure, the subjects were asked to perform a motor task (pasting stars in circles), a counting task (for which the subjects had an option of selecting the level of task difficulty), a block stacking task, and a practice test on math problems followed by a math problems task for which subjects could select difficulty  level. The performance measures were administered over a period of 1 week. Multiple regression analyses showed that prediction of performance was contingent on sex of the child and task. The best predictor for academic related tasks was IQ; whole locus of control predicted performance on some, but not all non-academic tasks. The data were compared to previous research, and the utility of locus of control as a predictor of task performance was discussed. (Author/GO)",

There were three major purposes for this colloquy: to provide selected Asian Americans with information on the philosophy and goals of CDA, to provide an opportunity for CDA and its constituents to learn about an ignored minority group, and to obtain reactions from Asian Americans to the CDA concept. It was stressed by the panel of seven participants that they were not representative of several major groups of Asian American and Pacific Island people and that their recommenoations must be viewed as tentative for that reason. Topics of the seven papers submitted by the panelists are: (1) the effects of residential patterns of  Asian Americans on the availability and utilization of child care centers; (2) problems of bilinguality and monolinguality; (3) early childhood education in the Asian community; (4) Asian Americans and Pacific Island Peoples; (5) early history of Asian Americans, 1850 to 1965; (6) role models for Asian American children; and (7) the portrayal of Asian Americans in the mass media.

Topics covered are: (1) definition of day care for children, (2) specific competencies required of day care staff beyond the basic CDA certification, (3) assessment procedures, (4) credentialing procedures, (5) eligibility requirements, and (6) special problems. Day care is defined as a multidisciplinary, nonexclusionary extension of the family, operating in an extended time frame at the request of families who use it. The CDA performance criteria are judged adequate to meet primary needs in day care but lacking in the  areas of human relations, individual differences, principles of learning, self-knowledge, objective observation, listening skills, and feeling tone. The task force consensus on the CDA assessment procedures for day care workers is that the additional competencies should be recognized, that procedures should be flexible enough to take account of artificial differences between full and part day staff, and that observations should be extended from 3 hours to a full day session. It is urged that the credentialing system remain independent cf existing licensing or credentialing processes and remain regionalized for flexibility. (GO)",

Statistics show only children often grow up to be outstanding, but there is a long-standing prejudice against the only child; parents often feel that they have to have a second child to &quot;save&quot; their first. Advantages for parents who have one child are discussed in terms of (1) less financial strain, (2) more freedom, (3) ability to devote time and energy to the child, (4) contribution to zero population growth, (5) avoidance of sibling rivalry, and (6) ability  of mothers to realize their own ambitions while enjoying the experience of motherhood. It is concluded that &quot;Oneness&quot; by itself is not a determining factor in how an only child behaves, affecting the child only in the sense that being the eldest, middle or youngest child would affect behavior.

A total of 123 low income single mothers with children under 14 years of age were contacted by telephone and interviewed using a 12-item questionnaire. Analysis of data indicated that 85 percent of the sample used day care services and a majority of the remaining 15 percent said that they would find employment if day care was available at little or no cost. Of those using day care, only 18 percent made use of day care centers and more than 33 percent used relatives as sitters. Satisfaction with day care arangements varied with type used: the use of day care  centers generated the highest rate of satisfaction and the use of an unrelated sitter in the child's home was rated most frequently as unsatifactory. Alleged dissatisfaction with day care centers was based on absence of perceived benefits to the child, costs of care, day care setting and restrictions on eligibility. Satisfaction with day care centers appeared unrelated to income and day care costs. Four recommendations to meet current demand and interest in day care centers were made based on (1) the findings of the present study which indicated high need, satisfaction and preference for day care centers, and (2) a survey of the status of day care services in Cleveland.

The children in the study were 35 Most Masuline boys, 31 Least Masculine boys, 38 Most Feminine girls and 39 Least Feminine girls. Forty preschool teachers selected the subjects from 22 classes in 8 private nursery schools in a large metropolitan area by the method of pair comparisons; subjects were then rank ordered. Knowledge of sex stereotypes was measured using (1) a set of 8 pictorial cards depicting stick figures differing on one stereotype feature, and (2) a set of 16 questions concerning sex stereotypes. Individual children were shown the pictorial cards in  fixed order and asked to point to the girl or boy. They were then asked 16 questions. Results did not support the hypothesis that knowledge of sex stereotypes and cognitive maturity affect sex role behavior. Girls were found to have more knowledge of sex stereotypes in general as well as of their own sex stereotypes when compared to boys. It is proposed that more attention be paid to the establishment of criterion groups in studies attempting to explore the process of sex role development which is still little understood. (GO)",

In the first study, the PPVT and SIT were administered individually to a total of 18 Head Start (HS) children of median age 5 years 2 months. In the second study 18 HS and 18 middle income (MI) 4- and 5-year-old children were asked to label stimuli shown in three representational forms: objects, colored pictures and black and white line drawings. Both MI and HS children labeled the objects more successfully than the pictures, but this discrepancy was greater for  the HS children. It was confirmed that the HS children obtained lower scores on the PPVT than on the SIT, and it is suggested that this may be due to the highly representational stimuli of the PPVT. A training effect was found in both the HS and MI groups; performance was enhanced by the presentation of objects before pictures. The possibility of cultural bias in preschool screening tests is discussed and it is suggested that such bias may be reduced by: (1) using concrete objects in preschool stimulus labeling tasks, (2) ordering stimulus presentation from concrete to highly representational forms, and (3) considering the appropriateness of the SIT compared with the PPVT.

In addition to general information about the study and its findings, specific attention is drawn to contrasts between optimal behavior in low SES and high SES schools, and contrasts between findings expected on the basis of previous theory and research and findings which failed to confirm expectations or even contradicted them. Analysis of these two sets of contrasts suggests an interpretation based upon considerations drawn from developmental psychology (particularly the distinction between Piaget's preoperational stage versus his concrete operational stage) and from an analysis of  differences between the teaching-learning situation in grades 1-3 versus the teaching-learning situation in later grades. The data and these interpretations suggest several implications for how the act of teaching should be conceptualized and how future teachers should be educated. Some of these implications conflict with popular theories and beliefs concerning the nature of effective teaching, the structure of teacher education programs, and the implications of research on cognitive development for curriculum and methods in the early elementary grades.

        "description":"This study examined the effects of varying degrees of situational definition on expectation states of third graders. The experiment was conducted in the spring and replicated in the fall. A total of 389 children in 12 third grade classrooms participated. The experimental conditions reflected three degrees of situational definition. In the assigment condition, subjects were told that another child had high or low ability at a certain task and that this ability was relevant to the task at hand; then expectations for the task at hand were assigned to the other child. In the relevance condition, subjects were told that the other child had high or low ability at another task and that this ability was relevant to the task at hand, but no assignment of expectations to the other child  was made. In the activation condition, subjects were told only the other's ability at another task. Each child was then asked to rate 10 sentences in which some words had been supplied by the other (fictitious) student. The results indicated that in both experiments, subjects in the activation and assignment conditions reflected about equal expectation effects in their ratings, while those in the relevance condition showed a smaller expectation effect. It was provisionally concluded that the data support the equality assertion of the expectation states theory. (JMB)",

Descriptions of the program's objectives, components, staff training, target population and comparison group are given. Results of the annual evaluations of the project have indicated that the program has had a measurable effect on children's cognitive and social abilities. Children who participated in the program have scored significantly higher on the Metropolitan Readiness Test and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test than children who had  not been in a preschool program. Children who had been in the program for two years scored significantly higher on both tests than children who had been in the program only one year. Parents, home visitors and teachers rated children's social behavior and, for nearly all items, posttest scores were significantly more positive than pretest scores. Parents' evaluations of the program for three years have been consistently very positive. (Author/ED)",

Major content areas, dealing with the rights of children aged 10-14 included: health, safety/care, education and information, economics, and legal, judicial, and political issues. Items conceptualized children's rights as oriented towards nurturance (i.e., the provision, by society, of supposedly beneficial objects, environments, experiences, etc., for the child) or oriented towards self-determination (i.e., stress on allowing the child to exercise control over his or her environment.) Two types of analyses were performed on the responses of the 381 subjects: (1) analysis by item subjects' attitudes  regarding nurturance, self-determination, and specific issues of children's rights are sometimes independent of each other. Appendices (approximately one-third of the document) present (1) several statements of children's rights as developed by advocacy groups and others, and (2) the complete 300-item version of the Children's Rights Attitude Scale.

        "description":"In this study, each of 33 middle class children from grades 3 and 4 was administered one of three experimental conditions designed to test in what ways coaching in social play skills improves the sociometric status of the children with their peers. The subjects were selected because of their low ratings on sociometric questionnaires. Condition 1 consisted of instruction, play with a highly rated same-sex peer and review of the play experience with the coach; Condition 2 consisted of similar peer pairing and play without coaching; and Condition 3 consisted of being paired with a highly rated peer but playing games separately to control for possible prestige effects. During play sessions observations were made of frequency of the positive social behaviors being coached, and  following coaching the sociometric questionnaires were again administered as a post-test. Results indicate that children who were coached received higher play ratings than children in the other two conditions, but that coaching for play situations did not result in generalization to the work situation. Gain in peer acceptance for play was not accompanied by gain in number of friends. It is suggested that work ratings and friendships depend on social skills not included in the present coaching. The important aspects of coaching for gains on sociometric measures in the play situation are discussed. (GO)",

Subjects were 60 infants, ranging in age from 3 1/2 to 9 1/2 months, and their mothers. There were three groups of mother-infant dyads: (1) the high-risk experimental group (HRE), comprising 15 high-risk infants who had attended a day care facility for 8 hours per day since they were approximately 2 months of age, and their mothers; (2) the high-risk control group (HRC), comprising 15 high-risk infants and their mothers living together at home; and (3) 30 dyads selected at random from birth records for the local community. Data were collected by  home observation and by interaction process analysis of 25-minute videotapes of mother-child interaction in a home-like laboratory setting. Results indicated that infants in the HRE group vocalized more and were generally more responsive than infants in the HRC group; these findings reflected basic differences in the infants rather than in the mothers, who differed only on measures of maternal concern for optimal child development. The HRE infants and their mothers were found to have a similar social relationship to that between infants and mothers in the general population group, suggesting that intervention has a positive effect on mother-child interaction in disadvantaged families.

Approximately 70 percent of the children enrolled are from single parent homes and most come from poverty level homes. The major sections of the paper cover the training and support services offered by the Red Hook training center for day care providers and parents, with anecdotal reports on the success of each program. Each provider receives (1) a comprehensive 4-week training course given at the center, and (2) follow-up supportive  counselling, information and educational materials from Red Hook educational aides on biweekly visits. Workshops are given at the center for mothers of children receiving care. A bilingual/bicultural program has been designed to cater to the predominantly Spanish-speaking population, and course credits towards the Bachelor of Professional Studies are available to highly motivated providers. A licensed early childhood education teacher is hired for every 40 to 50 family day care homes. (GO)",

The major sections of the paper include: (1) a review of the well-known molar phenomena regarding racial attitudes and preferences and the customary explanations of these based on social learning experiences involving cultural norms, (2) a summary of some recent research findings which challenge the adequacy of an exclusive dependence upon  social-cultural learning theories, (3) the proposal of a revised theoretical interpretation which takes into account the early learning experiences of the child and his subsequent contact with social norms, and (4) a brief consideration of some practical implications which stem from the revised theory (e.g., that pro-light/anti-dark bias in younger preschool children is not bona fide racial bias and is modifiable under appropriate learning conditions, and that generalization of bias to racial contexts could be prevented by abandoning the color coding practice of designating Afro Americans &quot;black&quot; and Euro Americans &quot;white&quot;).

A total of 16 hours of observational data were collected from 37 children, 9 to 11 years of age, during 40-minute free-play periods in their school setting. Dominance assessments were based upon repeated daily recordings of agonistic interactions. Following 5 weeks of observation, all of the children were asked to draw a picture of themselves and a friend. The drawings of 18 children (who each drew someone within their social group) were analyzed initially by two judges for detail of each figure. Each drawing was also scored for closest distance between figures, farthest distance between figures, figure orientation, relative  height of figures, and relative percent of page occupied by each figure. Subsequently, eight different judges independently rated the set of 18 drawings on maturity of style, friendliness, amount of interaction, hostility, and social dominance. Results provide evidence that: (1) adult judges do perceive social dominance differences of children's drawings of themselves and a classmate; (2) inter-judge assessments are reliable; and (3) judgments are correct with respect to observed dominance differences.

In the pretest phase, baseline rates of level movement, panel press and vocal responding were determined for each of the twelve, 6-month-old infants in the study. During treatment sessions, subjects assigned to the contingent stimulation group controlled presentation of auditory-visual stimulation by manipulating a level. An equal number of subjects assigned to the noncontingent stimulation group received the same stimulation noncontingently. In the posttest phase, all subjects were observed in separate tests of (1) learning to panel press, and (2) learning to vocalize to control perceptual  stimulus presentation. Results indicate that the long-term effect of prior contingent stimulation is to enhance responding to control environmental stimulation. In contrast, prior experience with noncontingent stimulation interferes with learning to control environmental stimulation. Analyses of attentional behaviors were used to suggest the processes by which previous experience with contingent and noncontingent stimulation influenced subsequent learning to control stimulation.

The opposing view is that hemispheric specialization is a product of genetic endowment present, in some form, from the beginning of life. The five research papers summarized included some concrete evidence related to these views: (1) a study of hemispheric specialization for both speech and nonspeech sounds in infants; (2) a study of the relationship between the size  of cerebral injury and the pattern of cognitive skills in adult patients who sustained brain injury during infancy; (3) an examination of hemispheric specialization for language in preschool and primary-grade children; (4) a study of hand specialization for shape discrimination in 3- to 13-year olds using the dichotic listening procedure for the haptic system; and (5) a discussion of the interaction of experiential and genetic factors in the patterning of cognitive abilities in normal individuals.

A total of 14 preschool children (6 girls and 8 boys) were rated for separation anxiety proneness by their parents prior to preschool entrance. The preschool teaching staff then rated them for entrance distress each day of the first two weeks of preschool attendance. A clinical psychologist made almost daily observations in the nursery school throughout the school year; in addition, periodic observations, parental interviews, and developmental assessments were made by a child study group composed of another clinical psychologist, a developmental psychologist, and several graduate students. At the end of the year, the  clinical psychologist who served as regular observer prepared summaries on each child based on the group's consensus from individual findings. The material from these case summaries was analyzed using a clinical judgmental process. The findings indicated that children who are prone to high separation anxiety have more limited repertoires for peer interaction than other children do, and that their relationships with both peers and adults are dependent ones. It was concluded that separation anxiety in early childhood has important implications for psychosocial development. (JMB)",

The practices are divided into 3 general categories, according to primary emphasis: (1) parent involvement in home learning, (2) group teaching practices, and (3) special programs. Relying on active parent involvement in the home, the first category consists of such program areas as early identification of learning disabilities, teaching severely handicapped children, and preparing young children for the classroom setting. Designed to provide  young children in rural or migrant areas with group social experiences outside the home, the group teaching practices involve such diverse elements as bilingual educational training, creative toys and games, and a learning center on wheels. The last category includes a program, not yet in operation, which has proved successful in testing stages, and one which lacks a distinctly rural emphasis. However, both offer potentially adaptable models. Each description includes: program title, location, needs, developmental history, implementation considerations, vital statistics, evaluation, and contacts for further information. (NQ)",

        "description":"Of the more than two million seasonal farmworkers in the United States, nearly half are between the ages of 14 and 20 years. Although much has been done recently to meet some of the special needs of these migrant youth, they are still confronted with inadequate educational and training opportunities and limited career aspirations. In the forefront of what has been done is career education, a widely discussed but little understood concept among educators and public alike. By adapting the concepts of career education to the special and unique circumstances of the migrant farmworker, career education can have a positive impact on the educational process of the migrant child. This paper focuses on the philosophical and process assumptions of career education and applies them to the  special situation of migrant children. Career education is discussed as a: (1) means of strengthening the relationship between the school and work, (2) means of easing the transition between school and work when the time comes, and (3) vehicle which will give migrant youth the opportunity to choose among alternative social and occupational lifestyles.

Issues tend to cluster around interface areas in which there is inherent institutional, programmatic, or organizational stress. An analysis of the problem of developing a nationally coordinated bilingual education program suggests 5 potential areas of major stress: (1) the &quot;continuity&quot; issue characterized by stress between new and existing programs and products; (2) the &quot;communication&quot; issue resulting from expanded internal, as well as, external linkages; (3) the &quot;cooperation&quot; issue arising from new interface areas at the  local, state, and national level; (4) the &quot;coordination&quot; issue involving interaction between Federal and non-Federal activity, among funded bilingual centers and clearinghouses, and with related state and local efforts; and (5) the &quot;compliance&quot; issue involving adherence to laws, rules, and regulations. Some unresolved questions regarding further implementation of the law are presented. The appendices include a listing of: (1) legislation amended by P.L. 93-380, (2) new acts or legislation embodied in P.

A total of 133 of these people were interviewed and divided into the following subgroups for purposes of comparison; (1) 74 respondents (46 blacks and 28 whites) who had been and remained employed following the III-B training; (2) 29 respondents (20 blacks and 9 whites) employed following III-B training but unemployed at the time of the study; and (3) 30 respondents (28 blacks and 2 whites) who had never been employed following the III-B training. The interviews were designed to solicit information relative to: (1) demographic characteristics; (2) employment history; (3) job attitudes; (4) perceptions; (5)  transportation; (6) support for employment; (7) internal-external control; (8) health factors; (9) migration; and (10) Herzberg's job satisfier and dissatisfier factors. Among the first two groups, the main roadblocks to jobs during 1971 were &quot;could not find suitable work&quot; and &quot;laid off from work.&quot; Reasons cited for leaving their first job after III-B training also centered on being laid off (32 percent) but included transportation problems (15 percent). Among the third group (predominantly black, unmarried, separated, or divorced females with children) major reasons cited for unemployment were inability to find suitable work (70 percent) and ill health (13 percent).

        "description":"Rural sociology research in the South needs to confront the question of research priorities in order to more effectively meet the needs of its various clients and publics. Review of current priorities in rural sociology reveals emphasis on research activities ordered as follows: (1) Rural Development; (2) Population Distribution; (3) Social Inequality and Disadvantaged Groups; (4) Environment and Natural Resources; (5) Agricultural Industry; and (6) Nonmetropolitan Communities. Since rural sociology is an applied field, research originates in the social problems confronted by policy makers and practitioners. Therefore, establishing criteria and procedures for setting priorities is more important than listing specific priorities. An adequate basis for determining research  priorities must be grounded in the practice of rural sociology to provide continuity and focus, but not to the exclusion of future-oriented theory and methodology. The theoretical orientation of social change as applied to social organization has been largely overlooked. In order to employ the organizational orientation there must be a change in methodological emphasis to include the use of a more diverse assortment of research tools. Since the cost for such an orientation would be high, a capacity for initiating and continuing communication with potential clients must be built into the research activities. (JC)",

Major conclusions cited in this report are: (1) Maine Indians are being denied services provided other Native Americans by Federal  agencies which is not only discriminatory but is also placing a disproportionate tax burden on Maine taxpayers. (2) Half the Indians in Maine are not receiving State Indian services because they live off-reservation. (3) The State should develop an integrated service program to serve all Maine Indians (Maliseets, Passamaquoddys, Penobscots, and Micmacs) regardless of their residency. (4) Current socioeconomic statistics reveal longstanding discriminatory practices (45 percent substandard housing, 65 percent unemployment, severe health problems, nonexistent bicultural education, and 4 out of 136 Indian foster children in Indian foster homes).

The study was limited to the Northeastern states of Maine, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York. Focus group sessions were conducted with 6 groups of students presently enrolled in programs of allied health, 6 groups of faculty, staff, and administrators of postsecondary allied health programs, and 1 group of minority professionals working in  allied health. The discussions were analyzed in 2 ways: (1) objective analysis of barriers as stated in discussion and (2) content analysis of underlying thoughts and feelings. Findings indicated that: (1) most minority students did not include the allied health fields in their career selection process because they had no knowledge or inadequate knowledge of the career opportunities available; and (2) those who did enter postsecondary programs found the academic work difficult, sensed a feeling of social isolation, and seemed unable to find or get the supportive services needed to successfully deal with their environment.

Data derived from 892 questionnaire responses were analyzed in terms of past, present, and future land use; land valuation; market trends; tenure; and prospects for potential conflicts among competing rural land uses. Specifically, data encompassed: (1) population statistics, 1950, 1960, 1970; (2) export industries; (3) rural land use in 1972 (acreage distribution, land values, mineral resources, idle farmland, farm income, agricultural crops, crop acreages, livestock income); (4) changes in land use, 1962-72; (5) anticipated land use changes,  1982; (6) land use problems (farm operation, water sources, and disturbed lands). Results indicated rural landowners: (1) owned less than 100 acres; (2) large tracts were few, averaging 177.9 acres; (3) beef cattle sales comprised the major source of farm income, but most owners earned greater incomes off the farm; (4) large owners of timber and mineral rights were notably absent from the survey population; (5) 50 percent of those surveyed had coal reserves, 80 percent had coal rights, and 13 percent indicated willingness to sell; (6) farmland will decrease and farms will increase in size; (7) livestock production will be the major determinant of the surveyed land.

        "description":"Purpose of the Zip Test is to locate the instructional level at which a child can effectively use a mathematics book and a reader and to indicate his ability to conceptualize verbally in English. Designed to determine quickly and with reasonable accuracy the grade placement of a migrant child in reading and math and to assess his English language facility, the test facilitates the migrant child's rapid placement into a productive learning situation upon his arrival at school and eliminates vital periods of &quot;sterile exposure&quot; to learning situations in which he cannot respond. The test is divided into 3 sections: Language Facility, Reading, and Math. This examiner's manual presents the directions for administering each section of the Zip Test. Most of the directions are in English  and Spanish. Zip Tips are given to indicate timesaving shortcuts and helpful hints. The manual also includes directions for: (1) administering math worksheets, (2) scoring the test, and (3) transferring scores from a tab sheet to a locator form. The assessment of the reliability and validity of the Math and Reading sections is discussed. (NQ)",

(5]Was &quot;agrigovernment&quot; (characterized by massive support programs for agribusiness) meeting its respcnsibility to all the people and institutions in rural America? and (6) What were the common interests of small farmers and farmworkers in the face of political and economic forces which controlled their lives, sometimes making them victims of poverty, but which lay beyond their control?

        "description":"Perceptions of social change in American society and education were examined via an attitude survey (22 demographic questions and 73 opinion statements) administered to the entire population of 5 Northern California rural high schools (n=1,288); all English classes in 2 Sacramento schools (n=1,384); and rural adults (n=258). Structured interviews were given to a cross section of students and adults (categories defined by the interviewers and selection made by school administrators). Among the items examined were: (1) Impact of Change (pace, quality, and pscyhological impact; traditional values; science and technology; family life); (2) City/Country Contrasts (freedom from serious social problems; the cautious approach; youth opportunities); (3) Change in American Education (pace;  leadership; controversial issues; facilities; curriculum; teaching methods; lifelong learning). Results indicated: (1) the pace of change is perceived as damaging to traditional American values, particularly among rural adults; (2) there is widespread fear that city migrants and recreational or corporate developments will destroy rural life; (3) there is uncertainty and disagreement about the proper role of the schools in the future; (4) pride, resentment, uncertainty, anger, fear, and hope all seem to characterize rural attitudes about a changing society.

        "description":"Since 1970, the Servicio National de Desarrollo de la Comunidad (SNDC) has been in existence as an autonomous decentralized government agency. Its main effort has been to integrate Bolivia's 3.4 million rural inhabitants, the &quot;campesinos,&quot; into the mainstream of national socioeconomic programs through self-help development projects at the community level. Schools, clinics, roads, bridges, potable water systems, sheep dips, livestock shelters, silos, and irrigation projects have been the main areas of concern. Local level workers trained in home economics have helped form Mothers' Clubs, provided training in homemaking arts, artisan crafts, hygiene and sanitation, child care, and other activities. SNDC has provided veterinary and agricultural production promotion, and education  services for small farmers. In 1975, an evaluation was conducted to help the SNDC build upon its considerable past success and expand its roles to meet new and changing demands for the development of rural campesino communities. This report presents: (1) a relatively objective description of conditions existing during May and June 1975 within the SNDC training component; (2) an assessment of what was observed in relation to SNDC's past efforts and future projected roles; and (3) recommendations for strengthening and changing the training component in light of the new roles, responsibilities, and demands.

During 1974-75, the program's 4th year of operation, there were 1,483 students enrolled in grades K-3. Of these 64 percent were Spanish surnamed, 35.8 percent were Anglo surnamed, and .20 percent were Japanese Americans. Student needs were met through the use of more individualized instruction, and more precise evaluation procedures for assessing student progress. Factors which influenced and enhanced the student's learning styles were achieved through an extensive presentation of oral language  development in both English and Spanish, music appreciation (both listening and oral exposition), ethnic dances, and art. The project staff consisted of a director, a materials specialist, 63 certified personnel, 49 paraprofessionals, 9 community representatives, a curriculum specialist, and an internal evaluator. Focusing mainly on the up-to-date process evaluation findings in each of the program's operational components, this report presents data obtained from in-service meetings, pupil progress reports, Test of Basic Experiences, workshop evaluation scale, supply inventory, material development and management.

The earliest records of Maine Indian representation are 1823 (Penobscot) and 1842 (Passamaquoddy), but Massachusetts' records indicate that Indian representation had probably been going on since or before the Revolution. Due to intratribal confusion and party conflict, the Main Legislature began in 1866 to describe the procedure for electing the Penobscot legislative representative as well as the tribe's governor and lieutenant governor. In 1952, the two Passamaquoddy reservations set forth provisions for annual election of their tribal representative in the Treaty of Peace of 1852. At the time of its inception in 1907, the Legislative Record indicates that  Indian representatives were both seated and afforded opportunity to speak. However, after a concerted effort in 1939 to upgrade the status of Indian representatives, there was reaction, and in 1941 Indian representatives were ousted entirely. Until 1975, Indian representatives were excluded from the floor of the House, their status being little better than that of State paid lobbyists, though in 1965 their salaries were raised and in 1967 an expense account was added. In l975 the House restored seating and speaking privileges to Indian representatives after a 34-year lapse. (JC)",

Occupation and residence histories were obtained from a 10% sample of rural households which produced data for 204 second generation household heads, their spouses, and their siblings 16 years and older (n=1,677) and their third generation children 12 years and older (N=593). Additionally, agricultural and marketing data were analyzed. The guiding hypothesis maintained that the number of high educational and occupational levels of both generations would be meager and that representatives from the larger  landowning families would attain the higher levels. Results indicated: (1) the rural-born were likely to remain concentrated in traditional positions in the agricultural or service sectors where much underemployment prevails; (2) the few rural people from higher social class positions would maintain that position from one generation to another via transfer of land or migration to urban places and entry into technical or professional positions; (3) despite industrialization, the pyramidal social hierarchy, characteristic of preindustrial society, would continue.

        "description":"Included in this document are a selection of articles reprinted from SCIENCE AND CHILDREN. They focus on environmental education in the elementary school, and present a number of environmental perspectives. Those concerning general or background information are: an examination of environmental education: children's attitudes about the environment; teaching resources in the national parks; and a school/community effort to preserve an urban environmental study area. Ecology is treated through investigations at the individual level, populations of one species, communities, and ecosystems. Adapting traditional activities to an ecological approach, emphasizing concepts of interaction and change, is suggested. Earth science experiences to increase awareness of the child's own and  natural enviornment center on site experiences. They focus on analyzing small parts of a larger environemnt--investigating change, age, movement, erosion, deposition, etc. The field trip is presented utilizing a conceptual approach to develop environmental relationships. Suggested activities for children for observing their town as a man-dominated biotic community are examining construction, tree identification, soil samples, zoo trips, food chains, and succession. A calendar for teaching conservation activities is constructed. One article is devoted to the associations between nature and creativity. References are included following some articles. (BP)",

        "description":"This study was conducted to determine if fifth-grade students can significantly improve their use of logical analysis through a suitable instructional unit taught under ordinary classroom conditions. Concrete teaching materials were developed to familiarize students with the distinction between the valid inference patters--Modus Ponendo Ponens and Modus Tollendo Tollens (MP, MT), and the fallacious ones--Affirming the Consequent and Denying the Antecedent (AC, DA). No formal rules were taught. The experimental unit was implemented 4 to 5 times a week for 23-25 sessions, by 4 fifth-grade teachers in their ordinary classes. The teachers participated in a 12-hour pretraining workshop. A pretest/posttest, treatment/no treatment design was applied to assess resulting improvement in  students' conditional reasoning ability. The sample consisted of 210 fifth-grade students in a suburban area, 104 in 4 experimental classes and 106 in 4 control classes. Experimental and control group pretest performance levels did not differ, but there was a significant difference in the posttest means. There was no significant change in the control group's pretest and posttest performance levels on any logical form, or for the experimental group's on MP and MT. However, on AC and DA the two groups' gain scores were significantly different. (MLH)",

Programs intended for this purpose are described, with attributes and weaknesses of each mentioned. The current status of computer interpretation is evaluated as being generally more reliable than human interpretive methods. Another important use of the computer in patient monitoring is also described. Again, in the area of electrocardiography, the computer can detect ventricular fibrillation, an  interruption of the heart's electrical stability. The computer has proven to be very effective in the detection of preliminary symptoms of ventricular fibrillation, thus lessening the demand on medical personnel to constantly monitor patients.

Specially, environmental topics relate to the university as the environment of research, including its administration and organizational structure. Managerial issues deal with those aspects of management which involve selection of personnel, supervision and control, and project evaluation. Behavioral considerations include problems concerning  individuality, education, and status, and the miscellaneous category is devoted to issues dealing with the research process itself. A cross-reference with these issues and 25 studies concerning research management is provided. (Author/CP)",

Two forms of a standardized test were used in a pretest-posttest format. The mean, standard deviation, scatter diagram, and regression line were calculated for each instructional group and appear in attached appendices. Histograms are used to show pretest and posttest scores for subjects in each of the groups and scatter diagrams are constructed in which lines of regression  are drawn. With the use of the stardard errors of measurement for each of the instructional groups, it was found that significant achievement resulted for 73 percent of the traditional group, 78 percent of the televised group, and 59 percent of those subjected to individual instruction.

Fifth-grade children from four schools in New Mexico who had had bilingual education for at least four years were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups, and were instructed in subordinate and superordinate units of science. Three dependent measures were administered. Two measures sampled student performance in science activities; one was administered after initial science instruction, the other at the completion of the study. Measures were also administered for student language preference and attitude toward science  instruction. The major finding of the study was that there were no significant differences between treatment groups receiving instruction bilingually and those having single language instruction. The students receiving total instruction in English did no better on the dependent measures than those students receiving total instruction in Spanish, and students receiving instruction in both Spanish and English performed just as well as those instructed in a single language. The students showed a statistical preference for a bilingual environment as opposed to a monolingual environment. (Author/MLH)",

These tasks were designed to assess acquisition of concepts identified as formally related to various aspects of number concepts. Tasks within a concept area were weighted according to their relative importance and degree of difficulty. Data were analyzed using contingency tables. In the second phase of the study, data were reanalyzed using a set of behavioral indices developed by Brainerd in earlier work.

Taylor School in Boston was used as a laboratory for the collection, study, and evaluation of published metric materials. Problems inherent in the introduction of the metric system in four dissimilar elementary schools were studied. The main concerns focused on staff training and conversions, pupil incentives, and community/parental support and involvement. A primary administrative concern is that of finding money to purchase texts and materials for metrication. This paper describes the preliminary steps involving suppliers, staff, community, and school personnel, as well as procedures involving faculty and students for evaluating materials and programs.  The paper includes a recommended list of the metric materials and aids judged to be most worthwhile for use in the elementary school. It was also recommended that a faculty review and use the materials before ordering them; that materials be learner-tested; that resource rooms to established and materials be shared to reduce costs; and that descriptive cost-analysis lists be distributed to assist in the purchase of cost-effective metric materials.

Three vital needs were identified for a successful conversion policy in the U.S.: (1) a broad-scale involvement of all major elements in early planning, (2) a committed government policy and firm schedules, and (3) continued communication and coordination as conversion progresses. Recommendations include: (1)  the creation of a national evaluative body that would establish clear uniform standards for metric educational materials; and (2) a coordinated teacher training strategy, with direct communication links with teachers and provisions for feedback on metric curriculum materials.

The relation of structure and property is the theme followed through all but the ecology part of the course. This course attempts to intrigue the  nonscience major by showing him how he lives with and depends on materials and how he or his representative will be responsible for laws regulating these materials in the future.

        "description":"This paper describes a program at Old Dominion University (ODU) which engages qualified graduate students in a professional research/design experience while simultaneously providing the academic environment for full-time study. During the two years, students are provided a stipend and tuition expenses under a study grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Langley Research Center (NASA/LRC), Hampton, Virginia. Masters students and a few Ph.D. students are selected for the program. During the second year, students engage in actual engineering research and design at NASA/LRC. Sections of the paper describe (1) the ODU interdisciplinary approach to graduate aeronautics education, combining strengths from major engineering disciplines; (2) methods of student  selection, study program planning, placement in NASA/LRC branches, student advisement, and research supervision; (3) degree production and current status of program; and (4) reception of the program by NASA management and engineers, the engineering faculty, and the students in the program. Evidence presented indicates that mutual benefits from the program accrue for the students, the engineering school, and the cooperating agency. (LS)",

        "description":"Agricultural engineers have been working for a number of years with colleges and universities in many developing countries to improve their agriculture. Much of the activity in university development assistance has been taken over the last 20 years. The greatest portion of the support has come from USAID. Among the common problems facing the programs were: (1) the method of financing on a year-to-year basis; and (2) teaching, research, and extension were rarely under one administrative unit. The first official agreement covering a United States sponsored university contract was signed in 1952. During the next 20 years, six American universities became involved. By 1972, India had established nine new agricultural universities patterned after our land-grant institutions. The  program was phased out during 1972 and 1973 at the request of the Indian government. The overall objective of the United States university contract program was to help India develop state agricultural universities with colleges of agriculture, veterinary medicine, agricultural engineering, home science, and basic sciences and humanities. Insight is given as to how a College of Agricultural Engineering was established. (LS)",

Implemented seven years ago, it has developed into a successful continuing education vehicle for mid-career professionals. Those proposing the program recognized that without guidelines to follow, it must be developed using feedback gained from students, faculty, and professionals. As presently offered, the program is flexible and open-ended in terms of electives and theses topics. Graduates have developed emphases in a wide range of subject matter and have applied their newly learned tools to improve their current situations or to redirect their careers. Out of the 100 graduates, about 30 have engineering backgrounds. Some of the  coursework is delivered over instructional television (ITV) via the Association for Continuing Education (ACE) and the Stanford ITV Network. It is anticipated that ACE will assume a regional leadership role in the certification and recertification of professionals. It is believed that the concepts of the cybernetic systems program will be extended to levels of education both below and above that of the current master's level. (LS)",

        "description":"Engineering mechanics is recognized as one of the core subject matter areas of most engineering and technology educational programs. The study of mechanics and particularly the applications of problem solving to rigid bodies at rest (statics) has proven to be troublesome to students. Systematic problem solving includes analysis, synthesis, and calculations. There is evidence to indicate that students gain broader insights into analysis and synthesis when freed from detailed computational method. The computerized model relieves the students of the mechanics of calculation and checks the students' analysis and synthesis of a broad range of statics problems on an individualized basis. The function and structure of the model is discussed. Two populations of students were used in  testing the model. One group consisted of eight sophomore engineering students, who had completed a computer programming course. The second group consisted of 27 freshman technology students who had not completed a computer programming course. The overall attitudes of both groups were positive toward the model on the pretest. Engineering students became more positive on the posttest. Technology students became significantly negative on the posttest. It was suggested that technology students probably would have gained more from the model if they also had had to turn in problems. (LS)",

        "description":"A premature embarkation in specialized areas of fluid mechanics by the beginning graduate student, without having first thoroughly learned the basics, leads to learning difficulties and destroys zeal for learning. To avoid these problems, many schools in the U.S. offer beginning graduate courses in fluid mechanics (BGCFM). Because the success or failure of BGCFM has a profound effect on the students' subsequent learning, these courses must be planned according to specified objectives. The following include the goals of BGCFM: (1) review basic concepts; (2) introduce new concepts; (3) survey entire field; (4) learn state-of-the-art; and (5) study necessary math. At the University of Missouri-Columbia, these goals are accomplished in a series of two courses: Fundamentals of Fluid  Mechanics (I) and Hydrodynamics (II). Course I is devoted to the first two goals and Course II to the last three. The specific objectives of Course I and Course II are given. The objective-oriented instruciton described involves (1) the writing of a list of goals and objectives of the course, (2) distribution of the list to students, (3) conventional teaching, and (4) reevaluation of the list at least once a year.

This tripod model of engineering education requires that all three legs be present for the educational system to stand. This paper presents one way that the observation leg, the weakest element in most engineering education programs, can be strengthened. The use of engineering case studies, particularly at the graduate level, has been described as an academic/professional link which is an alternate way of defining the observation leg of the tripod. Case studies offer a way  for students to learn about and empathize with the real world. At both the Berkeley and Davis Campuses of the University of California, students can choose to write a case study as a portion of their Master of Engineering program. After meeting several times with their faculty advisor and the project engineer, they write the case study. An appendix includes portions of two student prepared case studies and a list of student-written cases. (LS)",

A secondary purpose of the investigation was to compare student gains according to area of interest. The writer selected one of the processes of science, the process of measuring, which she considered basic to the new approach in the teaching of elementary science. Preservice elementary school science teachers participated in the study. Data were secured from four elementary science education methods classes. The curriculum, Science - A Process Approach, was used for the instructional materials in the study. The testing portion of the study represents all of the competencies included in the Process of Measuring of the  entire program. Tests were constructed and administered. Difference scores were obtained between pretest and posttest administration. It was determined that students enrolled in the methods classes gained more competence from an applied mode of instruction than from an abstract mode. The classification level of students caused no significant difference in learning outcomes as related to the process of measuring. Science oriented students make more significant competency gains by both methods than language art or social studies students. (EB)",

Chapter one presents an overview of the typology of values education approaches developed in the earlier publication and three procedures designed to help users apply the analytical system. Chapters two through six contain the analyses of curriculum resources. Each chapter focuses on one of the five values education approaches: inculcation, moral development, analysis, clarification, and action learning. Each is divided into three  sections: a detailed explanation of the approach, analyses of student materials reflecting the approach, and analyses of teacher materials reflecting the approach. Chapter seven describes and explains two other approaches to values education--evocation and union--for which there are few curriculum materials presently available. These two approaches are explained in terms of their rationale, purpose, and methods. In addition, sample learning activities and educational programs related to these two approaches are discussed. An annotated bibliography of over 400 materials and resources concludes the document. (Author/JR)",

The study ascertains whether the social-geographical environment or the family and other primary groups influence the orientations of Japanese Americans. Inquiry was limited to attitudes about majority rule and minority rights. Questions asked were: (1) what are the relative proportions of support for democratic precepts among Japanese, Japanese Americans, and other Americans; and (2) are the age/generation differences within these three groups similar in direction and extent. Although there are strong similarities in orientations, it was  found that elder Japanese Americans are more like their cohorts in Japan than like Americans, but that younger Japanese Americans are more &quot;American&quot; than a cross section of non-Japanese Americans. Thus, it seems that cultural predispositions to political behavior are transferred through the family and other primary groups or socialization agents. Also, orientation discrepancies are due probably to generational differences rather than environment. (Author/ND)",

        "author":["Lindmark, Joyce A."],
        "description":"Three changes in trial procedure are proposed to minimize the effects of individual juror bias and those biases that are artifically induced by lawyers. Since certain personality types are likely to maintain whatever prejudices they bring to court, no one should be exempted from jury duty unless he is mentally retarded or physically incapacitated in a way that makes jury service impossible. This would not eliminate juror bias but would broaden the venire in order to more accurately reflect the biases of the total community. Second, since most jurors have a verdict in mind before they leave the jury box, unanimous verdicts should be eliminated. This would decrease the effect of individual biases of either the majority or minority in jury deliberations. Third, lawyer-derived biases  may be eliminated by doing away with both cause and peremptory challenges. Too often lawyers use jury selection as means to seat jurors who have biases favorable to their side of the case. Also, in many cases, prospective jurors learn to give the \"right\" answer, glossing over their actual feelings. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"This publication, a revised edition of ED 081 706, contains a conceptual framework for social studies curriculum development. The social science disciplines--anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology--are considered resources for providing the key concepts, insights, and methods of inquiry enabling students to gain a better understanding of present and past societies and cultures. The framework, which comprises the major portion of the document, provides the following information on each discipline: (1) the major cognitive concepts, (2) a list of generalizations or ideas around which the concepts can be organized, and (3) an example to illustrate the development of a single concept into performance objectives and suggested teaching  strategies. A model, showing how to develop an interdisciplinary unit on Poverty in America, cities concepts, skills, performance objectives, and suggested teaching strategies for accomplishing the objectives. The document also contains a brief list of affective concepts and a list of social studies processes. Although much of the material in this document duplicates that of ED 081 706, a few new concepts for most disciplines have been added. The section on psychology has been completely rewritten, and the section on the development of an interdisciplinary unit has been heavily revised. (RM)",

        "description":"This paper proposes that research and scholarship regarding nationalistic education be encouraged in order to increase our understanding of this form of values education. Nationalistic education, defined as those educational activities designed to develop a belief in national values, usually incorporates three dimensions: (1) development of positive feelings toward those rituals, ceremonies, symbols, and persons which express or incorporate national values; (2) development of competency in operating as a national citizen; and (3) development of negative feelings toward countries, ideologies, symbols, and persons which are considered contranational. Since all three aspects are value laden, their uncritical indoctrination for national ideals must not be left unexamined. Some of the  studies conducted in this field and suggestions of several kinds of research that can contribute to this study are described. These include historical research, current documents study, text and materials analysis, censorship investigation, sociopsychological instrument development and use, interviews, and longitudinal attitude studies.

Regional Crisis requires student decision-maker diplomats, grouped in teams, to respond to a Middle Eastern crisis that has substantial potential for escalation. In response to an initial crisis scenario, student teams representing various Middle Eastern countries suggest policy decisions based on the expected costs, risks, and gains that may be expected from the implementation of such policies. Students representing members of the United Nations and an international newspaper encourage the student diplomats to publicly defend their country's policies with moral and legal statements and reasoning. All policy decisions take the form of treaties with  other nations. A team is considered successful or effective by the degree that it achieves all or most of its goals. The game teaches the utility of the cost-risk analysis model for both the planning and evaluation of policy decisions. Teacher guidelines, student guidelines, and sample student materials are also included. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"Social-distance attitudes of preservice teachers from middle and lower social classes toward minority and national groups are examined. Social distance, the aloofness and unapproachability of persons of different social strata, is both a symbol of class standing and a means of maintaining the existing distinctions in rank. The Bogardus Social Distance Scale was administered to 251 Mankato State preservice teachers who responded to the degree of intimacy they would allow to members of outgroups. Social-distance attitudes of preservice teachers from upper-middle and lower-middle, upper-middle and lower, and lower-middle and lower social classes were measured. The effect of educational home background (high-school diploma or partial college) on the difference in social distance  attitudes was also considered. The results indicate that teachers from the upper-middle social class tend to have a significantly greater social distance attitude toward minority and national groups than teachers from either lower-middle or lower social classes. The social-distance attitudes of the preservice teachers toward minority groups appear to be related functionally to the social status positions of the teachers' families as defined by educational attainment.

        "description":"Drawing from an analysis of educational innovation attempted in 200 school districts throughout the United States, this essay describes critical aspects of the implementation process. Four micro-level premises are critical to larger macro-level change policies. First, external inputs into the implementation process must be congruent with local needs, capacities, and preferences. Second, effective implementation of significant change is characterized by the process of mutual adaptation. This may include the modification of goals, technologies, behavioral change in students and teachers, and evaluation plans. Third, effective implementation depends on the receptivity of the institutional setting to change. Indifferent and unreceptive environments are most frequent and fail to  provide necessary support for change. Fourth, local school systems vary not only in their receptivity to change but also in their capacity to innovate; therefore, they can be expected to experience different implementation problems for the same class of innovations. Suggested implications for macro-level planning and implementation are briefly described. (Author/DE)",

Currently, instruction in the social sciences plays a minor role, as most social studies programs consist more of history than any other discipline. To determine the nature of their high school training in sociology and to determine whether their current university course was a duplication of what was received in high school, introductory sociology students from three Michigan universities responded to a questionnaire. The results indicate that two-thirds of the students had no sociology or related course in high school. For those few students who had a sociology course, it was usually a one-semester elective in which the content differed greatly from their introductory college sociology course.  Sociological Resources for the Social Studies, a major secondary-level sociology curriculum project sponsored by the American Sociological Association, was identified by less than one percent of the respondents. University instruction in teaching sociology at the high-school level is recommended to help solve this problem. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on defining and comparing four approaches for identifying the community's power actors. It outlines how professional change agents might use each of the four approaches to identify community power actors who are relevant for community development. The four approaches include the positional, the reputational, the decision-making, and the social participation. The positional approach assumes that the power to affect community decisions rests in the important positions of formal organizations in the community. The reputational approach identifies power actors behind-the-scenes who have a reputation for influencing decision making. The decision-making approach emphasizes the actual participation in decisions as the criterion for identifying community power actors.  The social participation theory holds that power to affect community decisions is acquired through participation and office holding in the community's voluntary associations. Since each of the approaches contains limitations and tends to identify a different type of power actor, a combination of the four approaches is recommended for professional change agents. Specific techniques for applying each of the approaches are described. (Author/DE)",

The emergence of multiple threats to human survival, rapid rate of social change, and complexity that has overtaken our society on a global scale are causing this need. It is emphasized that traditional educational practice tends to be concerned with the problems and conditions of the past, rather than with the decisions of tomorrow. Thus, in order for positive decisions to be made, the traditional pattern of education must expand in the direction of a reformed cognitive curriculum. The reformed curriculum should include the examination of key issues such as  global problems, economy, politics and government, and science and technology. This future-studies movement involves a broad spectrum of teachers from all grade levels and subject areas, and it incorporates a wide range of new curriculum materials and ideas. This means that teachers can design their own curriculum units to suit their concerns and the interests and experience of their students. (Author/ND)",

The series of twelve 15-minute color programs provides the basis for a high school course in population education. Produced under a foundation grant, the series is available from National Instructional Television, a division of the Agency for Instructional Television. The series considers a wide range of population-related issues in the United States, helping students to understand how their actions have an impact on population and how population has an impact on them as individuals. Students develop effective criteria for decision making, examine their own values about population matters, and become aware of the consequences of their actions on themselves, their family,  their society, and the world. Each unit in the instructor's guide corresponds to a specific program and includes the purpose, program content, suggested activities, teacher facts and figures, and student materials to be duplicated. Charts, graphs, and a bibliography conclude the document. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"The relationship between student attitudes and the school as a political system is analyzed in this research report. Four types of school systems are hypothesized: elite, bureaucratic, coalitional, and participant. After testing this conceptualization, student attitudes of trust, integration, confidence, and interest toward both school and society are explored. Questionnaire results from 2,546 students in 13 Midwest secondary schools provide the research data. The results indicate that most schools tended to be bureaucratic, although there was variation within this pattern. The student attitudes formed a consistent and predictable structure with general societal attitudes closely related to attitudes toward school. Depending on the particular systemic characteristic, coalitional  and participant school systems were most closely related to positive student attitudes, while elite school system patterns were most closely related to negative student attitudes. Student attitudes toward the bureaucratic school pattern fell between these two positions. Student government groups were seen by students as more important in the school decision-making process than originally hypothesized. (Author/DE)",

Although most schools have treated consumer education as a frill rather than as a true academic discipline, it is very relevant to students' lives. Consumer education embodies a large variety of distinctly different skills and critical thinking that are essential to effective functioning in our society. However, a variety of problems exist for incorporating consumer education into the curricula. Teachers lack good motivational materials and a sufficient background in consumer education. In preparing a course dealing  with consumerism, a variety of educational objectives should be considered. For example, students need to distinguish between needs and wants, learn how to manage their own finances, become aware of alternatives, and know how to get information before they purchase goods and services. In addition, consumer education should afford students opportunities to encounter the consumer situations of their daily lives in an innovative way. (Author/JR)",

The study undertook to identify the wide variety of needs, aspirations, and concerns of young women 12- to 18-years old. Nine hundred and twenty women were interviewed in both rural and urban settings, representing a wide range of racial, religious, and ethnic group and socioeconomic backgrounds. One-third of the women were adjudicated delinquent, one-third were active in youth organizations, and one-third fell into neither category. The study analyzed the girls' beliefs and feelings on life goals, marriage, children, sex, careers, relationship to adults, permissiveness, peers, drugs and alcohol, youth organizations, school, and social and political involvements. In addition, Dr.  Gisela Konopka, the author of this study, is interviewed. She outlines ways of meeting needs of young girls; for example, one way to meet their needs is to enhance their self-esteem through participation in decision making. Selected poetry and quotations from the interviewed girls are interspersed throughout the newsletter. (Author/JR)",

One-hundred and twenty male and female subjects, divided according to levels of achievement motivation, were asked to do an anagram task at which they were made to succeed or fail. Ratings of ability, effort, task difficulty, and luck, as possible causes for success or failure, indicated that those with high achievement motivation of both sexes made relatively higher ratings for ability and lower ratings for task difficulty. Females tended to employ higher ratings for luck, and females with high achievement motivation made more use of effort as a causal factor than men. High achievement motivation males had a very high estimate of  their own abilities. The male and female low achievement-motivated groups tended to be similiar, although the women tended to make more use of task difficulty in explaining failure and had somewhat higher rating of their abilities. The low achievement-motivated males saw ability as the primary determinant of outcome. (Author/DE)",

The first lesson introduces a general environmental issue and requires students to make a value decision between the rights of people and nature. In lesson two, the students examine a local environmental problem in political terms through a simulation and a field trip. Lesson three is a simulation which introduces students to the concepts of conflict, conflict solution, and decision making. Lesson four is a slide discussion of the various kinds of political power. Lesson five provides readings and questions for a  discussion on how organized, political-pressure groups work. Lesson six requires the students to formulate their own political strategy for a solution to the environmental issue.

The selection of interviewees was arranged to find those with both critical feelings of the deprivation of their traditional roles and the independence of the self-contained classroom and with enthusiasm for what others view as a major component of educational progress. Those who felt uncomfortable with the new schools (some to the point of requesting transfer to traditional schools) cited among their problems a lack of discipline, an &quot;anything goes&quot; attitude by the children, excessive noise, the difficulty of enforcing their own standards when not supported by other teachers, and dislike of practical aspects of the physical environment. Those who liked the schools cited (1) the opportunity to  cooperate as a staff, (2) the enhancement of possibilities of learning successful teaching strategies from other teachers, (3) a feeling of increased independence and freedom to experiment, and (4) the validity of having teachers focus on their special abilities rather than try to cover all things for all children. It was inferred on the basis of this interview that the open space school is not necessarily geared to every teacher's personality and abilities, but that it is a positive innovation for many. (CD)",

This goal was achieved by providing a selected number of black student teachers the opportunity to become involved in this special alternative student teaching activity. The several interdisciplinary seminars which comprised the first phase of the program were intended to provide students with a repertoire of technical, personal, and coping skills for successfully addressing teaching problems in predominantly white communities. The second phase of the program consisted of  full-time teaching in the same classrooms in which observations took place during the first phase. STEP program activities were based on throughly tested procedures drawn from the nationally recognized Cooperative Urban Teacher Education program, which prepares teachers for inner city schools.

The two most serious problems are crises in funding aggravated by dwindling enrollments and lack of continuity in leadership. Teacher education programs are often spared from being cut--some have been expanded--because they are cheap to run, but interests of budget and cost efficiency preclude innovations. In terms of leadership, individual private interest, examplified by faculty collective bargaining, often ignores larger issues. College administrator turnover is rapid, partly because the jobs are so demanding and frustrating. This too diminishes long-term cooperative planning. A swing to conservatism in American politics has influenced education. People seem ready for a return  to the 3 Rs; other aspects of traditional universities will survive as well, while the rest will rely mostly on field experiences and emphasize real skills as opposed to titles and credentials. Those seriously interested in progressive education should work together to prevent a chaotic, unplanned, and undesirable educational future. (CD)",

The role of school of education faculty is described as having an inherent conflict, in that faculty wish to help their students and are unwilling to grade them realistically and possibly limit their opportunities to get jobs.

He begins by discussing whether or not the teaching profession and teacher education are &quot;real&quot; professions. He takes the view that they are not and that the task ahead for teacher educators is to know what constitutes a &quot;real&quot; profession and to pursue it with wisdom and vigor. Next, he talks about problems in schools, and states that no effort to improve schools in America is likely to succeed until progress is made in improving the professional education of teachers. He urges that the governance of the teaching profession must be given to teacher educators and  not to the states. He believes that one way to achieve a professional status in teacher education is to increase the teacher education curriculum to include a fifth year internship. He highlights portions of the CEPT report and states that the commission is neither uncritical of nor does it defend universities and their performance in teacher education. He concludes that the teaching profession will be a &quot;real&quot; profession when society recognizes teachers as highly competent professionals, when the universities and colleges accord them status, when the profession supports and cherishes them, and when their own self-respect and self-esteem tells them that they are real at last.

        "description":"The National Advisory Council on Education Professions Development was established by law to review federal programs for the training and development of education personnel and report its findings and recommendations to the President and to Congress. In 1975, the council held four meetings. The first resulted in 15 recommendations concerning inservice teacher education, adult education, research, and other issues. Also, a draft report, &quot;Gatekeepers in Education: A Report on Institutional Licensing,&quot; was discussed and adopted for publication at this meeting. The report was written to combat consumer abuse and improve standards for institutional licensing. The second meeting adopted a report on directions for the Teacher Corps. The third meeting discussed the council's testimony  before the Senate Subcommittee on Education and the Congress' reluctance to continue the Education Professions Development Act in a time of teacher surplus. The council's position was that, while recruitment of new teachers is no longer a problem, the priority has become quality of teachers and improvement of inservice education. The last meeting of 1975 left it unclear whether the council would be continued, but the staff was to develop an issues paper presenting the council's view of the federal role in education professions development. (The text of the law establishing the council and its responsibilities is included in this report, as are numerous details on selection of officers, reports approved, educational institutions visited, and other business).

        "description":"These papers focus on (1) alternatives to and within education, (2) critical issues for the 70's and beyond, and (3) affective/humanistic education. While some papers are on very specific subjects (i.e., teaching emotionally disturbed deaf children, reading readiness tests, peer influence on students, alcohol education, visual learning in literacy, and other subjects), some major themes overlap in several papers. Foremost is a concern that education not lose the momentum of some of the reforms made in the 1960's through an overemphasis on basic skills to the exclusion of concern with the affective and humanistic side of education. Another important theme is the crucial need for educational alternatives, including nonformal education in developing countries and better educational  programs for the training of minority inner-city personnel. Several papers concern the problems of teaching reading and the fact that literacy is still not universal although it is fundamental to any other kind of learning. One paper criticizes the granting of academic credit in college for basic literacy courses. Various questions in educational research are also examined, including the problems of relating the understanding and knowledge of the researcher and the practitioner. (CD)",

        "description":"Group classes with 30-40 children per teacher favor the children who catch on fast. These children participate more in class and give more feedback to the teacher, so the teacher gears instruction to them and goes too fast for students who are having difficulty. Peer and cross-age tutoring, can supplement class learning and help the below-average student catch up. Tutors provide tutees with a greater chance for personal participation in instruction and offer reinforcement of correct responses. The tutors are likely to improve their own knowledge of the subject and their attitude toward school as well. Individualized instruction kits and materials are now available on the market and are useful for tutoring programs. Support of teachers for the tutoring program is crucial, as some  teachers feel threatened by any program which removes partial responsibility for teaching from them and unconsciously subvert tutoring program. Peer tutoring has an advantage over cross-age or adult tutoring in that it does not require interclassroom cooperation. (A discussion of how to decide if tutoring is warranted in a classroom and how to organize and supervise a tutoring program is included in this book. An annotated bibliography provides reports of effects of tutoring on tutor and tutee.) (CD)",

Units are suggested for a model course, \"Sex Role and Education.\" Suggested topics include hiring and other employment practices, children's books, the socialization process, and changing discriminatory attitudes. Specific objectives are outlined in terms of what any college course should provide and what a women's course in particular should offer. Among the suggested learning projects are journals, individual experiments, and  case studies of particular women. A number of ideas for research topics are suggested, along with possible ways of researching the topics. Suggested books are grouped under headings such as the History of the American Woman, Woman's Place, Women as a Minority Group, Sex Roles, and Counseling.

The career Opportunities Program (COP) was involved in getting colleges and universities to make several kinds of changes in their teacher education programs. One of the changes many institutions made was to establish open admissions or an admission policy in which students lacking normal prerequisites could be accepted on a probationary basis. On-site instruction was another innovation, with professors teaching courses in community schools. Many minority students and older students received bachelors degrees. Most COP students did unexpectedly well both  academically and as teachers. Through this program, some teacher aides received degrees, while others received paraprofessional degrees and a concomitant rise in status. Conservative institutions, through association with COP, tended to become a little more progressive, while institutions which were already experimenting with socially relevant programs did so even more. (Descriptions are provided in this bulletin of changes at several of the institutions which were involved with COP.) (CD)",

Generally, the attitudes of all groups were positive toward IGE. Results also indicated that school staffs which had used IGE for over three years liked it better than staffs using it for shorter periods of time. Also, the more IGE outcomes were implemented in a school, the more the staff was favorable. Attitudes of administrators, teachers, parents, and students in urban and non-urban schools were equally positive, as were attitudes from  schools with both predominantly white and non-white populations. Parents tended to feel that their children had progressed more in school using IGE. Teachers felt the program was equally useful for slow and fast learners as well as for culturally advantaged and disadvantaged students. A few administrators and teachers complained that the program carried with it the necessity to increase work loads too drastically. (Tables and sample questionnaires are included.) (CD)",

It proposed the following six major program objectives: (1) planning and implementation of start-up activities; (2) staff training in the charting of student correct and error frequencies in reading and math; (3) staff training in setting individual behavioral objectives and mastery criteria for students, and in concepts of the individualized management system; (4) training in reinforcement principles; (5) sequential ordering of behavioral objectives in the math and reading curricula; and (6) the attainment of Oakland Unified School District achievement score norms in math and  reading by 60, 80, and 100 percent of PTEL students in program years one, two, and three, respectively. The evaluation demonstrated that five out of six objectives were accomplished by the program. Curriculum planning and development of materials were initiated by the staff at the beginning of the program and continued throughout the year. The staff generally felt that the inservice training provided was effective and adequately prepared them to implement PTEL methods in the classroom. Santa Fe PTEL failed to meet the predicted objective of 60 percent of its students achieving OUSD reading averages by approximately 10 percent and math averages by approximately 14 percent. The staff's reaction to the program's operation, administration, and organization was generally positive.  (Author/BD)",

        "description":"With the conceptual model designed around the urban public and private school setting and its specific teaching strategies, this field-based teacher preparation program covers appropriate methodology in reading/language arts, social studies, and science. Students are afforded the opportunity of integrating content, theory, and practice into a totally field-based multilinguistic culturally diverse teaching/learning setting. Each semester program, comprised of approximately 40 junior interns, 30 cooperating teachers, 700 elementary pupils, and 4 university staff, is totally field-based in five urban schools. Content methods and instruction take place in one of the public school classrooms for a portion of each day; for the remainder of the day the interns work in their assigned  classrooms. Program competencies are designed to emphasize the specification, learning, and demonstration of those behaviors which are essential to effective teaching. Program research emphasizing the effects of the training site on selected teacher training variables has been consistently evaluated within a multi-dimensional scheme. The research results have provided evidence in support of the field-based teacher preparation program, evidencing that field-based preservice teachers have more positive feelings toward their teaching experience than university-based preservice teachers. In the cognitive domain, as evidenced by pupil growth, field-based interns have demonstrated an ability to positively affect pupil learning. (Author)",

STEP is a 16 week experience which seeks to effectively prepare black preservice teachers for suburban &quot;cross-over&quot; schools. It consists of two eight week segments, the first of which is devoted to the involvement of participants in interdisciplinary seminars in mental health, sociology of suburbia, and education, and employs inquiry teaching techniques and methods. The remaining eight weeks consists of actual in-class student teaching where the theories studies, field trips made, and the newer insights and understanding gained from the reality-oriented and field-based activity of the first eight weeks are implemented. Students may receive a maximum of 12 semester hours  credit for these experiences. Results of the first year's activity indicate that the program has made a significant impact on the student teachers, on the university, and the school community in which it is located. The program brings together a diverse supportive population and assists those students who seek to teach in suburbia in bridging the gulf that exists between the two cultures involved. (Author/CD)",

A common concern of many of the articles is developing positive self-concept in children; encouraging moral development; helping the child to understand and express humor, aggression, anger, and other personal feelings; and devising curricula that can spark a child's imagination. Two articles focus on the habit of teachers to shy away from teaching science, both out of unfamiliarity with the subject and a lack of ingenuity in thinking of ways to make it  accessible to young children. Experiments and projects are suggested which are both lively and educational. Another article examines children's difficulty with math and tries to focus on what kinds of operational thinking, as identified by Piaget, are required to master different mathematical problems, An article by Albert Shanker argues for strengthening the role of teacher associations in issues of educational policy. Other articles concern the role of the teacher in the open classroom, student role in a person-centered program, and competency based teacher education. (CD)",

        "description":"The Cardio-Pulmonary Research Institute conducted an exercise program for men with a history of coronary heart disease. Over 7 years, there were 15 cases of cardiac arrest during exercise (one for every 6,000 man-hours of exercise). Trained medical personnel were present in all cases, and all were resuscitated by electrical defibrillation with no permanent damage. Coronary heart disease patients are at risk of cardiac arrest during exercise, and there seems to be no way of predicting by age, type of exercise, or seeming tolerance to exercise whether or not cardiac arrest will occur. Nor are months of regular exercise a safeguard against an attack. However, exercise, even vigorous exercise, is safe if there are medical personnel present, and the physiological and psychological  benefits of exercise in the rehabilitation process for coronary heart disease patients are important.

        "description":"This booklet is an evaluation of the use of homework as it contributes to learning. The main contention of the booklet is that as often as possible homework should be in the form of independent study projects and should be interesting and enjoyable rather than boring or overly difficult. It is suggested that homework assignments which are too long or too disagreeable create a great deal of anxiety in students, particularly those most anxious to succeed. The document refers to experiments in which homework loads were reduced in school systems with no noticeable decline in accomplishment, while children and their families both seemed pleased with the change. Unpleasant homework assignments are also criticized as leading to cheating, since many students do not see the need for doing  the work themselves. It is stated that it is not in fact known whether or not homework detracts from the student's interest or vitality in the classroom. Creative assignments which genuinely challenge students and are geared to their ability levels are seen as useful when assigned in moderation. A bibliography by the ERIC Clearinghouse on Teacher Education of other literature on the subject of homework is included. (CD)",

        "description":"For a competency-based system of teacher certification to be feasible and fair, a valid and reliable set of measurement procedures must exist. There are four questions which must be answered before competency-based teacher certification can be validly implemented. The first question is, Should teacher or pupil behavior be used as evidence of teacher competence? Teacher behavior rather than pupil behavior is a more appropriate basis on which to judge teacher competence. The second question is, On what basis should specific behavioral indicators of competence be selected for observation? It is intellectually unjustifiable at this time to establish a particular set of behavior indicators of teacher competence as certification criteria. Question 3 is, Under what conditions should  teacher behavior be observed in order to assess competence? Teacher behavior must be assessed in several contexts and over time if the assessments are to be generalizable. The final question asks, what kinds of measures of teacher behavior should be used to assess competence? Observation systems need to be identified and developed which are characterized by strong reliability and validity and by enough scope to reflect the range and complexity of teacher-student interaction. The movement in the direction of competency-based teacher certification should proceed only to the extent that our knowledge and technology will adequately support it. (RC)",

        "description":"The book presents information on the use of oral history as a classroom device. The first chapter discusses the evolution of oral history from a practice intended to preserve information on noted Americans to a way of preserving recollections of older Americans about the past. The second chapter explains why interviewing members of their own communities can make children more interested in the subjects they study. The \"Foxfire Book,\" a popular anthology on Appalachia, originating from a social studies class, is used as an example of stimulating, innovative project. The third chapter offers suggestions on preparing the student as an interviewer, such as how to be a good listener, ask good questions, and put the interviewee at ease. Methods of using tapes are compared in chapter 4.  It is recommended that segments of the tape be indexed rather than transcribing all the tapes, which is time-consuming and costly. Chapter 5 discusses the development of an oral history project and provides examples, including a sample release form, which gives a project the subject's permission to use the interview, and a sample interview. The author states that the establishment of an oral history association, the increasing use of oral history in schools and colleges, and the enthusiasm usually associated with its use indicate that oral history is likely to be a major adjunct to classroom instruction in the 1970's.

Twenty-one teachers were asked to evaluate 125 teacher training products divided into various sets by objectives and complexity of training mode and skills required. There was fairly strong agreement on what products were good, with preference going to those that involved microteaching or other clinical practice, varied activities, and complex skills and training. These products tended to be more expensive and to have produced at research and development centers. The methodology used to determine teacher attitudes toward teacher training products is considered an acceptable model for future research, and the authors hope research will be done to determine  acceptability of the products after use by teachers.

We are typically confused on the subject of man's nature; we have arbitrarily and unwisely relegated it to the subdisciplinary area of metaphysics where the topic rests in some disarray because of the plethora of theories that currently prevails. These confusing and overlapping concepts of man's nature confound many of our presentations and discussions. We have a definite responsibility to our students to help them form their own, highly personal positions as to man's basic nature. The need for more effective communication within the area of sport and physical activity philosophy is self-evident. Because of the varied  methodological approaches we employ, we are seemingly not communicating too well with each other, and our voices are not having a significant influence on those involved with sport in the culture. Members of the Philosophic Society for the Study of Sport have a contribution of vital importance to make in regard to sport's cultural role. (Author/CD)",

Twenty-eight nursery teachers and 95 children from these classrooms were selected for this study. The teacher verbal behavior was measured by the Withall Social Climate Index, which produces a facilitative score and a directive score for each teacher. Child language change was determined by a pretesting and posttesting with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and with a analysis of 50 consecutive statements. Within the limitations of this study and from the findings, it can be concluded that teachers consistently used a pattern of facilitative of directive verbal behavior in their classrooms. It can also be  concluded that language for the four-year old children in this study, as measured by the instruments used, continued to change in the six month period. Finally, it can be concluded that, for children in this sample, change in use of complexity sentences was greater in those classrooms where teachers used more directive verbal behavior. In the other asPects of language change studied, the verbal behavior as measured by the Climate Index. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"To what degree testing can become adaptive is considered in three ways: from a formal methodological perspective; from a human process, stability, perspective; and from a sub-system or component view within an adaptive instructional system (AIS). With the advent of large computer-based training systems, the opportunity to broadly implement adaptive testing models and contrast them in terms of their adaptive nature has come to its moment of truth. It, therefore, seems appropriate to describe various computer paradigms which are representative of one or more models. This completes the first third of this paper. Testing has long been considered adaptive if the situation is made easier or more relaxing for the student. As this paper illuminates, it is perhaps more important to  increase the challenging aspects of the test adaptation, even to stressing characteristics in order to improve both reliability and validity. Adaptive testing can be considered within the context of a total AIS framework. To what degree does it provide for time savings and for enhanced systems improvement? It is in this last area that so little experience and data are available. What little data and conjecture that can be accumulated at this time is presented to complete the overview of adaptive testing. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"This Manual has been designed to provide step-by-step guidelines for conducting an evaluation of a structured training sequence. The assessment design to be presented involves essentially: the testing of a group of trainees before and after a sequence of instruction by administration of the same set of objective-form items under structured testing conditions; and the application of a series of statistical procedures to the resultant scores and individual item responses to determine the magnitude, direction and level of Test to Retest changes in cognitive (subject matter) competence. As will be stressed repeatedly throughout the Manual, the quantitative analysis of the testing data can provide both a measure of trainee achievement and an assessment of training effectiveness, by  estimating how much of the increase in levels of subject competence displayed by the trainees at the end of the course can be attributed to the training experience.

The first questionnaire attended to the first three purposes listed above, yielding data needed for a theoretically based coordinator definition. The  second questionnaire attended to purposes four through six, thus providing a needs assessment. The most important finding of this study is the extent of agreement found between Work Experience and Diversified Cooperative Training teacher-coordinators as to the principles undergirding their job performance and the teaching competencies necessary to conduct both programs.

The program was initiated to develop a bilingual curriculum for schools with Spanish-American populations. Federal legislation, which supports the Milwaukee program, was designed to meet the special needs of children who have limited English proficiency and who come from environments where the dominant language is other than English. In order for Spanish-background children to become more broadly-educated adults, they must be afforded educational opportunities at least equal to those available to other children. Bilingual education was and is considered to be a basic and essential  framework to provide these opportunities. The total bilingual program had three main components. They were an elementary program, a secondary school program, and inservice training for staff. This report describes each of these programs along with the specific objectives and the findings on which the evaluation was based. (Author/DEP)",

If the time permitted is much too short, scores may bunch up at the low end of the potential score range, with a loss of potential variance and a general diminishing of the utility of the variance which is observed. If the time permitted is an intermediate value, the scores tend to become some mixture of power and speed. This paper proposes a simple technique for estimating the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of finishing times for a population of test takers.

Part of the problem may be in the balance of granularity of analyses on the intelligence side and the personality side. A comprehensive analysis of the contributions of extraversion and neuroticism to problem solving latency, accuracy, and persistence in stressed and unstressed conditions was undertaken. Two directional predictions were made based on previous research: (1) Solution-time will be shorter in extraverts than ambiverts or introverts, and shorter in ambiverts than introverts, in both stressed and unstressed conditions. (2) Neuroticism will be related to solution-time such that in the stressed condition, mid-neuroticism subjects  will be faster than either high- or low-neuroticism subjects who will not be different from each other, and in the unstressed condition high-neuroticism subjects will be faster than mid-neuroticism and low-neuroticism subjects, and mid-neuroticism subjects will be faster than low-neuroticism subjects. Subjects were university students in undergraduate and graduate educational psychology classes. The personality dimensions of extraversion-introversion and neuroticism were measured by Form A of the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). The dependent variables of problem-solving latency, accuracy, and persistence were measured by the Nufferno Tests. Results are discussed in relationship to previous studies. (Author/BJG)",

The work included development and application of a method of analyzing operator performance tasks for purposes of identifying candidate measures. This resulted in sectoring of each T-37B maneuver into functional segments, wherein the dominant measurement variables are consistent, and task segments, wherein the relationships among the dominant measurement variables are consistent. Several types of measures were then defined which, collectively, satisfy measurement needs over all task segments. Specific candidate measurement formulae were developed for each segment in accordance with the analysis  results. Computer programs (FORTRAN IV) were developed and implemented to: (1) smooth, printout, and plot data recorded on-board a T-37B aircraft; (2) automatically detect task segment boundaries; (3) compute criterion functions from skilled performer's data; (4) compute measures specified at run-time by the user; and (5) perform and print results of several empirical validation tests of the candidate measures for subsequent researcher analysis.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to specify the design for evaluating the second year Health Start Program. This design is used as the basis for the determination of the data to be collected and the comparisons that will be made using these data to provide information to answer the policy questions asked by the Office of Child Development (OCD). For OCD, the basic purpose of the evaluation is to identify successful procedures, strategies, and methods of operation that could be transfered and applied to Head Start or other types of local health service delivery programs. In addition, rapid feedback was to be provided about: (a) whether local projects are complying with program guidelines and grant conditions; (b) the managerial efficiency of projects; and (c) the need for technical  assistance either in management or substantive areas. This form of feedback is called project management in this paper, distinguishing it from the evaluation of the program which is the main purpose of this effort. For this analysis, two kinds of comparisons are made: (1) comparisons between particular procedures and strategies within the Health Start program; and (2) comparisons between Health Start and the health component of a sample of Head Start programs. Appendices contain the data collection instruments. (RC)",

Thomas' ideas concerning the definition of the situation. Observer bias is an instance when a definition of a situation is based primarily on subjective situational factors. Reliance on subjective situational factors is dependent on the degree of ambiguity of the situation's objective factors. Students were given false information concerning the Socioeconomic Status (SES) of the children in the videotape (manipulation of subjective situational factors). Also, the degree of ambiguity of the videotape (manipulation of ambiguity of objective situational factors) was varied. The students were asked to record all  aggressive behavior exhibited by the children. The information about the children's SES did affect the students' observations. The degree of ambiguity of the videotape failed to produce the hypothesized effects. (Author/BJG)",

Formative and summative evaluation require two distinct types of instruments which yield different types of information. The problem that remains in the development of formative rating devices is a definition and enumeration of the domain of teaching behaviors. A solution to this problem possibly would be different for various subject areas and teaching styles. Careful sampling of this domain may require a set of rating devices which are hierachically arranged. Current rating instruments represent a step toward the development of broad-band devices, which could be used at the  highest level of the hierarchy to identify problem areas, and may also be useful for summative evaluation purposes. Evaluation instruments yield information that is reliable and logically expected to be related to quality of teaching performance. What is lacking is evidence relating ratings to important educational outcomes. (Author/RC)",

The two stradaptive tests differed in that one counted question mark responses (i.e., omitted items) as incorrect and the other ignored items responded to with question marks. Stradaptive test scores were more consistent with the hypothesized nature of the population distribution of verbal ability. When corrected for differing levels of item discrimination and memory effects, the test-retest stabilities of the two testing strategies were about equal. Scores on one form of the stradaptive test were found to be very stable for testees who had highly consistent response records on initial testing. Stability of \"subject  characteristic curve\" data was high, suggesting the usefulness of these data for describing test-testee interactions. Of the 10 stradaptive ability scores studied, which grouped into four clusters, average difficulty scores had the highest stabilities. Analysis of difficulties of items associated with correct, incorrect, and question mark responses suggested that items with question mark responses should not be ignored, but should be treated as incorrect responses in branching decisions. Suggestions for future research on the stradaptive testing model are made. (Author)",

Evaluation personnel can contribute both to the final development of a program and to the fair evaluation of such programs by learning to formally characterize programs and to construct causal models of them. The evaluation effort represents an attempt to determine the correctness of the program's existing conceptualization, and if properly carried out, permits the developer/sponsor to strengthen, add, or delete components which are found to be nonfunctional. In this paper, the authors discuss the concept of causal model building and illustrate their ideas with an example of how causal model construciton procedures were  used to assist in the evaluation of a complex early childhood program.

The model presents a tailored testing strategy based on Binet IQ measurement theory and Lord's (1972) modern test theory. Nationally normed School and College Ability Test Verbal analogy items (SCAT-V) were used to construct an item pool. Item difficulty and discrimination indices were rescaled to normal ogive parameters on 249 items. Freshmen volunteers at Florida State University were randomly assigned to stradaptive or conventional test groups. Both groups were tested via cathode-ray-tube (CRT) terminals coupled to a Control Data Corporation 6500 computer. The conventional subjects took a SCAT-V test, while the stradaptive  group took individually tailored tests drawn from the same item pool. Results showed significantly higher reliability for the stradaptive group, and equivalent validity indices between stradaptive and conventional groups. Three stradaptive testing strategies averaged 19.2, 26.5, and 31.5 items per subject as compared with 48.4 items per conventional subject. A 50% reduction from conventional test length produced an equal precision of measurement for stradaptive subjects. Item latency comparisons showed the stradaptive group required significantly longer per item than conventional group members. It is recommended that time rather then number of items be used in future adaptive research as a dependent variable. (Author/DEP)",

In addition to the type of mnemonic training, list imagery was either high (rated 6-7) or medium (rated 4-5), and instructions were either progressive elaboration (e.g., make a single image for each list position across the three lists), imagery, or verbal mediation. The verbal mediation instructions resulted in equal performance on both high and medium lists. The two imagery instructions resulted in higher recall than the verbal on high imagery lists and lower recall than the verbal on medium imagery lists. An absence of serial position effect was found for the two imagery instructed groups receiving  high imagery lists. All other conditions showed a strong serial position effect. The comparison of the two mnemonic systems showed the peg method gave slightly higher recall on the high imagery lists, and the loci method gave slightly higher recall on medium lists. The results were discussed in terms of the subject's attempt to create an image for the medium imagery items interfering with finding an effective mediator. (Author)",

Another experiment demonstrated that subjects report category more accurately than identity when stimulus duration is 2 seconds, although there is no difference at .2 seconds. At the longer duration, superiority of category reports was correlated with subjective reports of processing strategy, suggesting that rapid categorization occurs when subjects encode and store information by category immediately after VIS readout.

In the second task, a reliability study was conducted in order to be certain that consistency among several indexers can be taught and achieved in their interpretation and application of the rational condensation short-cut method. A third task was  undertaken in order to shed some light on whether it is reasonable to assume that although there may be slight differences between two indexers in how they apply a particular indexing procedure, a more important consideration is that they consistently use their own individualized interpretation of the indexing rules and conventions. In the fourth task, a careful comparison of the indexing, coding, keypunching, and subsequent computer processing time required to apply the rational condensation short-cut indexing procedure and the original lengthy indexing procedure to a small subsample of a data base was made.

        "description":"Tests of intelligence and structured measures of emotional status, aptitudes, and achievement alone do not suffice in predicting the vocational adjustment of the mentally retarded. Since the main concern is the evaluation of the many aspects of behavior which make the individual a unique and changing person, a format was developed which included a particular battery of psychological tests which assessed intellectual capacity and functioning, personality characteristics, academic achievement, aptitudes, and preferences. Tests were selected for their usability and appropriateness with the mentally retarded. The importance of the format is that it included the author's interpretations and insights based on the examinee's responses and reactions to the testing program. The test  findings were critiqued, and the clinical interpretations were presented. Some conclusions and recommendations were: the focus of the assessment should be on the identification of areas of strength rather than on weakness; social competence is one of the most important determinants for vocational functioning; it is more appropriate to make an assumption of positive adaptation on a meaningful criteria of employability and social integration until negative evidence appears, rather than to assume a poor prognosis until positive evidence appears; and finally that predictive measures should be more as estimates of preparation for the next step in training or placement than as determiners of the future.

        "author":["Nicolich, Mark J."],
        "description":"Several statistical techniques that can be used to ameliorate the difficulties inherent in the data analysis of longitudinal studies are presented. The first step in longitudinal data analysis is graphing. This permits visual inspection of the data, and with educated viewing can yield insights into the nature of the underlying mechanisms. The next level of sophistication is to apply regression analysis and change point analysis to the curves obtained from the graphical analysis. It is usually the case in longitudinal studies that the exact form of the curve is not known prior to the experimentation. The graphing of the data is useful in suggesting different mathematical models to apply to the curves. The results of the regression analysis will help determine the uniformity of the  process across subjects. The next step is to use the form of the fitted equation to determine significant points on the curve. The shape of the curve will suggest change points in the subjects' behavior with respect to the dependent variable. In certain cases where problems arise, the use of principal components is called for. Practical advantages are that they explain the original curve best and will likely point to any existing major differences, and they occur mathematically and do not depend on the experimenter's ability to form a regression curve or pick important change points. When used in conjunction with each other, these techniques form a powerful package for analyzing longitudinal data. (RC)",

The PLATO staff was composed of volunteers because of the perceived importance of teacher commitment to the program. This method of selection caused several problems. The orientation of PLATO staff varied with implementer's views of proper teacher contribution to the program. Judgments on the effectiveness of teacher orientation and the relationship between that process and the eventual  development of the innovation were inconclusive. In Part 2, the theoretical components of the degree of PLATO implementation and classroom observation were discussed. An effort was made to sketch the evolution of one of the observation instruments being employed to observe the effects of PLATO on the life of elementary classrooms, the conditions and hypotheses under which it has been developed and used, and one illustrative result concerning implementation.

The item type in question is a variety of the multiple true-false item, widely used in state and municipal civil service examinations. Items are produced, not by combining pairs of independent true-false items, but as a means of salvaging not quite adequate four-choice multiple items. The original items may have no right answer: two, three, or four right answers; or one or two ambiguous or nonplausible responses. Items of this type were developed for use in a national testing program for automotive mechanics. After review by a number of test specialists and mechanics, it was decided that many items were faulty. A format variation was developed which seemed to be more clear cut, informal, and  easier to read and understand. The revised items were used in a test battery. In practical terms, the overall effect of changing item format was to make the test items easier by an amount that would make mean percent correct scores higher by less than one percent. The real effect was to eliminate protests about the test questions. (RC)",

The Follow Through Program in Philadelphia is comprised of seven educational models: Bank Street, Behavior Analysis, Bilingual, Florida Parent Educator, Parent Implemented, Philadelphia Process and EDC (Educational Development Center). In terms of achievement based on cross sectional analysis, Total Follow Through (TFT) exceeds the Total Non-Follow Through (TNF) group in almost all test areas in kindergarten; in Total Reading, and Total Mathematics in first grade; and in Total Mathematics in  third grade. The Behavior Analysis (Grades K-3) Model and Parent Implemented (Grades 1-3) Model (with only one exception on one criterion in the latter case) perform better than the TNF group at all grade levels. Comparisons between Spring 1973, and Spring, 1974 test data, although only tentative at best, indicate that overall, with the exception of kindergarten, the 1974 results show higher percentile ranks than do the 1973 results on comparable test areas.

        "description":"In the spring of 1975, three alternative secondary schools in the Federation of Alternative Schools, with the help of the Minneapolis Public Schools' Research and Evaluation Department, surveyed their students. The 66-item questionnaire, which was developed to provide an overall assessment of student attitudes and information for program improvement, was completed by more than 75 percent of the students enrolled in the three schools. Results showed that more than 80 percent of the respondents indicated that their alternative school was relevant; 90 percent said their teachers understood them, liked them, were fair to them, and showed an interest in them; the majority were satisfied with how much they were learning and they learned more this year than previously; and the majority  felt their school helped them in cognitive and affective learning areas. Seventeen of the items were included in a 1972 survey. 1975 students responded more favorably on all items, but several interpretation cautions were noted. If positive attitudes toward school can serve as a means to school effectiveness, alternative schools appear to have some potential for effecting the attainment of other student educational outcomes.

An outline of possible techniques and methods for each of the above activities is presented, and the paper  concludes by considering the whole process in relation to the types of judgement the evaluator may be required to make. Throughout the paper a strong emphasis is placed on clarifying strategic and tactical decisions when planning curriuclum evaluations, and adequate references are provided to key works of a theoretical and statistical nature.

The corresponding regression coefficient, operating as a multiplicator, estimates the contrast effect, i.e. it measures the degree in which the stimulus is dependent of the conditions.

During the course of the four year operation the program has been organized within three components: the Education Component, the Student and Family Support Component and the Work Experience Component. Since the dropout rate for American Indian students in Minneapolis schools is especially high, many of the students  selected for the program are American Indians. Although improvements are evident in the three program components, the program has not shown a significant effect on the dropout pattern. Lack of attendance and tardiness still seemed to be a large factor with most students in the program regarding work programs and school attendance. (Author/DEP)",

Learner achievement of instructional objectives was accepted as the basic indicator of equality of educational opportunity. The district goals of self concept and basic skills--the latter restricted to math, science, and reading--were selected as the areas in which learner achievement would be examined. Data describing teachers' preparation, teacher instructional preferences, and amoun't of time spent on the subject was collected, and a cost analysis per student by school for 1974-75 was done simultaneously. This hypothesis was tested: &quot;There  will be no significant differences with references to learners' perceptions of self concept and to learner achievement in mathematics, science, and reading (at specified grade levels) across Rhinelander Elementary Schools.&quot; The data essentially supports the position that equality of educational opportunity does exist in grades K-6 in Rhinelander schools. A model to assist in the evaluation of elementary school programs was developed and is appended. Additional values of the study included an increased awareness of objectives related to instructor goals and a reexamination of curricular and instructional objectives. In addition, the study developed an increased awareness of a need for continual cost analysis and an increased understanding of evaluation procedures. (RC)",

It is expected to facilitate international compilation and comparison of education statistics as such, and also their use in conjunction with manpower and other economic statistics. The classification, which is essentially a dictionary of educational programs is designed for assembling data on current educational phenomena such as enrollment, teaching staff and finances as well as for statistics of the stock of educated people as obtained, for example, by a census of population. In this sense it is a multi-purpose system within which comparable data can be  assembled on various features of educational systems and processes. The aims of this handbook are two fold. The first is to ensure a common interpretation of ISCED between and within countries. The second is to assist countries, states, provinces, etc., to relate their system of education to ISCED. The latter purpose is very important since in many countries there exist problems in deciding the level of education of certain courses. (Author/DEP)",

A triangulation approach was pursued in the instrumentation concept. That is, three evaluation instruments were developed. These were: (1) a questionnaire to be sent to the students after they had returned to their homes following completion of the course; (2) a participant observer manual in which prestructured forms were designed for making observations relative to topic sequencing, teaching techniques, content, instructors' knowledge of the subject, instructors' transfer ability, visual aids, physical facilities, and  morale; and (3) a subject matter test to be used for determining student growth in number of correct responses. Eleven course variables were analyzed in light of questionnaire and participant observer data. Findings were presented for each of the variables. Another analysis related to growth in learning in terms of change in score in the pretest and post-test and the extent the students consider the learning to be valuable in helping them to do a better job and enhance their advancement. Recommendations were made. (RC)",

Following the introduction there is a brief critique of standardized, norm-referenced tests of student performance in reading. It is argued that school districts need tests that are sensitive to instructional treatments rather than more global measures of reading ability. In the section, New Measures of Student Achievement, comprehension is defined and then a multiple-choice cloze testing system is presented. In the next section of the paper the measurement of program resources is discussed. The measurement of resources utilization in units of time is offered as the most accurate, useful assessment of program resources. Finally, the work on the measurement of student  achievement and program resources and methodology in productivity analyses is summarized, and a statewide survey of productivity in reading programs is proposed. The Technical Appendix provides a detailed summary of procedures, results, and survey instruments. It is written for the research specialist interested in the Main Report's conclusions. It is designed to clarify procedures and results and to present studies which will help reduce disagreement over some of the research approaches employed. (RC)",

There were six major goals for the project for 1974-75. These dealt with student participation in the educational activities of the project, students' attitudes toward school and teachers, reading, computation, work experiences, and improvement in the ability of the staff to prepare goals and objectives. A variety of activities including courses, field trips, and independent study projects were used to help the students reach the objectives. The staff were assisted by pre-service and in-service training sessions. The evaluation  involved pre and posttesting in reading staff and employees, a review of the attendance records and credits earned by students, saff and employees, a review of the attendance records and credits earned by students, and a summary evaluation of each student by the project staff. The general conclusion is that the project as a whole continues to be successful. Objectives concerning attendance, credits earned, and student attitudes were not successfully accomplished in 1974-75, however, and it was impossible to determine the success of the mathematics program.

Since its purpose is to observe a maturation process, the CDI was administered to the two last grades of grade school and the first two grades of high school, where the students have from seven to ten years of schooling. A test of difference of means was carried out. The differences were statistically significant between the last grade of grade school and the first grade of high school in all scales of CDI. In a breakdown by sex, the results were not very different from the total grade results. These differences must be interpreted with caution because the scores were obtained not only from different grades but also across  different school systems. Only the grade school is compulsory in Brazil, so a natural selection can happen. These results did not allow the author to reach a firm conclusion about the use of CDI for Brazilian students. Some suggestions on the format of CDI's scale and on the experience provided by the schools was made. Norms provisionally established are included in the appendix. (Author)",

Objectives for the program were given in terms of gains measured by teacher judgement and achievement tests. Results in terms of test data, will be reported at a later time. Results, based solely on needs assessment data, showed that the program failed to meet those objectives which were based on teacher ratings. The percentage of Title I eligible students who had been rated poor or serious in reading and/or math in fall 1974 and were rated one level higher in spring 1975 were from 7 percent to 31 percent below the percentage stated in the objectives. Discussion of the teacher judgment discrepancies suggest that there was no  empirical basis for the expected percentages of students given in the objectives who would be rated one level higher in the spring. Descriptions of projects that were active in 1974-75 are included along with a history of the development of the oveall Title I program in Minneapolis.

Among the questions dealt with are: why white teachers teach in black schools in the inner city; whether white teachers are willing to accept black leadership (i.e., the black principal); whether a majority white faculty should be assigned to a majority black school; whether racism is widespread among the majority white faculty; whether the white teacher is afraid to discipline the black student, even when the need to do so is obvious; and the extent to which white teachers can interpret the black subculture. Five papers are included, addressing issues such as the white teachers in the all-black school, some comments on the Lincoln project and problems encountered by white  teachers in black schools and instruction, learning, and the problems encountered by white teachers in black schools. One paper by public school educators addresses the issue of white teachers in black schools. Firm conclusions concerning all white teachers in black schools in the inner city are held not to be possible from composite interviews. Impressions and concerns identified are: that white teachers and black students come from and live in different worlds; that there is a lack of communication between many white teachers and black teachers in black schools; and, that parents are more concerned with the quality of their children's education than the teacher's skin color.

The role of the supervising teacher, the relationship with tutors, and relationship with tutees and their teachers are also examined. The lengthiest section of the report deals with the tutors and tutees themselves,  focusing on them as they relate to each other in actual situations, through the use of field notes and extensive interviews. Remaining sections describe what happened to the program when its supervisor left and was replaced by a new teacher.

Criterion one concentrates on whether or not Third World people are present in illustrations, films, and filmstrips and whether Third World people are portrayed as person with dignity, in leadership roles, and possessing the more distinctive physical traits of their respective ethnic groups. Criterion two evaluates instructional material relative to how well it conveys that this society was and is culturally plural. The third criterion  assesses the extent to which the instructional material reflects the contributions that Third World people have made to this society. Directions for scoring the criteria are provided, along with a series of 17 definitions of terms used in the document. When employed effectively in evaluating instructional material, this instrument is said to generate data which will reflect the blatant presence of ethnic bias and dramatize the critical need for the school curriculum to reflect the dignity and value of all people in the society.

        "description":"The first part of this presentation lists four basic assumptions pertaining to educating black students humanistically and discusses each in relation to its impact on the public schools' capability to educate blacks effectively and meaningfully. These assumptions are: that black students can be educated by the public schools, that schools are capable of relating humanistically to black students, that universities and colleges are capable of equipping teachers, counselors and related staff with the necessary cognitive and affective skills to educate black students humanistically, and that those holding the power of the various institutions of our society will allow anyone to humanize education for all students. This first part includes that schools as they are presently consituted  can neither educate blacks effectively nor relate to them humanistically. The second part discusses some of the possible alternatives that have been used or might be used to maximise the humanistic quality of the schools' program for black students, i.e., an all black student boycott, black control of black schools, and black educators organized for change. It is emphasized that blacks and Third World people, especially, rise above rhetoric and apathy and move deliberately to establish all conditions in the educational institutions that are respective of and responsive to all learners and trainers.

        "description":"Two influences that are held to produce a lack of academic motivation in mixed minority group children are identified. (1) Minority students frequently come from families that, for a variety of reasons, do not encourage academic excellence; (2) the New Rochelle school program does not compensate for this lack by offering replacement encouragement to uplift the students' self-concept and offset the debilitating effects of a motivation-less out-of-school environment. This practicum is stated to have been designed to modify these influences. It addresses itself to the development and implementation of a three-year family involvement program that would enable parents and students to make future choices based on more adequate information and decision-making skills and provide a  framework in which parents would learn improved strategies for increased interaction between the child and parents related to educational choice, thereby promoting and broadening the aspirational level of black and Italian junior high school students toward future career choices. One of the significant outcomes of this project is stated to be that it was possible to enable students to achieve self-discovery while giving them a start towards self-direction. This practicum is now a full program at a junior high school. (Author/AM)",

In its project, the Advisory Committee examined employment practices and affirmative action efforts to recruit, hire, and promote minorities and women in State government and in the cities of Providence, East Providence, and Newport. Approximately 40 State and local officals were interviewed by Advisory Committee members and Commission staff. Data from Federal reports and other publications were collected and analyzed. These investigations culminated in open, public meetings held November 14-16, 1973, in the State House in Providence. Sixty-two persons,  including Federal, State, and local officials and representatives of unions, community, civic, minority, and women's groups testified. At the meetings, the entire employment systems of the four governments were examined. This report summarizes the Advisory Committee's general findings and recommendations. It includes a summary of the Federal and State mandate for equal employment opportunity, a section on each government under review, and a summary of some alternative reforms for civil service systems.

The first three chapters provide general background information on the suburbs, the black minority in the city of Boston, and suburban development in the Boston area. The remainder of the report consists primarily of data  presented at hearings held in the city of Boston and in two groups of suburbs in 1970. Testimony at the hearings in Boston, Needham, and Marlborough, June 1-4, 1970, was provided by public officials of the local communities, organizations, private citizens, representatives of the State government, and professionals in fields related to metropolitan growth. The final sections of the report describe some of the relationships between State and Federal agencies and suburban development, and offer recommendations for change. (Author/JM)",

Two major relationships are analyzed: that between wife and husband, and that between parents and children. The data for this analysis were gathered through interviewing 40 Korean families living in the Atlanta area. A separate interview with wife and husband was carried out, and the families were chosen according to occupational categories. Findings indicate that shifting of the family structure from an independent type to a joint type system seems to create role conflicts between the Korean wife and Korean  husband. In the joint type, wife and husband are involved together in socio-economic activities. Furthermore, living in two cultural worlds creates a state of anomie where wife and husband do not have clear-cut expectations of each other. Communication problems in English, inability to drive by wives, differences in socio-ecological systems, degrees of acculturation by both wife and husband, stress caused by living in a foreign culture, and limited social interaction seemed to be sources of conflict for Korean families in the U.S. (Author/JM)",

The results of several profiling techniques which were conducted on the Welfare Sample are disucssed. While the family and child behaivor profiles have already been constructed on the Cross-sectional sample, most of the single-parent families in that sample (22 percent in total) fell into one family type. However, since the welfare sample families were predominantly single-parent in composition (74 percent), family profiling in this sample offered an opportunity to investigate types of low income single-parent families. Five welfare family types were  derived. In arriving at the family typology, a program (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis) was adopted, which finds the profile of Family X over the various dimensions in constructing the profile and the score profiles of each of the other families in the sample. So that types of families could be characterized as completely as possible, social (demographic), parental personality and marital attributes, and child-rearing practices were included as dimensions. Additionally, seven Welfare child personality types were developed from a range of child behavior items. (Author/JM)",

It also examines the extent to which violent antisocial behavior presents a distinct entity with its unique etiological processes. Several major studies which purportedly attempted to identify the causes and explain the development of antisocial behavior and/or its expression in criminal behavior were seen to be methodologically limited. This study is considered to overcome these difficulties in several ways. It is based on a random sample drawn from the community and representing a cross section of the population. Information was collected in a survey interview from all mothers. As indicated by a later search of records, with the exception  of a small minority (two percent of the cases), this interview preceded the child's labeling as a 'delinquent'. This information includes both parental and child behavior. A follow-up interview provides a source of information on changes which took place and hence an opportunity to differentiate the outcome and correlates of antisocial behavior from its antecedents. Finally, antisocial and violent behavior were measured both on the basis of cumulative agency records and as reported by the mother at the time of the second interview. (Author/JM)",

In an effort to address these issues, this study focuses on the overall level and types of disturbed behaviors shown by children who differ with respect to the life events which intervened between the original and follow-up interviews with their mothers in the course of a longitudinal study. Given this and the array of sociodemographic and familial variables on which the children have also been assessed and which permit examination and  control for various competing hypotheses, the etiologic role of life events for psychological disorders is deemed to be determinable. The life events studied are limited to those outside of the child's and adolescents' control and/or independent of his psychiatric condition to prevent contamination between the two sets of variables. The stressfulness of life events are examined both in terms of change and undesirability-desirability. Groups clearly differentiated as to type and number of events are studied to ascertain the risks attached to exposure to different event types. (Author/JM)",

Implementation of the program is examined in terms of three parts corresponding to the goals.  Each part describes the process of implementing the results and possible uses of data. Valuable experience and information is held to have been gained from the process of implementation itself and also new insights into the uses of the process. It is shown that the process of implementation encourages participation within the school/community, and that it creates a momentum which can be channeled into followup activities such as a management plan to develop more efficient utilization of resources.

Suggestions for innovations are at the level of organizational modifications for community mental health centers. The second chapter deals specifically with the instrumentation of personality assessment and the interpretation of its results. Suggestions for different ways of  interpreting results when dealing with the target populations are made. Some directions for the development of more relevant tests are also suggested.

A brief summary of the data and the political-anthropological concepts used to analyze the data, conclusions and recommendations based on those data, and their analysis are presented. The analysis is seen to recommend changing the political structure of education governance in New York City toward a more arena-type council. One structure for accomplishing this would be to submerge education totally in the city government. Since total submergence of education into urban city government is held to be politically and culturally impractical, a second method is suggested that accomplishes the same goal by developing a structure  that places education parallel with, and in some elements fused with other urban government structure. Based on data collected by three separate boards from 1967 to 1970, it is concluded that the structure of the New York City educational governance system is not only elite but incapable of producing policy in response to the multifaceted demands of the pluralistic culture of the city. A design for restructuring the governance system is proposed. This paper is said to demonstrate that political anthropological concepts can be fruitfully employed in understanding this important area of American politics. (Author/AM)",

Some of the processes which facilitate resegregation are considered to be white flight, the disproportionate use of suspensions and expulsions against minority students, tracking, grouping on a racial basis, the use of test scores, and the  mechanism of pushing out minority students and educators from the school system. Key researchable questions in the areas of white flight, suspensions and expulsions, and testing, tracking, and ability grouping are noted. (Author/AM)",
