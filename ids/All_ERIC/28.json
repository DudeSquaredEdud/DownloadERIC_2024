        "author":["Gfroerer, Joseph"],
        "description":"This report contains national estimates of Americans' perceptions of the availability of various illicit drugs and of the risk of harm associated with their drug use. These 1992 estimates are part of an ongoing national survey. The report analyzes three basic perceptions concerning drugs: (1) the relationship between perceptions and use; (2) availability; and (3) risk of harm. On the first perception, results show that drug use correlated with attitudes and beliefs about drugs. Among those who reported that marijuana was easy to get, the rate of current marijuana use was 6.6 percent, compared to a usage rate of only 1.4 percent among those who reported that marijuana was not easy to obtain. For the second perception, 59 percent reported that marijuana was easily procured, with 40  percent claiming that cocaine or crack was readily obtained. Changes in perceived availability from 1991 to 1992 were small and there were decreases in the percent reporting the ready availability of marijuana and cocaine or crack. For the perceived risk of harm, 45 percent believed that occasional marijuana use was associated with great risk of harm, while 68 percent claimed that trying cocaine once or twice could lead to great risk or harm. Perceptions were also recorded on other drugs and on tobacco use. Survey results are presented in 12 tables. (RJM)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the integration of educational and mental health services for children and adolescents within a psychiatric day treatment setting at the Bradley School housed in a private psychiatric hospital affiliated with Brown University in Rhode Island. A full range of mental health services are used, and therapies are delivered in the classroom setting by treatment teams composed of psychologists, social workers, and clinicians in training. Psychiatric and medical consultation and treatment are provided on site. Other services include speech/language, occupational, and physical therapies. This program has evolved over two years from one in which the classroom was the adjunct to the treatment program to one in which the classroom is the primary agent of treatment. A  6-week inservice program focusing on the principles of operant conditioning and positive reinforcement was implemented. A study was designed to evaluate the use of behavior management strategies in the classroom, and positive results were found in the decrease in restraints and crisis incidents. As the revised treatment module began to work, community special education programs began to send students for short term diagnostic placements, and a plan is in development for \"transition classrooms\" intended for children who no longer need intensive treatment but are not yet ready to return to the community.

        "description":"Sixty-eight teachers and 62 school psychologists from California and Tennessee were compared on attributions of behavioral and characterological blame to individuals involved in a hypothetical case of father-daughter incest. A child-victim responded in an encouraging, passive, or resistant manner to her father's sexual advances, and Attitudes toward Women Scale (AWS) scores were assessed for prediction of blame. Respondents' confidence that child sexual maltreatment (CSM) occurred in the hypothetical case, their beliefs regarding its likelihood, and their probability of reporting it were assessed along with demographic characteristics, and training, education and involvement in CSM. Teachers and psychologists assigned the majority of both types of blame to the father; however,  both groups also blamed the child. Professional position nor victim response affected blame attributed to the child, despite psychologists reporting higher estimates of likelihood, reporting, education, training, and CSM involvement. Traditional women blamed the victim and mother more, and likelihood and confidence predicted AWS scores. The majority of participants would report the case; however, Californians and psychologists reported higher probabilities of reporting, while Tennessee teachers reported lower probabilities of reporting.

        "author":["Tentoni, Stuart C."],
        "description":"This paper reviews the literature on the developmental stages of trainees and supervisors and how experience changes each of these groups. The assumption that trainees and supervisors learn and improve as they gain in experience does not explain how psychology trainees and supervisors change. The nature of this change leads to a number of questions: (1) Should the supervisory process be proactive or reactive? (2) Should the trainee learn the theoretical orientation of the supervisor or should the supervisor adapt to the trainee's theoretical orientation? and (3) Should supervision models be based upon counseling theories? While much of the research on trainee changes implies a stage theory of trainee development, there has been little systematic research on supervisor changes.  What is known about supervisor development reveals that supervisors do not become more competent as they gain experience. Since practicums are essential in trainee development and since supervisors of trainees have to make every minute of supervision count, a co-therapy or co-intake procedure allows the supervisor to offer trainees more immediate and relevant feedback regarding intake and therapy sessions. Co-therapy also immerses trainees in the therapy process, allowing a continual focus on the student client and on the trainee's needs. (RJM)",

        "description":"In this introductory essay to the Carnegie Corporation's 1993 report, David A. Hamburg urges nations, during this time of increased ethnic violence, to cooperate in developing effective international systems of nonviolent conflict resolution. Promoting genuinely free civil societies within a democratic framework will resolve the current epidemic of civil and intranational conflict. There should be mutual accommodation through nonviolent agreed secession, peaceful border revisions, and a respected, cultural pluralism. Solutions must satisfy the reasonable claims of most citizens and allow diverse groups to sort out their differences. Established democracies, the United Nations, organizations of the international community, and scientists must all work together with a sense of  urgency to address these divisive ethnic conflicts. Countries should move away from a world model based on power balances and coercion toward one that is more complex and in which mutually beneficial political and economic relations are of growing importance. The paper lists specific ways that an international approach may prevent and resolve intergroup conflict and he lists the benefits such a plan would derive. The world of the next century will differ profoundly from any that has ever been known; everyone must work to achieve decent, fair, and peaceful relations among diverse groups. (RJM)",

The discussion focuses on behavioral, cognitive, and environmental predictors of AOD behaviors. The paper highlights a refined study of the influence of peers, drug information (from school-based programs and individuals), and positive school and after-school indicators in relation to drug involvement. Investigators examined 17 drugs, including beer, wine coolers, tobacco, marijuana, and liquor. The objectives of this presentation were to: (1) increase the participants' knowledge of environmental and individual factors related to AOD use; (2) identify select peer influence variables related to  AOD behavior; (3) examine the relative significance of cognitive-perceptual factors in AOD use; (4) help school psychologists understand the implications of this study's findings for direct and indirect service delivery; and (5) chart developmental trends in AOD predictive models. Participants were expected to increase their understanding of the multi-determined nature of alcohol and other drug use among adolescents and gain a developmental perspective on AOD predictors. Included are 16 tables which give statistical predictions for AOD use and behavior. (RJM)",

        "description":"As increasingly younger children exhibit spiraling social behavior problems, researchers are focusing on the role of family dynamics in these problems. For this study, investigators explored the relationship between problem-solving skills and verbal comprehension in children from distressed families. Twenty-nine children, ages 4 to 8, completed the Preschool Interpersonal Problem Solving (PIPS) Test, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test--Revised (PPVT-R), and provided solutions to a contrived problem. Results indicate that children from homes with distressed and abusive parents, exhibit a strong, positive relationship between verbal comprehension and the ability to generate solutions to interpersonal problems. However, verbal comprehension did not affect either the quality of  children's responses or their actual behavioral choices in a real-life problem situation. It seems that verbal comprehension is related to children's ability to verbally generate solutions to interpersonal problems, but verbal comprehension does not appear to mediate the quality of their solutions. Furthermore, when challenged with a peer problem involving a desired object, older and younger children are equally likely to choose an aggressive solution. These findings suggest that intervention strategies for behavior problems in elementary-school-age children should first consider building their verbal comprehension. (RJM)",

        "description":"Cognitive-learning theories hold a unique place in history: they explore the depths of the mind from the perspective of process. This paper discusses the history of cognitive-learning theories and how they grew to shape the way one perceives, organizes, stores, and retrieves information. The paper, after providing a definition and synopsis of cognitive theory and its basic concepts, turns to the theories' philosophical foundations, beginning with Plato. The psychological foundations of the functions of the mind, and the pioneering efforts of the structuralists and Wilhelm Wundt are discussed. As psychology matured, practitioners like William James and John Dewey rejected structuralism, believing it to be too narrow to understand the mind. The mind's mechanisms then underwent  numerous, pivotal shifts in interpretation moving from the Gestalt viewpoint and its variations, like those introduced by Edward Tolman, to the role of motivation in learning as expounded by Kurt Lewin, to Frederic C. Bartlett's concept of schemata, to Jean Piaget's explications of cognitive growth and development, and finally, to the refinement of Piaget's theory by Jerome S. Bruner. The paper concludes with a brief description of the contributions made by other disciplines to cognitive understandings such as those advances made by the linguist Noam Chomsky, and the powerful impact of the computer on cognitive psychology.

        "description":"Although counseling literature addresses within-group diversity among racial/ethnic groups in this country, seldom do studies examine the interpersonal dynamics within communities where minorities have fostered interdependence, cooperation, and acceptance of diversity among themselves. This paper presents an overview of some critical factors which contribute to within-group diversity among racial/ethnic minorities and then discusses the means through which individuals facilitate and maintain peace within these communities. Some of the critical factors assessed here include external factors, such as social attitudes, and internal factors, like racial identity, world views, and the locus of responsibility. While the media highlight the social ills in some racial/ethnic communities,  group members in many more communities maintain the tradition of &quot;transcultural caring&quot; in which members work together to provide various means of support for the community. Active measures such as sports contests, pageants, and talent shows in conjunction with an emphasis on the ties that bind the community together iterate the three primary components of the transcultural caring model: (1) preservation of others; (2) accommodation of others; and (3) open exchange of ideas, opinions, and attitudes as an avenue toward increasing awareness of self and others. All of these components facilitate peaceful coexistence. (RJM)",

        "description":"While previous studies have correlated career indecision with state and trait anxiety in college students, most researchers have examined the relationship between anxiety and career indecision without considering other variables. This paper, incorporating previous research on career indecision, profiles a study of a causal model of career indecision based upon D'Zurilla's (1986) social problem-solving theory. The social problem-solving process portrays how an individual typically attends to and thinks about problems and assesses his or her problem-solving skills. For this study, researchers administered measures of trait anxiety, state anxiety, problem orientation, problem-solving skills, and career indecision to 120 students from a multiethnic, urban community college. Results  indicate that anxiety can contribute to career indecision. Trait anxiety exerted a stronger indirect effect on career indecision than a direct effect while state anxiety was found to directly influence career ambivalence. Surprisingly, problem-solving skills did not modify career indecision when the other variables in the model were statistically controlled. Conclusions suggest that problem-solving training which focuses on helping the college student develop a positive problem orientation may be more effective in reducing career indecision than actual training in problem-solving skills. Included are two tables and three figures which present statistical summaries and model conceptualizations. (RJM)",

This paper addresses these &quot;negative addictions&quot; of exercise. As early as 1970, researchers recognized the addictive qualities of exercise. Short-term studies on exercise found salutary effects on self-esteem and mood, but these studies tended not to continue long enough to detect an addictive process. However, case studies and experiments on the effects of depriving athletes of activity have documented the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. In the last decade, investigations into the psychological and addictive effects of exercise have become more common and numerous attempts to quantify the  negative addiction to exercise have been attempted. Case reports can provide illustrative data on both the compulsive nature of addicted exercisers and potential causes. Research shows that the exercise addict continues to exercise despite medical, social, and vocational counterindications. Studies reveal that individuals become depressed when prevented from exercising and some reports suggest that periods of emotional stress may provoke addictions to exercise. Likewise, heightened physical activity is viewed as a common feature of eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa. Researchers still do not understand the etiological mechanism behind addictive exercise. (RJM)",

Many such programs employ prevention programs with primary, secondary, or tertiary aspects. In primary prevention, the school district develops a climate conducive to the understanding of alcohol/drug abuse prevention and intervention. Such programs commonly provide staff training, an alcohol/drug curriculum which addresses diverse needs, assistance from school personnel, a student assistance coordinator (SAC) who works with staff, peer counseling, and other measures. In secondary prevention, intervention concentrates on the effects of alcohol or drug abuse on students. This type of prevention involves many aspects: (1) school drug policy is  the foundation for intervention; (2) administrative procedures do not need board approval; (3) the SAC takes referrals from staff members and is also consulted on drug/alcohol policy violations; (4) a &quot;Core Team&quot; of school staff discusses questionable students; (5) student counseling groups; and (6) a broad-based employee assistance program. Tertiary prevention, or treatment, is technically not provided by schools but SACs need to be familiar with treatment programs. The SAC can suggest a student be involved in treatment and may help coordinate the services provided by the treatment center and the school. (RJM)",

        "description":"Alcohol, tobacco, and drug use prevention is a goal shared by many. Prevention strategies aim to both reduce specific problems resulting from substance abuse and promote healthy development. Past efforts at prevention have included a variety of approaches: (1) prohibition; (2) scare tactics; (3) presenting factual information; (4) affective education; (5) providing alternatives; (6) interdiction; (7) social influences curricula; and (8) environmental control. Independently, none of these strategies have been demonstrated as completely effective. Current prevention theory stresses community involvement, the use of multiple strategies and ongoing activities, and seeks to integrate prevention strategies into the community. Some promising prevention programs focus on strategies to  reduce specific problems related to alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use and include such efforts as providing people with instruction in personal and social skills so as to resist pressures to use alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. Other efforts encourage the healthy development of individuals and include broad health promotion strategies. Furthermore, community prevention project grants from the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention have provided many communities with an opportunity to encourage collaboration and coalition building so as to assess local needs through multiple and integrated strategies.

        "description":"Studies show that the percentage of women in the United States who drink, has remained stable over the last several decades. However, patterns in female drinking have changed, indicating a trend toward higher rates of heavy/frequent drinking among young women. Negative attitudes toward female intoxication still prevail and a double standard persists: intoxicated women are perceived as \"worse\" than intoxicated men. Theories about why women abuse alcohol include genetic endowment, inadequate coping mechanisms, depressed affect, problems in impulse control, traumatic events and losses, and heavy drinking persons in their environment. Alcoholic women are a heterogeneous group and they exhibit some differences from male alcoholics including: (1) women more frequently report a positive  family history; (2) the process of becoming an alcoholic is of shorter duration; (3) the woman's mate is more likely to be a heavy/problem drinker than the male alcoholic's mate; (4) marital disruption is more likely; (5) the combination of alcohol and psychoactive medication is more usual; and (6) it is thought women encounter more barriers in seeking help. Financial problems, child care responsibilities, family pressures, and social stigma create some of the barriers women encounter, but once in treatment, it is believed that a woman's prognosis is similar to a man's.

        "description":"Nicotine, the most abused drug in the United States, is the psychoactive drug in tobacco. It exerts diverse, often subtle effects on the central nervous system and can stimulate or relax, or do both simultaneously. Tolerance to this drug develops easily and addiction is common among people with other drug problems, especially alcoholism. Most tobacco use begins in childhood or early adolescence and is due to a number of factors, such as peer pressure, adolescent rebellion, marketing, and easy availability. Nicotine is the most widely promoted drug in the country. Tobacco directly causes one in every six deaths in this country and can lead to heart disease, cancer, respiratory problems, and other maladies. Stopping tobacco use has both immediate and long-term health benefits for  the user and his or her family. Although many people stop smoking without formal assistance, that does not mean that quitting is easy. Many quit by relying on informal networks of support among friends and relatives, by restructuring their environment, or by drawing on lessons learned during prior unsuccessful attempts at quitting. Sometimes, all that is required to quit are a few pointers and some simple advice from a health professional. Steps that offer a reasonable chance of bringing the tobacco epidemic under control include: (1) deal with tobacco as part of the overall drug problem; (2) increase excise taxes; (3) countermarket tobacco products with pro-health messages; and (4) require indoor air spaces used by nonsmokers to be free of tobacco smoke pollution.

Although some practitioners use different diagnostic labels, MICAs present a clear constellation of behaviors, symptoms, and risk factors, and require specific treatment technologies. Mental health and chemical dependency practitioners noted a rise in the number of MICA clients during the last ten years due to a number of contributing factors, such as the exodus of persons from state hospitals to community care. In the past, treatment for these individuals was hampered  by conflicting or uncoordinated treatment programs, misdiagnosis, damaging myths about MICAs, and failure to distinguish between psychiatric disability and chemical dependency. Today, a treatment protocol for the MICA client is emerging and practitioners now agree on a number of treatment strategies: (1) both illnesses must be treated concomitantly; (2) the illness given priority is the one most florid at the time of admission; (3) the psychiatric illness must be controlled to deal with the active chemical dependency; and (4) chemical dependency must be stabilized to treat the psychiatric illness.

        "description":"Marijuana or Cannabis is a weed which grows in many different parts of the world. The plant may be altered into different forms to allow various forms of ingestion. Although marijuana's psychoactive properties have been known for almost 5,000 years, the plant first attracted public attention in the United States during the first half of this century, and then became widely known during the 1960s. Marijuana is commonly smoked, producing a euphoria which lasts approximately two hours. While the drug induces side effects such as enhanced taste, touch, hearing, and vision, it also inhibits memory; accelerates the heart beat; impairs muscular coordination, time, and space judgment; impairs driving abilities; leads to lung disease; promotes birth defects; and may impede the immune  system's function. Controversy still surrounds the social and medical consequences of marijuana use and debate continues on whether the drug leads to chromosome damage. Legal penalties for marijuana use vary widely in the states and drug testing has become commonplace. Analytical testing techniques may detect minute levels of marijuana's psychoactive ingredients in bodily fluids but these tests do not necessarily reveal whether the person is intoxicated or how recently marijuana may have been used.

These programs started when acute worker shortages during World War II, coupled with the successes of Alcoholic Anonymous, prompted some companies in the 1940s to develop programs to rehabilitate alcoholic employees. EAPs gradually expanded throughout the country--one can now find more than 10,000 EAPs--and grew to address a variety of employee problems. EAPs usually consist of four major components: (1) identification; (2) motivation; (3) referral; and (4) follow-up. The kind of EAP an organization needs depends upon the organization's philosophy, size, culture, location, and financial resources. Some of  the important variables that need to be considered when setting up an EAP include whether to have an internal or external program; whether a fellow employee or an outside contractor should administer the program and perform the counseling; the kinds of services to be offered; the formation of an advisory committee, along with a written policy to guide the program; how to make the program known to workers; record keeping and statistics; and evaluation of the process and the outcome. In many administer the programs and perform the organizations, EAPs are becoming an integral part of the organizational structure. (RJM)",

        "description":"Ethyl alcohol (ethanol) is one of the few alcohols that humans can drink. This alcohol is a byproduct of yeast's reaction with the sugars in fruit or vegetable juice and the process stops naturally with about an 11 to 14 percent alcoholic concentration, although distillation can greatly increase the alcoholic content. Once ingested, most alcohol passes into the small intestines and then into the bloodstream. The body disposes of alcohol in two ways: (1) elimination through the lungs and kidneys; and (2) oxidation. The latter process removes 90 percent of the alcohol and the liver plays a major role in this mechanism. The liver, though, can only oxidize a certain amount of alcohol every hour so individuals are advised to drink slowly. Alcohol's effect depends on a variety of  factors, including: (1) how one feels before drinking; (2) what the drinker expects alcohol to do; (3) how much one drinks; (4) how long one takes to drink; (5) the type of alcoholic beverage; (6) the size of the drinker; (7) food in the stomach; and (8) experience in using alcoholic beverages. The effects of alcohol are directly related to the concentration of alcohol in the blood. The first brain function to be impaired is usually one's ability to think and make decisions, followed by decreased motor function. In many states a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .10% is considered legal evidence that a driver is intoxicated. Some states use a BAC of 0.08% and in some European countries the legal BAC is 0.05%. (RJM)",

        "description":"Despite increases in the minimum legal drinking age, national studies show that 82 to 92 percent of college students consume alcohol, with about 20 percent considered as heavy drinkers. Students who drink may have particular needs for focused education or intervention, but all students can benefit from education regarding the full range of alcohol usage. Alcohol education on campuses should target the entire college community, including faculty and staff; many opportunities exist for educating the university community about alcohol-related risk reduction. An initial step in alcohol education is to establish a task force or committee which will assess the needs of the target population and explore areas such as funding sources, staffing, and goals. Also important is an  institutional policy on alcohol use. Once campus needs have been determined, the scope of the program can be set. The program's leadership will assume responsibility for initial and ongoing program development and quality control, and will generate and maintain the momentum of the program. Peer education is strongly recommended in leadership programs and careful recruitment and education of these peer leaders is crucial. A well-planned, comprehensive, and enduring alcohol education program holds the potential to reduce alcohol-related problems on an individual as well as an institutional basis. (RJM)",

Among static factors are: gender and sex role attitudes; and supervisor's style, age, and race. Dynamic sources include stages of the relationship and relationship dynamics such as power and intimacy. Two other sources of dynamic influence on the supervisory relationship are mentioned: (1) ambiguity, or uncertainty about supervisory  expectations and methods of evaluation; and (2) role conflict, or expectations associated with the role of student in contrast with the role of counselor and colleague.

A number of multicultural issues in supervision such as the myth of &quot;sameness&quot; is addressed. Models are described that advocate supervision as a method to assist multicultural counselor development. It is noted that several supervision techniques have been proposed to insure that the cultural dimension is addressed. These include: planned discussion of culture, exploration of supervisee and supervisor cultural backgrounds, and case management. Following these discussions of the multicultural &quot;content&quot; of supervision, the multicultural supervisory relationship is discussed as the &quot;process&quot; of supervision. Research is briefly reviewed that points  to the critical important of the initial sessions in the multicultural supervisory relationship. The digest concludes that consistent themes in the literature on multicultural supervision are: (1) the critical role of the supervisor in promoting cultural awareness; (2) identification of cultural influences on client behavior, on counselor-client interactions, and on the supervisory relationship; and (3) provision of culture sensitive support and challenge to the supervisee.

        "description":"This digest focuses on issues of parallel process in supervision. The concept of parallel process has its origin in the psychoanalytic concepts of transference, when the counselor recreates the presenting problem and emotions of the therapeutic relationship within the supervisory relationship, and countertransference, when the supervisor responds to the counselor in the same manner that the counselor responds to the client. Parallel process, then, is defined as that which occurs when the supervisory interaction replays, or is parallel with, the counseling interaction. Types of parallel process are identified and ways for the supervisor to respond to parallel process are discussed. Suggestions also are given for when supervisors should respond to parallel process. The digest  concludes that the supervisor should always be aware of how the therapeutic relationship and client issues are presented by the counselor in the supervisory session, and that if the parallel process is not worked through in supervision, both the supervisory and therapeutic relationships will suffer.

It suggests that there exist some fairly basic premises from educational psychology, educational evaluation, and counselor supervision literature that can improve supervision evaluation practices, and thus reduce the ambiguity and uncertainty about evaluation in supervision. Evaluation is defined and distinctions are made between summative and formative evaluations. It is noted that the heart of counselor evaluation is an ongoing formative process which uses feedback and leads to trainee skills improvement and positive client outcome. Evaluation practices and procedures are discussed. Resources are cited which outline requisite skills and knowledge for effective evaluation practices, and guidelines and  suggestions from these resources are summarized in a list of eight effective evaluation practices. The digest concludes that the use of multiple methods for evaluation contributes to the supervisee's sense of self-worth and success. Contains 9 references. (NB)",

It begins by describing the merits of group supervision, noting that group supervision is unique in that growth is aided by the interactions occurring between group members. Collaborative learning is identified as a pivotal benefit of group supervision, with the supervisees having opportunities to be exposed to a variety of cases, interventions, and approaches to problem-solving in the group. Models of group supervision are briefly summarized. The group supervision format requires that supervisors be prepared to use their knowledge of group process.

Responses to surveys given to participants were tallied. Replies were scattered across the range of possibilities. Two days  of the seminar were devoted to a &quot;whole language sampler,&quot; highlighting the theory and techniques of whole language. The culminating activity was a self-directed dramatization. Surveys were grouped by grade level, job titles, classroom teachers, support service teachers, support staff, and administrators. Few whole language practices were being used by the groups who were not classroom teachers, but all groups indicated a desire for some or lots of training in some component of the practices. Primary teachers indicated they were using a large number of the practices, but the intermediate teachers were using only a sprinkling of the practices. The staff commented they were particularly delighted to share their mixed feelings of challenge mixed with anxiety as they ventured away from tried  and true methods. (RS)",

Teachers need to use supplementary readers as well as trade books to assist each pupil to achieve as optimally as possible in reading. Pupils also need to achieve skill in word recognition techniques. Most pupils can benefit from syllabication instruction to identify unknown words. Phonics instruction and syllabication learnings should be stressed within the framework of larger units of emphasis such as  context clues. Early primary age pupils, in particular, find picture clues to be helpful in choosing a correct word in what was the unknown in reading. Teachers also need to determine the level of reading achievement in relation to the basal textbook used. The numerous problems that pupils individually may experience in reading need to be identified and solutions sought.

        "description":"Appropriate for any elementary, middle school, or high school teacher who uses reading as part of content instruction, this book describes Project CRISS (Content Reading Including Study Systems), developed in Kalispell, Montana, at School District No. 5, which focuses on teaching students how to learn through reading, with studying, and writing strategies incorporated with content instruction. Five principles are fundamental to the instructional components described in the book: incorporating practical and theoretical ideas about text organization; having students function as active learners; teaching students to use a variety of learning strategies and to monitor their own learning; considering writing as essential for content learning; and using direct instructional methods.  Chapters in the book are: (1) Project CRISS; (2) Textbook Assessment; (3) Informal Assessment Procedures; (4) Generating Background Knowledge and Understanding Main Ideas; (5) Learning Guides and Writing Strategies; (6) Vocabulary; and (7) Directed Reading Thinking Activity (DRTA).

        "description":"A month-long study examined students' attitudes toward aspects of a specific reading workshop based on the whole language theory of instruction. Of the 23 students in a fifth-grade classroom, 11 became part of the experimental group who participated in the process which incorporated four primary aspects of language arts: reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Students in the control group read only during the same time period. A Likert-type survey was administered to the experimental and control groups as pre- and posttests. In addition, qualitative interviews with the experimental group were conducted following the intervention. Results indicated that students: (1) preferred to select their own reading materials and did not think they spent too much time reading in school;  (2) attitudes toward written teacher feedback and writing about books improved; and (3) found reading and discussions to be important aspects of a language arts program and would follow the existing language arts instruction process fairly closely with some modifications. Time and small sample limitations make the results ungeneralizable. However, the variety of responses and student attitudes shows that teachers will need to incorporate diversity into language arts programs to meet the needs of students with differing interests. (Contains 33 references and 6 figures of data. Appendixes present daily schedules, rules for reading, results of a demographic survey, the attitude survey, interview questions, a reading survey, the schedule of mini-lessons, student introductory letters and  samples, and a comparison of the two groups.)

Six of the 22 students (all six were boys) indicated on a reading attitude survey that they did not like to read books. The classroom teacher set up her classroom so that it fostered literacy development. Some of the experiences and activities she used included reading aloud to the students, shared reading, a home reading project, and cross-age reading. Students completed two more reading attitude surveys. By the end of the school year, all students felt that they were readers and that they enjoyed reading.

        "description":"A pilot study systematically collected classroom assessment data in reading and compared that data to the students' test scores on the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP). A total of 61 teachers in 18 New York City public elementary schools gathered the data for 268 students in grades 2 through 6. Teachers identified the books their children could successfully read by listening to the children read aloud, discussing the books, and evaluating student writing about the books. Teachers then looked up the DRP readability values of those books in published guides and compared them to the children's test scores reported in DRP units. Results indicated that the children with the lowest scores could read books that were 10 to 20 DRP units higher on the average than their DRP test scores.  Results also indicated that the classroom assessment techniques used by the participating teachers yielded far more information about their students than a standardized multiple choice test such as the DRP. Findings suggest that teachers should collect multiple forms of evidence about student progress in a rigorous, systematic way and that this evidence has consequences both in the classroom and beyond it. This kind of assessment can inform and drive instruction in a positive way while at the same time make schools more accountable.

Subjects were selected from two similarly composed schools located in Albemarle County, Virginia. Ten students were taught in a pure whole language classroom, and the other 10 students received instruction using a modified whole language approach with about 20 minutes per day devoted to focused, intensive, and systematic instruction in phonics. Results indicated that the whole language students receiving a daily supplement of explicit phonics instruction demonstrated greater alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness, word recognition in  context, and word recognition in isolation than students receiving pure whole language instruction.

For 10 weeks, 50 second-grade bilingual students and 26 students who spoke English only were administered CBM reading measures twice weekly. Reliability of the CBM reading was compared between the groups with respect to the level of student performance and rate of student progress. Evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity of the CBM reading for bilingual Hispanic students was evaluated using criterion measures of English reading and language proficiency. Sensitivity was evaluated by comparing the reading progress of the two groups during the 13-week period. Results  indicated that CBM reading was as reliable and valid for bilingual students as for English-only students, and was sensitive to the reading progress of bilingual students. The construct validity of CBM reading as a measure of general reading proficiency in English was supported. (Contains 67 references, 4 tables, and 1 figure of data.) (Author/RS)",

The teaching of whole language over the entire spectrum of the curriculum was observed in the Catholic Primary Schools of the Archdiocese of Sydney, Australia. Each school promoted learning through its own strategies pertinent to the needs of the student. Classrooms were curious, imaginative places that challenged the children. Teachers needed to be well prepared because groups of children were often involved in a variety of activities. Classroom observations indicated that children did not need to be &quot;spoon fed&quot; but that they could actively participate in learning activities.  Instruments of evaluation through the school visits were usually informal such as teacher observation, journal writing, visual materials, written projects, and research participation through performance. In general, classroom teachers feel that whole language: (1) enriches learning in the classroom and the teaching/learning process; (2) gives children the freedom to explore for themselves; (3) makes connections with oral, written, and reading comprehension; (4) encourages children to look at literature in depth; and (5) uses all modes of communication in an integrating manner stressing language as a whole.

A week of taped interviews with Rigoberta Menchu, a Guatemalan Indian whose native language is a dialect of Quiche, yielded a 500-page text in Spanish, peppered with native Quiche terms. The text relating the atrocities committed by Guatemalan troops was then edited, reorganized, cut, and broken into chapters, and later translated into English. A composition instructor introduces the complications of the text by using supplementary texts, including a documentary film, to familiarize the students with the situation in  Guatemala. Students then complete a series of reading assignments and writing assignments. The instructor often confronts students with their misappropriations of Menchu's text. Some students (and writing critics) go to extremes of either complete identification with her or complete exoticization of her. Students also tend to ignore Menchu's radical Marxist politics. Students are asked to do truly critical reading by questioning their assumptions about the stability of meaning in a given text and in a world they know chiefly through texts.

Students were identified by comparing their anticipated and actual national percentile scores on the Test of Cognitive Skills (TCS) and the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS). A survey of students' reading behavior, a review of school library circulation statistics, and the administration of the Estes Scale of Reading Attitudes revealed reading was not a priority interest for upper elementary grade students at Franklin Elementary School (serving grades K-8) in Franklin, New Jersey. The major solution strategies employed to improve achievement were designed to also increase positive attitudes toward reading. Strategies included the implementation of silent sustained  reading, Accelerated Reader, a campaign for public library membership, a home reading contract, a read-aloud program, and a novel-based approach to reading instruction. As a result of the interventions, 82% of the 46 underachievers who completed the project improved their reading comprehension achievement on the CTBS and 52% met their original anticipated achievement as predicted by the TCS. Although the underachievers showed a mean increase of 8.36 normal curve equivalent points on the CTBS reading comprehension subtest, only eighth graders demonstrated a mean increase in positive attitude toward reading. Increased reading activity had a positive relation with improved reading comprehension; however, no clear association involving reading attitude and the interventions emerged.

The Maryland School Performance Assessment Program (MSPAP) consists of learning outcomes, a framework for performance assessment, guidelines for school decision making, and suggestions for staff development. One year following the initiation of the MSPAP, semi-structured interviews were conducted with district-level administrators responsible for reading and language arts in the state, regarding their perception of the objectives, the influence of the program on district goals, and policies for instructional change. Learning outcomes were accurately perceived as requiring students to apply language to real-world problems and to construct meaning from a diversity of texts. The most frequently cited  instructional innovations were the teaching of reading-language arts through subject matters of the curriculum, and the use of trade books for reading instruction. The MSPAP was perceived by 24% of administrators as legitimating reforms already underway in their districts. Although some districts adopted some of the state-wide goals, and some of the instructional changes were tied to some of the goals, a broad-reaching, coherent program based on a vision for student literacy learning, coupled with an instructional guidance system and supported by a revised governance structure was not evident at this early stage of the reform process.

        "description":"A practicum was designed to encourage 60 at-risk young children in a Chapter 1 reading program at a rural primary school to read for pleasure so that they would eventually increase literacy development. The parents, teachers, and volunteer readers would increase the amount of time spent reading aloud to the children in the Chapter 1 reading program. These individuals would become the reading role models for at-risk children. A grade level in-service program presented current views and information necessary for teachers, staff, and volunteers of enrichment reading for at-risk children. The value of reading was reinforced by providing increased books and magazines that assisted the teachers with classroom libraries and materials for reading aloud. Volunteers, such as peers and  individuals from the community, were effectively incorporated with the teacher's needs. Analysis of the data indicated that parents reported their children enjoyed the time spent reading stories together and that they had increased their reading. Teachers stated that the at-risk children who were read to exhibited an attitude of confidence and expanded literacy development. (Contains 33 references.

        "description":"Linguistically inclined scholars such as Ragnar Rommetveit and Michael Halliday offer a sociocognitive understanding of writing that challenges current writing theories, which focus attention on processes to the virtual exclusion of the writing product. These linguistic scholars provide ways of understanding context, not as fixed or concrete, but as fluid, interactive and dialectical in its relationship with the reader. They suggest how current theories about the subjectivity of the individual writer might be expanded to take into consideration how writers engage with the reader. Rommetveit, for instance, describes what he calls a &quot;message structure&quot; in writing, through which the writer and reader play out an implicit dialogue. When a writer introduces difficult terminology for  the first time, he or she must decide whether or not to define the terms. Such a decision hinges on an implicit understanding between writer and reader. Similarly, according to Halliday, writers create a potential for meaning--both in a private and a shared sense--in so far as they are able to link the texts they create to contexts that bear on their activity. Contexts comprise a complex structure of meaning potential: (1) the kind of symbolic activity writers and readers are involved in; (2) the participant roles of writers and readers; and (3) the role language plays in accomplishing the symbolic activity. Halliday and Rommetveit also offer a means of understanding the complex web of contexts into which students must write themselves. (TB)",

        "description":"&quot;Farewll to Manzanar&quot; (Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James Houston), autobiographical account of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, might be used in a writing class to help students think deliberately about race and ethnicity. Writing about the book and researching the history surrounding it could serve to complicate student views of the world; it allows them to write about the government and the role the individual citizen plays in preventing the government from committing atrocities. In short, the autobiography is a means of confronting naivete. An instructor at Marquette University, however, found that her own naivete was confronted along with that of the students. If she was prepared for her students to find the internment disconcerting, she was not  prepared for their &quot;resistance&quot;: some denied that the internment was racially motivated; some suggested it was necessary; some condemned the Japanese Americans for their passive compliance with the government order and their continued belief in that government. Through a pedagogy that capitalizes on such resistance, however, students can be moved toward what Fletcher Blanchard has termed &quot;interracial competence,&quot; a stance that would respect race and appreciate difference. In their writings, students register an increasing awareness of the complexity of racial and political issues. Having read the autobiography's first chapter, one student writes that she is ashamed of her country, while another student wonders how she could have allowed herself to wonder if those in the camps did not have  it better than others.

        "description":"Hans-Georg Gadamer proposes a philosophical hermeneutics that sheds light on the ways in which scholars have envisioned the history of teaching writing. Offering an alternative to a linear model of history, in which events are viewed as links in a chain, Gadamer's hermeneutics regards a text as a locus or web through which other texts are continuously woven. In this model, the historian is asked to work speculatively rather than prescriptively, attending to the way in which a text suggests, argues with, comments on, or even omits other texts. Over recent years, attempts to understand composition and its theory and practice have arranged themselves into three distinct patterns: (1) works that revitalize the discipline by preserving teaching practices and theories informed by  Greco-Roman influences; (2) texts that authorize composition studies based on the work of empirical and theoretical research; and (3) accounts that focus on aspects of institutional theory--handbook usage and textbook publication trends. Gadamer's model presents a network or frame with which to read and evaluate these narrative accounts of the field. It shows, for instance, that Edward P. J. Corbett's attempt to make a case for classical rhetoric on the grounds of a continuity between antiquity and the present depends on his exclusion of expressive rhetorics from his narrative. It also shows that Albert R. Kitzhaber's study of college writing programs excludes many of the bread and butter issues composition programs were struggling with at that time. (TB)",

        "description":"The college instructor preparing students for a career in high school teaching should incorporate into his or her course a unit on linguistic diversity. It is part of the instructor's responsibility to provide some training that prepares teachers for the wide diversity of dialects they will encounter in teaching students from places like the Philippines, Mexico, Haiti, Vietnam, Eastern Europe, and China. At least three features of language might be incorporated into a writing course (such as the one now being given at Gonzaga University) designed for pre-service high school teachers from a variety of disciplines. First, instructors might focus on how language changes. Few students have heard the differences in the sounds of the English language throughout history; excerpts from  Robin McNeil's &quot;The Story of English&quot; provide illuminating examples. Second, instructors might explain that language is by nature varied; that is, there are standard and nonstandard varieties of language. Third, instructors might focus on grammar and usage, with the aim of encouraging linguistic tolerance. Students should understand the difference between grammar and usage, the latter being in Erika Lindemann's terms, &quot;Linguistic etiquette...socially sanctioned styles of language appropriate to given situations and audiences.&quot; Many students furthermore are unaware that the notion of standard usage is a relatively recent phenomenon, having developed only in the 18th century. The documentary &quot;American Tongues&quot; shows the various attitudes toward the different American dialects and accents  and is effective in this course. (TB)",

During the first three semesters of a study, 312 interviews were conducted with students, beginning when they first entered the university. Analysis of transcripts of the interviews indicated that the students' experiences supported social constructivist theories of writing that suggest making meaning is a complex act of negotiation. Students weaved their past experiences together with their teachers' specific assignments, but that complex act was different for each student. Findings suggest three reasons why using intensive interviews over  a period of time is beneficial are: (1) interviewing students over a period of time elicited data about students' sociocultural histories; (2) one interview session might not elicit as meaningful data as several interviews over time can; and (3) researchers can show their interpretations to the participants to elicit students' perspectives on the researcher's interpretations and speculations.

Though Rich is fully aware of her privileged middle-class background, she speaks from the margins of normal literary and philosophical discourse; she is reactive, peripheral, subversive, and satirical--intentionally confrontational and extreme, denying the master vocabulary which imprisons. Can such an extreme criticism which excludes so many  and demands so much engage students of the 1990s, many of whom believe that the issues raised with such passion in the 1960s are obsolete or not worth the trouble of debate? The answer is a qualified yes. If there is to be meaningful dialogue, students must move beyond their stereotypical and defensive comments, which essentially announce their refusal to subject their own views to examination. To keep his own bias out of the way, a professor at George Mason University asked his students to engage in a meaningful dialogue with one another. Each student wrote a piece on Rich and then responded to that of another student. In the process, those who spouted stereotypical comments earlier found themselves taking their fellow students to task for similar comments. (TB)",

        "description":"Situated between academic discourse and that kind of personal writing that is only for the writer herself, autobiographical writing could serve as a middle ground in which first-year college writers render and describe personal experiences yet at the same time explain and analyze them. In &quot;Lives on the Boundary,&quot; Mike Rose offers some examples of this particular type of autobiographical writing. Recalling his minority experience in college, for instance, Rose reflects on his struggle with academic discourse and generalizes from his learning experiences a view of learning process that is to influence his teaching later in life. By doing so, Rose provides a larger context in which his personal struggle becomes part of the struggle of all those who are outsiders of the academic  world. Such writing indicates an author's ability to make sense of his or her own experiences and to understand their significance to him- or herself and to others, an ability that is indispensable in producing good academic writing and an ability that is often underdeveloped in first-year college writers. According to Mikhail Bakhtin (1990), without &quot;an evaluative context&quot; for experiences to be apprehended there will be no experiences. If scholars agree that a &quot;strong,&quot;&quot;organized,&quot;&quot;differentiated,&quot;&quot;collective,&quot; and a &quot;vivid&quot; and &quot;complex&quot; inner world are desirable, then autobiographical writing may be a legitimate discourse for first-year writers.

In fact, that experience, which has been largely successful, suggests writing programs are best off as independent departments, directed by rotating members from a variety of disciplines. The reasons are as follows. First, a separate program is important because it is separate allowing it to keep its mind, energy and resources on writing. Second, it is financially independent, not having to depend on the good-will or sympathy of a parent department. With its own funds, it can encourage the participation of departments and reward collaboration. Third, as a separate department, it can insist that its directors are given the latitude and time to  be administratively inventive. The director of the program at Cornell, Fredric Bogel, worked hard to establish training programs. His attention to grant-writing resulted in a major endowment and a new name, the &quot;John S. Knight Writing Program.&quot; Before he would even agree to take the job, the second director, Harry Shaw, secured a guarantee from the Provost that no more than 17 students would be admitted to the Freshman Writing Seminars. Writing seminars, one-third of which are taught by full-time faculty, are offered in more than 100 different areas, such as &quot;Art in the Modern Era: or Modernist Primitivism,&quot;&quot;Assimilation, Accommodation, and Conflict: American Ethics in Transition,&quot;&quot;B.

        "description":"The persistent cultural conservatism in Western scholarship has led to the exclusion of Chinese rhetoric from the canon of rhetorical studies. However, the assumption that Chinese culture does not have a rhetorical tradition is misleading and inappropriate. It stems from any number of notions: that the Chinese language is not as logical as those of Western cultures; that rhetoric is an outgrowth of democracy while China's system of politics is hierarchical; that rhetoric is about logical thinking as defined by Western culture. Robert Oliver, however, contends that rhetoric should be seen as a culturally relative term, designating a &quot;mode of thinking.&quot; While it is true that the Chinese political system is hierarchical--no two people are considered equal--this system engendered its  own kind of rhetoric. The Machiavellian rhetorical theories of Han Fei-tzu illustrate the necessity of a certain kind of persuasion suited to the imbalance of power between the speaker and listener. Couching and phrasing an argument correctly could be a matter of life and death in ancient China. In ancient Chinese oratory, the speaker is always male, a person of authority and nobility; his motive is to carry out his social duty, for example, to help the ruler make just policies and promote social harmony. The audience is usually one person, the ruler, who is passive and less cooperative than the audience generally envisioned in Western rhetorical theories. (Contains 22 references.) (TB)",

        "author":["Claywell, Gina"],
        "description":"Traditional histories of American college composition instruction in the 19th and 20th centuries examine primarily the textbooks used in those courses, then draw conclusions based on the content of those textbooks about the activities and attitudes expressed in the classroom. The canon of composition historiography is lacking in several ways: the experiences of students and teachers at many schools across the United States have been neglected; a text-based approach seems to be the primary, if not the only, method used to evaluate past course instruction; and many assumptions about the level of instruction and the types of activities offered have been based on these previous accounts. This paper describes a dissertation project which: (1) adopts a case history approach to  investigate three different types of institutions in Tennessee and Kentucky; (2) triangulates data--documentary analysis, interviews, and a focus on individual personalities--to achieve a more complex history of the period between 1930 and 1945; and (3) examines the experiences of students and teachers to see if broad generalizations made about the era are accurate in specific instances. Using a case study/qualitative approach may detect trends in the cultural, social, and political arena which may have influenced writing instruction. Despite the problems of generalizability and the dangers of biased interview selection, oral interviews within the case history approach offer many advantages. Such a study has the potential to increase the knowledge base of the rapidly growing composition  historiography field.

        "description":"In an episode of MASH in which Radar O'Reiley takes a correspondence course in writing, Col. Potter advises him, &quot;The first rule if you want to be a writer is to be yourself.&quot; But what if O'Reiley wrote a series of stories about a corporal's negotiating his place in a system which urges, &quot;don't ask, don't tell?&quot; The colonel's advice &quot;be yourself&quot; quickly becomes complicated. And so does the advice of creative writing instructors who urge their students to write from their own experience if the student writing is in some way uncommon. Should he or she choose, or have the courage, to write from their experiences, they are likely to challenge some fundamental assumptions of both the instructor and the other students. Their work, in fact, may not make full sense to many of its  readers. The experiences of those whose identities are marked by the culture--marked as not-straight, not-white, not-male, etc.--are paradoxically invisible to individuals not marked. More often than not, when a student &quot;knows&quot; something which exceeds the knowledge of his or her instructor, which is in other words un-knowable, then this knowledge is interpreted as confusion or inability on the part of the student. When the literary models provided to a student are insufficient, or when the available forms are inappropriate to her content, instructors can dismiss her as inarticulate. Or they can interrogate their own position with regard to the assumptions underlying the work. (TB)",

        "description":"Teaching &quot;some&quot; literature in a college composition course is important because it offers variety, enlivens classroom discussion, introduces different writing styles, and helps students to understand and study life. The debate over the appropriateness of literature in the composition classroom has been ongoing. Erika Lindemann believes that literature has no place in the teaching of composition because literature is not useful for students to model their essays after or analyze for style. Essays, she argues, are the proper reading material for composition. By contrast, Gary Tate contends that college instructors submitted too quietly to the &quot;rhetoric police&quot; of the 1960s; bothered by the current emphasis on academic discourse, he fears that composition has been turned into a&quot;service course&quot; for all disciplines. This paper describes the use of a reader-response approach, which includes at least one novel in composition classes for many reasons: (1) to expose students to literature and literary terms; (2) to build tolerance of various viewpoints and enhance classroom discussions; (3) to expand the unconscious; (4) to offer students pleasure and joy; (5) to prepare students, as Tate argues, to participate in important conversations outside the academy. Furthermore, few instructors feel equal to the task that rhetoric scholars ask of them: to prepare students for writing in all disciplines. (TB)",

        "author":["Johnson, Jeannine"],
        "description":"Yale's Cooke Teaching Program is designed to diminish the sense of imperviousness and immobility that the university often conveys to its surrounding community. During the academic year, one Yale graduate student attended a high school senior honors English class twice weekly. It was an advanced class (mostly minorities), many were college-bound, and there was a range of talent and motivation in the class. The graduate student functioned as a team teacher, participating in regularly scheduled classes. Her presence created a more open and dialogic atmosphere of learning, helping the students to become more confrontational--and to challenge the texts and the idea of authoritative readings. Her most rewarding moments occurred in reading poetry with her students. Although the mere  word &quot;poetry&quot; produced instant resistance, the idea of privileged access that poetry suggests became an advantage with the students. Close reading and discovering formal &quot;keys&quot; to the poetry set up reading as a puzzle that requires engagement and effort, not merely the passive reception of inflexible literary meaning. Having the students write their own poems (sonnets) reinforced their familiarity with the technical aspects of poetry and further encouraged them to consider the reader's agency in creating poetic meaning. When the grad student elected to help one student who had been expelled and then readmitted, she found that he fit easily into the atmosphere of Yale's Sterling Library--falling asleep over his books like the undergraduates. Evaluations from her students were positive  about the &quot;Yale teacher,&quot; especially in the socio-cultural sense. (NKA)",

Some writing courses introduce students to great books but those books are usually written only by white men. Others open students to multicultural diversity but the anthologies used essentialize race and gender differences; however noble these courses may be, their purpose is dubious: Is building tolerance the job of a composition course? As an alternative, writing courses can be centered around historical moments that involve rhetorical interaction between cultures and viewpoints. They can introduce students to multicultural pluralism but do so with a clear sense of purpose.  Frederic Jameson has argued that effective democratic communication requires that people be able conceptually to locate themselves in history. A course taught at Holy Cross asked students to participate in a debate over the meaning of the phrase &quot;all men are created equal&quot; from the 19th century to the present. The students first read a variety of scholarly interpretations. Then the students wrote and shared diverse assignments working over the readings: summarizing, analyzing rhetorical strategies, or reworking the beginning of the Declaration of Independence as one of the scholars would have done it.

        "description":"A quasi-experimental study determined the effectiveness of teacher conferences as a modeling technique in freshman composition, as measured by the quantity and quality of selected characteristics in peer response group discourse. Subjects, 22 students in the &quot;experimental&quot; section and 24 students in another section of second semester freshman composition at a medium-sized public university in the southwestern United States, were trained using &quot;traditional&quot; modeling techniques. The 22 students in the experimental section received in addition a treatment of a heretofore undocumented modeling technique--teacher conferences. A total of 10 students in each class completed the first five papers assigned in the semester and were present for tape-recordings of peer-response groups.  Transcripts of peer-response group discussion of the students' first paper served as the pretest, and transcripts of peer-group discussion of the fifth paper served as the posttest. Results indicated that the experimental group improved its performance by a fair margin: in the role of writer, subjects asked many more questions of their peers; the questions were more phatic; and subjects dramatically increased the revision suggestions per episode. Results also indicated that the &quot;traditional&quot; group were less phatic in the role of writer, asked fewer questions and made fewer revision suggestions than before. Findings suggest that peer response groups are characterized by tremendous variation, and that intensive training may be needed to make peer response successful. (Includes six tables of  data.

Carol Gilligan has recently been taken to task by any number of feminist scholars for what they understand to be her tendency to essentialize the differences between the genders at the expense of the role that culture plays in defining gender. But these scholars misunderstand Gilligan's purpose and furthermore fail to see her seminal work, &quot;In a Different Voice,&quot; in the context of her later studies which reinforce yet modify her initial views. Significantly, Gilligan has never pretended that the &quot;different&quot; voice speaks for all women or that it was her goal to prove that it does. Her point  was simply that research hitherto has not taken into account the difference between a man's and a woman's voice, particularly in issues of moral judgment. In &quot;Meeting at the Crossroads,&quot; Gilligan's most recent book (written with Lynn Brown), she explicitly illustrates the role that race, ethnicity, class and family play in the psychological development of girls. At the same time, however, she shows that girls from a variety of cultures and backgrounds lose their authentic voice as they enter adolescence. Silenced by the dominant culture, they develop fraudulent selves. (Contains 53 references.) (TB)",

The Q&amp;A format contributes to the seemingly endless succession of questions and answers and is part of that flight from one signifier to another characteristic of postmodern culture. The Q&amp;A format is increasingly chosen for the delivery of complex information or for the delivery of information into an environment of conflict, even more often if both intricacy and controversy are present. On the local level, the Q&amp;A format obfuscates what was once called &quot;content&quot; or &quot;information&quot; or &quot;exposition&quot; by sporting with the desires of readers and diverting them with the pleasures of the rhetorical model. More often than not, the  Q&amp;A format contributes to indeterminacy in those circumstances in which readers and sometimes writers are seeking determinacy. The format is a currently popular and effective rhetorical strategy in large measure because it speaks to a deeply felt need for answers, a search for the experience of security and authenticity and authority in a shifting world--because it is both a response to and an instance of the superficiality, ephemerality, fetishism, commodification of images, and time-space compression that mark the postmodern condition.

The paper also speculates on how teacher training in the 1940s and 1950s may have contributed to the series' market success. After a brief review of related research, the paper first analyzes the nature and development of late 19th century current-traditional rhetorical theory. The paper next shows how the Warriner text is based on current-traditional rhetorical theory. The paper also compares the Warriner text with three popular competing textbooks of the day, in  terms of their theoretical basis of language and composition and their treatment of the paragraph, a key feature of current-traditional rhetoric and Warriner's approach. The paper examines teacher training, preparation for teaching of writing, and how an absence of any real knowledge in rhetoric and composition may have contributed to the initial success of the Warriner text. The paper concludes with a discussion of how teacher training, competing texts, Warriner's current-traditional rhetoric, and rhetorical theory and practice in secondary schools contributed to the initial success of Warriner's text.

This is a direct result of America's longstanding distrust of foreigners, and the condescension with which the educational system has sometimes treated nonnative speakers. According to C. B. Stein, &quot;the world view of teachers and administrators approaches history and culture as if both began in England and came to fruition in the United States.&quot; When nonnative speakers first began entering college in record numbers, many teachers who taught English as a Second Language (ESL) were not specifically trained in the field, and sometimes saw as problems what were really cultural differences in classroom behavior. For classroom English  teachers, grammatical incorrectness has traditionally been a sore point, and many nonnative students make a lot more errors than native students--errors which usually cannot be explained by simple prescriptive rules. Thus frustrated university professors lay the blame for unsuccessful written communication on what is immediately obvious--incorrect grammar. Although recent ESL theory has grown in the same direction as mainstream composition theory, that is, away from preoccupation with error and toward an appreciation of content, it is difficult to reconcile knowledge about the existence of contrastive rhetoric with the goal of preparing students to follow academic conventions in the discipline of English and in other disciplines.

They were able to discern the differences between good and bad literature. Students were active participants in the process, performing skits, writing prose and poetry, and individually formulating criteria for evaluating the works of professionals and of their peers. Their final products were children's books they designed and wrote. Prose and poetry samples were disseminated, pre- and postsurveys were administered, students were trained in the peer editing process, and students were helped to prepare peer editing critique sheets. Analysis of the data revealed that the students could  distinguish between good and bad literature.

As instructors are constrained by political forces beyond their control, such as lack of position and power, teaching undervalued courses, and the lack of respect from students, their position can be improved only if the academic community is willing to address and change those political forces. Largely because of these conditions, one instructor, now at Rollins College, found that she and her students had become \"evil twins,\" to borrow a term from Jane Tompkins; that is, both the instructor and the students were acting from defensive postures. The classroom quickly became a hostile environment, in which the  instructor attempted to prove her worth through lecturing or performing and the students showed their disrespect for the class and the instructor through rude behavior. Advice that colleagues and advisers offered this instructor were of minimal value. The insecurities inherent in the position of the graduate student and the scholarly demands placed on him or her by research faculty make experimental collaborative learning, as described by Tompkins, an unpromising possibility.

First, the instructor should ask the students to try to define &quot;conflict,&quot; and then responses to conflict should be discussed. Students can then be exposed to the five conflict styles (competition, compromise, collaboration, avoidance, and accommodation) by having students complete a questionnaire which presents statements about behaviors during conflict, or by having students write down both the dialogue and actions they would enact in one or several conflict situations. Students also need to become aware of what kind of communication can lead  to problem solving. Many of these effective communication techniques are already taught in the basic course: awareness of perceptions, active listening, empathy, perspective-taking, nonverbal communication, and organized and clear presentations. Whether discussing conflict management for a day, a week, or two weeks, with at least one exercise and discussion on conflict management, students can be familiarized with a key tool for communicating in today's diverse world.

        "author":["Clucas, Eric"],
        "description":"Advertisers have leaned heavily upon researchers to answer the question of what the advertisers get for the money they spend. Researchers have used a wide variety of methods, including a split cable simulated test market. Wilder Penfield's 1950s research may help other researchers better understand what goes on in the mind of consumers as a result of being exposed to advertising. Applying a mild electric probe to the temporal cortex of the brain, Penfield established that memories are retained in their natural form as ego states (coherent systems in which sensory stimuli are inseparable from what was felt and understood at the time of experiencing the stimuli); and two different ego states can occupy consciousness simultaneously. After some false starts, a researcher was able to  have respondents re-live the original unselfconscious advertising experience, which opened up the flood gates to a whole stream of communication information. Such data-gathering techniques do not measure recall (what survives in the memory) but communication--what was actually seen, heard, and read at the time, what this conveyed, and what rational and/or emotive response it evoked. Analysis of a television commercial for a Magnavox television with remote control indicated that, for the audience, the remote control was the symbol of advanced technology, not the push-button controls as expected by the advertiser. To discover what commercial the audience carries away in its head, researchers need to use their own counterpart to Penfield's electric probe. (A four-color chart is included.)  (RS)",

It is important for learners to develop needed skills in reporting to others in a group setting. The teacher and the pupils in the classroom should support each other so that satisfying experiences in oral communication are an end result. Objectives to emphasize in oral communication need to be carefully selected by those involved in teaching-learning situations, be it the teacher(s), principal, supervisor, or other persons with professional training. A variety of learning opportunities should be provided pupils so that interest is ongoing, and individual differences among learners need to be considered to achieve optimal achievement. Pupils also need to be instructed in how to  make appropriate introductions. Extemporaneous speaking has much merit for pupils possessing readiness for this activity. Pupils need to have the opportunity to participate in creative dramatics as a speaking activity. Formal dramatizations emphasize that learners write play parts pertaining to what has been read. Pupils, with teacher leadership, may make puppets that relate to content area reading, literature, and social studies. Early primary grade pupils should have ample opportunities to experience debate on their understanding levels. A challenging debate can make for much learning and motivation for either side of the debate.

Schools are contested spheres and the struggle over what forms of authority and types of knowledge should be legitimated and transmitted to students can be seen in the demands of right-wing religious groups, feminists, ecologists, minorities, and other interest groups. Teaching with empowering students as a goal can be particularly challenging for speech communication instructors because so much of what happens in their classrooms is public. Instructors should keep student developmental levels in mind prior to trying out new critical classroom approaches. According to the theories  of William Perry, students walk into class at many different places on the hierarchy of development, and instructors cannot reasonably expect all of their students to end up at the same place by the end of the semester. Incorporating sensitivity to multiculturalism into a public speaking class can be an extremely challenging endeavor. By exploring tenets of critical pedagogy and looking for opportunities to incorporate them into public speaking classrooms, instructors will be doing a service to their students. By using developmental theory as an &quot;overlay&quot; for critical activities, instructors can better understand their students' successes and failures. (Contains nine references.) (RS)",

One of the reasons for the low participation rate is that judges offer vague and sometimes insensitive evaluations. Judges must not forget that students are putting themselves on the line in entering an event that requires them to be funny. Meanwhile, coaches should try to coax students into the event by building self-esteem in those who show potential. If students feel they are not funny, tell them, &quot;You might not be the funniest person in the world, but with a little time, practice and coaching, anyone can do A.D.S.!&quot; When coaching an after dinner speech, coaches  might follow a 12-step process, by which they help students choose topics, make outlines, find support, time speeches, and memorize. Part of this process may involve teaching students how to be funny--and this can be taught. Students should know that there are a range of humoristic techniques such as topical humor, intellectual humor, analogies, satire and puns. In writing humor, students should suspend their critical faculties and employ the creative side of their brain. They might also try to watch or read some humor prior to writing. Coaches should also try to answer important student questions about the event, such as, why speeches that are not funny make it into the finals, and why rankings in this event are so inconsistent.

Teachers of rhetoric can use a liberating comic frame that acknowledges the recalcitrance of the &quot;real world,&quot; since it mediates between uncritical dogmatism and uncritical relativism. However, Dramatism can be oppressive if it is conceived of in terms of the &quot;insight&quot; it offers. In those terms, Dramatism is like a bank surveillance camera that &quot;watches&quot; and &quot;points out&quot; the oppressive transaction but is ill-suited to act to do something about it.

One group spent 20 minutes answering questions from their  textbook, another group rehearsed and performed a 90-second two-character script depicting the climax of the same story in randomly assigned pairs, and the third group individually composed compare-contrast essays. During the final 20 minutes of the class period the students composed a written response to a writing prompt asking them to discuss the principal character's actions in a proposed situation unrelated to the story. Results indicated that the dramatization instructional methodology yielded no significantly superior results compared with the two more traditional written analysis techniques, yet the highest mean score was obtained by high achieving students engaged in the dramatization method of story analysis. Results also indicated that high achievers benefited more than low  achievers from the dramatization technique. (Contains 21 references. Six appendixes of data are attached.) (RS)",

Subjects, 21 students representing diverse demographic factors, completed two self-esteem measures (a self-evaluation instrument and an interview) before and after the theater production. Over a 2-week period, the students cast the parts, made the props and invitations, studied theatrical vocabulary, memorized their lines (each student had a speaking part), mastered the elements of theater-like expression, conducted a dress rehearsal, and performed the play for other first-grade classes and for parents. Results indicated that, as measured by both instruments: (1) the self-esteem of the Afro-American students increased after  the production, but not to an extent greater than the increase in self-esteem of the white students; (2) the self-esteem of female students rose more than that of the male students; and (3) the self-esteem of the class as a whole rose.

        "description":"A study measured students' emotional response to teacher behaviors based upon the theory of implicit communication. Subjects, 281 undergraduate student volunteers of preexisting, intact introductory communication courses at a southwestern university, completed questionnaires. As in previous research, teacher use of affinity-seeking behaviors correlated positively with student liking of the teacher as well as cognitive and affective learning. Findings indicated that student emotional response explains why learning occurs. Specifically, the dimensions of pleasure and arousal accounted for 61% of the variance of affective learning and 27% of cognitive learning. Further, students' emotional responses help explain why teacher affinity-seeking behaviors enhance learning. Findings are  consistent with previous research using student emotional response to explain the meaning of teacher behavior from a student's perspective. Results suggest that the integration of theory implicit communication with learning in general and specific instructional variables such as affinity-seeking behaviors is appropriate and fruitful.

        "description":"When critical thinking skills are set adrift from course content, teachers soon fall prey to using critical thinking skills as techniques for getting students to succeed in class rather than surviving outside the classroom. However, the majority of writers in critical thinking skills agree that the skills are not subject-specific, are teachable, transfer to other disciplines, and cluster into paradigms for examining social phenomena. Students learn critical thinking skills by observing the professor manage the context of learning. A skillful teacher assesses students' experience bases and assists them in building structures they wish to change from those bases. Critical thinking skills in the communication classroom should help students assess the strengths they bring to the  classroom; weigh the loci of issues in their environment; assist in matching their strategies for change with their repertoire of need for change; and make solutions obvious to the students and to others. To do this, teachers should plant students in contexts other than the classroom; abandon the text-driven course; discuss relevant social issues in class; help students discover their voices; use context-specific assessment tools; and focus students on communication patterns that connect and unify interaction contexts. Communication teachers can encourage critical thinking skills when they teach students: (1) how quickly image transfers meaning; (2) how to use computers to enrich detail and increase information yet reduce it to manageable style; and (3) how to see beauty in this  postindustrial society where there is no beauty immediately apparent.

        "description":"The categorization of evidence through an &quot;inverse inference&quot; model is a preliminary attempt to organize the manner in which the ordinary language user perceives the use of evidence. While discussions on the nature of evidence have an important place in the realm of the theoretician and methodologist, this model attempts to explain how naive observers interpret and make sense of their world. The model begins with the assumption that individuals interpret events within a relatively stable frame of references. Ordinary language users treat as evidence those interpretations of phenomena which allow them to create meaningful classifications or apply them. The inferential process of connecting evidence with the interpretation of phenomena requires acceptance of several assumptions:  evidence is inferred; evidence requiring less inference is preferred to evidence which requires greater inference; the frame of reference through which evidence is interpreted is subjective; and the frame of reference in relatively stable, even though it is subject to change. Three levels of evidence (in order of least inference required to most required) emerge for categorizing evidence types through the model: (1) evidence only requiring a perceptual inference; (2) evidence requiring both a perceptual inference and at least one level of logical inference by the observer; and (3) evidence requiring multiple levels of logical inference without a direct perceptual inference by the observer. Future elaboration of the model will explain the heuristic rules employed. (Contains 16 references.)  (RS)",

        "description":"Artificial criteria included in speech evaluation forms in the basic communication classroom to assess students' communication competencies fail to reflect what is known about communication as a transaction and about communication competence. Communication competence is most commonly defined from the action perspective which focuses on the performance of specific communication skills. The reaction approach focuses on the perceptions of the listener who makes the ultimate judgment of competence. Whether viewed as a property of the speaker or a characteristic of the listener, the action and reaction approaches lead to inappropriate and/or incomplete criteria for evaluating competence. The transactional approach, however, changes the focus to the creation of shared meaning. If  communication is transactional, then communication competence is also mutually created. S. Morreale's &quot;Competent Speaker Speech Evaluation Form&quot; is an assessment instrument designed to evaluate/rate observable public speaking skills/behaviors of college students and consists of eight competencies. Criticisms of the evaluation form include: the discriminations needed to determine the levels of competence are not clearly defined; the competencies are based on generalizations from the teacher's point of view to the audience as a whole; and the competencies are culturally narrow. Communication teachers should not proclaim a student competent or incompetent based on a few weeks of lessons and a limited number of performances in an artificial environment.

A series of lectures and exercises which test cultural knowledge, communication behavior, and the possible results of parochialism, stereotyping, and ethnocentrism are provided, as are a questionnaire, pre- and posttests, and an evaluation form.

        "author":["Robinson, Karla Salmon"],
        "description":"Like other industries, television has its own version of the used-car dealership or second-hand store: off-network syndication. Since researchers who study television have rarely investigated the market for these programs, a study examined program and marketplace characteristics to determine which contributes most to the successful syndication of an off-network program. Factors hypothesized to play a role in the success of these programs were analyzed and two models were developed. Marketplace and program-specific criteria were considered as explanatory variables; however, the high multicollinearity of the marketplace data hindered investigation of the impact of many market-related factors. Much of the conventional wisdom regarding television programming was supported by the  findings. Programs entering the off-market network generally have had highly successful network runs, both in terms of ratings and longevity (these programs enter syndication with many episodes available). Comedies were more likely to be syndicated than dramas; half-hour shows were preferred over 1-hour shows. Although syndication has become easier, distributors now find it more difficult for a program to achieve high ratings, due to the increase in competing media outlets. This study merely scratches the surface of an area rich with possibilities for future research. No researcher has done an in-depth investigation of the nuts-and-bolts operation of the syndication market since the 1970s. Much needs to be done before communication scholars can truly say that they understand the  television industry. (Contains 61 references; 13 tables of data are included.) (NKA)",

        "description":"A classroom research project in Alaska explored what role dramatic play and story reenactments have as a teaching/learning method for young childrens' development. A review of the literature identified several common elements that helped teachers elicit successful dramatic story reenactments: choosing a familiar book or story; encouraging adaptations of stories to fit the needs of the group; directing as little as possible; and avoiding getting caught up in the final product. The students and the teacher began by reenacting familiar fairy tales and folktales. The 12 students in the class formed two groups to work on reenacting &quot;The Three Little Pigs.&quot; The students enjoyed the reenactments and wanted to reenact their stories again after seeing the other group's reenactment. The  students then moved on to reenacting unfamiliar fairy tales. The addition of a puppet stage with a variety of puppets was successful, and showed how language, cooperation, story comprehension, oral expression, and imagination are all developed in this creative play. The teacher was surprised and excited at the transformation the students made into various kinds of characters by just putting on a different shirt, hat, or skirt. The dress-up area soon became one of the most popular places in the classroom. Students developed higher-level thinking skills as they made decisions about characters, plot, and setting in reenacting their characters. They developed social skills as they listened to others' ideas and learned to compromise in the choices they made as a group. (Contains 14  references.) (RS)",

        "description":"Managing cultural diversity is recognized as one of the most pressing challenges to be faced in the 21st century by development communication scholars and practitioners. Meeting that challenge requires formulation of communication concepts, theories and practices which enable sharing and blending diversity among the world's multi-communal, multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religion, multi-familial communities and peoples. A &quot;Cultural Renewal Model&quot; can become the action framework for sharing and blending diversity through participatory communication at the local community level. The model incorporates a dialogic process at the local level in formulating common goals for both economic and cultural development, and utilizes participatory research methods. &quot;Cultural Renewal&quot; is  operationalized as a systematic self-examination of heritage and human ecology at all levels of community. Cultural renewal takes a holistic view of communities assessing their cultural context through participatory research, critical reflection, and analysis. Participatory communication holds potential for reducing the possibility of destructive conflict between groups, between communities, between nations whether powerful or powerless. Participatory communication reinforces the purposes of liberation, freedom, justice, and egalitarian ideologies--all related to issues of diversity. It not only enables people to become partners in communication decision making but simultaneously provides a process which facilitates development of communication competencies.

Subjects, 83 male and 100 female undergraduate students in communication or psychology courses at a Mid-Atlantic suburban university or a liberal arts college in a small midwestern town, offered up to eight characteristics of the most feminine and the most masculine person they knew, whether that person ever seemed more or less feminine or more or less masculine, and rated themselves using the Bem Sex Role Inventory. Respondents identified gender as characteristics of persons, but also understood it as something that  varied according to interaction partners and focus of activities. Responses show differences in how femininity and masculinity are constructed and in what situations influence gender perceptions. Findings suggest the need for a reconceptualization of gender to recognize its variation by situation and time as well as other factors such as race and class.

A third story  involves an experience from the teacher's early career regarding a student overcoming his communication apprehension--not through the teacher's intervention but through the use of phenobarbital.

During the last few weeks of the semester, subjects completed questionnaires that assessed attributions, anger, and preferences for particular conflict management behaviors. Results indicated that: (1) verbally aggressive individuals were more likely to prefer negative conflict behaviors than less aggressive individuals and that the preference had little to  do with feelings of anger; (2) even a single nonverbal display of status can increase the likelihood of a purposive attribution, leading to anger, which makes the use of negative conflict behavior more probable; and (3) men were more verbally aggressive than women. Findings support the attribution-based model, that conflict escalation is a more likely outcome when purposive attribution is made in response to a nonverbal display of status and less likely when a reactive attribution is made.

A classroom, wherein everyone is considered a teacher and student at the same time, is a classroom acknowledging students, promoting respect and acceptance of others' worldview on a wide range of issues. Having fun role-playing and working together in dyadic or small group structured learning activities, students as well as teachers learn a great deal about interpersonal communication, enhance their interpersonal relationships, relieve tension, eliminate boredom, improve class attendance, ameliorate active participation, heighten self-awareness of the importance of others, increase self-confidence, and enjoy what they are doing. Using  play and encouraging the application of a good sense of humor while playing, along with a careful consideration of the major factors of listening, affection, acceptance, respect, and timing, teachers and students would realize that it can be safe to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes.

        "description":"While the debate over the role of metaphor in language, thought, and meaning is not new, in the past decade there has been a move among organizational scholars to use metaphors in critical research. This paper presents a review of one area of the existing literature on metaphor--that dealing primarily with the nonliteral view of metaphors within the organization. The paper also develops a discussion and critique of the use of metaphor in critical theory, pointing out that critical research looks for systems of power and domination in the organization and that reality is socially constructed. Lastly, the paper provides suggestions as to how the organizational researcher can use critical theory without succumbing to the pitfalls discussed and considers some of the potential rewards  of critical research. Among the recommendations put forth in the paper are: (1) before engaging in critical research, the researcher should be aware of the implications of his/her position on meaning and reality; (2) the researcher must consider the desires of the group he/she considers to be oppressed; (3) the researcher should attempt to gain some understanding of the social reality of the individuals under study; and (4) the researcher should always be aware that his/her work may be ignored or rejected.

The paper notes that, although the rhetorical discipline is relatively young, a standard approach to discussing rhetoric and science is to discuss the rhetoric of science, exposing the non-scientific elements of science or scientific writing. Outlining the history of optics before Newton,  the paper also discusses Goethe as a scientist, his theory of color and contribution to optics, and his phenomenological science. The paper offers an illustrative application of phenomenological optics in practice in the regulation of air pollution in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The paper concludes that the discipline of rhetoric has historically been called upon to facilitate &quot;getting on with public business&quot; such as environmental regulation as epistemological certainty continues to erode and mathematics no longer carries the day.

        "description":"A study identified the academic needs of Australian vocational educators who are developing their own and others' communication competence in response to the imperative for vocational educators to provide a wide range of programs in communication for the workplace. Subjects, over 100 vocational educators enrolled in the University of Technology, Sydney, in the School of Adult Vocational Education, spoke to individual lecturers and evaluated formatively and summatively a new major sequence of four subjects in Communication Development Studies. Results indicated the vocational educators' needs clustered around a strong interest relating to conflict management, negotiation, listening, assertiveness, team building, group dynamics, leadership, interviewing and conducting meetings as a  communication process. The academic program has tried to model educational principles in adult education to acknowledge teachers' diversity and to provide opportunities for educators to focus their intellectual efforts on producing benefits for their practice of teaching. An experiential approach to the teaching of communication principles and practices, along with opportunities for discussion of key issues, would be appropriate. Assessment by negotiating an individual learning contract with an academic advisor provides a means for communication specialists to demonstrate development of their own and/or others' understanding and practice of an aspect of communication. The new major sequence of study in communication emphasizes combining theoretical approaches in communication with  strategies for teaching, and indeed facilitating, communication in many vocational contexts.

The paper discusses an interactive model of gender related behavior. Moreover, the paper addresses  conceptual and measurement concerns involved in examining sex and gender.

A teacher's craft lies in creating learning experiences that facilitate concept development and challenge misconceptions from which students actively build, modify, and extend their conceptual understanding. Concept mapping is accepted as one of several research and evaluation tools that are valid devices for assessing conceptual change. Concept mapping has also been identified by teachers and researchers as a tool for assisting teachers to organize their teaching strategies. Conceptual understanding is influenced by the prior knowledge brought by students to learning situations. Effective teaching entails recognizing  students' prior knowledge including any alternative frameworks and adopting teaching strategies to acknowledge those frameworks. Scientific facts, if learned in a meaningful, rather than rote, manner produce much in students' minds. Having identified their students' prior learning, educators are then faced with the challenge of creating learning experiences to facilitate meaningful learning and conceptual understanding. Meaningful communication of concepts can be taught through the use of contexts and case studies; discrepant events (when a mismatch exists between the preconceptions that students bring to a learning situation); analogies, metaphors, and similes; examples and non-examples; and multiple representations of verbal and nonverbal information.

        "description":"Based on the premise that multimethod approaches that integrate quantitative and qualitative research methods are best suited to contextual studies of media audiences, two studies of mass media use and meaning were conducted with college undergraduates. Research grew out of a classroom assignment wherein students avoided all media products (films, TV, etc.) for a 24-hour period to focus attention on the place of media use in their lives. This was also what was asked of the subjects in the study. Initial subject pool consisted of 80 undergraduates at Loyola of Chicago, of whom 31 completed the study. The study was broadened to include subjects drawn from Northwestern and DePaul; the numbers were increased from 80 to 250. Of these 250, 89 completed the study, 49 experimental  subjects and 47 control subjects. Subjects were pretested and surveyed. The second study extended the fast period to 48 hours, some items in the pretest were changed, tests of subjective mental health and self-image were added, and participants were encouraged to volunteer for follow-up interviews. Tests to determine the comparability of Study 1 and Study 2 quantitative results were performed on 28 variables. Survey consisted of open-ended questions on levels of media use. Responses indicated that both solitary and social media use have more than one dimension. Subjects' remarks regarding the difficulty of changing media use patterns can be interpreted as an indication of how deeply media use is embedded in social context.

        "author":["Matcuk, Matt"],
        "description":"Using sophistic theory and focusing on intersections in the practice and reception of sophistry and advertising, a study analyzed a contemporary advertising campaign. A number of extrinsic similarities between sophistic and advertising rhetoric exist: their commercial basis, their popular reception as dishonest speech, and the reception of both as nonetheless entertaining. Besides surface parallels, there are also intrinsic correlations. The techniques of antithesis, parataxis, and probability employed by the Sophists reappear in late 20th century advertising. The current campaign for the Saturn automobile allows for rhetorical analysis. The common theme of the Saturn print campaign (as seen in three representative ads) could be stated as: &quot;real&quot; people are the people who buy  Saturns, because &quot;real&quot; people also recommend them. The ads all feature ordinary people who are much more in evidence than the product itself. Contemporary advertising employs a rhetoric not of fixed, monologic, hypotactic certainty, but one of fluid, antithetical, paratactic reasoning--that of sophistry. Although it may be a stretch to conclude that the persuasive techniques championed by a small group of orators in the fifth century B.C. directly inform the rhetoric of advertising, a web of connections links the two. With the proliferation of advertising and with its power to motivate and persuade, access to every analytical tool is needed. This use of the Sophists can serve as an effective instructional exercise, both in the advertising course and in the rhetoric course. (Includes  illustrations of the Saturn advertisements.

        "description":"In his autobiography, Malcolm X wrote that he did not become fully literate until he went to prison in the 1940s. Literacy profoundly changed Malcolm's life--his progression from street talker, to spokesman for the Nation of Islam, to independent spokesman for human rights, is related to changes in his consciousness brought on by literacy. When he lived on the streets of New York, hustling for a living, Malcolm relied on oral communication. One scholar argues that part of the resistance to white racism and domination was the creation by Blacks of a fast-paced, improvisational language that contrasted sharply with the passive stereotyping of the tongue-tied &quot;sambo.&quot; Malcolm never lost his &quot;street talker&quot; skills, but literacy was central to his later development. In prison, he  became frustrated with his inability to read or write well, and he began to take advantage of the prison library. As Malcolm read and discovered the enormous injustices done to Blacks, and the attempts made to explain those injustices away, the level of dissonance he experienced became unbearable. The writings and teachings of Elijah Muhammad served to satisfy Malcolm's literate need for closure. He became a convert to Muhammad's version of Islam, a decision that had monumental consequences for his thought and lifestyle. What happened, essentially, is that Malcolm's experience with literacy opened his mind in many respects, but also closed it by leading him to devalue his earlier life. For teachers, the lesson is that the mind controlled by writing technology has limitations, as does the  mind without exposure to writing. (Contains 16 references.) (NKA)",

The digest first notes the rapidly escalating numbers of children who are being home schooled in the 1990s and comments upon the professionalization of resources offered for parents who home school. The digest then addresses some of the reasons that parents school their children at home. They include: living in areas where schools are not readily available and being anxious about the physical well being of their children in an increasingly more violent school setting. Next the digest discusses current research on socialization of children. Finally, it is pointed out that most experts feel that more research on home  schooling and socialization is necessary--that what is available is inconclusive. Contains 8 references. (NKA)",

Pointing out that the 1990s society is inundated with propaganda from numerous sources (including government, business, researchers, religious groups, the news media, educators, and the entertainment industry) the book exposes these channels of propaganda and the cumulative effect they have on public opinion and the functioning of American democracy. Chapter 1 reviews materials on diverse vantage points from which American writers and opinion leaders have tried to reconcile mass persuasion with the democratic way of  life during the 20th century. Chapters 2-6 examine propaganda in: (1) government (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation, aid to the Contras, Star Wars, presidential styles); (2) research and religion (e.g., national security, private sector, religion and politics); (3) news (e.g., getting good coverage, pressure groups, and business); (4) classroom (e.g., business propaganda, pressure groups, textbooks, pressures on teachers); and (5) entertainment (e.g., film, television). Chapters 7 and 8 question: (1) what action a democratic people should take to safeguard intelligent discussion and free choice from the taint of devious communication; (2) to what extent propaganda casts a shadow over public life; and (3) whether large-scale, engineered persuasion can ever be squared with the ideal of  democratic public deliberation.

This brief, three-part monograph organizes staff-development objectives, models, and program-design features into an understandable, comprehensive framework. Part 1 advises readers on how to weigh a program's objectives. Eight main types of objectives are described--five teacher-centered objectives, a student-centered objective, a curriculum-centered objective, and a school-centered objective. The second part features six major models of staff development. Each model represents a different strategy for accomplishing one or more of the objectives identified in part 1. The models are summarized, their features noted, and the objectives for which they are best  suited listed. The primary roles assumed by staff developers vary from model to model. The roles that correspond to the six models are: (1) expert presenter; (2) clinical supervisor; (3) trainer; (4) action-research facilitator; (5) organization-development specialist; and (6) change agent. Specific program characteristics that influence the effectiveness of various staff-development objectives are the focus of part 3. Nineteen features are grouped into three categories: objectives, delivery system, and administration. Pertinent questions and comments designed to facilitate program planning are included in each feature description. Two tables are included. (Contains 71 references.) (LMI)",

        "description":"In the past two decades choice has become a major policy proposal for promoting efficiency in schooling. This paper argues that it would be both efficient and feasible to remove government from its present roles in school finance and pupil assignment. The first part examines the revenue side of school finance and identifies four types of efficiency--technical, price, exchange, and allocative (McMahon, 1982). A conclusion is that educational vouchers fall short of meeting these types of efficiency, partly because they rely on government finance. An alternative system of school choice that relies on private finance is proposed: each family contracts with a school to provide education in exchange for a share of the student's income earned over her or his lifetime or other extended  time period. This acts as a tuition deferment and gives investors in students' education an equity stake in students' future earning power. Schools will enroll students at lower costs to attract higher enrollments and compete on the basis of effective programs and choice. Because the plan is based on free-market principles, it is not appropriate for the proportion of the population that is incapable of earning a wage. Schools would enroll only those students whom they could educate at a profit. Finally, it is argued that people make better choices if they are paying for something than if government taxes gave it to them. (LMI)",

        "description":"This paper presents findings of a study that conceptualized how the mass media in England are involved in the education policy process, and identified major influences on media production and its link with education policy. The project is being conducted by the National Development Centre for Educational Management and Policy from October 1993 to May 1995. Methodology involves interviews with media professionals and representatives of other groups; content analysis of national media coverage of educational issues; and case studies of progressive education in British schools. It is argued that political debate, especially the antagonistic discourse over progressive versus traditional teaching methods, is a dialectical process of myth making and myth bashing. Media and political  myths vary across several dimensions--the degree of simplification, the extent to which certain aspects are omitted, and the level of generalization. In a context of multiple education reform, the policy formation process may be viewed as a continuous dialectic between interest groups who are situated in four mutually influential contexts: the context of influence; the context of text production; the context of practice; and the media context. This paper discounts the theory of relative autonomy and asserts that the media and state are closely linked, and serve to legitimate capitalism. Some key areas for further inquiry are highlighted.

        "description":"Collaboration is often cited as fundamental to systemic change efforts. This paper presents a process-based model for collaboration, which can be adopted as part of systemic, generative change. Schools attempting to create a collaborative culture often encounter the following problems: collaborators who fail to translate their experiences to others; models that do not match experience; and participants who engage in organizational politics. The proposed model is grounded in social processes, and identifies four domains of collaboration: engagement, negotiation, performance, and assessment/evaluation. Engagement is the process through which the group or individual develops an understanding of the problem. Negotiation refers to the development of an action plan in which objectives  are clarified and the meaning of success is defined. Performance refers to the actual work done by the group. Assessment entails systematic reflection of outcomes and processes. The model attempts to demystify the process by not specifying a set path to be adhered to by participants. (LMI)",

        "description":"This paper describes some of the significant school-finance policy issues facing the state of Georgia, and speculates as to the possible consequences of certain policy alternatives. The state faces the following potentially divisive issues: (1) proposals for the provision of publicly funded vouchers for private choices in education; (2) the adequacy of funding for public education; and (3) the equitable support of educational opportunity for all students. Following an overview of Georgia's educational finance history, three conclusions are drawn. First, the creation of a voucher plan would be financially damaging to public schools and is likely to be divisive. If a plan that satisfies state and federal constitutional provisions is created, its success is contingent upon the  generation of sufficient political and financial support. This support will probably not be generated. Second, adequate funding for public education must remain a goal. Georgia ranks 38th in the nation in per pupil expenditures. Finally, it is unlikely that disparities in per pupil expenditures within the state will be greatly reduced. (LMI)",

This paper presents a typology of work cultures--the varying work conditions of schools and the challenges they present to principals in developing high-performance work cultures. Data were collected in 28 elementary, middle, and high schools in Florida, Virginia, and Minnesota. Methodology involved interviews with 28 principals, a work-culture survey of 1,235 professional staff at 25 schools, and a survey of 1,235 teachers at 25 schools. Three conceptual models were compared: (1) the Managing Productive Schools (MPS) Model; (2) the Change Process Model; and (3) the Quality Performance Model. Findings indicate that the highest  performing schools had developed interdependent planning, staff development, program development, and assessment functions. Teachers in the more mature cultures tended to see priorities and challenges in similar ways and were involved in shaping new programs and services. Principals who understand the change process as developmental tended to be successful in engineering school development. Finally, the typology for principals is built on visionary leadership, strategic planning, and systems thinking and acting. Five tables and three figures are included. Contains 25 references. (LMI)",

Two assumptions are made about change. First, behavior is based on beliefs and values, and individuals, not groups or organizations, change. Second, change must satisfy the individual person. Therefore, to change behavior, individuals must relinquish old behaviors and substitute new ones. This is accomplished through the grief process (Kubler-Ross, 1969), which is comprised of five stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. The grief process can be used to understand educational change, and some implications are: (1) clarify expectations and give reasons for those expectations; (2)  understand the negative reactions of staff as part of the process; (3) present change as improvement, rather than as criticism of individuals' past behaviors; (4) exercise persistence; and (5) provide individual support throughout the change process.

Research findings in the following areas are presented: funding, parent involvement, and accountability. School-linked social welfare services have successfully used funding strategies that attracted new revenue and redirected existing categorical funds toward coordinated service delivery. Strategies that have increased parent involvement are based on direct, informal, and  personal forms of communication, such as the development of volunteer programs, home visits, and parent group meetings.

State initiatives are grouped by the type of reform. Under each state is an overview of the effort and, when appropriate, an outline of organizational structure. States that have outlined their state-level objectives in documents called \"common cores of learning\" include Connecticut, Maine, Vermont, and Virginia. Other states describe expectations of students through the use of graduation requirements or \"certificates of mastery.\"  These include Minnesota and Oregon. Alabama, Arkansas, and Florida are states that have emphasized the six National Education Goals in their reform efforts.

        "description":"The literature concerning the superintendency is based on the experiences of men. This paper presents findings of the two studies that examined women superintendents. The first, a pilot study, sought to determine whether women superintendents used leadership qualities that fit a new paradigm for leadership. It also sought to determine if differences existed between urban and rural female superintendents' leadership qualities. Data were obtained from a survey of 346 women superintendents in 29 states. A total of 263 responses were received, a 76 percent response rate. Telephone interviews were also conducted with 21 urban and 30 rural survey respondents. The most striking conclusion was that both rural and urban superintendents possessed similar leadership qualities, and those  qualities fit a new paradigm for leadership. Both groups received job satisfaction by bringing about change, reaching out to others, and creating a nurturing environment. They had been hired by school boards to act as change agents, which was also one of their primary strengths. The second study used the same methodology as the first; in addition, however, it used the Leadership Practices Inventory-Self instrument to measure the extent to which the female superintendents adopted 5 leadership practices and 10 behaviors. Findings indicate that most of the urban and rural superintendents were hired to be change agents. Both groups placed a primary value on human relationships in the organization, and used leadership practices that were characteristic of the new paradigm of transformational  leadership. One table is included. (Contains 30 references.) (LMI)",

This paper was designed to help researchers communicate their knowledge of successful curriculum reform to policymakers and practitioners, in order to influence practice. It focuses on making more effective use of limited resources and presents a prototype communication strategy design based on four essential issues: (1) communications as a tool for sharing fundamental curriculum reform; (2) communications mechanisms; (3) the context of communications; and (4) communications tone, style, and format. The final section describes a prototype communications strategy, from defining objectives to preparing a publication and visual materials. One figure  is included. (LMI)",

        "description":"This paper addresses issues in integrating higher order thinking into the general curriculum. Data are based on a series of telephone interviews conducted in April and May 1992 with six leading thinkers in educational reform. They included: (1) Michael Apple, John Bascom Professor of Curriculum, Instruction, and Educational Policy Studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison; (2) Sharon Johnson, teacher-leader at Horizon High School (Alamo District, Colorado); (3) Gaea Leinhardt, senior scientist at the Learning Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh; (4) Dan Liston, associate professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder; (5) Fred Newmann, professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Wisconsin, Madison; and (6) Ted Sizer, director  of the Coalition of Essential Schools. The participants discussed problems in defining \"higher order thinking\" and policy implications. Two models of higher order thinking were briefly described: the Re:Learning program at Capital High School in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and an innovative program at Horizon High School in Thornton, Colorado. Participants concluded that higher order thinking should be more than just a set of skills and that reform programs should provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge to the real world. Higher order thinking classrooms may not look much different from traditional classrooms. However, reform must change not only procedures, but the depth of conversations in classrooms. Finally, educators must not ignore the issue of replicating inequalities  in the classroom. (LMI)",

The study first focused on schools' management strategies and their impact on the school's management culture. A second focus was on the relationship of the school and its headteacher with external agencies. Data were obtained from two rounds of interviews, conducted first in 1990 and again in 1992, with 48 headteachers at 48 English primary schools. A comparison of the 1992 responses with those of 1990 indicate that headteachers shifted from a collegial management style toward a more directive approach, although collegiality remained the predominant style. In 1990, for example, 60 percent of headteachers used a collegial leadership style; in  1992, 46 percent did so. Second, the schools also shifted from a mediation approach with external agencies to one of compliance with the mandated changes. Schools with more directive management tended to be making substantial changes, and those with more collegial/participative management were more likely to focus on developing their own change strategies.

This report examines the school finance issue and proposes that education funding be tied more closely to systemic reform initiatives. It next describes past trends in school finance and current challenges to traditional education funding sources. Policy implications of these changes are presented, followed by a discussion of possible components of a finance system based on systemic reform. It is recommended that a system of school finance based on systemic reform include the following: a school-based finance structure; a school-controlled budget; school authority over personnel; a school-based information  system; investment in knowledge-development activities; a redesigned system for rewarding and compensating teachers; choice; deregulation; and school-finance equity.

        "description":"In May 1987, the Washington State Legislature passed Chapter 525 Laws of 1987 (Substitute Senate Bill 5479) that authorized the Schools for the 21st Century Program. This report presents information about the progress and results of that program. The State Board of Education selected 33 schools to be awarded 10 additional staff days; supplemental funding; and the opportunity to request waivers from local bargaining contracts, district policies, and state regulations for the purpose of school restructuring. Themes among the participating schools included school-based management and collaboration among teachers, parents, community members, and school administrators. Findings indicate that the program was successful in improving student learning by linking local decision-making in  the educational change process with time, waivers, and resources. Barriers to change included lack of time, resistance to change, and difficulty in developing group consensus. Conclusions are that: (1) with proper incentives, locally-based shared decision-making is the most effective way to develop and implement positive school change; and (2) time for staff collaboration is the single most important ingredient for significant school improvement. One figure is included. Appendices contain the 1992-93 project budgets, lists of approved waivers and project contacts, and a map of project distribution. (LMI)",

In this manual, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction explains how extended services can be implemented at the school level. It identifies and provides an overview of 11 models of service, which fall into the following 3 categories: (1) those that occur during nonschool hours; (2) those that occur during the school day but provide a mechanism for nonschool hours; and (3) those provided during nonschool and traditional hours. The 11 models include the following: accelerated schools; alternative educational programs; before-and-after school programs; the Corner School Development  Program; the Comprehensive School Improvement Management Concept; Family Resource Centers and Youth Services Centers; Parents As Teachers; service learning; Student Services Management Teams; teen parenting and pregnancy prevention; and year-round education.

        "description":"This General Accounting Office (GAO) report addresses the concern raised by Senator Thad Cochran that revising counts of people in poverty (by adjusting the official poverty line for geographic differences in the cost of living) could significantly alter the allocation of federal aid to state and local governments. A concern is that a cost-of-living adjustment in counting people in poverty could divert federal assistance from states that already must make an above-average effort to fund needed public services. The following are problems presented by the proposed cost-of-living adjustment: (1) It raises fairness issues in allocating federal aid; (2) it would improve only one dimension of state funding needs; (3) states differ in the cost of providing services; and (4) states  differ in their ability to fund services for the poor. The report describes how the Chapter 1 program formula is an excellent example of how increased fairness in the allocation process could be achieved. The report concludes that if adjusting poverty counts to reflect differences in the cost of living prove feasible, it would enhance the federal government's ability to target federal assistance to places with the greatest needs. However, such a change should not be implemented in federal allocation formulas without first assessing the impact of the change on the fairness with which federal funding is allocated to states and localities.

At-will employees are employed for an indefinite term; either side may end the employment without the others' consent. At-will employees include all other local school employees who are in neither a certified nor contract position. In North Carolina, employees at will have a number of statutory protections that relate to termination. The interpretive analysis section points out that North Carolina courts have long held that at-will employment may be terminated for no reason or for an arbitrary or irrational reason. However, they have also refused to allow  the discharge of at-will employees for unlawful reasons or reasons that violate public policy.

The third section compares the findings of various studies that have estimated the extent of sexual abuse by teachers and staff. Section 4 examines patterns of staff sexual abuse of students, and section 5  describes school district reporting patterns. Actions taken regarding the staff and students involved are discussed in sections 6 and 7. The eighth section offers suggestions for school-district prevention policies, and the ninth section presents guidelines for handling complaints and investigating charges.

Findings are based on data collection by the National Data Set Project on Residential Services located at the University of Minnesota. The brief uses narrative, tables, and graphs to specifically address the following: historical patterns of deinstitutionalization; the total residential care system; resident characteristics (functional assistance needs, age, secondary conditions); resident movement (patterns, characteristics of movers, previous and  subsequent residences); state institution costs; and state institution closures (past and projected closures, and selected state plans and policies on closure). The continuing commitment of states to the depopulation and closure of state institutions is projected, with continuing challenges in providing adequate resources for community services for those with high support needs. It is predicted that increasing cost inefficiencies of under-utilized state institutions will lead to even more closures of such institutions. (DB)",

Part 2 proposes systematic approaches that states can use to diminish risks and to provide for the healthy development of infants and toddlers in child care, through the following four components of states' child care quality assurance systems: child care regulation, state planned health and safety training, child care monitoring, and data collection on the health and safety status of infants and  toddlers in child care. The report calls for development of mechanisms to ensure that service systems operate in an integrated, coordinated manner.

        "description":"This review analyzes traditional standardized assessment practices to determine if they recognize cultural, linguistic, socioeconomic, and disability differences. It then examines the extent to which these assessment practices are being used in transition for decision-making and predicting post-school outcomes. The review begins with a historical overview of testing. It discusses three types of standardized assessments: norm-referenced, minimum-competency, and criterion-referenced tests. Alternatives to traditional standardized assessments are explored. The review concludes that the failure to consider sociocultural milieu, socioeconomic status, and linguistic and disability differences in test construction leads to false information about the status of learning and compounds  bias in testing. Thus, minorities and students with disabilities, in particular, suffer as a result of traditional assessment practices, which have proven to be inaccurate and inconsistent, yet continue to be used in prediction, decision-making, and inferences about student performance and lifelong success. Current assessment practices stifle the post-school success of minorities and students with disabilities due to their inappropriate norming standards, discrimination, and exclusion. By examining individual student skills on specific tasks, alternative assessments appear to be a solution to eradicating biases. Reasonable and limited use of traditional standardized assessments for the purpose of decision-making, prediction, and inferences about students' post-school activities is  recommended.

        "description":"This paper examines transition from school to post-school activities for students with chronic illness and disabilities, with reference to: four legislative acts that impact transition services, seven legislated implementation mechanisms, seven outcomes areas, and a social system for evaluating services to transitioning youth. Transition legislation addressed includes Public Law 94-142, the Education of All Handicapped Children Act; the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Mechanisms that are incorporated into this legislation to ensure critical transition outcomes include, among others: individualized transition services, inclusion of transition services in  Individualized Education Programs, coordination of school and adult services, and individually determined outcomes. Transition services focus on employment, training and education, financial/economic, recreational, social relationships, independent living, and residential outcomes. A multiple systems approach is recommended for meeting the information, support, and service needs of students and their families. This social systems framework consists of four mutually interactive levels: student and family, program, organization, and community. Two student and family scenarios illustrate the transition process from a social systems perspective. The paper concludes that service professionals and other team members need to function as facilitators or knowledgeable advocates, rather than&quot;experts&quot; in helping individuals with disabilities make decisions for themselves.

Eleven papers focus on evaluation of systems of care, addressing: preliminary findings from several program evaluation studies, systems of care in California, several Robert Wood Johnson projects, a parents' satisfaction survey in Colorado, comprehensive services and prevention, multicultural issues, and innovative neighborhood-based approaches. Five papers discuss the organization, staffing, and financing of systems of care. These papers consider state financing strategies to promote home-based and community-based services, workforce issues related to community-based services, residential treatment programs in Florida, embeddedness and resource transfers between  agencies, and the role of cash subsidies. Program evaluation is the focus of six papers considering issues of children's in-home psychiatric emergency services, family reconciliation services, a home-based mentor program, community-based programs, qualitative evaluation of community-based prevention programs, and multisystemic treatment with adolescent offenders and substance abusers. Eight papers look at the role of education in systems of care. These papers discuss: the school-based wraparound approach, three demonstration projects in Texas, a primary prevention and early intervention demonstration project, attitudes of teachers and students toward mainstreaming, and attitudes of parents toward collaborative educational teams. The final section presents five papers on child  welfare/foster care systems. They address: factors influencing appropriate placement, treatment foster family care, an individualized system of care and juvenile delinquency, the use of aggregated progress indicators to evaluate treatment foster care, and integrating research into practice in a public welfare agency.

Definition development involved identifying characteristics of the population and analyzing responses to a survey of 810 deaf educators and deafness rehabilitation counselors.

The competency-based program was designed to address the developmental needs of practitioners, from foundational skills to advanced practice competencies. The program allowed therapists who were working to remain in the provider pool while enhancing their skills. Participants collaborated with project faculty and clinical supervisors in developing individualized learning contracts. Foundational Level therapists enrolled in a lecture series and completed an extensive supervised practicum. Training at the Enrichment Level  included completion of a continuing education program involving didactic sessions and videotape case analyses. Advanced Level training addressed highly specialized competencies that required practicum experiences supervised by qualified practitioners. Follow-up activities for participating therapists included seminar meetings emphasizing faculty and peer review. Appendices contain competency statements; a parent advisory committee report; the Individual Learning Plan; various evaluation forms; a reprint of an article by Mary C. Lawlor and Elizabeth A. Cada titled &quot;Partnerships between Therapists, Parents, and Children&quot;; and results of a survey of 276 occupational and physical therapists in Illinois. A participant's guide titled &quot;Forming Partnerships with Families&quot; is also provided. It  includes information and exercises for a self-paced, video-based course dealing with the family, interpersonal relationships, the multidiscilinary conference meeting, and development of the Individualized Family Service Plan. The participant's guide is accompanied by three videotape recordings. (Contains 19 references.) (JDD)",

System-level interagency collaboration involves joint planning, joint implementation, and joint evaluation between individuals or organizations in order to provide services for children and their families. Interagency collaboration is mandated by federal legislation as the most cost effective and efficient manner in which to provide appropriate services. To ensure the effectiveness of interagency collaboration, it is essential to understand each agency's philosophy, how services are provided, and the regulations under which each agency operates. Joint  ownership and responsibility can be accomplished by requiring that all participants contribute an appropriate share of the resources needed while considering the constraints, requirements, and discretionary authority of each participating agency. Once agencies have determined a need to collaborate, team members must designate a plan with reasonable expectations for success. During the implementation phase, communication among agencies must persist. The education administrator's role is to act as the catalyst and supporter for interagency collaboration. The education system should be the catalyst as it provides a direct link to the child and the child's family and is mandated to have zero rejects. (Contains 10 references.) (JDD)",

The chapter examines what is meant by &quot;inclusion&quot;; outlines benefits of inclusive programs for students with disabilities, typical students, and school staff; and notes potential pitfalls. Six steps in implementing inclusive aprograms are discussed: (1) form a representative planning group; (2) engage in consensual&quot;visionizing&quot;; (3) assess needs and determine priorities; (4) form school-level planning teams; (5) form individual student planning teams; and (6) implement recommended changes. Techniques are presented for addressing challenges that schools face during the implementation of inclusion. These challenges concern modifications in school organization, identifying and providing supports, modifications in teachers' roles, meaningful participation, inclusion across different age groups, community-based instructional programs, and integration of related services. The final section discusses how inclusive programs can be evaluated. Appendices list six videotapes on inclusion and other materials available from the Virginia Statewide Systems Change Project.

The transition plan includes the following phases: (1) make decision regarding kindergarten placement; (2) develop a preplacement plan which includes a visitation to the preschool program by kindergarten staff; and (3) implement supported transition. Key components of the plan include: empowering the general education teacher with knowledge and skills in dealing with the student with special needs; increased communication among educators, parents, and administrators; provision of services by a member of the preschool staff who acts as a transition technician with the student's general education teacher and the student in the kindergarten classroom;  and a scheduled timeline of services. The plan was designed for a rural school setting but could be utilized in an urban setting with minimal adaptations. The plan utilizes the skills of an educator, speech/language pathologist, teaching assistant, and occupational therapist. Six recommendations for program implementation are offered.

        "description":"Assessment in early childhood special education should go beyond diagnosis of the child in isolation and include evaluation of the child using an ecological perspective. The ecological perspective assesses interactions of the child with significant people in the environment such as parents and teachers. Three aspects of ecological early childhood assessment include: family interviews, adult-child learning styles, and parent-child interactions. Family interviews identify family resources, needs, strengths, and concerns. Interview techniques include the use of semistructured questions and the sharing of family stories. Interviewing skills such as effective listening are critical to the success of the interview method. Evaluation of learning styles is also important, as children's  learning and performance at a very young age are affected by whether they are visual, auditorial, or kinesthetic learners. Effective therapists and teachers vary their techniques in response to the learner's style. Parent-child interactions should also be assessed, with the objective of increasing positive interchanges. Parent participation in a training program can help them develop a clearer understanding of child development and how their interactions affect it and can improve the parent/child relationship, thereby building the child's self-esteem.

Treatment generally involves neuroleptic medication. Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, learning disabilities, neuropsychological anomalies, school adjustment problems, and behavior or conduct disorders are often associated with Tourette Syndrome. Milestones unique to the course of Tourette Syndrome may include parents' realization that something is unusual about their child's behavior, a referral to a school psychologist, an official diagnosis, and subsequent parental involvement with a support group. The role of the school  psychologist involves evaluation, case manager, counselor or therapist, and advocacy. School psychologists are in a unique position to be prime facilitators and advocates in promoting self-esteem, encouraging school achievement, and supporting warm family relationships and peer socializations.

        "description":"Special education is experiencing the effects of educational reform. Examples include rethinking of service delivery, collaborative versus authoritarian leadership, teambuilding and inclusionary practices replace exclusionary practices, and diversity issues. These changes are creating ethical and moral dilemmas for school administrators. In forming moral judgements, two voices are distinguishable: the voice of care, connection, protection from harm, and response; and the voice of justice, equality, reciprocity, and rights. Women tend to choose a care orientation while men tend to choose a justice orientation. The competence of caring and intuition has just as much importance as that of justice, and needs to be assimilated into the leadership and organizational theories for  educational administration. This approach can be applied to special education service delivery and administrative practice through consideration of such issues as placement of minority students, services to individuals with disabilities as well as their caregivers, shared educational responsibility, participatory opportunities for parents, and the impact of Outcome Based Education.

A 3-month multiple channel public relations campaign was designed and implemented to train high school teachers in the identification and referral process. The campaign aimed to increase teachers' awareness of communication disorders in adolescents, the availability of services for these students, and the teacher's role in the identification process. Analysis revealed that, following the campaign, the frequency and appropriateness of referrals for speech language services were increased. Providing information to teachers via inservice training proved to be the most potent aspect of the public  relations campaign. Classroom observations of referred students formed a basis for increased collaboration between the speech language pathologist and high school teachers. Appendices include a teacher questionnaire, classroom observation form, a pre-evaluation flow chart, a pragmatic skills checklist, and sample newsletters. (Contains 37 references.) (Author/DB)",

It also aimed to promote more social interaction between students with impaired hearing and those with normal hearing and to effect a more comfortable transition from a special school to the mainstream school for hearing-impaired students. Inservice training was provided for teachers and normal hearing students concerning hearing loss and its communication correlates. In addition, parent support meetings were held, hearing \"buddies\" were provided for each hearing-impaired student, and a weekly pragmatics group was held for hearing-impaired students to allow them to practice the appropriate use of social language. Improvement was  measured in pre- and post-tests administered to the normal-hearing students and their teachers. Although practicum goals were not achieved, social interactions between hearing-impaired and other students increased by 14 percent over initial observation. Appendices include student and teacher questionnaires, various forms used, and summaries of the three pragmatics groups. (Contains 27 references.) (Author/DB)",

A lack of studies of facilitated communication in natural settings is noted. Examples are given of individuals who, with the aid of facilitated communication, communicated information the facilitator could not have known. A current study comparing communication about weekend happenings with later parental reports notes a 66 percent rate of accuracy by students using facilitated  communication (compared to 100 percent accuracy by verbal peers).

Teachers had the opportunity to attend weekly staff development meetings which focused on such topics as multicultural education, integration of computer-assisted instruction within the curriculum, working with parents, counseling goals,  English as a Second Language (ESL), behavior management, and infusion of career education. The Project sought to establish an active parental component by offering career conferences, open school days/evenings, and adult ESL. The Project met most of its objectives.

The speaker concludes that inclusion programs can work (as in districts in California, Kentucky, New York, and Vermont) but take tremendous effort and considerable resources. The advice given by many educators and parents to districts attempting such programs to &quot;go slow,&quot; is noted. Educational reform and inclusion programs are seen as having a reciprocal relationship. Key conditions for successful inclusion programs are identified. These include: (1) a collaborative learning environment; (2) natural proportions of students with disabilities in their local education setting; (3) adequate  support--including large numbers of aides and training--for classroom teachers, and (4) a philosophical reorientation, from defining special education as a place to defining special education as a service. General support of inclusion by teachers and parents (of both disabled and nondisabled students) is noted. Concerns are raised regarding the appropriateness of inclusion for students with severe emotional disturbances or with learning disabilities requiring a highly focused learning environment. Major questions still unanswered concern funding, access, equity, and the federal role. (DB)",

        "description":"This 3-year study examined how primary grade teachers and their teacher assistants taught reading and the language arts to a boy with multiple disabilities in inclusive classrooms. Qualitative research strategies are used to describe and explain the boy's participation in literacy activities from kindergarten through second grade. Findings are presented chronologically by the boy's grade placements, from kindergarten through second grade. Analyses revealed the following: (1) inclusion is a learning opportunity that enables teachers to improve their understanding of teaching and learning; (2) inclusion sensitized teachers to the needs of children in their classrooms; (3) other children benefited from the boy's inclusion in their classrooms because they learned to accept academic  and physical differences as part of everyday life; (4) special children can be as socially and academically isolated in a regular classroom as they are when in separate facilities or programs, as not all regular classroom teachers willingly assume academic and social responsibility for special needs children in their rooms; (5) teacher assistants had a tremendous influence on the success of the boy's inclusion by accelerating or impeding his progress; and (6) successful inclusion requires teachers to creatively plan learning activities for disabled children that parallel the literacy task demands of other children.

Inclusion, as a policy and as a practice, is reducing the physical and social isolation encountered by individuals and families, broadening expectations, reducing limits, and expanding choices. Technology and inclusion go hand in hand. Without technology supports and accommodations, many students cannot take full advantage of education. Without the opportunities for interaction found in inclusive settings, students cannot truly demonstrate their abilities. The following areas should be analyzed to determine whether technology support has the potential to facilitate the child's participation: (1) transportation  to and from school and related events; (2) physical access; (3) classroom/library equipment and modifications; (4) shop/vocational education; (5) lunchroom; (6) playground/gym; (7) evaluation/assessment; (8) curriculum; (9) Individualized Education Program or Individualized Family Service Plan; (10) training; and (11) planning and policy.

Twenty-three tables present data on: number of students in general education and special education in each state; types of participation and exit data collected; state assessments of outcomes; inclusion of students with disabilities in data collection; barriers to outcome assessment and state needs for outcomes assessment; state practices, programs, and plans; and nontraditional state assessments. For each state, text sections describe activities in selected outcomes areas, including academic achievement, post-school status, vocational skills,  functional living, and attitudes and aspirations. Findings indicate that, while states continue to focus on participation and exit data for students with disabilities, the following trends include: states are attempting to produce better information on the numbers of students with disabilities taking part in statewide assessments; guidelines on acceptable testing accommodations and adaptations are being advanced by state assessment programs; and states implementing nontraditional forms of assessment seem to retain the same approach to including students with disabilities and making accommodations as in their traditional assessments.

        "description":"Students with disabilities have been excluded to an unreasonable extent from large-scale assessment programs at the national, state, and local levels. One implication of this exclusion practice is that students who are left out of assessments tend not to be considered during reform efforts. Another implication is that estimates of performance are not comparable among states because of differential participation rates. Many factors underlie the exclusion of students with disabilities from large-scale assessments, including: (1) the use of vague guidelines, (2) the differential implementation of guidelines, (3) failure to monitor the assessment, (4) sampling plans that systematically exclude students, (5) unwillingness to make accommodations in assessment procedures and materials,  and (6) an altruistic motivation to lessen the emotional distress of students not expected to perform well. Recommendations are proposed for large-scale assessment programs to include students with disabilities, to make accommodations and adaptations, and to monitor how well the intent of the guidelines is followed.

        "description":"By setting academic standards, America takes its first critical step toward providing a plan that will create an excellent educational system for the 21st century. It is important for those working on standards and those educating students with disabilities to work together as standards are being developed. Four kinds of standards need to be understood in order to address ways of including students with disabilities. These include content standards, performance standards, opportunity-to-learn standards, and assessment standards. Issues in setting appropriate standards for all students include: (1) educators will focus only on teaching the standards; (2) consensus cannot be reached on what the standards should be; and (3) it is unfair to hold everyone to the same standards because  some students start way ahead of others. Criteria are listed that indicate what should be included in standards that are developed by states applying for funds to support education reform through the Goals 2000 Educate America Act. Three approaches designed to include students with disabilities in later phases of standards-related reform are described, with the merits and limitations of each. These approaches include individualized education program-based standards, standards for group gains, and separate standards. Policy and practice recommendations are then offered for content standards and performance standards. (JDD)",

In the colloquia, mothers were exposed to issues concerning affective development using the taxonomy of Benjamin Bloom. Interactions between mothers and their children were observed during social activities and in home visits. Program evaluation indicated program success as indicated by high attendance of mothers at the colloquia and other meetings, observed improvements in affective skills, a gain in knowledge of  factors that alter children's behavior, and a reduction in the recorded number of incidents of antisocial behavior by the children.

The combined classroom model involves two normal size classrooms made into one, three teachers (a general education teacher, a resource teacher, and a teacher of students with E/BD) as well as three paraprofessionals. The students include about 20 students without disabilities, about 10 students with learning disabilities, and no more than 10 students with E/BD. The program involves an integrated behavior management system involving a level system varying in degree of structure, an impulse controls sequence, and monthly  meetings of a support team which includes additional resource professionals and service providers. Program evaluation by parents (of students with and without emotional disabilities) has been highly positive. Students without emotional disabilities also expressed positive feelings about the combo class. The students with E/BD agreed that they were learning more though they tended to feel the behavior management system was unfair and only half would choose the combo class next year. Tables detailing evaluation results are attached. Transcripts of parent and student comments are also attached. (DB)",

The rating scale is based on the conceptual model proposed by the National Center on Education Outcomes and asks for judgments on the feasibility and relevance of potential indicators for objectives in each of the model's eight domains: (1) presence and participation; (2) accommodation and adaption; (3) physical health; (4) responsibility and independence; (5) contribution and citizenship; (6) academic and functional literacy; (7) personal and social adjustment; and (8) satisfaction. Results of giving the survey to 102 respondents are summarized for each outcome and objective.

The promise of earlier detection, diagnosis, and habilitation of hearing loss is within reach if: (1) there is appropriate understanding of the magnitude and consequences of the problem; (2) information based on past efforts is utilized; (3) there is the ability to evaluate and use emerging technologies appropriately; and (4) collaborative uses of resources and agencies already in place are developed. Appended material includes a public awareness hand-out, a time-line on early identification of hearing loss, a summary of  studies on the incidence of hearing impairment in high-risk infants, a draft position statement on universal hearing screening of the Directors of Speech and Hearing Programs in State Health and Welfare Agencies, and suggestions for community/professional advocacy for early identification of hearing loss.

An extensive review of the literature provides a history of special education, mainstreaming, reverse integration, and the inclusive schools movement. The study included a survey of 30 teachers and 10 aides from the special school concerning the proposed reverse integration/inclusion effort. Results indicated that most faculty and staff had a negative opinion of the school climate following program implementation, would prefer to work with only special education students, and felt that the regular school population is noisy, rude, and disruptive and provides poor role  models. Respondents felt that inclusion/integration was initiated to keep the school open without regard to teacher/staff opinion, student needs, or space considerations. However, 85 percent of respondents did feel that inclusion/integration could be successful. The Phelps School Climate Survey Questionnaire and this study's specific responses are attached.

These groups recommend the development of personnel standards for: (1) regular early childhood educators; (2) early childhood special educators; and (3) related services professionals. Specific philosophical assumptions are recommended to serve as the foundation for development of such personnel standards. Development of a structure for certification standards is also urged. Such development should be  based on the inclusion of early childhood specialists on state agencies responsible for credentialling and certification, that standards be developed which are separate from existing general education or special education certifications, and that these standards apply to personnel serving children in the birth-to-eight range. Principles for developing certification standards should include the importance of graduate level training, and the value of outcome-based, not course-based, credentialling standards. (DB)",

In the second paper, &quot;Education of Gifted and Talented Students in China, Taiwan, and Japan,&quot; Harold W. Stevenson et al. report on studies of children's academic achievement in East Asia over the past 11 years and analyze those Asian nations' policies and practices for educating high-ability  students. In the third paper, &quot;State Policy Issues in the Education of Gifted and Talented Students,&quot; Patricia Bruce Mitchell examines current state policies, regulations, and legislation concerning education programs for gifted and talented students. She also discusses state policies which influence the nature and scope of gifted programming and considers implications of recent school restructuring efforts. James Gallagher, in &quot;Current and Historical Thinking on Education for Gifted and Talented Students,&quot; describes how early cultures addressed or failed to address the needs of gifted children and contends that our society has traditionally had ambivalent feelings toward gifted children. He offers several definitions of giftedness and evaluates various educational methods with this  population. In the final paper, &quot;American Culture and the Gifted,&quot; Daniel P. Resnick and Madeline Goodman examine the role that the American culture and political beliefs have played in shaping the educational system. They suggest that forces outside the classroom (such as anti-intellectual attitudes) may account for more of the success or failure of programs for the gifted than previously thought.

It reports on studies over the past 11 years of East Asian children's academic achievement. In the first section, the report looks at governmental policies and practices concerning the education of three types of students: (1) those who display high levels of intelligence, (2) those who are talented in the arts, and (3) those who are high academic achievers. Special programs both in and out of school are described. In the second part, the report describes the characteristics of students who have participated in the authors' studies and compares their  performance and personal characteristics with those of American peers. Discussion focuses on students who demonstrate high levels of cognitive ability and on students who display exceptional ability in mathematics. The paper notes that programs for gifted and talented children in East Asia are new; the majority, especially in China and Taiwan, established only during the last decade. Japan supports no programs specifically for gifted students prior to the high school level. There is a greater emphasis of East Asian cultures on effort, rather than ability.

Recent policies to restructure education are considered in the context of their effects on programs for gifted and talented students. Specific principles are recommended for shaping the reform agenda in the areas of curriculum and instruction, accountability, and governance. For each principle, examples of actions and potential impact on gifted and talented students are  discussed. In addition, approaches taken by states to the following traditional issues are considered: (1) whether gifted and talented education policies should be linked with special education policies; (2) how the state should define and demarcate the gifted and talented population; (3) whether the state should mandate services for gifted and talented students; and (4) how the state can provide fiscal incentives to districts for gifted and talented education programs.

        "description":"This paper, commissioned for the development of the national report, \"National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent,\" provides historical background on issues in gifted education, together with ideas and practices from the special educational strategies now in use for gifted students. The report focuses on the nature of superior intelligence, the general school adaptations for these children, current and unresolved issues in the education of the gifted, and specific policy issues in gifted education. Historical information describing how early cultures addressed or failed to address the needs of gifted children is offered. A major problem is seen to be the ambivalent feelings toward gifted children traditionally seen in the American society. Various definitions of  giftedness are discussed, as are traits that characterize gifted children. Specific current issues addressed include the following: (1) educational reform; (2) creativity; (3) underserved populations (cultural differences, gifted girls, and gifted students with disabilities); (4) accountability; and (5) equity versus excellence. Future research is urged in such areas as understanding intellectual processes, assessing educational strategies for gifted students, and information processing. A table summarizes federal policy and legislation regarding the gifted since 1958. (Contains 95 references.) (DB)",

        "description":"This paper, commissioned for the development of the national report, \"National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent,\" examines the relationship between American culture and efforts to educate gifted and talented students. The paper presents a historical overview of the cultural forces that have affected public policy, reviews the conflict between equality and intellect, and examines public education's attempts to educate gifted students. A lack of respect for achievement, effort, and merit in American schools and culture is noted. The ideas of de Toqueville, Locke, Binet, and Terman are cited to help explain the cultural forces influencing the education of gifted children. Three challenges for American policy makers are identified: (1) the need to make American  culture supportive of efforts to develop the talents of young people; (2) the need to reform schools so that the needs of students who have \"a curiosity and taste for achievement\" are challenged and a less restrictive view of talent is adopted; and (3) the need to make able students \"visible pace-setters within their schools\" and to make schools more challenging for a broader spectrum of students.

        "description":"This paper reviews research relevant to the adjustment of adults with learning disabilities (LD) in the areas of academic, occupation/vocational, social, and personal/emotional functioning. After an introduction, methodological concerns are raised in the areas of sampling, definitions, experimental designs, and instrumentation. The review concludes that LD adults have increased difficulties in all areas of functioning. However, the literature also indicates that, with accommodation, intervention, and adaptation, the LD adult can demonstrate high levels of functioning. Although early intervention is suggested for maximizing later adaptive functioning, it is most commonly provided only in the academic area. While accommodations are seen to aid functioning in the workplace and at  the postsecondary academic level, the lack of attention and remediation in the area of social and personal/emotional functioning is decried.

        "description":"A 3-month practicum utilized teacher workshops and biweekly consultation to provide all fourth grade teachers (N=11) in a public school district with higher level questioning strategies to meet gifted students' cognitive needs. A total of six fourth grade students were identified as gifted and talented. At the workshops, higher level questioning strategies, based on Bloom's Taxonomy and Hilda Taba's Concept Development and Interpretation of Data, were modeled. Teachers used these strategies in their daily questioning routines. Strategy implementation was individually addressed in biweekly consultations. Analysis of pre-post samples of questioning strategies indicated that teachers were using the strategies and that questions were of a significantly higher level. However, an  attitude survey of teachers indicated that teachers continued to feel unsure about their ability to meet the needs of these students in the regular classroom and desired additional support. Students achieved a 7.27 percent improvement on the Ross Test of Higher Cognitive Processes. Appendices include the teacher attitude survey, question/statement components classified according to Bloom's taxonomy, results of analysis of teachers pre-post question samples based on Bloom's taxonomy, sample pre-post questions, and results of the pre-post cognitive test given to students.

Content analysis of each state's documents focused on six major areas: (1) legislation, (2) definitions of &quot;gifted,&quot; (3) standard identification practices, (4) nonstandard identification practices, (5) due process and grievance procedures, and (6) specific references to gifted students from special populations. The analysis revealed that a range of attention is being given to these special populations and that state policies tend to be permissive and inclusive regarding identification and services. Some states have developed communication, recruitment, and  child-find strategies to increase public awareness. Forty-three states have screening policies to locate gifted students. Formal identification strategies often rely on the use of multiple criteria. In their identification processes, 46 states incorporate outside-of-school activities; 43 include measures of creativity; and many states permit input from teachers, parents, students, and others. Forty states specifically mention culturally diverse gifted students, and 40 mention economically disadvantaged children. Students with learning disabilities are addressed by 40 states, and students with sensory and physical disabilities are mentioned by 36 states. Appended are the content analysis matrix and guidelines. (DB)",

Specifically, the study looked for evidence of language transfer in bilingual acquisition and the direction of that transfer (Spanish to English, English to Spanish). Over 5 months, spontaneous speech (55 samples) was recorded in several natural settings (school, home, and restaurant) and an imitation task method was used to elicit additional language samples (n=100). The syntactic structures studied were negative-verb sequence, &quot;do&quot; inclusion in the verb form, and sentence subject omission. These data were also compared with data from a previous study of monolinguals and bilinguals of the same age. Results indicate that in the case of the  first two structures examined, the child had internalized the rules of Spanish negation well enough to influence the use of Spanish negative structures in her English constructions. In the case of sentence subject omission, findings did not indicate a Spanish influence, but rather that she had acquired enough English rules on sentence subject inclusion to influence her use of this structure in both Spanish and English, suggesting a two-way transfer effect.

The program originated with the author, who as a parent volunteer had been teaching Spanish to her child's class. First, a brief account is given of the history of foreign languages in the elementary school (FLES) and of currently used low-cost FLES methods. In the Madison School District, parent desire for a foreign language program was strong despite minimal financial resources and lack of appropriate instructional materials. In the middle school in question, the seventh- and eighth-grade Spanish teacher agreed to write 20 fifth- and sixth-grade lessons leading into the later curriculum, and parent volunteers were recruited through the school  newspaper and parent-teacher association. Each volunteer received instruction on lesson presentation from the author and the Spanish teacher. Volunteers were found to be conscientious and committed, and the program became an opportunity for friendships and parent involvement. Challenges to be met included support of administration, teachers, and parents; parent preferences and conflicts; a malfunctioning copy machine; and a major cultural project--a school fiesta.

It is proposed that what really happens as a student learns can be understood better by applying the concept of task to classroom processes. The ways in which task has been defined by educators are reviewed, and it is concluded that the term reflects three aspects of student work: product; conditions (time, classroom environment, task complexity, student grouping, cooperative learning methodology); and operations (memory, application of principles or formulas, comprehension, opinion). Each of these three aspects is examined further, and the influence of student perceptions on each is discussed. The influence of task type (involving discourse; open/closed;  one-way/two-way exchange of information) is also considered. A plan for designing classroom instruction involving five stages is proposed. The stages include: identification of a target task relevant to the whole group; establishing the roles of learners and teachers; selecting input and identifying related skills; creating a pedagogic task; and identifying the desired product. Evaluation of classroom tasks by both students and teachers is also seen as an important element of effective instruction. Contains 102 references. (MSE)",

        "description":"This article describes a paired storytelling technique that can be used in bilingual and English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) classrooms to help motivate students to maximize reading comprehension. The technique involves having the students: (1) pair off; (2) discuss the story theme; (3) read half of the story; (4) take notes on their half of the story; (5) exchange the story notes with each other; (6) write about the part of the story they have not read, based on their partner's notes; (7) read their own versions of the story to each other; (8) read the part of the story they have not read; (9) discuss the whole story; and (10) take a test on the story. This storytelling strategy provides opportunities for one-on-one interaction among students around school tasks and gives them  opportunity to use the target language communicatively. The cooperative work improves group relations, increases self-esteem, and increases vocabulary acquisition. (MDM)",

The project offered a challenging curriculum designed to develop both groups' proficiency in English and Chinese, providing the participants with a program of bilingual education that used language development and enrichment activities within a framework of whole language methodology as well as cooperative learning. The project  encouraged parent involvement and provided staff development workshops. An evaluation of the project found that it met all its pre-kindergarten objectives for social and academic development, content areas, arts, health and physical education, and multicultural awareness. The project met its objectives for English as a Second Language, Chinese language arts, staff development, and parental involvement. The project did not meet its dual language objectives for kindergarten or first grade.

From the Oyster School perspective, the educational problems that language minority students face are due to discrimination by mainstream American education and society. A major goal of the Oyster program is to provide a setting whereby language minority students can maintain their native language and culture and achieve academically. The program functions as a language plan within an identity plan that aims to provide equal  educational opportunities to its linguistically and culturally diverse student population. (MDM)",

The paper describes the speech of students and the teacher during different segments of the school day, and presents an analysis of 290 speech acts transcribed during observations of circle time, math time, and free time activities. The speech acts were categorized by communicative function, based on Saville-Troike's six categories: (1) directive; (2) expressive; (3) metalinguistic; (4) phatic; (5) poetic; and (6) referential. The study found that members of the class were most likely to engage in directive communication or to communicate factual information to one another. They  were less likely to use speech as a means of personal expression, to show group solidarity, or simply as language play. (MDM)",

Government language planning until recently has sought to unify the diverse nation through Hispanicization and acculturation into the mainstream Spanish-based culture. During the last several decades, Indian organizations have sought to promote indigenous languages and the maintenance of Indian culture through bilingual and bicultural schools and programs controlled by the Indians themselves. Several of the education programs are  examined. During the 1980s the government recognized bilingual education, largely due to the increasing political influence of Indian groups. (MDM)",

Both groups had varying degrees of exposure to English. Data for the first group were gathered through an audiotaped conversational interview, while data for the second group were gathered through a task-based elicitation procedure. The tasks included picture recognition, story completion, informal interview, picture sequencing, picture differences, and peer meeting. The results indicated that tasks were more efficient than  interviews in eliciting targeted morpho-syntactic structures with child speakers of ESL and that the tasks were successful in targeting the structures for which they were designed.

Thirty-two third- through sixth-graders in a Spanish immersion program participated in the study. Data were collected through: (1) interviews; (2) student questionnaires that covered pupils' abilities, attitudes, and preferences with regard to thinking in Spanish; (3) classroom observations; and (4) background information such as school grades, achievement test scores, and extracurricular exposure to Spanish. The findings revealed that English seemed at times to play a more prominent role in the students' internal language environment than did Spanish. In responding to  word problems in math, fifth- and sixth-graders reported favoring English in their cognitive processing and were also observed to be doing so. They would read the problem in Spanish but would shift to English immediately or as soon as they had some conceptual difficulty. (Contains 18 references.) (MDM)",

Eight fifth- and sixth-graders with varying levels of Spanish proficiency participated in the study. Data were collected through student verbal reports, questionnaire-based interviews, classroom observations, and background information such as school grades and achievement test scores. The study found that although students used Spanish when talking to the teacher in teacher-fronted classrooms situations, they were unlikely to use Spanish when talking to fellow students, unless the students were working on an academic task. Learners were able to understand written and verbal instructions in Spanish, especially if these instructions were over material easily  grasped. However, learners had more difficulty understanding instructions in Spanish if the material was new or difficult for any reason. (Contains 41 references.) (MDM)",

        "description":"A study investigated the interaction of cognitive, cultural, and linguistic factors in second-language concept formation in adults. Specifically, it examined how seven college students in a lower-division intensive Spanish class developed new gender concepts when learning a second language. Course instruction focused on concept construction at linguistic, cultural, and abstract levels. In recorded individual interviews with the instructor, the students performed two problem-solving tasks: (1) defining three nouns denoting specific gender cases for animates in Spanish; and (2) writing three complete sentences to accomplish a specific task in a restaurant. Immediately after completing each task, the students were asked to explain why a particular linguistic form they used in  written work was correct or incorrect, focusing on gender markers. The text of one interview is presented here. Analysis of the interviews suggests that there is an interaction between cognitive, cultural, and linguistic factors affecting concept construction in second language learning situations, but also idiosyncratic, individual learning approaches and strategies and incorporate elements from the learner's own cultural history. Less advanced learners showed only implicit intralinguistic knowledge, with no understanding of the relationship between intralinguistic and extralinguistic-cultural knowledge. (MSE)",

Initially, the children were Spanish-dominant; all had one native English-speaking parent; all were learning English easily. The followup study involved parent interviews and observations of the children interacting together and with others outside school. It focused on the children's use of Spanish and English in their daily lives and their expressed attitudes toward the languages. In the first phase of the study, the power of English was symbolized in the power of English-speaking superheroes appearing in the children's dramatic play, but English was used only in interactions related to superheroes or role-playing. Three years  later, the children spoke no Spanish spontaneously with each other or their parents, were reluctant to use Spanish even when pressed to do so, and were limited in their abilities to express themselves in Spanish. It is concluded that all three children reversed their language dominance over three years, and while broad generalizations are not possible in the three cases, the children appear to actively construct their own uses of and attitudes toward the two languages from complex influences.

It is noted that stories, both folk tales and personal experience stories, are the original teaching materials. The text of a jump story is included. Songs helpful in language teaching include didactic, pop, and folk songs. A song-leading  lesson plan is presented. Folk speech (riddles and jokes, proverbs and slang, rhymes and wordplay) activities are suggested, including exercises in collecting, sharing, and completing language forms. A split-proverb exercise is detailed. Finally, possible classroom activities using folklore for development of each language skill (listening, speaking, reading, writing) and creativity are listed.

The program consists of two sixth- and two seventh-grade classrooms that use computers and cooperative learning techniques to enhance learning. The evaluation of the MacMagic Program sought, among other objectives, to assess the program's utility as a vehicle to enhance the learning of English as a Second Language (ESL) among the program's multilingual students. The evaluation consisted of classroom observations, administration of the Language Assessment Scale test to students, and comparisons of 22 ESL MacMagic students with 22 similar students in the  regular ESL program at the school. Overall, it found that students expressed positive opinions about the MacMagic program and enjoyed working with computers. Comparisons between MacMagic and regular ESL students found no significant differences in test scores, absenteeism, and English language proficiency. The amount of social interaction between ESL students and native English speakers was higher in the MacMagic Program than in the regular ESL program. Recommendations for program improvement are presented. (Contains 102 references.) (MDM)",

The content can be viewed in two ways: (1) literature in the form of rock music (poems set to music or lyrics that are new versions of previous literary works), or (2) rock lyrics as poems in their own right. It is proposed that interpreting rock lyrics in class can be a significant opportunity to exchange views, discover how much members of the class community have in common, and learn how others view the  world.

In the partial immersion format, at least half the courses are taught in Japanese. Courses in the first year emphasize the learning process. In the second year they focus on improving learning processes, and in the third year on the sociocultural context of learning. The six curriculum components are: foundation subjects; second language teacher development; second language teaching methodology; curriculum subjects; second language enhancement subjects; and practicum and study in Japan. In each year, the components take on the particular focus of  that year's instruction. The program recruits top students from high school graduating classes for the 22 student places available. The first cohort began the program in February 1993. Even in its early stages, the program has given evidence of success in terms of students' Japanese linguistic proficiency and teaching skills. It is seen as a promising means for improving second language teaching in Australia and supporting the national policy of extensive elementary and secondary school second language instruction.

        "description":"A study investigated the interpersonal dynamics occurring in an ungraded bilingual education class of native Spanish-speaking students in an ungraded primary classroom (with 10-12 students each from grades one, two, and three) at Garamond Elementary School in a working class community southeast of Los Angeles, California. Six classroom sessions were taped for discourse analysis focusing on the language patterns used by students and the ways students positioned themselves through language in relation to each other. One session was conducted entirely by students. Data were also drawn from observation, student and teacher interviews, and written work spanning six months. Analysis of the data suggest two common patterns of verbal expression: (1) a direct, argumentative form in which  individuals overtly position themselves, in relation to other students, as for or against particular arguments; and (2) introduction of new ideas into discussion without argumentative positioning, often in the forms of helpful suggestions or comments. The class session conducted by students, late in the year, illustrates these two dynamics and the fact that the students have internalized a basic framework for argumentation. Similar patterns also appeared in teacher-led classes and were influenced by the teacher's participation. It is proposed that such interactions are influential in helping students organize thinking and use language in specific ways, and can influence literacy development and self-expression.

The program, emerging from a national curriculum reform effort, begins English instruction when students are eight years old, three years earlier than previously. Students are already bilingual in Spanish and Basque, both official languages, and some feel that because the two languages are not related, students experience some confusion in learning both. Addition of a third, also unrelated language is seen as a special challenge in this area. At the program's inception in 1992, the University of the Basque Country was designated as the coordinating institution. Teachers were trained in English language instruction in the United Kingdom and had regular meetings  for discussing instructional issues and exchanging ideas. An activity-based and thematic syllabus evolved from this process. Program coordinators observed classrooms several times a year. A formative evaluation used observation, an attitude survey of teachers, parents, and administrators, a teacher survey, and English language testing. Results suggest the program fostered a favorable attitude toward English language teaching, highlight the important role of the teacher, and provided a significant opportunity for teacher development. Areas for improvement were also identified. A bibliography is included. (MSE)",

Data were gathered in home and classroom visits, in formal and semi-structured interviews, and from samples of the child's writing and drawing. Field notes were analyzed for patterns and strategies used in written and oral English. Audio recordings were reviewed for literacy events. Interviews were reviewed for evidence of parent and teacher expectations and concerns. Writing and drawing samples were examined for understanding of the child's attempts at English writing. Data were categorized as expectations, strategies, and English literacy skills. Analyses  are presented in this report. Results support the theory that children learn a second language through many authentic, purposeful, and meaningful language experiences, and that the child's understanding and use of a second language are influenced by their unique cultural characteristics and through varied social interaction with significant others. It was found that teacher and parent expectations and beliefs were dissonant, and suggested that clear and direct communication of educational goals from the outset would better serve the child's language development.

Results indicate the teachers perceived the process-oriented strategies as most important for teaching LEP students, in contrast to earlier studies that suggest process-oriented writing strategies are little used in the English-as-a-Second-Language classroom.

An overview of the differentiated curriculum is offered, and issues that must be addressed in meeting the needs of the GT/LEP student are discussed. Teaching strategies and methods that can be used in GT/LEP instruction, and recommended teacher characteristics, are also outlined. It is concluded that although no specific pre-packaged curriculum can be recommended to meet the needs of GT/LEP students, the criteria discussed here should be used in developing instructional strategies for this population. The curriculum, when extended using the criteria recommended here, is seen as providing the  necessary foundation for both cognitive and linguistic development. (Author/MSE)",

Bilingual education teachers, special education teachers, specialists in speech pathology and English as a Second Language, and principals collaborated to construct their own programs in one elementary school and one junior high school. The program was studied by ethnographic methods. Its evolution is described chronologically, and its results are discussed in terms of four general collaboration competency areas needed by educators serving culturally and/or linguistically diverse students. These competencies are: understanding one's own perspective; use of effective interpersonal, communication, and problem-solving skills  sensitive to cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary interaction; understanding the roles of collaborators; and use of appropriate assessment and instructional strategies. It is concluded that the program succeeded in helping teachers achieve these competencies. In addition, several lessons learned about the dynamics of bilingual special education teams are outlined.

        "description":"A qualitative method for assessing the cognitive and linguistic development of bilingual children is presented, and its underlying model is discussed. The model views language learning as a concept formation process in three domains: cognitive; cultural; and linguistic. This method has been found useful in accurately differentiating genuine handicapping conditions, disabilities, giftedness, and normal second language learning. Two major methodological needs in assessment and identification of language-minority, low-income, gifted children are discussed: (1) development of psycholinguistic models including culture, cognition, and language; and (2) control of external factors influencing language and cognitive development. Application of this qualitative assessment method is  illustrated in a case study that included a home language survey, parent and teacher ratings of the child's language proficiencies and talents in school and home environments, and standardized language and nonverbal intelligence tests. Dilemmas evaluators face in assessing bilingual children are discussed in light of myths and misconceptions. (Author/MSE)",

Several models for consultation used in special education are outlined: process consultation, used to help the teacher clarify student needs and develop solutions through a prescribed set of activities; the doctor-patient model, which is largely prescriptive; and the \"purchase\" model, in which service to the children are bought. Factors in the consulting relationship are discussed, including resistance, listening and communication skills, shared responsibility, content knowledge needs, and pre-referral intervention. These principles of consultation are then applied to bilingual and English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) education as provided in pullout  programs, focusing on the benefits of consultation and the special considerations inherent in bilingual and ESL instruction. One such program in an elementary school is described, and its characteristics illustrated in one interdisciplinary instructional unit. It is concluded that consultation programs offer benefits to both students and teachers, particularly when language and content area instruction are integrated. (MSE)",

It is suitable for bridging the instructional gap in bilingual education so these children can have the same educational opportunities as their English-speaking peers and suffer less the effects of cultural and social segregation. Computer software, compact disk, CD-ROM, and videodisk technology provide and store large quantities of subject matter, allow individualization of instruction and instructional materials, permit children to learn at their own speed, and are motivating and non-threatening. These characteristics are useful in  instruction in English as a second language, in both one-way and two-way bilingual education, for attractive graphics to involve all students, and even to promote parent involvement.

A group of 124 Florida college freshmen then heard the speech samples and completed a semantic differential scale questionnaire for each. Analysis revealed significant differences in reactions across languages and error types. Phonetic error was rated lower than grammatical error, despite the fact that grammatical errors  sometimes obscured meaning while phonetic errors did not. Spanish and German accents were rated about the same, but the Arabic accent was rated lower than the others.

The first involved study of the assigned text to clarify objectives and expectations. From this stage, three kinds of objectives emerged: broad; those related to reading strategies; and those related to text type. The second stage focused on assessment of current  assignments and development of assignments related to those objectives. In stage three, the readings were analyzed to determine whether students would require skills other than those already stated. This involved a genre analysis of history research articles to determine the basic patterns of text organization and language used.

        "description":"A project to develop instructional materials for English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) instruction is described. It consisted of development and testing of materials on the correct use of American idioms to limited-English-speakers. Twenty-five idioms were selected for use as the basis of the script for an instructional videotape. The idioms were then incorporated into exercises, which were then compiled in handbooks for students and teachers (not included here). The videotape (not included here) features dramatized situations in which the idiom is used correctly, then dramatized interpretation of what the idiom seems to mean, and an explanation of what the idiom really means. A version of the videotape was also produced for the hearing-impaired. The current report describes the  process of developing the materials and pilot-testing them with literacy students in several locations. Although there was not sufficient time to post-test students using the materials, it was found that they were well received by both students and literacy providers. A source address for the materials is provided. (MSE) (Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouse on Literacy Education)",

        "description":"A project to promote collaboration between child and adult literacy educators in a family English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) literacy program is described. It arose from conflicting opinions and concerns voiced by teachers familiar with different student groups and with different instructional frames of reference. Quarterly teacher preplanning sessions and weekly planning meetings were held to define and expand on instructional themes. The planning sessions were found to be most useful when carefully structured to work toward specific, stated project goals, using a grid system. Teachers came to the weekly sessions with ideas to implement the agreed-upon theme and explained them in detail. It was found that to collaborate fully, child and adult educators had to adjust their  perspectives somewhat. Native language community liaisons were frequent participants in planning sessions. Although these individuals initially adhered to traditional concepts of instruction, they adapted their approaches to the conceptual framework underlying the project. It is concluded that while the project took much time and energy, its results were worthwhile and made it possible to address the needs and value the strengths of all students.

A federal mandate that most televisions provide a closed caption decoder, increased captioning of all program types, and additional research on the benefits of CCTV for ESL learning support the use of the medium. Several technological advances make classroom use of CCTV materials less time-consuming for teachers and a rich experience for students. Captions can now be captured for simultaneous printing or computer use and exercises can be developed for using this material. Sample exercises include punctuation analysis of the large-type captions, lessons  on grammar and vocabulary, study of cultural patterns and social behavior, analysis of intonation and stress, study of the techniques used by captioners to make captions brief and succinct, and construction of adult activities using the slower-paced children's programs. Training in the use of CCTV and sharing of teaching experiences will allow educators to exploit the power and effectiveness of television as a language and literacy learning tool.

A variety of activities occur under the umbrella of practitioner inquiry, all of which are grounded in the knowledge and questions held by practitioners. The characteristics of inquiry intersect with those of other adult education concepts such as self-directed learning, reflective practice, learner centeredness, and action research. Inquiry has been defined as a &quot;social and collaborative process&quot; through which practitioners actually contribute new knowledge within programs and even to the larger adult education field. This digest examines the thinking that underlies practitioner inquiry, explains the phases of an  inquiry process, and gives examples of projects. The digest concludes by identifying concerns with the approach and by suggesting changes that must take place if inquiry is to be viably implemented as a staff development process.

The study used a 1-year, longitudinal, panel study design using data collected as part of a pilot study for a national, longitudinal investigation of factors influencing learning, cognitive development, and orientations toward learning in college. The survey randomly selected 600 students from a population of about 4,500 freshmen students at a large, urban, commuter, research university in Fall 1991. Of these, 327 (54.5%) participated and 210 (64.2%) of these also participated in the follow-up component in Spring 1992. The initial survey used the Collegiate  Assessment of Academic Proficiency and also gathered demographic, family, and educational background information. The follow-up instruments included the College Student Experiences Questionnaire. Results indicated that college experiences gave a 6 to 17 percent increase in critical thinking skills, that both class-related and out-of-class experiences made positive, significant contributions to critical thinking scores, and that the number of hours students spent studying and the number of non-assigned books read were positively related to gains in critical thinking.

Interviews were conducted with 24 faculty drawn from 12 departments in the first 2 years of the project, with an additional 18 in departments participating in Year 3 of the project. Results indicated that faculty in some departments are now more likely to perceive that somewhat less weight is given to research and publication and more to teaching in the university's tenure system. Members of some departments  were more likely to agree that a climate favorable to teaching now exists in their college; that their department head spends more time talking about teaching in annual reviews; and that the evaluation system and the measure of effective teaching are adequate and valid. In addition, faculty in both colleges were more likely to agree that teaching is rewarded in the tenure system.

During this study students participating in regular freshman orientation were given the Campus Mapping Questionnaire (CMQ) on randomly selected days. The CMQ is based on a map of the campus and an attached survey which seeks demographic information and asks students to identify locations of interest and describe their emotional perceptions of those locations. Of the 411 respondents, 73% were white while 10% were African-American. The study compared responses of African American and White  groups. Results showed that African American students were much less familiar with the campus than were Whites. No African American student indicated the chapel as an area of interest. Also surprising was that the Black Cultural Center was not mentioned in any survey. Most Black students were interested in becoming familiar with a recreational facility while most White students named the Student Union. For Black students the library appeared the most comfortable location while most White students named the Student Union as the most comfortable location. (Contains 16 references.) (JB)",

An already established effort to increase grant activity included the position of Associate Dean of Research with the responsibility for increasing the level of external funding and efforts to establish a clearly defined research culture. Consequently grants and contracts had dramatically increased in recent years. For this study all 106 tenure track faculty in the College of Education were surveyed of which 58 returned usable surveys. Survey findings revealed that a large percentage of faculty feel involvement in grant related activity is worth the trade-off for time spent on other scholarly efforts  especially from a tenure and promotion standpoint. In fact 84 percent of those responding felt consideration in promotion and tenure decision was a very important factor regarding their involvement in the grant and contract process. Faculty perception affirmed the difficulties involved in developing a grant proposal. To help minimize the burden, most faculty requested that the university support the time consuming development process with release time and administrative support. Few respondents thought that recognition in a college publication was important. Detailed analysis of the survey responses are attached. (JB)",

The study surveyed a random sample of 260 faculty from the eight campuses. Of these 136 responded. Analysis found that less than 20 percent were actively engaged in sponsored research activities and nearly half reported they rarely or never engaged in grant development activity. Faculty generally desired released time from teaching and advising to concentrate on sponsored research activities. Heavy teaching loads, other scholarly and entrepreneurial interests, committee work, and lack of advance warning were obstacles that prevented them from participating in sponsored research activities.  Faculty who did engage in grant related activities more often reaped benefits of released time, extra clerical help, and recognition for their work in college publications. Also these individuals were more likely to seek and receive technical assistance in other areas. Junior faculty reported that they received technical assistance less frequently than their senior colleagues. Data indicated no difference between male and female professors except that females were more likely to stress the importance of technical assistance.

Students completed four coping inventories at four designated points during the academic year. Results produced no significant differences in the types of demands reported by students of different ages. Among findings were: (1) direct entry students, ages 18-19, made greater use of emotion-focused and disengagement strategies and showed greater coping stability across time suggesting that they appraised their inability to  alter demand characteristics and resorted to emotional regulation; (2) students who rated coping efforts as less effective used more emotional venting and disengagement coping; (3) students who rated their coping strategies as highly effective tended to use more problem-focused coping and were able to maintain positive appraisals of demand characteristics; and (4) students age 20 or older used more suppression of competing activities, an active coping strategy important for coping with competing role demands.

The investigation included examination of a current Department of Education (ED) pilot program, a video teleconference to discuss direct lending with 23 individuals in education finance and policymaking, telephone interviews before and after the teleconference with participants and with others who did not participate, meetings with several State University of New York officials, review of materials, and interviews with senior managerial staff at New York University. Key recommendations flowing from the investigation were: (1) design the system to take full advantage of existing systems; (2) amend the statute so  schools can phase in the new program; (3) allow schools to certify loan eligibility electronically and transmit student records to ED electronically which would then print the promissory note; (4) make sure ED contractor integrates ED's system with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) so collections and collection options are maximized; (5) communicate plans, timetables and likely impact on students as soon as possible, particularly to the high school population and media; and (6) use IRS data for verification and to feed an automated reapplication process and collections.

The audit investigated whether the Principal Statements were reliable and whether relevant internal controls were in place and operating effectively, and tested compliance with significant provisions of selected laws and regulations. The audit found that the accuracy of the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Operation and Changes in Net Position, and the Statement of Budgetary Resources and Actual Expense could not be determined due to the lack of reliable student loan data.  The Statement of Cash Flows was found to be fairly accurate. Material weaknesses in internal controls over determining program costs, effectively monitoring payments to guaranty agencies and lenders, and ensuring accurate financial reporting was found to have the potential for material losses of assets or misstatements in the principal statements. The Department's ability to achieve the program's mission of providing loan access to students at reasonable cost to taxpayers was seen as compromised. The pertinent financial statements, details of the audit design, additional reports, comments, and recommendations from 1992 are included. (JB)",

Over half of the 40 items received mean ratings above 5.0, with none less than 4.26. These results indicated that the education majors surveyed felt that they possessed high levels of leadership ability. Stepwise regression procedures revealed that a significant portion of the variance associated with the  Management of Self factor and the Interpersonal Relations factor was explained by the respondent's gender. Apart from gender, none of the other demographic characteristics had a significant influence on leadership factors. Includes recommendations for further research. (Contains 21 references.) (MDM)",

A 62-item survey questionnaire was developed and sent to employers in the West Midlands region of England. The survey found that the main areas of satisfaction with graduates were their willingness to learn, their co-operation, motivation, commitment, drive and energy, desire to achieve, and dependability. Employers were dissatisfied, however, with graduates' prior knowledge of the job, relevant work experience, knowledge of the organization, commercial awareness, experience of the world of work, and financial knowledge. Overall, it would seem that  line managers and people in commerce and industry who work closely with recent graduates are satisfied but not enthusiastic about most of the graduates they employ.

The university as a whole should develop a campus teaching journal, emphasize quality over quantity in promotion decisions, allow groups of first-year students to take certain classes as a cohort, avoid quick-fix solutions, develop a teaching center, and use the teaching center to seek funds for guest lecturers and visiting teachers.

A team of nine experts reviewed statistics on the state's public and private programs, conducted a survey of institutions on industry status and projected training needs, and visited all 10 program locations. The project applied guidelines to evaluate the data and make recommendations. Evaluation covered the industry as a whole including aviation trends, manpower needs, merging technologies, and industrial workforce requirements; Oklahoma state programs; and private programs. The evaluation found that the State System is producing too many pilots and aviation maintenance technicians and devoting too little effort to planning designed to meet future aviation/aerospace needs in the  state or nationally. The evaluation recommended a statewide comprehensive program planning process to improve efficiency and excellence and to develop strategies to meet current and future needs. New career track programs recommended include fiber optics, laser optics, robotics, and space medicine. In addition the State System was urged to identify strategies to encourage and facilitate participation of women and minorities in the industry. Finally, the report recommends that Oklahoma focus more resources on mathematics and science educational reform.

Findings reported include the following: (1) institutions conferred more than 2.1 million degrees in academic year 1991-92; (2) of these, 24 percent were associate's degrees, 54 percent were bachelor's degrees, 17 percent were master's degrees, 2 percent were doctorates, and 4 percent were first-professional degrees; (3) the number of all  degrees awarded was up 4.1 percent over the previous year with about one half of the increase in bachelor's degrees and with women receiving almost 61 percent of the increase; (4) percentage gains in number of degrees awarded to minorities were as high as 10 percent more to Asians and Pacific Islanders, 9 percent more to American Indians, and 8 and 7 percent more to Hispanics and Blacks, non-Hispanics, respectively; (5) as a whole minorities increased their relative share of all degrees by .5 percent; and (6) minorities received only about 14 percent of all degrees awarded in 1991-92.

        "description":"This paper discusses the funding status of Canadian universities which are referred to as &quot;creatures of the provinces&quot; as their principal funding comes from the provincial governments. Their other main source of funds is tuition and academic fees which are themselves subject to government regulations. Together, 78 to 89 percent of university funds are controlled directly or indirectly by provincial governments. Thus they are expense driven institutions. Direct competition for funds with other public goals results in income uncertainty for universities as illustrated by the recent implementation of Ontario's &quot;social contract&quot; which targeted its universities for a $216 million cutback. When government responsibility to act in the public good conflicts with another public good, it  courts economic and social damage. Given these problems, universities should start to exercise more of an entrepreneurial spirit to reshape their dependency on government funding. Universities must convince the private sector to become long-term financial contributors to the general operation of universities as a politically driven funding source can no longer serve as the primary source of university revenue. Successful tempering of the expense driven institution with these changes would create a more balanced support base. (Includes two tables on university revenues in 1992.) (JB)",

They were also polled on their use of word processing software. Appropriate disks were then sent to each containing the pertinent accreditation standards and other information. Some problems with disk and program compatibility arose as team members each had unique combinations of hardware and different  version of software. Before the campus visit, the leader met with the university's computer expert to review the machines that would be available. After some initial concerns, all members conducted their two days of interviews and research and recorded their evaluations with the help of their computers. At the visit's end, each participant turned in a written report on disk which later was merged, edited and mailed to the state Department of Education in both hard copy and disk form. (JB)",

        "description":"This paper describes three non-traditional higher education outcomes assessment models and identifies common characteristics of successful models of this type. Institutions considering how to meet state, national, and accrediting agency mandates have two kinds of non-traditional approaches available: formative and summative assessment. Formative assessment helps institutions make internal adjustments to student programs before the student completes the program. Summative assessment is that which evaluates the overall effectiveness of programs and services. A third emerging model is the Assessment Center model in which the testing and evaluating procedures for an institution are coordinated. Common features of assessment models all designed to meet the unique needs of individual  institutions include evaluation of: clearly stated institutional mission and goals developed by the institutional community; in-place formal systems procedures; faculty commitment; administrative support; feedback from students and graduates; student-faculty contact beyond class; assessment focus on student completion; feedback to students; and commitment from chief leadership personnel. The paper closes with a discussion of the historical context of assessment pressures in higher education and a look at why assessment is now being mandated. Contains 18 references. (JB)",

        "description":"Clemson University (South Carolina) has developed an undergraduate Language and International Trade program designed to train students to meet the needs of American firms doing business overseas. Program aims are that graduates know one foreign language, be attuned to cultural differences, have a business training foundation, and have experience living and working in a foreign country. The program offers specializations in French, German, Spanish, applied economics, forest products, international trade, textiles, and tourism. Currently 220 students are majoring in the program, of whom 90 percent are specializing in international trade. During their junior year students complete an internship either abroad or stateside with an international firm. These are arranged by the students  themselves, through a professional placement office, or by the university administration. In many cases Clemson has developed agreements with other higher education institutions, chambers of commerce, and civic clubs in foreign countries to exchange students. However, direct placement with firms abroad has been difficult: many firms are not open to undergraduate interns, most American students prefer to intern in summer, and firms prefer to have students work for at least 6 months. Clemson charges no fee for the internship placement. The job placement rate among graduates 1 year after graduation has increased from 48 percent in 1991 to 52 percent in 1993. (JB)",

        "description":"A controversy at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in New York State over that institution's involvement with classified research for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) raised issues regarding classified research and institutional leadership. In 1991 M. Richard Rose, then president of RIT, took a 4-month sabbatical to work for the federal government. During his absence, controversy arose over his absence, the lack of information and communications regarding his absence, and over means to examine and correct the situation. A Review Panel reported to the Board of Trustees late in the year and made several recommendations to change and clarify relations between RIT and the CIA. Rose announced plans to retire in 1992. The controversy raised questions about the necessity  of university involvement in classified research and many agreed that such research should not take place under RIT auspices. Others argued that RIT could oversee classified research if appropriate policies and procedures were first developed that address disclosure, minimum intrusion, protection of rights, researcher responsibilities, and independent oversight. Appendixes contain a glossary, a list of key players in the controversy, term definitions, and an extensive list of newspaper articles on the controversy. (JB)",

A section on student responsibility summarizes Robert Pace's standards embedded in the College Student Experience Questionnaire. Student responsibility is important as the key to all development and learning, because irresponsible students diminish the collective academic life, and because responsible habits pay lifetime benefits  to the individual and society. A following section notes the work of Vincent Tinto, Alexander Astin, and Ernest Pascarella on student responsibility. A final section looks at how institutions can encourage responsible student behavior by stressing the importance of student achievement, by conveying the institution's purpose in an unambiguous manner, and by creating an ethos where students believe they are members of a larger community. In addition, small-scale, human environments for student faculty interaction, and other efforts to enhance student faculty relations are important. (JB)",

FE in Scotland is analogous to community college education in the United States, providing vocational and transfer programs to secondary school graduates. Recent governmental pressure to increase enrollments at HE institutions with only limited increases in funding has led to an increased emphasis on FE-HE linkages to reduce costs. Scotland's Further and Higher Education Act of 1992 encourages increased collaboration between HE and FE institutions by making their educational programs and course offerings more compatible and centralizing the  funding of both types of institutions. Napier University has established closer links with local FE institutions, implementing student transfer agreements and multi-institution programs. Such cooperation will allow institutions in both sectors to increase student intake in targeted areas and at levels that suit them best. Comparisons with the community college-university relationship in the United States are also discussed. (MDM)",

Resources for counseling, including college guides, catalogs, and trained personnel, were found to be unevenly distributed among the offices. The report recommends that a basic collection of reference and orientation materials on American higher education be acquired by all offices, and that  maintenance of these collections and systematic communication among the counseling offices occur through a centralized office in Rio de Janeiro. The report also recommends that continuing personnel training occur through periodic national counseling conferences.

Perelman examines issues raised by his recent book, &quot;School's Out&quot; (1992), which describes the current educational system as an obsolete technology that is rapidly being replaced by the new metaprocess of hyperlearning. Hyperlearning will combine teaching and learning with artificial intelligence, broadband telecommunications, information processing, and biotechnology to transform the world's economic order. This style of learning will emphasize active, student-directed experiences rather than institutionalized, teacher-directed instruction. The present educational system is less and less able to meet the needs of rapid change exhibited in industry and society. Perelman observes that community colleges are in a better position to adapt to these  changes than other segments of higher education, since community colleges are generally more flexible and consumer-orientated, and already serve in many ways as community learning centers open to all individuals. He maintains that the one great strength of the American educational system is its great diversity, a factor that may allow it to adapt more easily to change than more centralized systems found elsewhere in the world.

A total of 41 American and international graduate students were administered the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT), and 20 of the international students were interviewed. The study found that 70 percent of the American students and 82 percent of the Chinese students tested were classified as field independent in cognitive style. The four students from Saudi Arabia had GEFT scores in the field dependent range. Although Americans tended to score higher than international students, and men tended to score higher than women, the results indicated that age, gender, nationality, and academic major had little influence on  students' cognitive style. Interview data about international students' attitudes towards teaching techniques, teacher-student interaction, examinations, research papers, and differences between American and home country universities are also presented.

        "description":"This study sought to determine whether the motivational patterns of first-year university students differed between courses of varying difficulty levels, and the nature of the interactions between self-efficacy, attributional style, and academic achievement. A total of 509 students majoring in history, physical education, mathematics, and private law at an independent, rural South African university were surveyed. A two-part subject-specific questionnaire was developed for each of the four courses of study to assess how students in the specific majors rated their self-efficacy, goal-orientation, attributional choice, and attributional style. The results indicated a relationship between motivational pattern and course difficulty, but not between motivational variables and academic  achievement. Based on the results, it would seem that students need to have an adaptive motivational pattern before they would accept the challenge of a difficult course of study such as mathematics or private law.

Available mechanisms for gathering information about educational practices and student experiences were also examined. Conclusions suggest that indicators based on student behaviors and &quot;active learning&quot; instructional processes gathered through student and faculty questionnaires would be most promising for development as potential national indicators, supplemented by transcript studies and assessments of typical college examinations and assignments.

An executive summary highlights the scope of the audit, audit observations and conclusions, and comments of SUNY officials. An introductory section gives an explanation of the audit scope, objectives, and methodology. The report then examines the spending practices of a group (of six faculty members) in which potentially illegal spending practices were found. Questionable practices were identified in entertainment costs, travel costs, purchase of gifts, personal loans, related party transactions, and purchases that appear to have yielded a personal gain.  Questionable practices were also identified for six remaining groups (totaling 140 faculty members) in which, however, no patterns of expenditures resulting in personal gain were found. Overall, the report concludes that serious internal control weaknesses related to the expenditure of clinical practice funds by the various medical service groups were found. It notes the lack of guidelines for controlling the amount or type of spending by the groups with each group functioning in an autonomous manner and lack oversight.

The study examined five issues central to institutional research: (1) professional role identity, (2) location of the office in the organizational hierarchy, (3) institutional research task variables, (4) the hierarchy of institutional research tasks, and (5) the role of the institutional research office in organized assessment activities. Findings are detailed in text and tables for each of these five issues. Among general findings are the following: the larger the institution's size, the larger the institutional research office staff; the lack of predictability between  variables of institutional research structure and tasks is ascribed to the strong influence of varying management styles, demeanor, career paths, and organizational power structure; there was little relationship between organizational variables and the tasks hierarchy; the size of the professional staff suggested more about the nature of institutional research activities than any other single variable. The increasing importance of institutional research in smaller, two-year, and community colleges is noted. Contains 16 references. (DB)",

The study had three objectives: (1) to identify students' background information and involvement in computer assisted instruction; (2) to assess whether there is a linear relationship between computer awareness or literacy and academic achievement; and (3) to compare the learning achievement between sequential learning and interactive learning. Fifty-six 10th-grade students were divided into two instructional groups; one received sequential instruction on computer awareness and the other received instruction on the same content via interactive video. Statistical analyses were conducted of the background information, the  students' learning behavior, and their learning achievement. The learning achievement of students who received computer exposure (interactive video) and students without computer exposure (sequential) were then compared. The results indicated a high level of interest in computer assisted instruction and in computer related occupations; students with prior experience with computers scored significantly higher than those who had never learned computer awareness; and students' computer awareness came primarily from television. The results of the data analyses are presented in both narrative and tabular formats. (Contains 32 references.) (DB)",

Subjects were teachers from the Center for Technology in Education (New York) national telecommunications survey who had responded that they used the Internet for more than just electronic mail. Participants were sent an open-ended questionnaire that covered Internet use, involvement, learning, use in schools, future, and background. Responses were received from nine women and nine men who had spent an average of 19 years working as educators. Half were classroom teachers, two were librarians, and the others were technology specialists at classroom or administrative levels. All but  two of the interviews were conducted over the Internet. Responses indicate that obstacles to Internet use for elementary and secondary education are substantial. These users were extremely technologically sophisticated and were drawing on skills they had developed outside their professional roles as teachers. They also were in schools with the necessary technology--conditions not available for the majority of teachers. Suggestions are given for making the Internet more accessible and more friendly for the educator user, as well as for expanding the available technology. (Contains 26 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"Different learning strategies that are used by field-independent (FI) and field-dependent (FD) people in a hypermedia-assisted instructional setting were studied with 63 international college students for whom English was a second language. The treatment was a semantic network-based hypermedia-assisted language-learning environment to help non-native speakers of English learn vocabulary. Field dependence and independence were determined using the Group Embedded Figures Test. Patterns of learning while using the hypermedia were studied. FI and FD students employed different learning strategies. The FD students spent more time using the courseware and used it more often than did the FI subjects. The video format was a favorable medium for the FD participants, although not much  difference was found in accessing the textual and graphic media among FD and FI participants. FD learners were more likely to use features that represented the wholeness of the content, while FI users tended to use component features. Hypermedia offers promise in finding ways to match instruction-type to learning style. Five tables and two figures present study findings. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"Because information is quickly becoming the key resource in many industries globally, it seems natural to utilize and incorporate it as the primary resource in education, an institution that affects our entire society. A definition of an information-based organization (IBO) is proposed, steps to making an organization an IBO are identified, and a model for making local public school systems IBOs is derived. An IBO is defined as an organization in which information is the primary resource utilized, shared, and integrated into normal workday routines to achieve a common vision or goal. The model for an educational IBO is based on the existence of new information that satisfies teachers' needs and new information flow that results from collaborative restructuring of local schools  and empowered teachers. Implementing an educational IBO will mean redefining the organization's culture to an IBO culture. An appendix gives a detailed explanation of the educational system structure and its organization. Two figures illustrate the discussion. (Contains 42 references.) (Author/SLD)",

This involves teaching from an environmental perspective. This paper introduces an instructional model that uses media as a foundation for creating and implementing strategies that both teach and reinforce concepts from an integrated environmental perspective. A curriculum integration matrix (CIM) is used to help teachers link ideas from two or more subject areas. Steps in the instructional process include: (1) identifying the main subject topic, lesson subtopics, target concepts, and available teaching time; (2) describing the lesson content; (3)  choosing additional integration topics using the subject table; (4) focusing on the integrated topic; (5) deciding on presentation method and instructional media; (6) describing or sketching the integrated media; and (7) completing the matrix by summarizing the process and rewriting the fully integrated lesson.

This document examines the rate of historical acquisition, level of access, and degree of use of technology within New York State public schools. The number of microcomputers in the schools has more than doubled in the past 8 years, to more than 214,000. The state's ratio of microcomputers to students is 12.2 to 1 overall. To reach the goal of the State Education Department's long-range plan, a ratio of approximately 5 to 1 will be necessary. Most of the computers in New York schools are older models that are not capable of running the most powerful, user-engaging applications. Capital funds are needed to ensure up-to-date technology for the state's students. At  present New York schools rank well behind leading states in terms of the number of technology resources. There are many cutting-edge applications of educational technology in New York, but there are also many inequalities in the access and use of technology relative to the minority status of students. Two graphs and seven tables present information on computer use in New York schools. (SLD)",

OERI is the research and development arm of the U.S. Department of Education. In spite of the importance of its duties, funding in terms of constant dollars has decreased approximately 80% since 1973. The proposed act seeks to reverse this trend by redefining the authorities, functions, and responsibilities of the office, and establishing five new research directorates. The bill also creates a nonpartisan Advisory Board of Educational Research to review research and evaluate its quality. An Office of Dissemination  and Reform Assistance is established to provide national coordination, and regional education laboratories are established to advance the National Education Goals. In addition, S. 286 includes a minority focused civic education program for improved instruction in civics for minorities and Native Americans. This initiative also supports teacher education in civics. The Committee believes that this act will support educational research of the highest quality and will strengthen the flow of information and technical assistance to every student. (SLD)",

        "description":"The Computers in Education (Comped) study was designed as a two-stage survey. The first stage (1987-1990) was aimed at gathering information from a representative sample of schools at elementary, lower secondary and upper secondary level with regard to the state of computer use in education. The survey's focus was on the extent and availability of computers in schools, how computers are used, nature of instruction about computers, and the estimates of the effects that computers are having on students, curriculum, and the school as an institution. This publication describes Stage 2. The first part of Stage 2 was a repetition of the survey of Stage 1, with data collection centering on a school questionnaire. This enabled a longitudinal study of trends. Part 2 of Stage 2 studied the  relationship between policy, practice, and outcomes with respect to computers in education relating variables referring to school, teacher, and classroom practice to student variables such as functional computer literacy, specific knowledge about and experiences with computers, performance in handling computers as well as attitudes towards computers and their uses. Ten countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, India, Japan, Latvia, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and the United States) participated. Because thorough analyses have not yet been done, the presentation is mostly descriptive. The data collected are presented in 31 tables and 38 figures. Twelve appendixes, with an additional 30 tables, contain detailed information on participating countries, sampling, computer uses, and  responses to specific questionnaire items.

        "description":"The rising demand over the past 2 years for interactive radio instruction (IRI) in Papua New Guinea has been unexpected and has come primarily from educators who have seen the difference it can make in the classroom. This enthusiasm was unexpected because it was not clear at the end of the Papua New Guinea Radio Science Project in 1990 how extensively funding cuts had affected its impact. Since then the government and educators in Papua New Guinea have asked for other core material to be adapted for radio broadcasts. Teacher demand is playing a vital role in the overall institutionalization of IRI in Papua New Guinea because planners recognized its importance in the change process. Because the driving force is coming from teachers, the process is moving beyond the  institutionalization of interactive radio to the institutionalization of interactivity itself. The adoption of the interactive character of the Radio Science program as the standard for all school radio instruction is beginning in Papua New Guinea. (Contains 11 references.) (SLD)",

Through its review of expenditures, PEER determined that the MAET Board compromised fulfilling its statutory responsibilities by relying exclusively on MAET managers to formulate policy without appropriate review and control. The MAET Board did not effectively  supervise and control MAET's relationship with the Foundation, allowing MAET's executive management uncontrolled use of Foundation funds for questionable purposes and MAET administrative costs instead of for programming, as had been represented to donors.

Bibliographic databases are usually found in three formats: citations only, citations and abstracts, and full-text articles. Numeric databases are generally those with numbers and only a minimal amount of explanatory text. They include numeric databases of statistical and survey data, textual-numeric databases with explanatory text, and properties databases of dictionary and handbook-type data. For this paper, bibliographic databases on CD-ROM are categorized into university or academic, general or popular titles, and special titles. Eleven bibliographic databases, including ERIC and  PsycLIT, are listed and described. Three major producers of numeric databases are the Census Bureau, Donnelly Marketing Information Services, and Nielsen Media Research. Nine such databases are described. CD-ROMs that serve as catalogs of available databases are discussed, as are databases available on diskette. The volumes of information available to researchers can no longer be accessed without including this and other computer technology. Nine figures illustrate the discussion. An appendix lists 13 resources on CD-ROM products. (Contains 37 references.) (SLD)",

Results suggest factors that instructional designers should take into account to improve learning. Thirty-six upper-division college students were enrolled in a course on Shakespeare at a regional university. Using HyperCard, a document for teaching and interpreting &quot;Hamlet&quot; was prepared. Characterization, plot, literary analysis, and perspective on revenge that were built into concept maps were the principal interface of the program. Video commentary by the course instructor juxtaposed to an available screen portrayal of &quot;Hamlet&quot; advanced the major interpretations of the play. A 25-question objective test measured student  learning. The experimental group outperformed the control group on this measure of learning. Results suggest that the multimedia document was useful in consolidating knowledge from the play. The interface design appeared to aid students in acquiring major concepts. One table and two figures illustrate the findings, and attachments illustrate some of the hypertext screens. (Contains 26 references.) (SLD)",

It has become a leader in distance-education programs by offering off-campus undergraduate and graduate degree programs in education, business and public administration, psychology, and computer sciences. Almost half of the students are enrolled in field-based programs that are delivered in a number of ways, including the National Cluster approach of the doctoral program in Child and Youth Studies (CYS). The various forms of technology used for program delivery include the autobridge (a telephone  technology), videotapes, audiotapes, telephone, electronic mail, and the electronic classroom (simultaneous online classes). A study of the effectiveness of the CYS National Cluster approach is being conducted to compare the effectiveness of its delivery methods and practicum approach (infrequent cluster meetings and more reliance on technology) with more traditional methods of distance education. Nova University recognizes the need to keep abreast of technology and to provide the latest valid delivery approaches for its distance learners. (Contains 5 references.) (SLD)",

Teachers must be able to identify learning styles and find ways for instruction to match those styles. This paper moves from an overview of different learning styles to a review of the use of computer-assisted instruction. A recent development in technology, known as hypermedia, is described as a tool for faculty training and managing curricula. Hypermedia is an expansion of the hypertext concept that allows for the inclusion of media links as well as data links. Information in various types of electronic media can be accessed by activating the link. The user can explore information in a direction and speed suited to his or her learning style, as well as through the sensory  stimuli that best enhances learning. The HyperCard software package provides tools to permit the educator-author the freedom and flexibility to address the needs of any learner. While development efforts may require more time when using technology to provide alternative learning paths, only minor revisions should be needed once the original work is done.

Three types of computer applications that are appropriate for an LEA program are Hypertext, multimedia creation programs, and CD-ROM. Because computers can be combined with other media systems, they provide motivational and dynamic tools that can foster a child's expressive and reflective skills. However, computer technologies are only as effective as a child's willingness to embrace them and an adult's enthusiasm for using them at home and in the classroom.

The plan begins by identifying the challenges present in education and then identifies the benefits of technology in solving these challenges. Next, the state of technology and education in North Carolina are presented in three areas--computer  literacy, student information management, and distance learning by satellite. Five objectives for change are presented: (1) changed definitions and percentages of schools and schooling; (2) changed student roles and activities; (3) changed teacher roles and activities; (4) changed administrator roles; and (5) expanded methods of assessment. The technology infrastructure of a networked school is described; strategies for action are suggested; and the roles and responsibilities of the participants are identified.

CNIB, which has provided vision services that are called eye patrols in the NWT since the 1930s, established the CNIB Library for the Blind in 1918. This privately funded library is the largest national production and distribution network for information to blind and visually impaired Canadians. Works are distributed in English and French because a comprehensive  braille code has not been developed for the aboriginal languages. Funding and access problems mean that blind and visually impaired people in the NWT are not well served. Recognizing the potential of the electronic highway for improving services, CNIB has responded by establishing an Information Resource Center to serve as a library without walls that uses computer terminals and telephones to increase access to information for those who are unable to read print.

        "description":"This study was designed to update the existing research and to examine the relationship between library media programs and student achievement. The schools selected for the study sample were not selected on a random basis; rather, they were library media centers (LMCs) that responded to a 1989 survey of Colorado LMCs. The study relied entirely upon available data about LMCs. The findings of the study provided evidence to make these conclusions: (1) students with better funded LMCs tend to achieve higher average reading scores regardless of wealth or education level of the schools and community; (2) the size of the LMC's total staff and the size and variety of its collection are important characteristics which intervene between LMC expenditures and test performance; and (3) the  role the school media specialist plays can influence test scores.

A questionnaire was used as the data gathering instrument. It was conducted on site at three randomly selected DeKalb County (Georgia) library branches. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) computer program. The study found that 58% of the students find needed materials in the public library. Only 22% indicated they find the materials they need in the school library media center. Parents and guardians were cited by 68% of the students as having the most influence  on their public library behavior. Teachers were the most influential elements in the students' use of the school media center with media specialists having little influence on the students' library use behavior.

Also selected for inclusion were library science monographs which addressed at least one of the following functional elements of management: planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, or budgeting. In total, 7,049 citations were analyzed. A general statistical analysis of the total citations showed that overall, 3,853 (55%) of sources cited were those in business  and public administration as compared to 3,248 (45%) of library science sources. This figure is even higher (61%) if citations in &quot;Journal of Library Administration&quot; are examined separately. One table presents data on the use of library science versus business and public administration literature as cited in monographs; the data indicate the three areas which draw most on non-library science literature are planning, coordinating, and directing. A graph presents a ranking of the use of library science versus non-library science literature from 1981-92. (Contains 49 references.) (MES)",

The four usual tables are: personnel; expenditures; preservation treatment; and preservation microfilming. The second section presents an  analysis of the core data for all reporting ARL libraries. The key organizational, functional, and fiscal components that characterize preservation programs in ARL libraries and that distinguish between program levels are analyzed.

After a review of the literature on the effects of television, a rating scale was prepared and applied to a number of broadcast (noncable) television shows aimed at children. Ratings were compared with those of 60 parents of preschoolers about the positive and negative aspects of some frequently watched programs. In addition, the author watched some programs in company with preschool children. The review of individual programs, including cartoons, suggests that television is not promoting family values and is not necessarily modeling prosocial behavior for young children. The time children spend watching television could be better spent on other stimulating and  developmentally appropriate activities. Parents can select programs carefully and use video equipment to record and show programs with positive values. Monitoring children's television viewing takes extra time and effort but is very important. Parents must take the influence of television on their children seriously.

It is written for educators and educational entities involved with the design and implementation of educational projects. The guide will help planners and designers decide what type of networked community to create; what factors to consider in selecting an electronic network to support the community; what networks or network projects already exist to provide resources to meet the needs of the community; and how members could gain access to the network. Chapter 1 introduces some basic concepts about networked communities and relates these concepts to education. Chapter 2 identifies criteria for selecting a network. beginning with its educational purpose and  concluding with connection considerations. Chapter 3 describes types of networks, characterized by factors and issues relevant to decision making. Chapter 4 presents examples of networked communities in terms of the frameworks and factors defined in the preceding chapter. Included in the appendices are descriptions of networks and/or projects mentioned; comments on the future of networking in the schools; and a glossary. (Contains 28 references.) (JLB)",

The paper compares the policies for handling requests for access by donors of material and procedures for accessioned records among the three offices that have physical custody of permanent records: the Office of Presidential Libraries, the Office of the National Archives, and the Office of Federal Records Centers. A number of instances in which loaned records have been lost are cited, including U.S. Army records from the Vietnam War. The paper concludes by proposing revisions of the procedures for records requests.

It is the first phase of a broader project of the Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to evaluate the overall statistics available from the annual Public Library Statistics program. The report contains four sections. Section 1 is a summary of findings. Among the findings were the following: (1) the coverage in the annual program is very nearly complete (99.5 percent); and (2) there is a degree of inconsistency for reporting information about public libraries. Section 2 describes the methodology of the evaluation study. Section 3 describes the findings of this first phase of the  evaluation in detail. Section 4 consists of individual state descriptions. Each state description contains a summary of the coverage rates, a descriptive evaluation, a brief description of the relationship to the Census of Governments library directory, lists of specific public libraries and sources of undercount or overcount in the NCES dataset, a description of branch library counts, and additional findings of note. There are two broad purposes of this evaluation. First, it is an evaluation of coverage, intended to raise specific issues for discussion among NCES, the Federal State Cooperative System (FSCS), and the states. Secondly, it is the starting point for evaluating additional issues of the statistical program, including definitions and the accuracy/reliability of various library  service measures that result from the program.

        "description":"A project was undertaken to test feminist teaching strategies designed to improve women students' confidence and engagement in the physical sciences classroom. The strategies under study included peer-support partnerships, writing in the learning process, and systematic self-disclosure by the teacher. In each of four semesters from 1991 to 1992, the strategies were employed in two experimental physics sections matched with two parallel control sections. The effects of the strategies were assessed through analyses of attitude inventories administered to students, grades, failure and abandon rates, office appointments, interviews with teachers and students, and student evaluations of the strategies. Feminist pedagogy was shown to effect significant positive change in student  attitudes both towards the physics teacher and towards physics as a subject of study. This was true for both genders, although women showed less overall enjoyment. When student rates of achievement were taken into account, almost significant effects on student anxiety were noted, as low achieving students were less anxious in experimental sections. The partnership and writing assignments were positively evaluated, especially by low achieving and women students who took fuller advantage of writing. In general, feminist pedagogy had a positive impact on engagement in and commitment to physics for all students. Data tables are included. Teacher and student attitude inventories and rating instructions are appended. (Contains 54 references.) (KP)",

        "description":"In 1991, two student surveys were developed at Westchester Community College (WCC), in New York, to investigate the reasons for student attrition at WCC. The first survey, the &quot;Student Intent Survey,&quot; was designed to discover students' reasons for enrolling at WCC, plans for returning the next semester, and graduation plans; while the second survey, &quot;The Student Follow-Up Survey, was designed for students who did not plan to return to WCC. In March 1991, the &quot;Student Intent Survey&quot; was distributed in freshman composition and remedial English classes to approximately 1,650 students, and 1,393 usable responses were returned. Responses to this survey included the following: (1) 55.7% of the respondents reported that their primary reason for attending WCC was to transfer to a  four-year college; (2) 72.9% planned to enroll at WCC the following term, and 16.7% were undecided; (3) 61.7% indicated that they planned to graduate from WCC along with students in the Certificate program (77.5%), students between 30-49 years old (76.6%), and Hispanics (70.1%) all of whom indicated that they planned to graduate from WCC in substantially higher percentages than other groups; (4) 36.2% of the students intended to obtain a Bachelor's degree, and 24.5% intended to get a Master's degree; (5) only 20.8% were were attending WCC full-time; (6) most of the respondents were working, with 19.4% employed full-time, 20.8% working between 21 and 34 hours per week, and 27.5% working between 11 and 20 hours per week; and (7) 96.8% of the students indicated that they were &quot;very  satisfied&quot; or &quot;satisfied&quot; with WCC. Attainment and persistence figures for the 1990 freshman class suggest that there might be some disparity between the expressed goals of the students and their patterns of continuing enrollment, graduation, and transfer.

        "description":"The Student Right-To-Know and Campus Security Act gives community colleges a strong incentive to track transfer students. Westchester Community College (WCC) in New York devised a four-step process to track students who transferred to four-year college before graduating. The method used to track student transfers involved the following steps: (1) taking all the requests made for a transcript to be sent in a given semester and removing from the files those requests that were not sent to a bona fide four-year college; (2) sending confirmation of enrollment forms to all transfer institutions to which transcripts were sent; (3) setting a deadline for responses; and (4) generating computer reports using Paradox and Lotus 1-2-3 of patterns in transfer college choice and of student  characteristics. In fall 1990, WCC sent 1,350 transcripts to four-year colleges, and 87.8% corresponding confirmation of enrollment forms were returned. Of these, 38% confirmed that the student had transferred, and 40% indicated that the student had not transferred. The remaining 22% of the forms either were not returned at all; indicating that the student had been accepted but had not enrolled; or lacked sufficient information to be included. The transfer students enrolled in a total of 148 four-year institutions, with 17.9% enrolled in State University of New York colleges. The largest number of students who transferred were not enrolled in any curriculum; the average number of hours completed was 37.2 hours; and the average grade point average was 2.9. Appendixes include the transfer  confirmation form, and statistical summaries of transfer institutions and the majors and characteristics of WCC transfer students. (KP)",

The Tech Prep program is designed to provide technically oriented backgrounds to the middle fifty percent of high school students who may not pursue a four-year college degree but choose a two-year trade, technical, or community college program. The mathematics component of Tech Prep, Applied Mathematics (AM), was created by a consortium of 42 states and the Center for Occupational Research and Development. AM consists of 25 competency-based units covering basic math skills, geometry, algebra, quality control, and trigonometry. The learning materials for  each unit include a 10-15 minute video program, a student text, a teacher text, mathematics laboratory activities, practical problem-solving exercises, and glossary. In the AM classroom, the teacher is a facilitator, the students actively participate, work in groups, and are allowed to use calculators. Tech Prep students who have completed AM courses will enter two-year colleges much better prepared than general mathematics students and will be used to this teaching approach. Two-year college mathematics faculty, therefore, will need to adapt to the new techniques and methods of teaching. Eight sample laboratory activities are appended. (KP)",

This paper reviews some of the ways in which Algonquin College (AC), in Ontario, is planning to interface and articulate with CSAC initiatives to ensure full compliance and retain institutional autonomy. First, the CSAC initiatives are described for Ontario, indicating that they rely on learning outcomes as the basis for the definition of program standards and aim to establish system-wide outcome standards by province to ensure similar outcomes for similar college programs and demonstrate to the public that standards are being met. Next, characteristics of learning outcomes and how  they are determined are reviewed, and information is presented on drafting learning outcomes statements. A curriculum model for outcomes-based education is then presented and assessment and evaluation strategies are discussed, including eight types of instruments or methods. Finally, the province-wide regulations for program review are described and the program review system at AC is detailed, including the use of critical performance indicators, cyclical program evaluation, ongoing program appraisal, program review, and the program review report.

Agendas and minutes of board meetings were analyzed and interviews were conducted with administrators and board members at four institutions, one rural and one urban from each country. The participating colleges were Burton Manor College (BMC), in Cheshire, England; Blackpool and the Fylde College (BFC), in Lancashire, England; Mid-Plains Community College (MPCC), in North Platte, Nebraska; and Metropolitan Community College (MCC), in Omaha, Nebraska. At BMC the board was very political, as 9 of the 15 members were party-affiliated members of the local city council, while at BFC the board had to accommodate individuals involved in the  predominant industries of the area. Board membership for both Nebraska institutions was open to the general citizenry, and no compensation was given to board members. The boards of all four colleges restructured themselves annually by electing their own officers, although the British did not utilize the operational committees employed at the Nebraska college boards. Unlike the Nebraska college boards, the British boards did not use Robert's Rules of Order and the board chair exerted a much stronger control over the meeting. While the Nebraska boards met in open session with mandatory voice votes, the British boards met in private session. Recommendations related to board membership, organization, and meetings.

        "description":"In response to legislative mandate intended to curb a national trend toward students taking longer than the traditional two- and four-year time frame to complete educational degrees, the Minnesota State Board for Community Colleges conducted a study of factors in this trend; options for encouraging students to carry full credit loads; and nonfinancial impediments to timely completion. Factors mandated for study by the state and examined by the Board included: (1) tuition banding, which allows students at certain registration levels to take higher credit loads without paying additional tuition; (2) unavailability of courses; (3) expanded program requirements; (4) lack of student preparation; and (5) such changes in values and attitudes as financial concerns and the desire for  broader educational experience. In addition, the Board examined differences in registration and enrollment among students, institutional treatment of different categories of students, and student advising, finding that while differences in treatment do not seem to affect completion rates, implementation of a new Computer Assisted Advising System will provide students and the colleges with more complete information about requirements and progress toward completion. While such improvements in the advising process represent one institutional option for influencing students' time to program completion, the Board found that other factors such as students educational objectives and enrollment patterns were generally beyond the control of the system and the colleges.

        "description":"This planning report reviews major goals for the Minnesota Community College System (MCCS) and sets directions for the 1992-95 period. The first section describes the following three major thrusts to MCCS planning efforts: helping constituencies understand the vital role of the MCCS in maintaining the quality of living and work; ensuring quality in every aspect of operations; and investment in partnerships. Following the MCCS vision and mission statements, recent efforts to stretch the system's limited resources are then reviewed, indicating that students paid almost 40% of instructional costs as of 1992-93 while dollars per student have dropped from $4,132 in 1985 to $3,800 in 1992-93. Next, the following strategies are presented for the three major goals: (1) reaffirm the role  of community colleges in serving the state with quality programs by listening, responding, and communicating to constituents; (2) improve responsiveness to constituencies by instilling quality processes at all levels, setting standards, measuring effectiveness, promoting excellence in teaching and learning, and implementing total quality management processes; and (3) create teaching and learning partnerships and strategies to achieve them by establishing and expanding partnerships with high schools, universities, business/industry, labor, federal/state/local governments, and nonprofit corporations and charitable foundations.

A compilation of job placement studies for 1992-93 occupational graduates conducted individually at the 21 MCCS colleges indicated that 70% percent of associate degree occupational graduates were employed in jobs related to their studies, with another 24% employed in unrelated jobs. Analysis of outcomes studies conducted at MCCS colleges for 1992-93 AA graduates revealed that 64% of the graduates had transferred to a four-year college in fall 1993, with over half transferring to Minnesota  universities, and 24% reported employment. A study of 300 &quot;leavers&quot; enrolled in spring 1993 but not returning in fall 1993 resulted in a response rate of 65% and indicated that 75% of leavers were employed; over half were currently enrolled in higher education; 39% had transferred to a four-year college; and 87% rated the quality of instruction at their MCCS institution as good or excellent. Finally, a systemwide study of students enrolled for fewer than six credits during fall 1991 who had not returned as of fall 1993 indicated that for completers (i.e., those who completed at least 60% of their credits) 89% had achieved their goals at least partially, while 58% of non-completers (i.e., those who did not complete any credits) cited job or studies conflicts and 29% cited  course/instructional factors.

        "description":"Enrollments in the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) have been affected by the area's slow local economy, shrinking aerospace and defense industries, the recent major earthquake, and the threat of more proposed fee increases. Since 1981-82, full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollments in the district have fluctuated. In 1993-94, both fall and spring enrollments declined from the previous 2 years, due mainly to losses in new students and Bachelor's Degree holders. The fall 1993 new student population is 75% of that in fall 1992, while the number of Bachelor's Degree holders is less than two-fifths of the number from 2 years ago. The LACCD's recent downward enrollment trend is contrary to the expanding source of college students. Some possible causes of the enrollment  declines include a lack of sufficient entry-level English and math classes, which are pre- or co-requisites of almost all programs; and disproportionately low graduation and transfer rates for Hispanic students, who represent the main source of students. Without effective enrollment strategies, such as specifically designed recruitment strategies, educational programs, and support services, the LACCD may lose another 5,000 FTE students in the next 2 years.

        "description":"Projecting the future for California community colleges involves projecting the future for the state and for the nation in general. According to population projections, the absolute number of 18-year-olds in the U.S. will rise to 4 million in 2004 up from 3.3 million in 1992. The tuition differential between California's community colleges and the state's other post-secondary institutions will bring a higher proportion of these students to the colleges, where liberal arts credits can be obtained at bargain prices. With respect to faculty, the state's full-time community college faculty salaries are high, at an average of $48,300 per year. If there are to be salary increases, then faculty work will be reorganized, with professors at the apex of a pyramid of paraprofessionals.  While the curriculum and governance structures can be expected to remain stable, the financial contributions that students make to their education will probably double from the current 12%. With respect to instruction, budgetary limitations will make year-round schools a priority, and while distance learning has been hailed as a panacea, diverting half a million students to technological instruction will not solve cash management problems and risks educational segregation. Better approaches would include more peer tutoring, on-campus computer-assisted instruction, and larger classes. The future for the community colleges of California is assured and the built-in inertia of educational systems would suggest that there will be no major shifts in funding, staffing, clientele, or  instructional forms.

        "description":"Intended to provide background information and preliminary policy options for the California Community Colleges' Commission on Innovation, this document explores the cost and practical feasibility of delivering distance instruction using pre-recorded broadcasts. Following introductory materials detailing the Commission's charge, the paper suggests that distance education (DE) represents a natural starting point for enhancing the efficiency of community colleges. Current uses of DE are then reviewed, describing the simple case of an institution making use of television, consortia of institutions promoting DE, and &quot;colleges without walls&quot; which offer only telecourses and have no campus. Next, pros and cons of DE are discussed, indicating that studies of student outcomes show that  DE students learn as well or better than classroom students and that most DE programs include opportunities for teacher/student interaction contrary to common criticisms of DE. A base model is then provided for statewide distance education, including assumptions about delivery and curriculum and tables of costs per full-time equivalent student with the use of full-time instructors, the use of part-time instructors, full- and part-time instructors with extra grading time, and full- and part-time instructors with extra meeting times. This section also provides tables of potential savings per option. Finally, three options for a statewide system are discussed and four policy changes concerning removing enrollment caps to provide incentive for DE are considered. A discussion of cost  assumptions and 81 references are appended. (KP)",

        "description":"Intended to provide background information and preliminary policy options for the California Community Colleges' Commission on Innovation, this document explores changes in local and systemwide college governance to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Following introductory materials detailing the Commission's charge, the current state governance system is reviewed, including a history of governance systems from 1910 to 1992 and a discussion of the role of the legislature, the Board of Governor (BOG) and Chancellor's Office (CO), and the district boards. This section also describes the governance system in practice, indicating that the BOG has limited authority over the colleges, the legislature micromanages college affairs, and interest groups dominate the policy making  process. Next, the paper proposes the establishment of a unified and coherent community college system with increased local college freedom and accountability called coordinated decentralization. The following features are described: (1) the BOG would assume from the legislature the principal governing authority for the system; (2) the BOG would delegate broad authority for college operations to local districts; (3) Chancellor's Office staff would become employees of the California Community Colleges, and would no longer be hired under laws of the Civil Service system; (4) district governing boards would be expanded to include members from sectors in the community with a stake in the colleges; (5) districts would emphasize policy oversight for accountability rather than administrative  decision-making; (6) the system would establish common student performance standards and accountability procedures; and (7) the systemwide budget would include incentives for the support of statewide priorities.

Data sources included a literature review and student, faculty/staff, and community opinion surveys conducted by the state department of education and local chamber of commerce from 1991 to 1993. In addition, NMC piloted several two-way interactive classes between the main campus and the Cadillac campus, conducted a survey of these students, and gathered college and state cost data on distance education. Study findings included the following: (1) a lower percentage of residents in the five-county area serviced by NMC had four-year degrees than in  the state as a whole, and per capita income was $3,680 lower than the state; (2) area residents indicated a desire for NMC to becomes a university or for the college to expand opportunities for advanced degree courses; (3) among students enrolled at NMC in winter 1991, 46% listed university transfer as their primary goal; (4) the Traverse Bay Economic Development Corporation identified the lack of baccalaureate programs as an impediment to business growth; (5) sufficient funding sources were found to support distance education efforts; and (6) students enrolled in pilot distance courses indicated they would take additional courses and recommend them to others.

The first step was the formation of a diverse &quot;crucial team&quot; to identify weaknesses, adopt more effective recruiting strategies, improve hiring procedures, research successful programs, and develop a successful plan. The 18-member team received training on affirmative action, gender equity, and disability requirements and implemented a variety of campus enrichment activities, including educational forums, community outreach, part-time faculty orientation, networking of newly  hired faculty, and preparation of a draft campus cultural diversity survey. Recommendations proposed by the team included the following: (1) on-going training on cultural diversity issues for faculty and staff to enhance sensitivity and awareness; (2) showcase Solano College with an open house for community leaders; (3) administer a campus climate survey; (4) hold lecture series and open forums on cross-cultural diversity; (5) develop on-going strategies for retention of underrepresented staff and faculty; (6) provide continuous orientation and training of part-time instructors; and (7) establish and maintain resources on cultural diversity.

        "author":["Isonio, Steven"],
        "description":"Beginning in fall 1993, Golden West College, in California, began pilot testing an English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) course adapted from the Focal Skills approach, which features instruction in intensive modules in listening, reading, writing, and general immersion. The listening and reading skills modules were offered in the fall 1993 semester, followed by the writing skills and immersion modules in spring 1994. To measure the effectiveness of the pilot courses, student performance in two sections, as measured by Focal Skills assessment instruments, was compared with that of students in two regular ESL sections during the fall 1993 semester. In addition, analyses were included of the continued skill development of pilot students through spring 1994 and ensuing course referrals.  Results generally indicated that both the Focal Skills and comparison groups showed significant but comparable gains in reading and writing skills in the fall 1993 semester. Spring semester measurement showed that pilot students continued to make marked gains. Comparisons of the spring 1994 semester course referrals indicated a nonsignificant tendency for higher level course referrals for the pilot group students. At best, the results constituted marginal evidence for the effectiveness of the Focal Skills pilot. However, since the control and pilot students were not randomly assigned and were self-selected, caution must be taken in interpreting these findings and it is recommended that a second year pilot and evaluation be conducted. Data tables and a description of ESL courses at the  college are attached. (Author/KP)",

All full-time employees were given a copy of the report and biographies of the Kansas state appointed accreditation team members prior to the visit. The campus was spruced up in honor of the occasion and a hospitality committee made sure  the team was comfortable. During the week following the visit, the steering committee decided to continue to develop strategies to assure implementation of team recommendations. The committee drafted a set of goals and objectives for the school president who reappointed the committee as the &quot;NCA Monitoring Committee,&quot; to be responsible for: (1) addressing team recommendations; (2) monitoring the progress of implementation; (3) keeping a written account of accomplishments; and (4) assuring that all recommendations became a part of institutional goals and objectives.

The concept of a continuum of services is central within the framework, in the belief that when service providers link together to provide continuity, the connections they establish provide smooth transitions for children and their families. In reviewing the various attempts over the past two decades to address the problem of transition to school, the document discusses the value of early intervention, the definition of horizontal and vertical continuity, and the design of a continuum of services. The document discusses each of eight elements which, together, constitute the framework and represent broad areas of concern that  must be addressed to ensure continuity. These elements are: (1) shared leadership and decision making; (2) comprehensive and integrated services for children and their families; (3) education, involvement, and empowerment of families; (4) sensitivity to home culture and home language; (5) communication; (6) joint staff development (7) developmentally appropriate practice; and (8) evaluation. Indicators, levels of practice, and detailed references are given for each element. Approximately 170 references are cited. (SM)",

        "description":"Since 1980, at least 8 states and more than 200 localities have developed programs that deliver a variety of health, social, and education services at or near schools. Many of the students served by these programs are at risk of failing in school or dropping out. These comprehensive school-linked programs are attempting to improve the educational performance and well-being of at-risk, school-age children by addressing their multiple needs in a coordinated manner at school sites. This report reviews such school-linked programs that provide students with at least three of four primary services--health, education, social services, and employment training--from the school site. The body of the report describes the background of the study and summarizes principal findings,  specifically why programs vary and what common elements they share. Appendix 1 explains the objectives, scope, and methodology used to review the delivery of human services at schools. Appendix 2 describes the following school-linked programs, including problems encountered: (1) School-Based Youth Services Program, New Jersey; (2) Kentucky Integrated Delivery System and Family Resource and Youth Services Centers; (3) Texas Communities in Schools; (4) Effective Schools Initiative for Homeless Children and Youth Program, Seattle, Washington; (5) Lawrence New Futures Initiative, Lawrence, Massachusetts; (6) Chatham-Savannah Youth Futures Authority; Savannah, Georgia; (7) New Futures School, Albuquerque, New Mexico; (8) Family Learning Center, Leslie, Michigan; (9) Linn County Youth Service  Teams, Oregon; (10) Madison Park Humphrey Center High School, Boston, Massachusetts; and (11) New Beginnings, San Diego, California. Appendix 3 contains summary evaluations on the effectiveness of 6 programs, 5 of which suggest that comprehensive school-linked programs can have a positive short-term impact on improving academic achievement and reducing absenteeism and dropout rates.

Emphasis is placed on the need for understanding the processes of human development as a vital component of the planning process, noting that such an understanding starts with recognizing the social nature of the human species and the powerful impact that social environments have on human development. The first section of this report explains how contemporary social structures and practices affect individual and collective development. Topics explored  include: (1) basic needs for positive human development during infancy, early childhood, transition to school, puberty, and adulthood; (2) the impact of the social environment on human development; (3) information technology and the creation of new learning opportunities; and (4) the necessity for linkage and integration in developing a conceptual framework and a common language. Subsequent sections of the report examine in greater detail the current dilemmas of modern technological societies, developments in the human sciences that inform any attempts to make important decisions, and the relevance of this information to economics and health. Other topics discussed are the social cost of failure, family sociology and behavioral epidemiology, and building a new framework for understanding  the determinants of human development.

        "description":"Noting the while there may be much support for the principle that families on welfare should have access to 2 years of education and training and then be expected to work, this paper contends that it will be extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, to design a coherent and constructive program within the probable federal budget constraints. In arguing why a 2-year limit, followed by work for welfare, is a bad idea, this document makes the following points: (1) the 2-year plan disregards what is known about the way many families use the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program over time; (2) imposing a 2-year clock from the moment AFDC receipt begins would force recipients to make irrational and inefficient decisions about whether and when to initiate education and  training activities; and (3) the structure appears to preclude access to what is likely to be the most promising route out of poverty for a single parent, that is, postsecondary education. The report concludes that an alternative approach that could work, and end welfare as it currently exists in the United States, should involve the restructuring of the JOBS (Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training) program. Elements in the reconceptualization of the JOBS program are discussed. (SM)",

Using age-appropriate examples, the book shows how to combat bias and negative attitudes from friends, relatives, and the media. It also provides problem solving techniques for specific situations; a resource guide to multicultural books, audiotapes, videos, dolls, and games; 11 stories from different cultures to share with children; and creative activities that celebrate a variety of cultures. Part 1 discusses the role of parents and family in the development of children's attitudes and the  importance of early cultural education. Part 2 looks at influences outside the home and family, such as school and the media. Part 3 explains how to counteract negative influences on children's attitudes and to support positive ones. Part 4 contains a variety of folktales that offer views of other peoples and cultures. The titles are: (1) \"The Earth on Turtle's Back\" (Onondaga Indians, Northeast United States); (2) \"Banh Giay and Banh Chung\" (Vietnam); (3) \"The Flight of the Animals\" (India); (4) \"Cinder Jack\" (Hungary); (5) \"How the Porcupine Outwitted the Fox\" (Honduras); (6) \"Simon and the Big Joke\" (Trinidad); (7) \"The Man Whose Luck Was Sleeping\" (Persia); (8) \"The Origin of Lamps\" and \"The Education of Goat\" (Haiti); (9) \"Treasure Mountain\" (Yao People, Southern China); (10) \"The  Baby Leopard\" (West Africa); and (11) \"Lon Po Po\" (China).

The profile of each program provides in-depth information about how the program operates. Fundamental barriers to program development and service provision are identified, and specific strategies that programs have developed to overcome these barriers are described. The first chapter of the report traces the evolution of family support programs in vulnerable communities and discusses the special issues and challenges that emerged as family support took its first step toward serving these communities. The next three chapters provide detailed descriptions of three innovative programs and the manners in which they were  developed. Those programs are Family Place in Washington, D.C.; New Beginnings of San Diego, California; and Walbridge Caring Communities Program in St. Louis, Missouri. The final chapters of the report analyze the strengths of each of the programs, describe the obstacles they faced, and provide program recommendations for others interested in serving socially vulnerable families.

It outlines the philosophy behind family resource and youth services centers and how that philosophy is to be reflected in all aspects of the program. The guide is not intended to prescribe any particular program model or the unique methods of planning, designing, financing, or evaluation of each center. Rather, planners are expected to be creative and innovative, using the ideas contained in the guide as springboards for their own thinking. Program flexibility at the local level and an emphasis on encouraging new ideas that emerge from the people participating in the  centers are the hallmarks of the family support movement throughout the country. Following an introduction, the philosophy of family resource and youth services centers is discussed. A section on center planning outlines the following eight steps: (1) establishing an advisory council; (2) completing a needs/resources assessment; (3) determining rationale, missions, goals, and objectives; (4) designing a program; (5) assuring successful operations; (6) clarifying the oversight process; (7) thinking about the budget; and (8) planning for appropriate evaluation. Four appendices contain a statement of the premises, principles, and practices of family resource programs; a statement of program goals; an annotated bibliography of 33 items; and a sample workplan.

        "description":"Since the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, nations are obligated to submit regular reports to the international Expert Committee, which will require monitoring conditions for children. This study discusses the Norwegian Ombudsman for Children as a useful source of experience for other countries. Chapter 1 presents those trends in legal rights, child psychology, human rights, and public opinion that converged in the 1950s and 1960s to create an international concern for children's rights. Chapter 2 shows how in the last 10 to 15 years children have been seen as competent, active subjects, instead of passive objects. Chapter 3 describes developments in Norway that led to the establishment in 1981 of the Ombudsman for Children. Chapters 4 and 5 describe the  establishment of and changes in the Ombudsman, its practical work, how cases were handled, and those elements and issues of developmental psychology that were most helpful in its work. Chapter 6 evaluates the Ombudsman in terms of its own goals and of government and public opinion. Chapter 7 discusses the principal facts contributing to the achievements of the Office, and how its experience might apply to other countries. Finally, Chapter 8 examines how the Norwegian Ombudsman might serve as a model to other countries, and examines whether child-related social science (developmental psychology in particular) can improve conditions for children in work conducted at a national level. The study contains approximately 200 references, five appendixes, the text of the United Nations Convention,  and a list of publications. (TM)",

        "description":"Based on classroom observations, developmental assessment, individual educational planning, and research, this curriculum describes developmentally appropriate practices to assist adults who work with young children (primarily 3-year-olds) in providing quality care and education. Chapter 1 sets out the study's specific questions, procedures, definitions, and limitations. Chapter 2 describes the goals and objectives of the curriculum which are specified in three areas of development, cognitive, socio-emotional, and physical growth. The following topics are discussed and amplified with suggestions: (1) developmentally appropriate practices in daily, weekly, and long-term planning; (2) active-learning experiences; (3) indoor and outdoor activities; (4) consistent daily routine; (5)  classroom and outdoor environments that promote social-cognitive levels of play; and (6) three important processes used by adults to influence children's play (reinforcement, modeling and imitation, and modeling and instruction). Additional developmental activities that adults (as parents or teachers) can provide for preschoolers are also suggested. Chapter 3 describes observation and testing of 3-year-olds in 2 day care centers in Washington, D.C. using the Brigance Development Record Book, which allowed children to respond at their level of development. Results of this testing were used to organize an outline for writing the curriculum. Chapter 4 gives answers and findings to 7 specific questions about the skills and development of 3-year-olds. Chapter 5 provides conclusions and  recommendations for current educational studies. The curriculum concludes with a bibliography and four appendices that include a sample schedule, learning objectives, content area planning guides and a recipe for curriculum planning. (TM)",

The broad-based research team included members from faculties of education, boards of education, early childhood education programs, a research consulting firm, child development researchers, and teacher-practitioners. The study began with the collection of background information from the literature on kindergarten practice. This literature review was divided into three areas that form the foundation of the child's development during kindergarten--play and problem solving, language and literacy, and social-emotional development through interaction with peers and teachers. Issues of special importance to exemplary practice in French-language schools were also reviewed,  highlighting the importance of placing the kindergarten program in its social context. The role of the teacher, another critical feature of exemplary programs, was also reviewed. The final part of the study consisted of collecting the views of teachers, principals, consultants, and parents on what defines exemplary kindergarten practice. The study indicated agreement across practitioner groups with the play-based child-centered philosophy articulated by the Ontario Ministry of Education. Parents were also supportive of these developmentally appropriate goals and methods. Conclusions drawn from the study include several principles inherent to exemplary kindergarten programs: (1) focusing on the whole child; (2) placing the child in social context; (3) recognizing and supporting the  teacher; (4) working toward structured and balanced programs; and (5) providing school and societal support for kindergarten.

One of these trends is toward the expansion and redefinition of early childhood education to include all educational experiences for children from birth to 8 years of age. Another trend is the increased interest in developmentally appropriate education, which takes into account what is known about how young children develop and learn, and matches that to the content and strategies planned for them in early childhood programs. A third trend is the renewed interest in integrated curricula. One approach to this is thematic organization, in which skills, facts, and subject-matter knowledge are integrated around a unifying theme. A fourth trend is toward  the authentic assessment of children's learning, which is \"the process of observing, recording, and otherwise documenting the work children do and how they do it, as a basis for a variety of educational decisions that affect a child.\" Another trend is increased interest in mixed-age groupings in preschools and nongraded education in early primary grade programs. A final trend is toward multicultural education and anti-bias curricula in early childhood in response to rapidly growing minority populations, and increasing cultural pluralism and global awareness.

        "description":"Although child development laboratory programs continue to be important players in the child development and early childhood arenas, these programs face a number of emerging issues and challenges as they seek to solidify their support on campuses nationwide. Child development lab programs have been charged to serve as: (1) sites for personnel training in child development and early childhood education; (2) research sites; and (3) leaders in local, state, and national early childhood communities. Presently, many university-based child development lab programs are faced with threatened cutbacks or closures, due to the shrinking resources available at most state colleges and universities, the blurring of the roles and missions of lab programs, and the low priority placed by society  on the education and training of child-care providers. Despite these trends, two phenomena are reviving interest in child development lab programs: the increased demand for child care at a time of serious concern over the quality, availability, and affordability of such programs; and the recent emphasis placed on research examining child development within individual, family, community, and societal contexts. Four interrelated issues need to be addressed to build support for these programs; (1) expanding program services; (2) reevaluating personnel training functions; (3) revitalizing model programs/leadership activities; and (4) expanding research opportunities.

Following welcoming remarks by Carolyn Slack, two presentations discuss improving urban maternal and child health (MCH) linkages. &quot;Pittsburgh's Alliance for Infants,&quot; by Virginia Bowman, describes a comprehensive in-home follow-up program serving very low birthweight babies and their families. &quot;The Case of Orange County, California's 'Child Health Network,' A Public/Private Partnership,&quot; by Len Foster, Anthony R. Edmonds and David Ward, discusses the Child Health and Disability Prevention Program. It describes the treatment unit of the program and also includes comments by one of the health care providers participating in the program. The next two presentations focus  on the role of urban health departments in Medicaid managed care. &quot;Publicly Funded Managed Care and Children's Health, An Urban Perspective,&quot; by Magda G. Peck addresses some of the issues and concerns associated with managed care programs. &quot;Lessons from Boston, Massachusetts,&quot; by Lillian Shirley relates experience with Medicaid managed care in Boston, Massachusetts. Conference closing remarks are by Kathy Carson. The second section of the report presents profiles of successful urban MCH programs. It includes profiles of urban health department initiatives from over 90 cities in the United States. This section also includes conference profiles in the following categories: (1) improving outcomes of pregnancy; (2) improving access to health care; (3) improving primary and preventive care for  children; (4) improving primary and preventive care for adolescents; (5) reducing and treating substance abuse; and (6) improving urban public health systems.

The Starting Points Preschool Program was initiated in 1992-93 through the United States Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 in order to improve the availability, affordability, and quality of child care services. Federal regulations associated with this program require that both parents or guardians of the children be working or enrolled in job training or education programs and that families meet a household income requirement. The purpose of the Starting Points Preschool Program is to provide quality early childhood education services to children who meet the two  previously stated federal criteria, as well as three state-specified criteria of age, at-risk status, and parent or guardian agreement to participate in program activities. Following an introduction that includes tables on program funding and participation, the report presents tables of data in six categories. The six categories are: (1) applicant information; (2) enrollment data and characteristics of classes; (3) demographic characteristics of the Starting Points participating children; (4) eligibility criteria and parent or guardian data; (5) parental involvement; and (6) program assessment data. Each of these sections includes a summary statement. A final summary of the report includes tables on program characteristics and on comparison of the programs 2 years of operation.

        "description":"This report describes a program for improving academic productivity in an elementary school in Rockford, Illinois. Students were unmotivated, unproductive, and uninvolved in academic life, as measured by teacher observation and student behavior. Examination of teacher records revealed that the learning disabled or behavior disordered resource target students (6 sixth-graders) were completing, on average, less than half of their assigned work with a passing grade. Surveys and interviews of teachers, classroom observations, grades, and attendance records showed target students lacked motivation and organizational skills to complete an acceptable percentage of their homework; and some students had poor academic skills and parental support. Based upon a review of the literature, an  intervention with three main parts was implemented: teacher use of motivation techniques to increase student involvement; instruction in organizational skills; and teacher use of techniques for increasing students' academic output. An evaluation of the 20-week project showed all symptoms of the original problem were reduced: motivation for academic success improved, assignment completion increased, parent involvement increased, and student behavior and study skills improved.

        "description":"In the wake of administrative reforms, curriculum revisions, and assessment requirements introduced in New Zealand in the late 1980s that increased workloads and stress for teachers, a survey studied the roles and workloads of primary school teachers. How workloads have changed, and how resulting pressures affected teachers' professional work, students, life outside school, health, and views of their future in teaching were also examined. Twenty-nine schools and 160 teachers were surveyed. Results regarding teacher work roles indicated that: (1) about one-third of teachers had some non-class-contact time; (2) teachers whose hours increased gained just under 2 hours per week; (3) teachers in smaller schools carried a greater number of extra-classroom responsibilities than those in  larger schools; (4) responsibilities in larger schools were more dispersed, though senior teachers with more service had more responsibilities; and (5) most teachers had some curriculum responsibility, which increased with age and seniority. Results regarding workloads indicated that: (1) the weekly mean was 54.5 hours (6 during weekends), with a mean of 23.9 hours spent in the classroom and 11.7 hours in preparation; (2) workloads appeared to be uniformly high for all types of teachers, but permanent teachers and those in small schools tended to work longer; (3) all teachers perceived workloads as clearly higher than in 1989, with two thirds rating loads as very heavy or above and 64% believing loads would increase; and (4) teachers regarded the impact of these changes negatively,  particularly as they affected life outside school. Results regarding work pressures indicated that the six most stressful factors (principally the amount and nature of paperwork) were clearly associated with the educational reforms. Also teachers in mid-size schools tended to find change affecting them more severely than those in other size schools. Results very clearly indicate high levels of stress within the profession.

Portfolios can be used to form a total judgment of what is needed for the child's further growth, based on daily events of the classroom, without interrupting the class day. They also allow the teacher to know more about students, while developing the child's own self-assessment, which in turn encourages more discussion between teacher and student. Portfolio assessment was adapted to a preschool classroom in a university laboratory school. Each child was given an accordion-style folder. Portfolios were organized around four areas of development: physical development, social and emotional development, emergent literacy development, and logico-mathematical development. For each  area there was a checklist, and evidence was included to back up the checklist. At certain points during the school year, the teacher met with each parent to discuss the portfolio, results, and goals for the child. The portfolio was sent to the child's kindergarten teacher as a record of what was accomplished in preschool. Portfolio assessment is a worthwhile endeavor with preschoolers, giving the children a foundation for making judgments about themselves and giving teachers useful information in the evaluation process.

        "description":"Kindergarten Plus, a program for disabled and non-disabled kindergarten students in an integrated classroom setting, was implemented in 5 New York City classrooms serving 99 kindergartners. The program's implementation and student outcomes were evaluated at the end of the first year. Classroom observation and staff interviews revealed that the Kindergarten Plus program provided a developmentally appropriate learning environment that encouraged children's language, cognitive abilities, social skills, and emotional development. Teachers used an appropriate balance of small-group, individualized, and whole-group instruction, and a variety of child-directed and teacher-guided activities. Teachers also used English as a Second Language (ESL) and multicultural strategies and materials  in the classroom, and participating ESL students showed substantial gains in English language proficiency. The high ratio of classroom staff to children allowed for more individualized attention to children, but also necessitated the use of team teaching and increased staff communication. A comparison of the Kindergarten Plus average attendance rate with the city-wide attendance rates revealed only minor differences. Program staff participated in a variety of staff development workshops and cited those on multicultural education, staff collaboration, and instructional strategies for integrated instruction as being most helpful. Parent workshops were offered at all of the Kindergarten Plus sites. Teachers gave high praise to the Kindergarten Plus program and maintained that the integrated  setting helped both general education and special education children to work together and to respect similarities and differences in one another.

Specifically, it examined whether kindergarten teachers believed it was more effective to teach values implicitly as compared to teaching values both implicitly and explicitly. Also investigated was the reason why teachers might avoid teaching values explicitly. Twenty-seven kindergarten teachers in central Virginia were surveyed. The survey contained five pairs of methods for teaching the value of honesty. One method of each pair was implicit only; the other method was implicit and explicit. Teachers chose the method they thought would be more effective for conveying the value of honesty. The survey found that the combination of implicit and explicit methods was judged more  successful than just implicit methods for teaching the value of honesty. Most teachers did include explicit teaching of values; teachers believed those who taught values only implicitly did so because they did not think explicit teaching of values was effective. For example, it is possible that teachers of other grades would not agree that it is effective to teach values to their students both implicitly and explicitly.

The paper then explores ways that questions can be used to make language more responsive. Questions can be used to: (1) communicate positive attitudes and encourage thinking and learning; (2) stimulate language development and cognitive development; (3)  enhance self-esteem; (4) manage behavior appropriately; and (5) promote inclusion of special needs children.

        "description":"In recent years, a number of claims have appeared in the popular media and press suggesting that television viewing has potentially detrimental effects on human brain development or activity. An extensive review of the published scientific literature finds that virtually no credible experimental evidence appears to exist in the current literature which specifically relates to the effects of television viewing on human brain development. A review of the scientific literature based upon the measurement of small electrical signals from the surface of the scalp as an indicator of cortical brain activity during television viewing revealed two major experimental findings. First, brain wave patterns occurring during TV viewing are quite similar to those that occur during other  waking-state activities, suggesting that television viewing should not be characterized as producing a passive or inattentive activity in the brain. Second, television viewing does not appear to be primarily a &quot;right brain&quot; activity. Rather, both cortical hemispheres are involved in the information processing associated with the complex sensory and perceptual experiences that accompany television viewing. New research opportunities for investigating the relationships between television viewing and brain activity should emerge from advances in technology. However, television remains deeply embedded in a complex array of social and cultural factors and is subject to a broad spectrum of individual differences in information-processing capacity, perception, and cognition.

        "description":"A study examined the effect of extreme marital discord, involving abuse of the mother, on maternal parenting style and level of maternal stress. It was hypothesized that battered women experience a higher level of maternal stress and choose an authoritarian parenting style as a consequence of marital discord. Subjects were 30 mothers of children aged 3 months through 10 years. Fifteen mothers were in discordant marital relationships and were in a shelter for battered women. A comparison group of 15 mothers in nondiscordant relationships also participated. Average age of the subjects was 30. Subjects completed the Parenting Stress Index and participated in interviews to determine parenting style. Results indicated a statistically significant difference between groups in the mean  total stress scores. With respect to parenting styles, no significant differences were found between the two groups in any of the parenting styles. Therefore, at least with this sample of maritally discordant mothers, the marital relationships may not have had an impact on their parenting style. Twelve of the maritally discordant mothers exhibited a preference for the authoritative parenting style, while 13 of the nondiscordant mothers preferred this style. The results suggest that experiencing marital violence has a significant effect on the level of maternal stress but not a significant effect on maternal parenting style. (Three appendixes contain copies of the Parental Stress Index, the parenting style interview, and interview response sheet.) (HTH)",

        "description":"A study evaluated the effectiveness of a parent education program in increasing school readiness in poor and high-needs children. Participants in the Parents and Children Together program (PACT) of Binghamton, New York, receive home visits from trained and certified parent educators, beginning when a child is born and continuing until he or she is 3 years old. The parent educators provide information about child development and parenting, and refer parents to other agencies when needed. The program also provides developmental screening tests, parent group meetings, and a lending library of child development sources and age-appropriate toys. Subjects for this program evaluation were twenty 4- and 5-year-old graduates of the PACT program and a matched control group of 20 children  whose families had not participated in the program. The cognitive, language, and physical development of the PACT graduates was compared with that of the control subjects. Results indicated that the experimental group had significantly higher scores on all measures than did the control group. The following year, kindergarten screening and readiness test scores, as well as kindergarten attendance, grades, and special education referrals from all program participants were compared to those of all other children entering first grade. Again, program participants showed superior performance. Regression analyses of performance models showed higher coefficients for program participation than for other preschool experiences such as Head Start or private preschool attendance. A cost-benefit  analysis showed evidence of substantial financial savings in implementation of the PACT program. (HTH)",

        "description":"Recent theory and research suggest that peer conflict contributes to children's development and represents an important form of social interaction. Research has identified structural features of children's conflict as issues, such as control of objects or physical space; strategies, including aggressive and nonaggressive physical and verbal tactics; and outcomes, such as an unresolved situation, an adult-imposed solution, one child's submission to another, or a mutually agreed-upon solution. Studies of children's conflicts indicate that age makes a difference in conflict resolution; the role of gender, however, is not as clear. Children's conflicts during play are influenced by the play setting, the children's prior relationships, and the presence of adults. Disputes are more  likely to occur in closed than open play areas, children who were playing together before a conflict are more likely to resolve the conflict than children who were not playing together, and children more often generate their own solutions to conflicts when an adult is absent than when an adult is present. Implications for teachers and parents can be drawn from the research on children's conflicts. Teachers should: (1) be aware of children's intentions in an apparent conflict; (2) let children who are verbally competent try to resolve their conflict themselves; (3) note whether children were playing together before the conflict; (4) make play spaces accessible and provide ample play materials; and (5) help children, in conflicts characterized by physical strategies, to find words to use to  express their feelings.

        "description":"To help parents address those aspects of their child's development which may need special encouragement, support, or intervention, this digest delineates 11 categories of behavior for assessment. Parents should not be alarmed if their children are having difficulty in only a few categories, and they should not judge their children's permanent behavior based on 1 day's observation. The categories are: (1) sleeping habits; (2) eating habits; (3) toilet habits; (4) range of emotions; (5) friendship; (6) variations in play; (7) responses to authority; (8) curiosity; (9) interest; (10) spontaneous affection; and (11) enjoyment of the &quot;good things in life.&quot; Concerning these categories, parents should ask whether their child usually falls asleep easily and wakes up rested; eats with  appetite; has bowel and bladder control, especially during the day; shows the capacity for a range of emotions over a period of time; initiates and maintains satisfying relationships with peers; varies his or her play and adds different elements to the play; accepts adult authority; exhibits curiosity and adventure; becomes absorbed and interested in something outside him- or herself; expresses spontaneous affection for caregivers; and enjoys the pleasures of childhood. The first 3 of the 11 categories are particularly sensitive indicators of children's well-being because the child has control of them. The other criteria are more culture-bound. When children are having problems with some of these areas of development, they can sometimes be helped when adults simply spend more time with  them, or when the children's daily routines are simplified.

        "description":"Minority engineering programs (MEPs) were established in the late 1970s to recruit minority students to engineering education and reduce their dropout rate. MEPs at 20 engineering schools were examined in relation to institutional environment; pre-enrollment activities; and services that encourage community building, provide academic support, and enhance students' personal and professional development. Data from interviews with program staff, faculty members, university staff, and current and former students were analyzed. Eight of the 20 universities were identified as being the most successful in recruiting and graduating minority students. MEPs at these universities tended to recruit the best qualified students directly from high schools, establish summer programs that stress  study and critical thinking skills, provide study centers, have sufficient supplies of tutors available to intervene when students had academic problems, and have higher levels of university funding when compared to other programs. Although enrollment figures for minority students in engineering programs have increased, the attrition gap between minority and nonminority students remains. Recommendations largely target universities and include the need for increasing institutional support for MEPs, increasing student financial aid, increasing the number of minority engineering faculty, addressing diversity issues, and initiating longitudinal studies to better understand MEP participants and dropouts.

Hispanic Americans are proportionately more likely to suffer from AIDS than any other minority group, and health officials predict there will be a seven-fold increase in the number of AIDS cases among Hispanics over the next 4 years. Barriers affecting the Hispanic response to AIDS include the belief that AIDS is a White gay male disease, the lack of culturally sensitive and appropriate education and prevention programs, and insufficient federal funding preventing Hispanic community groups from effectively serving Hispanic populations. In December 1987, the National Council of La Raza and the Centers for Disease Control organized a  meeting of Hispanic community leaders concerning AIDS. In response to the recommendations of these leaders, the National Council of La Raza will (1) provide technical assistance to affiliates and other Hispanic groups to carry out AIDS-related programs; (2) assist community-based organizations to develop culturally sensitive and regionally focused educational materials; (3) develop an information center on AIDS for community-based organizations; and (4) carry out applied research and policy analysis on specific issues related to AIDS in the Hispanic community.

        "description":"During 1968-91, middle schools were the only school type to grow in number, increasing by over 400 percent. Middle school advocates focus on early adolescents' need for developmentally appropriate institutions, but show only a weak historical understanding of the emergence and status of middle schools. Critical factors in early support for the middle school movement included urban interests in countering de facto school segregation without use of busing, urban overcrowding of elementary and high schools, and a &quot;bandwagon effect&quot;--the desire to appear modern and reform oriented. The emergence of rural middle schools under the cloak of psychological progress can be destructive to both the declining sense of community in America, and to the actual persistence of many rural  communities still organized around K-8 or K-6 public elementary schools. Examination of the National Center for Education Statistics's Common Core of Data indicates that the construction of rural middle schools has led to the closing and consolidation of rural elementary schools. During the school years 1987/88-1991/92 the proportion of schools that were middle schools increased 20 percent in rural areas, was unchanged in suburban areas, and decreased 6 percent in urban areas. At the same time, the proportion of rural schools that were K-8 declined precipitously. Emerging school reform agendas that provide alternatives to the &quot;inevitability&quot; of consolidation include efforts to restructure schools as caring communities (requiring active parent and community participation), and the  development of rural schools as centers for integrated social services.

        "description":"This report describes the National Public Telecomputing Network's (NPTN) development of free, public-access, community computer systems throughout the United States. It also provides information on how to initiate a &quot;Free-Net&quot; through the Rural Information Network. Free-Nets are multi-user systems with some of the power and sophistication of commercial systems, yet each system is locally owned and operated, and designed according to the information needs of the local community. Because few rural areas have access to an Internet node and the technical personnel necessary to manage such a system, Free-Nets have primarily been an urban phenomenon. However, in the fall of 1993, NPTN received several grants to develop Free-Nets in rural areas. The Rural Information Network runs on  Macintosh computers and allows individual users to connect to community computers via a local phone call. Each community computer will, in turn, connect to the Internet (and to NPTN services) via periodic phone calls to the closest Internet node. NPTN services range from educational programs to access to health and medical informational services. The program has several requirements: (1) participation is limited to communities of less than 50,000 people; (2) the community must provide an institutional sponsor such as a county government or county school system, and the sponsor must develop a community-based governing board for the system; (3) the institutional sponsor or governing board must agree that the system will be a part of the NPTN-RIN program for at least 2 years; and (4) the  institutional sponsor or governing board must agree that access to all basic services will be free to the user while the community is part of the NPTN program.

        "description":"This paper discusses the market for rapidly expanding information technology and the benefits of developing community computer networks. Accessible low-cost community networks allow rural communities to provide specific training and educational opportunities tailored to their needs. However, communities must assess the value of connectivity options rather than be dazzled by technological glitz. Big Sky Telegraph (BST) began in 1988 as a rural telecomputing testbed at Western Montana College, by offering an online course via modem to rural K-12 teachers. BST customized its function and services based on advice from practicing teachers and since then has offered free access and online lessons to all citizens interested in learning the benefits of telecomputing. BST offers many  services including six community bulletin board systems; Internet E-mail; Internet self-teaching lessons; rosters of K-12 telecurricular projects; graphics; and free local and global customized databases to serve K-12 education and local citizen entrepreneurship and teleliteracy. Bulletin board systems can serve as cost-effective local networks accessing specific Internet services, as opposed to paying for full Internet connectivity. Barriers to community networking are related to enlightened self-interest versus short-term profit motives, lack of teleliteracy among leadership, fear of technology, citizen teleliteracy development needs, and control of information. This paper concludes that national, regional, and local governments should develop programs for funding grassroots innovations  toward developing community networks. (LP)",

        "description":"The Northland Wilderness Experience (NWE) was established in 1985 to provide outdoor therapeutic programs for at-risk youth from the Northland region of New Zealand. The program involved a physically challenging 10-day expedition, followed by an 18-month followup period of group outdoor activities offered every 2 weeks. By the end of 1989, 280 youth had worked through 32 expeditions run by NWE. The first four chapters examine: (1) the process of assessing change and the experiential nature of research and evaluation for NWE; (2) at-risk behavior and why youth become at-risk; (3) approaches to achieving change through the wilderness experience; and (4) profiles of youth who have attended the NWE, giving information on the nature and extent of their at-risk status. The remaining  three chapters look at the degree of personal change achieved by program participants. Because of frequent revisions of questionnaires, data were analyzed from only 250 participants. Questionnaire results following the 10-day expedition indicate that the experience had a positive impact on most youth and provided a catalyst for behavior change. Results from the Wilderness Self-Esteem Scale administered prior to the wilderness experience and 6 months afterward indicate significant decreases in behavior associated with helplessness and chronic low self-esteem and significant increases in coping behaviors associated with high self-esteem. At-risk behaviors decreased substantially, especially in relation to trouble with the law, and relations with families and friends improved. Includes the  followup questionnaire and the Wilderness Self-Esteem Scale. (LP)",

        "description":"This report summarizes perceptions of Latino teachers concerning their professional preparation, their working environment, and school/community characteristics that affect the achievement and attainment of Latino students. A mailing of 1,252 survey questionnaires to members of the Association of Mexican American Educators was conducted. Of the 438 respondents, 156 were Latino teachers. Respondents were mostly women (77 percent), principally bilingual, had an average of 11 years teaching experience, and generally taught at the K-6 level. Fifty-five percent had earned master's degrees or credits beyond the master's level. Most teachers taught at schools that are considered &quot;low wealth,&quot; and the majority viewed overcrowded classes as a moderate or serious problem at their schools.  Sixty-two percent of respondents indicated that financial cost was a major barrier to Latinos pursuing teaching careers, along with insufficient individualized faculty counseling and poor preparation for testing requirements. Of those respondents working at the K-6 level, only 41 percent felt they were well prepared to teach Latino students and only 34 percent felt well prepared to teach limited-English-proficient students. As a group, respondents indicated a high level of satisfaction with their jobs. However, 65 percent indicated that fellow teachers had lower expectations of Latino students than of White students, and 53 percent felt that they were typecast into activities related to their ethnicity and that these activities increased their workload beyond that of the average teacher.  As a result, 51 percent of respondents plan to leave classroom teaching within the next 5 years, and half of those leaving the classroom plan on leaving education altogether. (LP)",

Based on the concept of learning communities, the program aims to reduce the isolation experienced by minority students, offer support services that help nontraditional students satisfy academic requirements, encourage professional development by linking students with minority teachers, and encourage young Latinos to consider teaching as a profession. In 1991, four university schools of education were chosen as demonstration research sites that would develop variations of a learning community model within 2 years. Sites included California State University (San Bernardino), San Diego State University, Southwest Texas State  University (San Marcos), and University of Texas at El Paso. All four enrolled substantial numbers of Latino students. Programs are described in terms of goals, target population, key components including most successful program components, number of participating students, and areas for future development. In addition, each university is described in terms of location, faculty, number of students, and focus of teacher education programs. Participants indicated that the programs relieved their sense of isolation and helped them to complete class requirements, increase their level of responsibility, and improve their study skills.

Sixty percent of respondents believed that the most urgent issue facing Pennsylvania was violent crime and strongly supported measures to reduce the irresponsible use of guns, especially by minors. The majority of respondents supported welfare reform, but lacked a clear consensus about what actions would improve the welfare system. The majority of respondents believed that doctors should help terminally ill patients to commit suicide, were willing to pay higher taxes or higher insurance premiums to provide health care for uninsured residents, and favored a law that would require employers to  provide health insurance for their employees. Additionally, the majority of respondents favored measures to reduce youth access to cigarettes. Respondents had mixed views on educational change issues, including providing condoms for high school students, allowing public school choice outside of resident district, and increasing the number of school days. Residents also responded to questions concerning property taxes, tax amnesty, and state income tax deductions for child care expenses. Responses to survey questions are broken down by rural/urban and regional residence, age, sex, marital status, parenthood status, educational level, political affiliation, and religious preference.

Data documenting the change process include archival records, participant observation, and interviews and questionnaires conducted with community members, school staff, and students in grades 7-12. The restructuring effort occured over 3 years, was teacher initiated, and was supported financially by a Carnegie Planning Grant. This paper debunks the myth of universality often ascribed to rural communities by describing the complications involved in creating school change in a rural community composed of multiple voices. A school restructuring committee made up of teachers, administrators, students, and community members developed a plan that featured high  expectations for all students, less movement between classes, heterogeneous grouping, and fewer subjects to study at one time. The plan received support from the majority of the community but also encountered persistent, vocal opposition. Eliminating school tracking was the major source of controversy. The vocal minority, made up in equal proportions of teachers, students, and community members, was dissatisfied and disaffected, arguing that the changes represented decreasing opportunities for the traditional college-bound population. This minority was overwhelmingly middle-class and high-achieving as well as relatively coherent and articulate. In the face of student transfers and dissipating community support, the school district reformulated its collective vision to accommodate the  minority without disaffecting the majority. (MNL)",

        "description":"Although the incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has been called an &quot;epidemic&quot; on some American Indian reservations, solutions for Native American women with alcohol and drug dependency problems have largely been ignored by the federal government. FAS prevention policy, originating around 1979, has been driven by the simplistic idea that women are responsible for FAS, and has focused primarily on the health of the fetuses, not of the women themselves. Long-standing policy has ignored the dearth of gender-sensitive treatment programs for women, the devastating health consequences of alcohol use for all Native Americans, and the complex conditions that give rise to alcohol dependency. Tribes, especially those in rural areas, have limited access to federal funding for FAS  prevention, and existing funding methods complicate service delivery. FAS prevention has meant, largely, that the federal government gives money to tribes to distribute educational materials and to identify those suffering from FAS, and gives money to the Centers for Disease Control and other agencies for surveillance studies. Existing FAS prevention efforts are largely unworkable due to gender insensitivity, lack of child care, social stigma, bureaucratic infighting, lack of interagency coordination, and lack of adequately trained staff. Although &quot;primary prevention workers&quot; have recently begun providing training to educators, related health education to children, and support and referral services, such workers are scarce and scattered.

The 1991-92 school year was marked by dramatic growth in the number of participants receiving MEP services in both regular and summer terms. In both terms, migrant participants were more likely to receive reading and mathematics than any other instructional service. Of the 531,841 participants reported as an unduplicated count of both terms, 80 percent were Hispanic and 11 percent were White, not Hispanic. Fifty-four percent were formerly migrant, 32 percent were currently migrant interstate, and 14 percent were currently migrant intrastate. Participation increased 22 percent from the previous year. Four percent of  participants were disabled, and 20 percent were limited English proficient. States reported achievement data in basic and advanced reading and mathematics for students in grades 2-12 using various norm-referenced models (one point in time, two points in time, pretest/posttest, and sustained gain models). Federal funding for Chapter 1 MEP was approximately $294.6 million, a 4 percent increase from the previous year. The allocation per participant was $554.

        "description":"Instructional conversation (IC) is a dialogue between teacher and learner in which prior knowledge and experiences are woven together with new material to build higher understanding. IC contrasts with the highly routinized and teacher-dominated &quot;recitation script&quot; of traditional Western schooling. IC varies in form in different cultures, as do other discourse forms. Analysis of research on the formal and informal learning of Native Americans (including Native Hawaiians) indicates that successful Native American ICs are influenced by at least four basic psychocultural factors: (1) sociolinguistics (teacher and student expectations about conversational &quot;wait time,&quot; participation structure, tempo, loudness, and nonverbal behavior); (2) cognition (Native American emphasis on the  visual/holistic approach); (3) student motivation (enhanced by the use of culturally relevant curriculum materials and by teacher respect for student autonomy); and (4) social organization (Native American emphasis on small peer-oriented work groups). The evidence suggests that the nature of classroom activity settings influences the participation and engagement of American Indian and Alaska Native students in these activities. &quot;Ideal&quot; Native American activity settings embed ICs in the social context of small student-directed units engaged in joint productive activity that contextualizes formal knowledge in the immediate experience and concerns of the learners.

        "description":"Research generally points to a negative relationship between school or district size and student achievement. When all else is held equal (particularly community or individual socioeconomic status), comparisons of schools and districts based on differences in enrollment generally favor smaller units. A recent study found that small elementary schools benefitted disadvantaged students most (by weakening the negative influence of background characteristics). A study of higher-order thinking skills found no significant differences in the performance of students in small rural high schools and those in larger high schools in more urbanized areas. Small school size is also associated with lower high school dropout rates. In spite of the apparent benefits of small school size for  adolescents, policymakers still employ a powerful rationale to justify the continued creation of larger high schools. The charge is made that small high schools cannot provide a curriculum with adequate breadth and depth to meet students' diverse needs. Yet evidence suggests that a total enrollment of 400 students is actually sufficient to allow a high school to provide an adequate curriculum. In addition, research on grade-span configuration shows that eighth-grade students achieve best in an elementary K-8 setting. If restructuring truly is an aim of school reform, then the scale of schooling is a major structural issue. Making the institution of schooling more responsive to students may require a shift in metaphor from school as organization, where bureaucratic thinking inhibits true  learning, to school as community, where learning is &quot;nurtured&quot; or &quot;cultivated.&quot; (KS)",

        "description":"The Indian Nations At Risk Task Force and the White House Conference on Indian Education suggested systemic reforms that would improve the education of Native students who attend public schools. These reforms focus on fostering intercultural harmony in schools, improving teacher preparation, developing instructional curricula and strategies that support diverse cultural needs and learning styles, including American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) parents in the education process, and adopting a new paradigm for evaluation of AI/AN student progress and success. Proven practices that establish intercultural harmony in schools include developing positive self-regard in students; increasing intergroup contact under specified conditions; introducing in-depth multicultural activities  at an early age; and engaging in activities that replace inaccurate information, negative attitudes, and discriminatory behavior. Non-Native educators need in-depth, sustained multicultural training to prepare for teaching culturally diverse student populations. A culturally relevant curriculum takes into account the interests and needs of AI/AN students and their learning strengths for visual, perceptual, and spatial information. Schools must make special efforts to include AI/AN parents, as this often improves student attitudes as well as achievement and behavior. Finally, more authentic indicators of learning, such as criterion-referenced tests or portfolios of student progress, are needed to measure AI/AN educational progress. (KS)",

A personal narrative of an Alaska Native man who grew up in the 1930s shows the importance of his native language to his cultural upbringing, and the gradual decline of native language use across the generations of his family. A contributing factor to generational language loss was the efforts of American schools to assimilate Native children, which included punishing children for speaking their traditional language. Recent findings show that learning languages in addition to English can enhance academic performance  and that developing a strong language and cultural base is strongly and positively related to high academic achievement. The conclusion reached by the Task Force and White House Conference is clear: parents, tribes, schools, and governments all have a responsibility to promote the continued use of Native languages for academic and cultural reasons. Eight recommendations for systemic change made by the conference committee responsible for language and cultural issues are listed. (KS)",

Promises and Panaceas,&quot; by Maria Robledo Montecel, discusses some major problems related to school choice and vouchers, particularly who would have the choice (families or schools), who would pay for transportation, and what would &quot;choice&quot; mean for special needs students. &quot;Ethnicity and School Performance in Bexar County,&quot; by Maria Robledo Montecel and Jose A.

From these groups' perspective, there were no high performing districts and therefore, little justification for initiating school choice plans. &quot;Rio Grande City: A Case Study in TAAS Performance,&quot; by Maria Robledo Montecel, Mercedes G.

Cardenas, describes educational strategies leading to dramatic improvements in TAAS scores in a border school district whose students are predominantly Mexican American, economically disadvantaged, and limited-English-proficient. &quot;In Search of a Label: A Commentary on School Choice,&quot; by Bradley Scott, suggests that &quot;self-initiated public school site selection&quot; or some other label replace the confusing term &quot;school choice&quot; to designate strategies that promote public school improvement through equitable and empowering choice mechanisms for  all students. &quot;School Choice: Limited Choices for Minority and the Poor,&quot; by Roy Lee Johnson, reflects on arguments for and against school choice.

The amendments reauthorize the Indian Education Act, revise existing law to improve administration of Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) education programs, and incorporate school reform legislation enacted in Goals 2000 (the Educate America Act). The Indian Education Act funds 185 BIA-operated or tribally operated schools and dormitories on 63 American Indian reservations; supplemental programs for Indian children in over 1,200 public school districts; and competitive grants to support planning, demonstration projects, fellowships and professional development for Indians, and agency administrative budgets. While reauthorizing formula grants for supplemental programs,  the amendments specify minimums for program enrollment and funding; require applicants to provide a comprehensive plan covering objectives, coordination of funds, teacher training, student evaluation, and dissemination of assessment results to parents; and require the school district to assess Indian student needs. The amendments also reauthorize the six Indian Education Technical Assistance Centers, provide educational planning grants to tribal governments, provide for revision of BIA education standards to reflect community goals, authorize new funding for Indian and Alaska Native language instruction, address the enormous backlog of needs for school construction, and change criteria for investment of endowment funds of the tribally controlled community colleges.

Recent research suggests that institutional practices in high schools have much to do with the low postsecondary participation rates of minority group students. Several innovative projects to counter such influences include community-based group tutorials and &quot;untracking&quot; of low- and high-achieving students. A number of barriers and problems reduce Hispanic rates of transfer from two- to four-year institutions and of four-year college completion. Suggestions to help students overcome alienation and other problems include support systems, guidance and counseling, minority  group organizations and cultural centers, high involvement in both social and academic life, and favorable relationships with faculty and advisers. Other related issues are the importance of financial aid for Hispanic students, the higher educational attainment of Hispanic women versus Hispanic men, the benefits of Hispanic cultural elements and Spanish-language materials in the college curriculum, and research needs.

        "description":"Resilience is a quality that characterizes children who, though exposed to significant stress and adversity in their lives, do not succumb to the school and life failures predicted for them. Recent research suggests ways that schools and communities can protect children from the threats that confront individuals and families. This digest interprets such findings for application in rural areas. The notion that schools and communities can nurture students' resilience and competence constitutes a radical shift away from the concept of &quot;at risk&quot; and its negative implications. Key protective factors found in families, schools, and communities include caring, supportive relationships; high expectations; and opportunities for social participation. Protective factors help develop  resilient children who exhibit social competence, problem-solving skills, and a clear sense of personal autonomy and purpose. Because of their comparatively greater social capital, rural communities may have a head start on developing local efforts to nurture resilience. The development of such efforts includes several elements: (1) assessing local threats and setting priorities; (2) assessing and enhancing existing support systems; (3) promoting and celebrating mentoring relationships between children and adults; and (4) collaborating across agency and institutional boundaries. Resources on resilience, mentoring, and service learning, in the literature and on the Internet, are recommended. (Contains 15 references.) (SV)",

        "description":"Recognizing the failure of American schools to educate Hispanic and other minority students, educators are searching for new strategies and discovering the powerful role that parents can play in advancing educational goals. A growing body of evidence supports the belief that involving parents in their children's education works in the best interests of students, schools, and parents themselves. However, despite recent legislative support, few schools are involving parents in meaningful ways. Barriers that block collaboration between Hispanic parents and school personnel include work interference, low parent self-confidence, limited English proficiency, cultural differences, and teacher and administrator attitudes. Parent involvement encompasses a variety of patterns focused on  home, school, or community. Successful school interventions to promote parent involvement include strategies that are social, informational, educational, supportive of the home, or leadership oriented. Appropriate training helps both teachers and parents establish an effective home-school communication network. Such programs train teachers to train parents and to learn from parents, and provide parents with an awareness of school practices and resources and the skills to support student learning at home. A successful four-way collaboration among Hispanic parents, university trainers, local businesses, and school district personnel is described that demonstrates ways to promote community support. An appendix outlines a model of integrated parent and teacher training within an inservice  curriculum. Contains 129 references. (SV)",

The entrance into what is being called the information age brings new challenges in preparing students with new skills in the areas of creative thinking, problem solving, interpersonal relations, communication, and cooperative learning. This handbook is a revision of the 1985 edition of the Teacher's Handbook for the Mathematics 9-12 Curriculum of the Standard Course of Study. Opening sections include the educational philosophy for the mathematics program, an outline of the mathematical concepts and student attitudes relative to the mathematics curriculum, the major emphases of the mathematics curriculum, expected program outcomes,  and a diagram that traces the possible pathways through the mathematics program. The remaining two sections of the document describe the competency goals and objectives for the courses offered in the Standard Course of Study and supply sample measures corresponding to those competency goals and objectives. The courses in the Standard Course of Study are as follows: (1) Pre-Algebra; (2) Algebra I-A; (3) Algebra I-B; (4) Algebra I; (5) Technical Mathematics; (6) Geometry; (7) Algebra II; (8) Advanced Mathematics; and (9) Advanced Placement Calculus.

        "description":"In the attempt to improve the quality of geometry instruction in schools, researchers and teachers alike have given considerable attention to the van Hiele theory of geometry learning and development, which proposes a series of cognitive levels through which every geometry student passes. This paper reports a study to determine the extent to which factors of age, gender, grade point average, standardized achievement test scores, and geometry achievement acted as predictors for van Hiele levels in two groups of 8th through 11th grade students (N=328): entering geometry (i.e., algebra students) and exiting geometry students. Individual variables determined to be significantly correlated with van Hiele levels among all subjects tested were class level (geometry or algebra),  standardized achievement test scores, and geometry achievement test scores. For the geometry subgroup, significant variables were standardized achievement test scores, geometry achievement test scores, and age (negative correlation). For the algebra subgroup, only the geometry achievement test scores were determined to have a significant relationship with van Hiele levels. Grade point average, grade level, and gender were determined to have no significance within any of the groupings. Appendices include Van Hiele Geometry Test, Entering Geometry Test, Exiting Geometry Test, and answer sheets. Contains 28 references. (Author/MKR)",

        "description":"Previous studies have examined the day-to-day behavior of principals in an attempt to identify specific, concrete behaviors that help teachers in their efforts toward improvement. But, there is still a gap in knowledge about principal interventions during the period in which decisions are made about prospective changes and reform, and plans for change are discussed, designed, and developed. To investigate this question, a study was conducted in select elementary schools that were identified as sites where teachers and principals had collaborated to accomplish improvements in their mathematics programs. At each elementary school, questionnaires were completed by the principal and one teacher who was actively involved in the change process, and two of the schools were chosen for  on-site visits. The items on the questionnaire and in the on-site interviews focused on four domains: (1) principals' roles and actions, (2) the events of the change process, (3) teachers' roles in the change process, and (4) contextual factors contributing to change. The Model for Successful Change, a conceptual framework consisting of the four domains, was developed. Three major implications emerged from the study: (1) The role of the principal in the change process is crucial; (2) Even traditional teachers are willing to change their teaching methods and beliefs when empowered to make the decisions that impact their classrooms; and (3) A collaborative planning structure is successful.

The questions were formulated by speaking with teachers and teacher educators. Variations of the questions are frequently asked by both experienced and novice teachers. A wide range of answers are presented in a triangulated approach. The first perspective for each question is the teacher's response, the second perspective, the responses of hands-on science developers, and the third perspective comes from a review of the literature in science education that incorporates findings, conclusions, assertions, and recommendations that seem to respond in spirit to the questions posed. The chapters in this book include: (1) What is hands-on learning, and is it just a fad?  (2) What are the benefits of hands-on learning? How do I justify a hands-on approach? (3) How does a hands-on science approach fit into a textbook-centered science program? (4) How can practicing teachers gain experience with hands-on methods? (5) Where do I find resources to develop hands-on activities? (6) How is hands-on learning evaluated? (7) What are some strategies for helping students work in groups? (8) How does or should the use of hands-on materials vary with age? (9) Hands-on science can be expensive. How do I get materials and equipment? and (10) Where do you keep materials and equipment once you get them?

In CGI classrooms students spend most of their time solving problems. Little work is focused explicitly on the mastering of counting, basic facts, or computational algorithms. The article discusses knowledge about children's thinking, what research has shown about CGI, teachers, children, successful implementation, and the longitudinal study of CGI in primary schools, including: development of educational materials, urban settings, and  preservice education. The study finds there is a pervasive view held by teachers, students, and the public that equates with telling students what to learn and how to learn it rather than with guiding students' learning process. Changes in instructional practices must accompany changes in materials. (MKR)",

This article describes findings from a preliminary study which sought information on middle school mathematics teachers' conceptions of teaching, their pedagogical and content knowledge, and their teaching behaviors. Data were obtained on teacher characteristics by conducting extensive interviews, an assessment of content knowledge, and observations during a series of 3-hour  seminars over a 3-month period. A framework containing five categories of conceptions of mathematics teaching was used. The five categories are: what mathematics is, what it means to learn mathematics, what it means to teach mathematics, what the roles of the teacher and the students should be, and what constitutes evidence of student knowledge and criteria for judging correctness, accuracy, or acceptability of mathematical results and conclusions. Findings revealed that these teachers: focused on problem solving, conceptual relationships and understanding, and communication in mathematics; had a comprehensive knowledge of the mathematics they were teaching; and participated in their own professional growth by attending conferences and inservice programs, completing graduate studies, and  continuing to seek encouragement and support for their reform efforts.

        "description":"This paper describes an experiment that investigated the effects of goals and self-evaluation on self-regulation processes and achievement outcomes of (n=44) fourth grade students who received instruction and practice on fraction operations. Half of the students were provided with the goal of learning how to solve problems (learning goal) and the other half were given a goal of solving problems (performance goal). Within each goal condition, half of the students regularly assessed their problem-solving capabilities. Providing a learning goal with or without opportunities for self-evaluation or a performance goal with self-evaluation led to higher self-regulated performance, self-efficacy, skill, and task orientation, as well as lower ego orientation, compared with providing a  performance goal without self-evaluation. The learning goal with self-evaluation led to greater persistence than the performance goal without self-evaluation. Task orientation correlated positively with self-efficacy and skill, and ego orientation related negatively to these measures. Implications of the results for educational practice are discussed.

        "description":"Results of surveys and studies suggest that too few African-American and female students aspire to and achieve doctoral degrees in biological sciences. It has also been suggested that gender and racial inequities exist in teaching and research faculties in higher education, especially in the biomedical sciences. Thus, few role models are available to encourage young students to seek courses or careers in these fields. The purpose of the Graduate Achievement Program (GAP) is to identify and recruit talented minority undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need and to provide a summer institute designed to introduce them to the opportunities and excitement of careers in the biomedical sciences. GAP was designed to provide educational resources to bolster learning  abilities, build academically on the educational foundation already present, provide the opportunity to actively participate in all aspects of biomedical research, and familiarize students with the demands of graduate school through interaction with doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows. The current paper is a description of the first year of GAP including recruitment, program activities, curriculum, student descriptions, schedules, student evaluations of the program, goals and objectives, and future directions of GAP. Appendices include student demographics, student percentile ranks on Woodcock-Johnson Subtests, GAP weekly schedule of events, and a list of presentations made by GAP students.

        "author":["Wilkins, Cynthia W."],
        "description":"This paper discusses an experiment designed to determine the effects of a problem-solving approach to instruction (PSAI) on eighth grade Algebra I students. Comparisons were made of the scores from the 1991 and 1993 Subject Area Testing Program--Algebra I of skills taught via PSAI and skills taught traditionally. In 1991 (n=56) eighth grade Algebra I students were taught seven skills traditionally and four skills via PSAI. Additional students (n=18) were taught all skills traditionally. Mean scores on the four PSAI skills were significantly higher than the mean scores on the seven skills taught traditionally. In 1993, eighth grade students (n=51) were taught all skills via PSAI and (n=44) students were taught traditionally. Mean scores showed no significant difference between  performance on the four skills and the seven skills for either the PSAI or control groups. However, mean scores on the seven skills taught traditionally in 1991 but via PSAI in 1993 increased significantly. It can be concluded that utilizing a problem-solving approach to teaching Algebra I students resulted in higher mean scores. The paper includes additional evidence that the problem-solving technique helps increase retention and provides better transferability for higher level mathematics classes. (Author/MKR)",

These materials have been carefully screened and selected for their usefulness in reviewing the curriculum, evaluating instructional materials, conducting professional development, and promoting parent/school partnerships. Many can be used directly with students in the classroom. There are three sections to this guide. Part 1, \"Print Materials,\" provides information to assist educators in exploring the underlying causes and subtle barriers that  discourage so many students from recognizing the relevance and usefulness of science and math to their lives and future careers. Part 2, \"Resources for Career Information,\" lists information on careers in science and technology published in booklet or pamphlet form by associations, professional societies, nonprofit groups and corporations; the pamphlets are grouped together under the name of the publisher or the originator. Part 3, \"Films, Videotapes, Slides and Audio Tapes,\" supports the work of integrating gender and cultural diversity into the classroom and of providing professional development for educators.

        "description":"As the current reform effort in school mathematics education continues to gain momentum, an understanding of the process by which teachers make changes in their instructional practices becomes increasingly important. The first part of this paper describes a model for teacher change using an extension of the constructivist model for learning. According to the model, six factors drive the teacher change process: (1) experiencing a perturbation, (2) having a commitment to change, (3) constructing a vision of what specific changes might look like within a teacher's own classroom, (4) projecting the teacher's self into that vision, (5) deciding to make changes within a given context, and (6) being a reflective practitioner. The remainder of the paper describes a case study designed to  test the model. A middle school teacher was chosen as a subject for the study, which found that each of the six factors was demonstrated by the subject. A vignette illustrates how each of the six factors reveals itself. An appendix contains the activities used in the study. Contains 18 references. (MKR)",

        "description":"Teachers often maintain that there is very little classroom time available for student inquiry which leads to in-depth questioning of subject matter, and improves performance levels. In addition, teachers often assert that there is little time for unit planning. To examine these problems, a group of teachers (n=24) were involved in a study designed to obtain insight regarding the following questions: (1) how do teachers who use the instructional process model understand a generative learning model (a form of inquiry teaching) when presented as the preferred model for teaching science in the elementary school?; (2) what are specific points of conflict between the two models?; (3) what are points where the models are complementary?; and (4) how can generative learning model be  communicated effectively to a broader range of teachers? The results indicated that these teachers felt that it was easier to teach using the traditional instructional process model largely because of the added skills and attitudes that must be considered in generative teaching. Also included in the article are points of conflict and similarity of the two models and implications for teacher education. (ZWH)",

The research sample consisted of 128 college algebra students enrolled in a north-central Florida community college. There were eight classes of students: six treatment classes and two control classes. All classes were intact, thus random assignment of students to the  classes was not possible. Two classes were in each of the following groups: Graphing Calculator and Assignment Group, Graphing Calculator Only Group, Assignment Only Group, and the Control Group. The analysis of covariance was used to examine mean differences on two instruments between the four groups in the study. The Domain/Range/Scale Instrument and the Identification/Construction/Definition Instrument were both administered as pretests and posttests. The results of the study suggest that the treatments were in various ways interactively and independently effective regarding the students' understanding of the concept of function.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between students' classroom experiences and the manner in which they construct mathematical meanings. Two intertwined research foci guided this investigation: (1) how students make sense of and utilize mathematics  concepts and operations, and (2) the social context within which teachers' and students' individual contributions play a role in the sense making and utilization of mathematics concepts and skills. Data were collected from classroom observations and videotaping sessions and from subsequent video-stimulated interviews with six students in each of two year 5 classes in two different government schools in the metropolitan area of a large city in Western Australia. Analysis revealed the existence of four primary sources by which students determined the meaning or correctness of mathematical activity: the teacher, intuition, familiarity, and procedural knowledge. Second, in relation to the social level, the teacher emerged as playing the most valued role in the sense making and ratifying of  procedures or answers. Contains 13 references. (MKR)",

Single-sex settings as the preferred option for improving schooling for girls have evoked fierce advocates as well as critics.

Important dimensions of the study included surveying students in as well as out of the program, seeking the reactions of parents to this initiative, and the opportunity to assess the effect of the introduction of such  classes at grade 10 instead of at lower grades (7 and 8), where such interventions have more typically been tried. Results include: (1) Both female students and mothers were more favorably inclined towards the single-sex mathematics program than were their male counterparts; (2) Performance levels for males and females were not significantly different throughout the project year; and (3) Anticipated and actual subject choices for grade 11 were no different for males and females; however, anticipated subject choices for grade 12 showed more differences between males and females than past state average statistics.

        "description":"There is substantial empirical evidence showing the impact of the type of numbers in the solution of problems with a multiplicative structure. The theory of the intuitive models of arithmetic operations is today the most plausible theoretical account for these findings. In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of the effects of number type, a study was carried out in which student-generated word problems were used as data to test a series of predictions derived from the theory of the intuitive models. Subjects were 107 12-year-olds, 107 15-year-olds, and 99 elementary student teachers in Belgium. Results concerning the influence of the type of number sentence on performance are reviewed and the congruence of the generated problems with the primitive models are  discussed. Several findings of this study support the theory of Fischbein et al. (1985) that the selection of an operation for solving multiplication problems is mediated by primitive intuitive models of the arithmetic operation. (Author/MKR)",

        "description":"The purpose of this two-year study was to document and examine changes in four teachers' beliefs and practices while implementing National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' (NCTM) mathematics standards. Qualitative research methodology was used to develop multiple case studies, which were analyzed individually and across cases. Data came from interviews, observations, journals, attitude and belief surveys, and videotapes. The participants were four elementary-certified teachers in a suburb of a large urban area in a midwestern state who volunteered to teach 6th grade mathematics full-time. The teachers were supported during implementation by colleagues, administrators, professional development resources, and availability of materials. Problems reported included limited  knowledge of: (1) NCTM's mathematics standards, (2) current mathematics teaching methodologies, and (3) mathematics content. Documented changes included an increase in student-centered activities, the use of manipulatives and calculators, and good questioning techniques. There were also increases in student participation, teacher and student attitudes toward mathematics, use of alternative assessment, and a change in the beliefs of teachers about mathematics teaching and learning.

It is for this reason that many have begun to look at methods of assessment when considering the improvement of education. This document presents a discussion of performance based assessment. This method of assessment requires that students complete, demonstrate, or perform the actual behavior of interest. It is noted that the textbook is not to be used as a guide in creating high-stakes assessments for use in promotion/retention, program evaluation, or teacher evaluation; instead it is to be used as a tool for teachers to improve their classroom instruction.

This document summarizes a Saskatchewan thesis study that explored female grade 12 high school students' perceptions of the factors that influenced their traditional or nontraditional science career aspirations. Of particular interest was the influence of the gender of the teacher. Parents, older siblings, other people, work experiences, volunteer experiences, and certain school experiences strongly influenced female career choices. However, this study revealed that female high students commonly exhibited doubts about their academic ability and expressed fears that they would not succeed. Several factors influenced nontraditional student career  aspirations more than those of traditional students. For example, nontraditional students received more verbal and active support from their parents. They had more shared experiences with their fathers. Nontraditional students generally had long-range career plans with options as an integral part of the plan. Even though they had doubts about their ability, they did not allow these to affect their nontraditional career aspirations. The gender of the science teacher appeared to have little overt impact on the career decisions made by female students. (Author/CW)",

        "description":"The concern of this publication is to explore the extent to which there is common ground in the approach to the education of primary school teachers in mathematics and science. Chapter 1, \"A Model for Discussing Teacher Education\" outlines a rationale for making decisions about approaches to teacher education. Chapter 2, \"The Interface Where Science and Mathematics Meet and Mingle\" presents two examples of how mathematics and science concepts can be taught simultaneously. Chapter 3, \"Children's Learning in Science and Mathematics\" briefly considers characteristics of learning in mathematics and science. Chapter 4, \"What Should Teachers of Primary Mathematics and of Primary Science Know?\" explores how teachers should develop an intellectual structure of interrelated concepts on  which they can draw with confidence when placed in a problem situation. Chapter 5, \"Education of Assessment as Part of Teaching\" provides a brief discussion of features and various purposes of assessment. Chapter 6, \"The Training Needs of Teachers\" suggests the full range of skills and abilities which primary teachers need. Chapter 7, \"Teacher Education Approaches\" presents ways in which teacher education programs can develop workshops that exploit the commonalties that exist between mathematics and science while providing differences where appropriate. The production of these chapters was a combined effort of the following authors and contributors: Jos Elstgeest, Fred Goffree, Wynne Harlen, Hubert Dyasi, Bernard Hodgson, and Jeanne Bolon.

The sample consisted of 3,182 grade 10 students in 46 PNG secondary schools. Overall, boys had a more favorable attitude towards science than girls. Multivariate analysis showed that PNG science academic achievement was related to quality and  quantity of instruction, science laboratory learning environment scales and gender. Male students performed better than female students in external science achievement examinations; however, female students scored higher on a practical process test. The study also revealed that PNG science teachers were very didactic in their approach to teaching. An examination of the cultural context provided some help in trying to explain these teaching practices and students' learning patterns. Finally, this study showed that a modified educational productivity model was applicable to the Papua New Guinea context. (ZWH)",

His university accepted the instructor's right to use these materials and acknowledged students' rights to opt out of the classes after they learned the requirements of the class. The instructor viewed his role as model (being an openly gay faculty member), mentor (balancing confrontation and reassurance when raising issues of sexual identity), and as judge (weighing the quality of the students' work). In the composition classes, the readings were arranged to be more challenging as the term went on. The science fiction class was divided into three segments: biological distinctions between men and women; social and cultural distinctions  between masculinity and femininity; and sexist and homophobic stereotypes. The instructor has been met with some resistance from some students. Four or five students out of 25 chose to drop the section each term, while other sections of freshman composition sections close out. Among the students who stay in the course, there are always several who are easy to remember for their overt resistance to the objectives and the materials in the course. In both semesters of the freshman composition course, three-fourths of the students wrote in comments on the course evaluation forms that the concentration on gay and lesbian issues was the least-liked aspect of the course.

Language theory supports what the instructor observes in her students' writing development. A series of class writing assignments (designed to help students move their vision both inward and outward through language) make up the first half of the semester. The second half of the semester is spent writing and sharing a biography of the student writer's choice. The first time the biographies were assigned, at least two-thirds of the students wrote about family members rather than a notable person, as the instructor expected. Because all  work is placed in a portfolio, and because all students in the class share their stories for their portfolios, the students arrive at an appreciation and a greater awareness of their unique history and the histories of others.

To motivate students, make it known as specifically as possible what kind of written assignment will be required and how it will be graded. Then guide the students towards the goal by giving them pointers, encouragement, and opportunity--reminding them that they do not have to worry about starting at the beginning when they write. Advise students to use a word processor, if possible; and invite students' thoughts in class discussion by specifically asking about complaints, fears, anxieties, and problems. During a class session, student articulation of specific complaints helps them see the value of the assignment.  The teacher is given the chance to answer each specific complaint, and students learn to express themselves in ways other than slamming locker doors and grunting obscenities. When announcing the writing assignment, be flexible about the due date. Instead of reading one student's entire essay to the class in one droning narration and then asking, &quot;What do you think of that essay?&quot;, read the essay sentence by sentence and, where appropriate, ask &quot;What's good about that sentence?&quot; and &quot;What's weak about that sentence?&quot; Once the class gets used to this pair of questions as regular discussion stimulators, nobody feels publicly picked on when the essays are being read.

One student teacher (ST) developed a bulletin board to stimulate learner interest in reading for her sixth grade students. &quot;Read and Digest&quot; was the heading, with four illustrations showing a student reading, travel scenes, historical figures, and four new book jackets which overlapped. Using the book &quot;Cassie Binegar&quot; (Patricia MacLachlan), the ST discussed the bulletin board with the class and told related trade book content for each illustration. The ST mentioned that she would like to use a seminar method to discuss the book in depth, and she explained this method to the four students who had volunteered to read the  book. The four students, when asked if they had enjoyed the book, responded in the affirmative. They were enthusiastic and ready to share and analyze ideas contained in the book. The open discussion between the ST and the students used brainstorming effectively--33 responses were provided by learners as to how the heroine of the novel might have resolved her feelings about the house her family lived in. The group of students finished off their discussion by writing a &quot;diamante.&quot; (NKA)",

Students were followed over the entire 4-year course of their undergraduate careers. Data included interviews, questionnaires, papers the students wrote, and maps they drew of the discipline of psychology throughout the 4 years (and into a 5th year). Results indicated that all of the subjects made changes (some gradual and some dramatic) in their representations of the discipline. In the bodies of work of some subjects were signs of an emerging authorship--signs that the writer was creating a body of work interconnected through thematic links and connected with a community of  scholars pursuing similar work. The second phase provided converging information for the 5-year-long longitudinal study. Nine professors, 10 first-year students, 10 third-year students, and 12 graduate students from the Department of Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University completed questionnaires designed to elicit their descriptions of the discipline of psychology, the roles writing and authoring play in the discipline, and their experiences with authoring in the discipline. Results indicated that as students became more steeped in the discipline, they became more attuned to the various kinds of discourse that operated within the discipline; and the students learned the discipline through a long apprenticeship.

Critics have complained that interpreting Huck Finn as antiracist is reductive and ignores countervailing tendencies in the text. For Quirk this implies making Twain into a 1990s politically correct liberal, which he was not; and for Wayne Booth, author of the critical study called &quot;The Company We Keep&quot;, it represents the even worse sin of dismissing the moral complexities of the novel in favor of self-satisfied rationalizing. Some critics have argued that the  post-Reconstruction era was so violently racist that no more than a handful of Southerners wrote antiracist novels. In that sense, &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is certainly not politically correct: the political correctness of Twain's era was, after all, strident racism. Only a superficial reading of black characters in &quot;Huck Finn&quot; as reflections of racial stereotypes can ignore how Twain undercuts such stereotypes and exposes their inadequacy. The conformity that goes along with political correctness in a given era may not always generate humanitarian sensibilities nor will literary critics' practice of political correctness in criticism or teaching necessarily lead to the kind of interactive change in which students and teachers are both in some way transformed.

Students worked individually and in small groups to complete activities which focused on writing skills at the prewriting stage. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the program included analyses of data, a comparison of  the writing samples using the rubric designed by the Florida Writing Assessment program, and attitudinal surveys completed by the students. Results indicated improvements in writing skills achievement and attitudes.

Subjects, 143 seventh- and eighth-grade students in San Diego were assigned by intact classes to one of five versions of computer-guided writing software. The programs were created combining three hypothesized types of guides: structural chunking, rhetorical interventions, and on-line guides. During a treatment period of 3 weeks, students wrote two reflective essays using their assigned version of the software. The essays were scored holistically based upon the California Assessment Program's Scoring Guide for Rhetorical Effectiveness. Students also completed a metacognitive assessment and an  attitudinal questionnaire concerning satisfaction in using computers. Analysis of the data showed support for one version of the guided-writing software. The program featuring structural chunking and on-line guides provided statistically significant differences compared to the control group in terms of rhetorical effectiveness. Results also demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in cognition when compared to one of the other treatment groups. No significant differences in attitude toward using computers could be attributed to the treatments.

Accruing theory that stresses process and integration recommends instruction that: crosses different subject matters; combines various kinds of thinking; and integrates the different language behaviors. The public's concern with academic achievement may have slowed real improvement in education. The result of the use of short-answer or selected-answer assessments has been a narrowing of the curriculum. Concern with more valid forms of assessment has led to the search for &quot;alternative assessments.&quot; Portfolios have evolved in  the language arts as individualized and personalized collections of students' achievements, but they do not solve the need for comparability and for educational accountability. Many state and local school districts are experimenting with performance assessments that emphasize process by having students read several texts to construct a response to a general problem. Authors and publishers of assessment and other educational materials have begun to produce textbooks and instructional materials that respond to these trends. Educators have a wider, richer selection of materials and ideas to match their theories. Such choices underline the excitement of education in the 1990s. (RS)",

In schools where writing is used as a means to promote clear thinking, it appears that reading a variety of literary genres has a related positive effect on writing. One genre that might be effective as a beginning point, and is particularly enjoyable for children, is folktales. Folktales are common in all countries, universal in nature. Through the use of a simple genre like the folktale, educators can help children  understand that there are different types of literature. It is not necessary for children to define every piece of literature that they read, though the elementary school curriculum should provide a wide range of genres. (RS)",

        "description":"The major schools of journalism in the United States established themselves during the first 25 years of the 20th century. These schools formed an important part of the broader professionalizing project within journalism. Over the next 30 years, this elite group of schools attempted to make a degree from a professional school of journalism the required credential for all aspiring journalists. They fought not only against traditional on-the-job methods of training, but also against journalism schools that did not share their vision of professional education. By the mid-1950s, these conflicts had led to a stalemate. The elite schools were unable to build a strong alliance with the industry, and there remained in place a number of alternative routes into journalism and a number of  different philosophies of journalism education. Unlike other professions, in which a strong professionalizing coalition made up of practitioners and educators was able to create a system of restricted professional education, in journalism no such coalition emerged.

        "description":"A study investigated how writing skills were taught and learned in one low-SES, urban, whole language primary classroom. Participants were three teachers who team-taught a group of primary-age children and 11 children who were considered conventional writers, 3 of whom had learning disabilities. Teachers and children were observed twice a month for a school year during literacy instruction, and six visits were tape-recorded. Children's writing folders and journal entries were collected in September and compared to their writing samples from spring. Five writing skills (fluency, a sense of audience and purpose, organization, use of written language, and use of lively or engaging language) were examined holistically, and the skills of using compound or lengthy sentences, end mark  punctuation, capitalization, and spelling were examined through word and sentence counts and error rates. Results indicated that the teachers were effective in helping the children with some skills but not others. While they changed their instruction mid-year to meet the needs of learners, their instruction was not always a part of the children's writing. More opportunities for editing and publishing and more direct, explicit instruction on particular skills may be needed for some of the children. (Two tables of data are included; 79 references, scoring rubrics for students' journal entries and for letters, sample scoring for a journal entry and a letter, a narrative account of one portfolio examination, and pre- and post-journal writing exercises for one child are attached.)

This article reviews the literature on the various definitions of critical thinking and examines how critical thinking can be promoted through writing. Persuasive writing can especially help the acquisition of critical thinking skills because: (1) that genre calls upon several of the same higher-level thinking skills as critical thinking; (2) it forces students to think in concepts because the organizational structure requires connection of ideas through a hierarchy of thesis statements and topic sentences; and (3) it teaches  writers to create their own alternatives to problems instead of merely analyzing those of others.

For instance, two literary texts written early in this century--Thornton Wilder's &quot;Our Town&quot; and Ernest Hemingway's short story &quot;Up in Michigan&quot;--can illustrate important principles of communication and gender. When, in Act II of &quot;Our Town,&quot; Emily decides to &quot;tell the truth and shame the devil,&quot; she communicates her perceptions of George by using something like a &quot;clear message format&quot; popularized in interpersonal communication textbooks. George's attempt to establish honest, open communication about their relationship counters current wisdom expressed by Deborah Tannen and Carol Gilligan about male and female patterns  of communication. Likewise, Liz's verbal statements in &quot;Up in Michigan&quot; lead students to ask &quot;Was Liz raped?&quot; Does Liz's &quot;no&quot; really mean &quot;yes?&quot; Does she protest verbally simply to maintain some semblance of Victorian feminine decorum in the face of overwhelming sexual desire? This story embodies crippling myths about communication between men and women, and it challenges readers to say what they mean and mean what they say and act upon what is actually said. Thus communication should not be understood as an isolated discipline in the academy. (SAM)",

The exercise simulates a traditional production organization in the classroom and mirrors the efforts, the successes, and the frustrations of individuals and work groups as they attempt to produce a quality product in a productive manner. Following an initial production run, with a large group, students are assigned the task of improving production. Based on student suggestions, an array of methods and techniques are presented and discussed over time. The students use this information as they redesign the ACME Basket production process. Group communication management, product and process design,  quality and productivity improvement, and group processes are explored. The experiential process culminates with a second production run where the students have the opportunity to apply their new group communication understanding and design. In this experiential exercise, there is opportunity also for different kinds of research. Based on students' scores on several instruments, some groups were formed with just one communication style and a high or low level of communication apprehension and others with a mixed communication style and mixed levels of communication apprehension. The experiential process can be restructured to match on the job requirements and allow production and engineering teams to focus on quality, design and project planning issues, and the group communication  process.

Ten honors students from a college of arts and sciences were invited to a 3-day intensive focus on career decision making. The honors students reported satisfaction with the 3-day program. Information from these students was used to develop a career indecision questionnaire. The Career Anxiety and Career Indecision Questionnaire was administered to 50 students in 2 sections of the basic speech communication course at a Southwestern multi-university before the first speaking project. Results indicated that there are problems with career indecision at universities, that communication anxiety does exist, and that student attrition might be the result of  these frustrations. Helping to impede student attrition caused by career indecision, communication anxiety, and lack of information and frustration is a natural undertaking for instructors in the basic speech communication course. Basic speech communication instructors have the power to guide students along positive and productive future tracks. (Contains 73 references.) (RS)",

Data were collected from students, teachers, and observers to determine, record, and analyze any differences in social skills between classes. Results indicated that: (1) drama-based instruction appeared to influence the learning of social skills in a number of ways; (2) some positive growth occurred in attitudes about social skills within each class, while little difference occurred in attitudes  between classes; (3) the use of theater games was highly effective in creating an environment that would allow non-threatening group interaction; (4) basic drama activities appeared to work best; and (5) to make a drama-based classroom work, students must be required to participate right from the start. Findings suggest that drama can be used as an effective tool to create a positive classroom climate with basic skill students at the high school level.

Student attitudes toward role-play was also surveyed to provide more background information on sociodrama's impact upon student learning. A class of 26 students in southern Cook County, Illinois, prepared role-play characterizations through face-to-face interviews with community members. Outcomes of the mastery of eye contact, gestures, and vocal rate and volume were studied. The comparison class of 26 students had the same role-play assignments; their role-play preparation, however, was created through student readings in the library. In addition, student attitudes on eight projects were traced. Four speech assignments were non-role; four speeches required  students to assume a persona or character point of view other than their own. Results indicated that: (1) the role-play assignments created a deeper engagement in students; (2) an overwhelming number of students felt that physical delivery enhanced success later in life; (3) the affect of the student fared better in the role-play environment; (4) students felt they witnessed more improvement in vocal variety; (5) over 60% of the students felt that role-play should be required of all students in the district; and (6) many of the students were selected to be televised in a program entitled &quot;Drugs: A Crisis in Our Schools&quot; in which they voiced opinions about the issue in role.

The department faculty began by working to establish &quot;exit criteria&quot; during an all-day meeting. Unlike other disciplines, communication has no standardized tests and performance measures which can easily be adapted to an institution's needs. Also, since Heidelberg College does not offer release time, all assessment activities had to be added to full loads of teaching and co-curricular activities. Given the difficulties of participation in a junior year pilot assessment program, the department elected to conduct most assessment activities in the required senior seminar course where participation could be mandated. The  Watson Glaser Test of Critical Thinking was administered, as well as instruments to measure writing skills, speaking skills, and student attitudes. None of the first-year data from these measures was significant by itself nor did it reveal much collectively. Informal discussions of the process and initial attempts in assessment have changed the focus of the faculty's thinking about the program. An alumni survey was developed and administered. Only about 25% of the surveys have been returned so far. In papers written for the senior seminar, students indicated they are pleased with hands-on experiences and the range of opportunities both academic and co-curricular. Preliminary response to the assessment program is that the process may be more valuable than the results. (Contains 18  references and a list of exit criteria.) (RS)",

Self-disclosure research offers two conclusions in regards to gender differences in communication. First, there is no definite indication that females self-disclose more than males. Contradictory findings are the rule through the review of the literature. Second, females do disclose more on the intimate level than males. Males tend to focus their disclosures around activities; while females disclose more on the emotional content level. Intimacy, in the past, has been treated as a static variable, and the paper offers the conclusion that a transactional approach may be useful tool in discussing gender differences  and self-disclosure. As support for this contention, excerpts from student papers assigned in a basic communication course, honors division, are offered. These excerpts offer the student perspective as it applies to the validity issues. Contains 25 references. (RS)",

        "description":"Traditional course outlines in a hybrid communication course cover the &quot;elements&quot; areas before discussion of different forms and types of relationships. This paper proposes a structure whereby the development of relationships is presented first, and the elements are examined as communication factors that promote or discourage a particular relationship. M. Knapp's (1978) stages of Coming Together and Coming Apart are presented in the paper as an efficient tool for this structure, with slight modification to accommodate the emphasis on friendship relationships as opposed to primary relationships. The organization proposed in the paper permits students to conduct an introspective analysis of their own interpersonal communication relationships, and the teaching involved takes on an  enhanced interpersonal focus.

        "description":"A study documented an investigation into the use of selected theater technologies to enhance the oral/written communication skills of entry-level theater students at New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, a public high school for the performing arts. The Paradigm, a critical tool developed by Syd Field, and the students' application of the conceptual scheme in interpreting a theatrical event were also examined. For each of the 8 weeks, a series of theater games, processes, improvisations, and dramatic activities cohering around themes were created as multiple interdependent fluctuations. Pre-test results, supported by the oral/written evidence of the first two lessons, led to the evolution of three core groups of students: Players (who readily used metaphor), Oscillators (who  vacillated between metaphor and descriptive), and Spectators (who could not gain control of the process of generating and organizing their writing). The written material from each week was computerized and collated. Results indicated that: (1) theater technologies rehabilitated the oral/written communication skills of a majority of the students; (2) students' writing improved during the latter half of the study; and (3) the use of The Paradigm contributed to students' knowledge and comprehension of the dramatic event as evidenced in posttest papers. Findings provide empirical support for theater technologies as planning processes involved in writing and for theories related to symbolic functioning in general.

        "description":"A study determined whether first year middle school drama students in a talented, magnet program were able to demonstrate more credible characterization in a scene study project after they had been taught some basic directing methods. These methods included blocking (the movements of the actor) and beat breakdowns (the small acting units in a play). Students' initial understanding of scene study elements were measured in order to show a rate of change after exposure to this teaching approach. An evaluation was developed and administered to determine the effectiveness of the student's characterization in the scene presentation. Most books about acting assume that actors have basic knowledge of blocking and scene breakdowns and thus tend to ignore or give little detailed  information about such topics. Results revealed a marked improvement in student actors' characterizations after they have been introduced to basic directing principles. A number of other discoveries were substantiated through the pre-and posttests and through parent surveys. These include students': (1) positive attitudes toward acting; (2) belief that memorization of lines was not the most important element in scene study; (3) higher regard for teacher evaluation than for grades; (4) greater problem-solving ability; and (5) improved cooperation between scene partners.

Data included interviews, student and teacher logs, discussions, observations, and audio and video taping. Results indicated that the group acquired the properties of Group Dynamics, as described by Lawrence Kohlberg, including: a shared background; a participation pattern in which nearly all students usually contributed and a  communication pattern marked by students speaking on any subject suitable for public disclosure; a great deal of growth in group cohesion; a nearly always warm, friendly, and accepting atmosphere; standards (such as &quot;be polite to others&quot;; and significant changes in the patterns of how the students felt about each other. Results also indicated that one student was in stage 1, five students were in stage 2, four students were in stage 4, and three students were in stage 6 of the six stages of moral reasoning developed by Lawrence Kohlberg.

        "description":"Style is a crucial component of success in competitive forensics, whether debate or individual events, and one of the greatest benefits students get from participating in such events is the opportunity to develop a sense of style. In keeping with the classical canons of rhetoric, style (as it relates to forensics) can be limited to a consideration of word choice and arrangement. Not only does style affect every mode of persuasion, language may be the most significant of the available means of persuasion because it is the basic vehicle through which nearly every other means operate. Among the ways in which participation in forensics can help a student learn how to effectively manage the resources of language are: (1) forensics helps a student to discover that the essence of good  writing is revision; (2) the more or less rigid time limits imposed on debate and individual events help students to develop and appreciate economy of style; (3) through forensics a student can learn much about how the impact of an argument is largely a matter of language; (4) forensics drives home the point that good style must be appropriate; and (5) what students get out of forensics is a more sophisticated view of the relationship between style and content. Students who engage in competitive forensics are less likely to lose sight of the fact that style is nothing but meaning. (Contains 12 references.) (RS)",

Results were consistent with the growing body of cross-cultural CA research that supports the claim that some cultures have CA norms similar to the United States while others have CA norms which differ substantially--Lithuanians, Finns, Swedes, and the English are more apprehensive than Americans, while Australians, Chinese, Micronesians, Puerto Ricans, Filipinos, Costa Ricans,  and Koreans are less apprehensive than Americans. Future research needs to identify and quantify the specific consequences and make a greater effort to address the validity of the measures employed to assess CA and its related constructs in other cultures.

Subjects, 81 undergraduate students on 2 campuses of a state university in the northern United States, responded to a questionnaire. The results of qualitative and quantitative analyses indicated that U.S. students' feeling about non-native instructors was mixed. Though being recognized as an asset to U.S. education, non-native instructors were expected to improve their language proficiency and cultural understanding. A student's previous contact with people from other cultures was found to have positively influenced the way he or she perceived the clarity of non-native instructors' messages.

        "description":"The growth of intercultural interactions increases the need for nonverbal communication competency to help obviate potential cross cultural communication difficulties. Foreign language studies too often concentrate on vocabulary, grammar, and syntax, and forgo the role and methods of nonverbal communication. Japanese culture and modes of communication present excellent opportunities to examine a society that emphasizes nonverbal behavior. In Japan, an accomplished nonverbal communicator is held in high esteem. Extensive previous research on Japanese indicates how Japanese culture plays an important role in shaping nonverbal communication activities. The Japanese sense of Confucian-based collectivism exerts a large influence on their communication patterns. The quest for social  harmony profoundly informs communicative actions. Japanese nonverbal codes can be classified under nine specific groupings: body language (kinesics); eye behavior and facial expressions; proxemic behavior; touch (haptics); appearance; space and time; smell (olfactics); vocalics (paralanguage); and silence. Much research has studied these individual classifications, showing that nonverbal language behavior is intrinsic in Japanese society to an extent far surpassing its use in Western cultures. The effects of social evolution and the inherent difficulties of the Japanese language necessitate continued study of this expanding field of research. (Contains 80 references.) (HB)",

Scott's article &quot;On Viewing Rhetoric as Epistemic&quot; exemplifies agonistic-transcendent rhetoric in that it sought to revalue &quot;rhetoric.&quot; However, as Scott has already noted, his project was ultimately compromised by his not revaluing &quot;epistemic&quot; in conjunction. Scott's article is criticized with respect to the goals of agonistic-transcendent rhetoric, namely to revalue fundamental relationships. His discussions of epistemology, knowing as doing, truth, certainty, the human condition, and the ethics of rhetoric-as-epistemic are examined. The paper concludes that Scott left too much latitude to the reader by not revaluing key concepts, and thus much of his article could be ignored. Scott's role as agonistic-transcendent rhetor and the future of his project with respect to  research are explored. Rhetoric-as-epistemic is then revalued with respect to tacit knowing, conviction, and commitment. (Eighty-eight notes are included. Contains 95 references.) (Author/RS)",

The committee submitted to the communication faculty an assessment proposal that focused on answering the question of whether the basic speech course was achieving its desired outcome. A pilot program of videotaping student speeches in some basic speech courses was approved. A literature review conducted by the committee suggested no significant increase in negative speaker responses or anxiety levels due to videotaping. Six faculty members volunteered to participate in the pilot program, representing 12 sections and 264 students. Students (10%) were videotaped, but only eight  tapes were actually provided by the students to be analyzed, and one tape was disqualified because the instructor appeared briefly on the videotape. Seven students were rated as satisfactory, one student was rated as excellent. Despite being scaled back and encountering some problems, the pilot program was considered successful. The committee offered suggestions to facilitate adoption of the oral competence assessment proposal. To date, the proposal and recommendations remain officially tabled while pressures for oral communication assessment continues to mount. Some faculty members are taking a proactive stance by revising and using the procedures outlined in the proposal.

        "description":"While no one instrument can accurately evaluate or assess every college or university debate program, two separate frameworks can be established based in forensics and assessment literature. The first framework is a descriptive/analytic/evaluative framework for a debate program based on the philosophies of the several national conferences on forensics and debate, the literature on directing forensics, and on debate program surveys. The second framework is a more empirical/qualitative one based on recent trends in assessing the outcomes of college education and is still in the process of being formulated. Prospectively, the framework can be applied to many debate program goals but currently it has one &quot;half-way-worked-out&quot; exemplar, that being the template for evaluating a debate  program vis-a-vis its development of critical thinking. Forensics educators are going to have to operationalize the goals of debate and find or create empirical tests to measure how well they teach students. (Thirty-four footnotes are included.) (RS)",

        "description":"A study investigated the impact of teachers' use of immediacy behaviors on students' reported motivation to study over the course of a semester. The state and trait motivation of 178 undergraduate students (enrolled in communication courses at a mid-sized eastern university) to study for a class was measured at three points during the semester. Reports of teachers' use of verbal and nonverbal immediacy were collected at two points in a semester. Support was found for the hypothesis that not all students would respond similarly to a teacher low in immediacy. Students beginning the semester with either low or moderate state motivation to study were found to have increased levels of motivation later in the semester when exposed to a highly immediate teacher. Students beginning the  semester with high motivation maintained high motivation regardless of the level of immediacy they reported their teacher's having. (Nine tables of data are included.

Bhowmik's (1970) heterophily-homophily distinction is used to help better understand and offer ways to deal with the negative reactions of undergraduates toward foreign teaching assistants (TAs) in U.S. universities. While it is important for foreign TAs to work harder to improve their English language proficiency and teaching skills, this paper focuses more on the role undergraduates can play in improving the situation. This is done for two reasons: (1) given the increasing interdependence among countries today, undergraduates will benefit by improving their intercultural sensitivity by taking steps today for a more fruitful tomorrow; and (2) there are a number of programs focused toward  helping foreign TAs and very few aimed at preparing undergraduates to take classes from foreign TAs.

        "description":"To affirm Sojourner Truth as a powerful rhetor who advanced the equality and empowerment of women, a study examined several of her speeches on women's suffrage. Although the value of using such role models as Sojourner Truth has been demonstrated in various grade levels, and in the study of history and English, the approach is too seldom employed in today's college classes studying rhetorical criticism. Additional analysis of this female voice is overdue in the field of speech communication. The goal of Sojourner Truth's life was to move the United States toward equality of the sexes, making it appropriate that the critical method used in the study is that of feminist criticism. The study analyzed how in these speeches, and from her perspective as a freed female slave of African  descent, Sojourner Truth presented the situation of women; how women perceived society; and the way Sojourner Truth challenged post-Civil War assumptions about females.

        "description":"Noting that the trend in the newspaper industry from the predictive-control model to the explanative-naturalistic model mirrors a trend in the communication discipline toward qualitative research and more meaningful connections between industry and academia, a study investigated Sedgwick County, Kansas residents' concerns regarding politics and politicians. Focused, personal interviews were conducted with residents served by the &quot;The Wichita Eagle.&quot; The newspaper requested that a large, random sample be used so that results could serve for quantitative purposes as well as for qualitative interviews. Advantages and disadvantages of the personal interview method were discovered: for example, a large number of the interviewers reported a &quot;therapeutic effect&quot; of the study on the  respondents; also, the face-to-face interview method allowed for an explanation of how and why citizens speak out on certain subjects. Conversely, the methods used tended to reduce the representation of certain groups--the elderly, the handicapped, the poor; and the presence of the interviewer may have affected how some subjects responded to questions. However, a composite picture emerged indicating that: (1) most respondents were registered voters who looked to the mass media for their information; (2) economic and moral problems pervaded their conversation; (3) they felt detached from government and alienated from their elected officials; (4) in order of importance, crime, education, taxes, economy, abortion, family, status of government leadership, and health care concerned the  respondents; and (5) most respondents spoke confidently and definitively about how they viewed the paper's coverage and offered suggestions for improvement. Two of the most provocative findings were that the issues identified by respondents were often entwined with larger issues, and that &quot;how&quot; people talk about issues was more meaningful than &quot;what&quot; people identified as issues.

        "description":"&quot;Contrary-to-face-value&quot; (CFV) messages, which can only be understood from a contextual instead of a text-based approach to communication, have caused many problems in communication between East Asians and North Americans. A typology of CFV communication, as identified in the Chinese culture, is proposed in this paper. Four forms of CFV communication are constructed on the basis of the following two dimensions of CFV communication: internal motivation (other-serving or self-serving) and external speech (saying &quot;yes&quot; for &quot;no&quot; or &quot;no&quot; for &quot;yes&quot;). Previous communication research has addressed the concepts behind other-serving CFV communication, although the self-serving CFV communication has been addressed in only a few studies. The typology proposed covers a wide range of CFV  communication in a relatively parsimonious way. Though confusing to outsiders, each of the four forms can be justified from an insider's perspective. A table listing the four categories of CFV communication is included. Contains 12 references. (Author/RS)",

        "description":"The case study method has received increased attention at both the graduate and undergraduate levels in a number of public relations programs. Unlike the Harvard managerial-oriented case studies, the approach useful in large, introductory public relations courses stems from a simplified team approach to classroom projects, case studies in the classroom, and small groups advocated by various educators. An instructor at Florida International University finds the following to be effective ways to make &quot;team cases&quot; useful in the introductory public relations course: begin with theoretical underpinnings; encourage students to became familiar with all the cases in the textbook; introduce the team concept in the third week; supply ancillary materials to the teams; keep teams to  four-to-seven participants; have teams meet back in the classroom at a specified time with their answers/solutions to the cases; and emphasize the public relations process rather than getting the &quot;right&quot; answer. Benefits of the course include: (1) socialization skills are honed; (2) students become more autonomous as learners; (3) a better environment is created for the teacher; (4) students learn to research and present more indepth information than they do working alone; and (5) students enjoy the team cases more than any other part of the course. Team casework can help bridge the gap between theory and practice, a goal toward which all public relations educators should strive. (Contains 36 notes and 22 references.) (RS)",

The purpose of experiential learning should be the application and integration of concepts and philosophies that students acquire in the traditional classroom experiences. The media industry often expect a steady supply of inexpensive or free labor from media education programs. Students need to bring an attitude to internships that prevents them from blindly accepting the status quo. Interns should get a complete picture of the corporate  structure of the facility, get experience in a wide variety of tasks in a number of job categories, and have an observational proximity to view technology, technical processes, creative work, and decision-making. Students who expect to go on to graduate school, who cannot afford to live independently while interning, or who are locked into rigid schedules can get experiential learning through workshops or laboratories. Media laboratory classes benefit those whose career interests have not yet crystallized and for those who do not feel that a career in traditional media organizations is attractive. Experiential learning provides practical information students need to get entry level jobs, but could also provide evidence to justify the existence of the media program. (RS)",

        "description":"One way to improve topicality debates in CEDA (Cross Examination Debate Association) debate would be to thoroughly study the field contextual meanings of propositional phrases prior to submitting them to a vote. Judges need to reward exemplary arguments and &quot;punish&quot; poor arguments by substantially lowering a team's speaker points for presenting such arguments. Well planned topicality arguments are as research-intensive as disadvantages or counterplans and require the same attention to organization and structure. While not a panacea, a reinvigoration of the importance of topicality argumentation could help restore the balance between impact-oriented arguments and case-specific refutational styles. Absent a plan statement, debate critics could evaluate topicality in the same  fashion as &quot;extra-topicality&quot; arguments would be evaluated in a policy format. Topicality standard debates are generally not well presented. Confusion arises in two broad areas concerning topicality standards: the host of arguments that masquerade as &quot;procedural&quot; questions; and arguments that are related to the disposition of topicality claims. The nature of standards debates would be drastically improved if judges refused to consider assertions as arguments absent an explicit application of the &quot;standard&quot; to the opposing interpretation. The topic of a recent CEDA debate (regarding implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations) typifies the difficulties faced when propositions are poorly worded. Neither a true policy proposition, nor an explicit  question of value, the proposition lurked in the shadows that separate those two realms. (Fifteen notes are included.) (RS)",

        "description":"An instructor's effort to internationalize a business communication course taught him much about the relationships between cognitive egocentrism and cognitive ethnocentrism. Cognitive egocentrism is the chief obstacle to be overcome in learning to write, even within a culture, while cognitive ethnocentrism is the chief obstacle to be overcome in learning to communicate interculturally. Business writing students at Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis exchange simulated job application letters and resumes with business communication and business English students at the Antwerp Business School in Antwerp, Belgium. Students at both institutions read the documents from their counterparts and decide which applicants to &quot;interview&quot; and which to reject. The Indianapolis  students write personal, student-to-student critiques of the Belgian applications, and the Antwerp students present videotaped oral evaluations of the American applications. Four subjective outcomes of the internationalizing of this business communication course are: (1) students seem to find the course even more authentic than earlier, noninternational versions; (2) students seem more motivated than their earlier counterparts; (3) as students worked to overcome cognitive egocentrism, they began to overcome cognitive ethnocentrism as well; and (4) in an increasingly international and intercultural communication environment, egocentrism and ethnocentrism are the same thing.

Source material was drawn from exploratory fieldwork conducted at a Japanese-owned business (anonymous) located in the United States and with operations in North America, Europe, and Japan. Preliminary results indicated that attention to &quot;visuals&quot; was evidenced in production, training, and development at all organizational levels, communication efforts, research and development, and hiring practices. Results also indicated that these procedures were  so ingrained procedurally that they were not even recognizable to interviewees until questioned about them. Future research should examine linkages between nonverbal communication, training, corporate culture, and significant other variables.

        "description":"This paper describes how director Spike Lee changed Hollywood's representations of African Americans in a dramatic way. He returned to traditions of early African American filmakers like Oscar Michaux by casting all-black movies. In his first film, &quot;She's Gotta Have It&quot;, he broke with the Hollywood tradition of using a classic beauty type as his leading lady for the character Nola Darling. In a further departure, Darling's role is not a usual one for African American women in Hollywood films: she is not a servant, a doomed mulatto, a victim, nor a &quot;glitzy ornament&quot; snapped to the end of a man's arm. What seemed like a breakthrough for African Americans (particularly female African Americans) collapsed with the succession of &quot;in-the-hood movies&quot; like &quot;Straight Out of Brooklyn,&quot;&quot;Hangin' With the Homeboys,&quot; and &quot;Juice&quot; which consistently treated women as subordinates. Although women directors first gained institutional support in the 1970s, the Director's Guild of America reported in 1990 that only 5% of the movies under guild contracts were made by women. Outstanding women of color who have begun to make a name for themselves as directors include Euzan Palcy, Julie Dash, Christine Choy, Mari-Carmen de Lara, Camille Billops, and Trinh-T. Minh-ha. English teachers will find the work of these filmakers useful because previously unexplored material can be looked at from new viewpoints. Short films can be seen more than once in a class, or instructors can assign a longer film that is currently showing. (SAM)",

        "author":["Zamanou, Sonia"],
        "description":"Many colleges and universities lack a comprehensive, fully integrated marketing plan to combat high attrition rates in programs offered to non-traditional students. A clear understanding of the needs of the marketplace is crucial to an effective marketing program. Research suggests that life transitions are what motivate adults to pursue education, that some non-traditional students report holding false expectations about college, and that non-traditional students decide to return to college and decide on a particular college at the same time. Barriers to success of nontraditional students include: sex and age quotas; financial aid practices; regulations; deficiencies in curriculum planning; and faculty and staff attitudes. Direct, specific recruitment seems to meet the needs of  a population in search of retraining and may help universities face the realities of a stable or decreasing traditional population pool. Institutions can be placed in one of three stages: (1) laissez-faire (characterized by removal of barriers or constraints on adults); (2) separatist (adults given separate specially developed programs); and (3) equity (active recruitment of adult learners, a fully integrated curriculum, and services available evenings and weekends). A realistic awareness of the diversity of non-traditional students and what it means for the quality of the institution and the traditional student body is essential for marketing success. Educational institutions must learn to serve the students they now have and could have, not continue in ways that served those students  they once had. (RS)",

        "author":["Woodyard, Jeffrey Lynn"],
        "description":"The works of over 75 communication scholars have consistently traced the markers of communication in African American life. There exists a complex and varied corpus that is necessarily interdisciplinary and multifarious in perspectives and context. The space(s) is theirs to define and, perhaps, to claim. Such studies may reward scholars most when they are nuanced with the kind of historical consciousness that gives way to analytical narratives and allows reflection on the moral accountabilities which telling such stories often produces. A nuanced historical narrative constructs African American life while remembering that both the past and the present are composites of equivocality, dubiety, ambiguity. The principal issue regarding Afrocentricity in African American communication  studies is the degree to which Afrocentric perspectives advance the collection of stories and analyses that will allow scholars to understand how they signify meaning and create understanding within the contexts of macrostructural dehumanization. Popular African American culture is fertile with the markers of the &quot;dynamics of being&quot; of African descent in the United States. The production and consumption of African American popular culture in the context of all American cultural productivity alongside the influences of market-driven values are within the purview of African American communication studies.

Of the 43 students sent questionnaires asking for their reactions to the assignment, 40 returned completed questionnaires. Content analysis of the responses to the assignment revealed that prior to writing their narratives, students had high expectations of learning, general positive and negative thoughts about the assignment, and several technical concerns. After writing the narrative and before sharing it, students considered their written work as a learning experience, although they expressed anxiety about sharing it aloud, and mentioned continued concern with technical difficulties. After sharing and  listening to the narratives, students reported gaining insights into their own and others' families, witnessing the development of group cohesion, and having general positive reactions. Even with all the benefits of the assignment, teachers should be aware of potential negative outcomes and ethical problems associated with an assignment that some students may see as intrusive.

        "description":"Students should become acquainted with gender communication differences in basic communication courses so that they can more effectively deal with each other. Very few business communication textbooks acknowledge that gender sensitivity is an important criterion. Also, instructors unintentionally ignore or trivialize the issue of gender sensitivity. Most instructors value modeling as a method for subtly teaching new concepts and behaviors to students. Instructors should take the time at the beginning of the semester to explain their policy on gender sensitive behavior as it applies within the confines of the classroom. Guests of both sexes can be invited to visit the classroom and relate their experiences. Students could be asked to write &quot;mini papers&quot; based on interviews with  members of corporations. Readings for the course should contain literature that discusses gender communication. Role-playing situations (such as job interviews, group decision making processes, and &quot;audience adaptation&quot;) benefit students by reinforcing the instructor's lecture as well as classroom discussion. Class activities (&quot;supportive speeches,&quot; self-analyses of career goals, and &quot;powerful&quot; versus &quot;powerless&quot; language) may also be useful. Faculty training (panel discussions, faculty observation, and informal faculty discussions) are needed to make faculty aware of the need for changes in classroom climate and the material itself.

The establishment of speech codes has sparked a heated debate over the impact that such codes have upon free speech and First Amendment values. Some commentators have suggested that viewing hate speech as a special category of expression, unworthy of traditional protection, will result in unpredictable consequences. Many administrators, however, feel that the codes are justified because of the threat that hate speech poses to the educational process and environment. Many administrators also feel that institutions of higher learning should at least be responsible for the behavior of students. Most of the arguments supporting hate  speech codes focus around the notion that establishment and maintenance of a university &quot;community&quot; is essential. But every community--including a college or university community--must accept some degree of violation of its norms. There is also no legitimate reason to view students as inherently more vulnerable simply because they are on campus. Although codes are concerned with protecting women and minorities, the use of a regulatory response to hate speech is problematic. The possibility that open discourse might spread sexist and racist ideas should not be a cause for alarm. (Forty-seven notes are included.) (NKA)",

Obscenity is an ambiguous realm of language that the Supreme Court has judged to fall outside the safety of protected speech covered by the first amendment. In the current climate of deregulation and the benchmark of community standards, potentially obscene material has emerged as a common form of radio programming. College radio is a significant contributor to the acceptance of obscene programming by conventional radio  broadcasters. In the process of airing expositional obscenity, college broadcasters initiate the public's acceptance of questionable material and ultimately broaden the scope of conventional radio discourse. The process is a healthy one for the college students, conventional broadcasters, and the spirit of free expression. Four notes are included. Contains 10 references. (Author/RS)",

While many attempts have been made to design frameworks to help manage organizations in education, most of these projects are in the developmental stage. Although these models have not been tested as leadership tools, the indicator concept has great theoretical promise. However, there are some ways to change indicators to enhance their use as a tool for effective leadership. Indicators have had little impact on administrative performance for three reasons. First, the development and use of indicators has been undertaken by researchers and not administrators, and indicators hold little significance to administrators. Second, most indicators measure input and process, not  outcomes. Third, it has not been demonstrated that indicators can be used for organizational improvement. Four related projects in British Columbia illustrate that administrators should use indicators for planning and public relations. Indicators should also reflect the vision of the organization, and all shareholders should be included in their development and use. With these changes, indicators can be powerful forces for educational improvement. Appendix 1 contains the British Columbia government's mandate statement for education. (Contains 37 references.)

These goals must be transformed into educational outcomes by the State Board of  Education and met at the local level. An assessment that measures the performance of all schools against statewide and local standards should be established and made available to all education stakeholders. Incentive grants should be established to help schools carry out school improvement initiatives.

The traditional view of education defines the student as customer, the teacher as worker, teaching and learning as the products, and school boards as overly influential. An alternative paradigm is presented that defines school board members as the elected representatives of the customers of education--local business and parent groups. The product is preparedness, which has been paid for in advance by the customers. Students, in this paradigm, are not the customers, but the workforce of the American public schools. The customers are those who receive the end product of education's services; i.e., parents, higher education, business, government, and society.  Teachers are not the labor force, but managers of the workers and the work. It is argued that these new definitions will allow the industry of schooling to move forward as never before. (LMI)",

Contextual factors, which shaped the administrator's work, included internal, external, intrinsic, and time factors. Each of the directors utilized the following four different work styles to achieve organizational goals--situational leadership, support for  change, respect for developmental levels, and effective planning.

It is argued that in Australia, the drive toward a market culture is a form of administrative achievement that turns culture into commodities. One of the major features of the current educational reform context is a substantial increase in demands, accompanied by a severe decline in the proportion of national wealth directed toward educational activities. The market model is viewed as a strategy to protect middle-class privilege. A key effect of market policies is the redistribution of public resources away from those most in need. The devolution of education is accompanied by new forms of control: a performance-based national curriculum; a national  testing system that allows inaccurate comparisons; budgets that are linked to performance; and a curriculum that ignores social, cultural, and ethic understandings. An examination of the perceived anti-educational impact of a &quot;corporatist&quot; culture concludes with a call to educators to show their commitment to a caring, just, morally responsible, compassionate and ecologically aware society.

It recommends a shift in the culture of principal-professional development from a system-driven, input model to an individualized approach founded on collaborative, experience-based, critical reflection. A survey of the 74 principals in the diocese, conducted by the Principal Professional Development Task Force, elicited a 64 percent response rate. Findings indicate that the principals are experienced, highly qualified, and participate regularly in various kinds of professional development. It is suggested that the administration acknowledge the importance of experience in professional development, structure professional-development programs in longer blocks of  time, and be sensitive to individual differences. Criteria for principal selection are also outlined. Sixteen tables and a copy of the survey are included. (LMI)",

In Australia, education systems have adopted OBE within the framework of National Profiles curriculum statements in eight learning areas, including arts, health and physical education, science, English, languages other than English, mathematics, studies of science and environment, and technology. Schools must assess students' progress against more comprehensive outcomes and engage in evaluation and assessment of teaching in a publicly verifiable manner. The scope of these changes has overwhelmed many educators who do not have access to the most advanced information processing technology. Instructional Management Systems (IMS) utilizing computers are designed to manage many aspects of  schooling: curriculum development, instruction, evaluation, and assessment. However, computer technology and its benefits to information flow have been slow to enter the classroom and instruction. A new curriculum model must be adopted that keeps up with and effectively manages emerging and rapidly changing information. Well constructed IMSs allow unobtrusive and automatic acquisition of data in areas of curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment. The IMSeries software provides the information management tools to meet educators' needs. (Contains 15 references.) (JPT)",

Questionnaires sent by the New York State Council of School Superintendents (NYSCOSS) to 766 NYSCOSS members yielded 480 returns, a 63 percent response rate. The questionnaire examined demographics, contractual issues, retirement plans, and perceptions of education issues. Fifty-six percent of the superintendents said that they planned to retire by the year 2000, which will create a &quot;leadership vacuum&quot; in the state. Overall, respondents reported positive relationships with their boards of education, describing them as supportive, student-oriented, and forward-thinking. Forty-four percent said that they would choose the superintendency again, if given the chance to start anew. Although almost  one-half wanted to concentrate on curriculum and instruction issues, they spent more time involved in school finance, board relations, and personnel issues. They rated the top three local issues as school finance, passage of budgets/bonds/referenda, and personnel negotiations, and the top three state issues as implementation of the New Compact for Learning, school finance, and compliance with state/federal recordkeeping requirements. Of issues on the reform agenda, they placed most value on teacher and parent involvement and outcome-based education. Seven figures are included. (LMI)",

However, many students are not receiving these essential skills from their education. Minority students in particular, despite improved academic performance, still perform well below national averages. Restructuring schools to meet students' needs will require a rethinking of curriculum and instruction. A review of research challenges seven common assumptions about intelligence, teaching, and learning. Schools that focus on the needs of the learner construct all resources around attaining high achievement for all students. Strong administrative leadership, family-teacher collaboration, and effective classroom management are all characteristics of an  effective school environment. There are several recommendations for improving instruction and curriculum: basing decisions on informed research; supporting inquiry, consultation, and cooperative collaboration; and stressing achievement for all students. Staff development should be ongoing and an integral part of the school's philosophy. Recommendations are also offered for assessment, student grouping, school organization, student support, and family involvement.

The framework is comprised of external influences, individual leader internal processes, leadership practices, mediating variables, and student outcomes. Conclusions are: (1) Transformational leadership contains interdependent and equally important dimensions; (2) transformational leadership initiatives can be hindered if they ignore individual consideration; (3) transformational leadership practices are themselves contingent; (4) expert thinking lies behind effective  leadership practices and is not contingent; (5) distinctions between management and leadership cannot be made in terms of overt behavior; and (6) the dimensions of transformational leadership require modification when applied to schools.

A change in government resource allocation provided schools with substantially more money  for continuous professional development. In a review of the first year of a development program for middle and senior managers at Darlaston Community School in the West Midlands, all participants in the program judged it very positive and many wished to continue their training. The program improved management skills, confidence, and attitudes toward management.

A survey was conducted of 219 families of students with disabilities who had applied for the open enrollment option for the 1990-91 school year. The study found that students accessing open enrollment were distributed rather evenly across family income levels, elementary and secondary levels, and rural and metropolitan locations. There was no open enrollment participation of African-American students with disabilities. Reasons often cited by parents for transferring their child were: the  child's special education needs being better met at the new district; more personal attention from the teacher; and dissatisfaction with the resident school. How these reasons differ as a function of disability category, location, grade level, and parents' income or education level was also examined. (Contains 14 references.) (Author/JDD)",

Subjects were fitted with appropriate amplification to optimize their residual hearing but were performing below their grade-level placement in the areas of word attack and word identification, and made numerous reading decoding errors during oral reading of curriculum materials. The outcome objectives aimed to improve the students' phonetic skills for sound/letter units, single words, and connected reading material. The strategy, which was implemented for a 12-week period in the students' special education class, incorporated the use of 70 sound/letter unit flashcards, a comprehensive word list, and  the students' classroom reading text. Analysis of data revealed that all five students increased their accuracy for identifying sound/letter units and transferred this learning to single words and connected text.

Researchers analyzed requests for due process hearings filed between January 1, 1987 and June 30, 1988 in New Jersey, and received completed questionnaires from 53 mediated cases and 51 cases transmitted for a hearing, for a research sample of 104 cases representing about 30 percent of the total number of requests for a due process hearing during the 1-year period. Major issues in the 104 cases involved eligibility and identification, appropriateness of special education services, related services,  and placement. The expectation that mediation would resolve certain types of issues more readily than other issues was not met. Parents lost in 55 percent of the cases that went to a hearing, but lost in only 25 percent of the cases that were mediated. Parents lost or compromised on more cases involving eligibility and identification, won more cases dealing with the appropriateness of special educational services, and won or compromised on 67 percent of the placement cases. Lay advocates were equally as effective as trained attorneys in assisting parents in resolving disputes. School officials tended to be more satisfied than parents with the outcome of mediation. Parents reported significant problems in the implementation of the mediation agreements. (Contains 28 references.)  (JDD)",

The agencies involved are the National Association of State Directors of Special Education, the Council for Exceptional Children, the National Education Association, and the American Federation of Teachers and other organizations. The Collaborative's first step was to identify school districts or school sites that have effectively implemented inclusive school strategies. A survey was also conducted to identify resources in three categories: (1) statewide initiatives, (2) information documents or products, and (3) personnel preparation programs.

Although this is the documentation of secondary programming, with an emphasis on severe disabilities, these &quot;phases&quot; can be generalized to other program areas and levels of education. During phase I, a functional, community-based curriculum was delivered to students with severe disabilities at a special school site. Gradual integration for recess, lunch, and assemblies was implemented. During phase II students with severe disabilities were assigned to regular classes and community instruction with appropriate support. The third phase involved a refocusing so that all special education program areas are addressed within the framework of inclusion. A checklist  suggests indicators for the three phases of the inclusive school process. Attached are handouts and visual materials to accompany the presentation of this paper. (DB)",

Government involvement through subsidy in the 19th century was usually in the form of establishing special schools, including what is now Gallaudet University for students with hearing impairments. Higher education opportunities offered to students with disabilities were again expanded as a result of the G.I. Bill of Rights following World War II. Government involvement through regulation has included the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  Finally, government involvement through the judicial branch has affected postsecondary education of students with disabilities in such cases as Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka and a number of cases concerning Section 504. Issues addressed by some of these cases include: (1) faculty academic freedom versus the student's right to appropriate accommodation, (2) course examinations, (3) provision of deaf interpreting services, and (4) the extent of accommodations required. Finally, government involvement through administrative agencies has included actions of the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights. (Contains 42 references.) (DB)",

Parents became involved to observe and to carry the learning over into the home environment. Strategies included making pictorial flow chart plans and following them, conducting hands-on activities, and having students view videotapes of themselves at work. The results of pretesting and posttesting indicated that all 10 students made improvements in their ability to think of materials needed for age-appropriate activities. It was concluded that the strategies  increased the critical thinking skills of the students. Appendices contain teacher-made test items (including a checklist for pretesting and posttesting and a performance test), a parent questionnaire, and a letter to parents. (Contains 32 references.)

A needs assessment survey of mainstream teachers identified needs in the following areas: responsibility, cooperation, conflict resolution, and truthfulness. Grade-appropriate literature was tailored to each of the targeted areas and was read to students daily. Various activities to further enhance the literature were carried out, including discussion, formal writing assignments, journal keeping, art activities, role playing, and audio and video taping. Critical thinking questions were posed and discussed to  enhance self-expression and awareness in these areas. Although projected goals were not met, gains were made in each area by individual students. Students experienced attitude changes, improved self-concepts, and more realistic awareness of objective areas. Items in the appendix include the student contract, target behavior survey, the data collection chart, and critical thinking questions. (Author/DB)",

Teachers participated in two national training conferences, taught an ADA curriculum specifically written for students with disabilities, and developed future classroom plans. Implementation of the practicum involved conducting the training, writing an implementation guide for the training model, writing the ADA curriculum, conducting site visits, developing the ADA Clearinghouse and Teacher Resource Center, compiling an ADA resource packet,  and assisting teachers with overall guidance. Analysis of program evaluation data revealed that teachers increased their ADA knowledge as a result of the training model. A comparison of students' pretest and posttest scores showed increased knowledge about the law and the ADA after students (n=53) participated in the law-related instructional program. An appendix contains a 90-page training model implementation guide, with information and resource documents on planning training, training components, teacher training, student instruction, and program evaluation. The implementation guide provides a conference checklist, student questionnaire, teacher questionnaire, student portfolio criteria, and many other resource materials. (Contains 34 references.)

Chapter I, an introduction, defines \"coexisting disability,\" outlines prevalence and incidence, examines multicultural issues, and explores personal and social attitudes about substance abuse. Chapter II addresses the medical aspects of substance abuse, covering the classification of substances; effects on the central nervous system; pharmacology; and interaction of substances with physical, cognitive, mental, and emotional disabilities. Chapter III  considers assessment of substance abuse as a coexisting disability, with special attention given to the diagnostic interview. It describes signs and symptoms of substance abuse, criteria for psychoactive substance dependency, and methods of detecting substance abuse. Chapter IV covers the definition of treatment, intervention strategies, the need for family involvement, and interagency cooperation. Chapter V begins with the vocational rehabilitation counselor's responses to substance abusing clients and then addresses resources and networking, confidentiality, and appropriate methods for sharing information. Chapter VI discusses how traditional substance abuse treatment programs fail to meet the needs of many persons with disabilities and discusses ways to develop more accessible  treatment programs. Chapter VII addresses job development and placement in cases of substance abuse as a coexisting disability. Appendices contain the 12-step model for addiction recovery, a glossary of drug street language, and an annotated list of 19 suggested readings. (Each chapter contains references.) (JDD)",

        "description":"This handbook is intended to serve as a procedural guide for Utah school districts to improve the assessment and classification process for students who are behavior disordered. The handbook reviews Utah's definition of behavior disorders and explains some of the ambiguous terminology in the definition. The topic of social maladjustment is examined, along with its relationship to the behavior disordered classification. Types of behavior problems most often classified and served in programs for students with behavior disorders are reviewed. Fundamental principles and practices of educational and psychological assessment are presented. Using that as a base, best practices for assessing students who may be classified as behavior disordered are identified. The practices stress the  importance of evaluating current instructional conditions, documenting educational and social adaptive behavior, and implementing prereferral interventions. The handbook then concludes with a checklist to be used in making decisions about the classification of students with behavior disorders. Appendixes outline an observation system and list rating scales for school and home behavior disorders and for social skills assessment. (JDD)",

One group of meta analyses concluded that the strongest benefits from grouping were found in programs in which there was a great deal of adjustment of curriculum for highly talented learners. The other meta-analysis did not find any strong positive benefits of grouping, but did not examine grouping programs designed for highly talented students. Re-analysis of all studies included in both sets of meta-analyses confirmed that higher aptitude students usually benefit academically from ability grouping. Benefits are in  proportion to the amount of curriculum adjustment, with programs entailing acceleration of instruction resulting in the most gain on standardized tests. Grouping was found to have less influence on the academic achievement of middle and lower aptitude students. Analysis of noncognitive outcomes suggests that the effects of grouping on self-esteem measures measures for all ability groups are small and may even be rather positive. Results are contrasted with the conclusions of J. Oakes (\"Keeping Track: How Schools Structure Inequality\" (1985). The review concludes that American education would be harmed by the wholesale elimination of programs that group learners for instruction by ability. (DB)",

Originally begun as a time-limited parent group of children attending a therapeutic nursery program, the parent group has continued to meet into the children's adolescence. The group was initially led by two co-therapists but has continued with one leader. Although the parents have increasingly managed many aspects of the meetings, they continue to prefer an outside \"expert\" in the formal role of leader. Over the years, the focus of the group has changed from being completely about the children to covering the range of issues faced by the parents, including a marital breakup. This group's experience has led the agency involved to conclude that  parent support groups may frequently be the treatment of choice for parents of special needs children. (DB)",

        "description":"This report presents findings of a 1991 survey of 3,573 adolescents in Area Learning Centers and Alternative Schools, in Corrections and Detention Centers, and in Residential Treatment Centers in Minnesota. The study focused on six environmental stressors: family alcohol problems, family drug problems, experiencing or witnessing physical abuse, and intrafamilial and extrafamilial sexual abuse. The survey found that students in these programs were three to six times more likely than regular students to report at least three of these problems. A history of physical or sexual abuse doubled the likelihood of deliberate self-injury or suicide attempt, especially for females. Additionally, all groups were characterized by more frequent involvement in high risk behaviors (e.g.,  substance abuse). An encouraging finding was the relative success of the Alternative Schools and Area Learning Centers in engaging youth who had dropped out of school or were at risk for dropping out. Findings lend support to the existence of a general &quot;at risk&quot; syndrome, with implications for prevention and intervention. Two recommendations resulted: first, that adequate resources be provided to educational programs for this population, and second, that prevention programs include counseling, health services, and other support activities. Tables, graphs, and narrative provide the details of the survey findings for each type of program and compare findings with the 1989 survey of 91,175 adolescents in the state.

Hermeneutics is applied to the problem of the gifted underachiever, seen as the paradigm of giftedness-at-risk. The concept of &quot;at risk&quot; is seen to have its origins in ideas of insurance, resulting in technical educational efforts to reduce risk factors and descriptions of gifted students in terms of dehumanized qualities such as IQ scores and discrepancy data. Being &quot;at risk&quot; is redefined to include not only increased vulnerability but also increased  access to new possibilities for human fulfillment. A dialogue with one underachieving gifted adolescent illustrates the importance of trust and disclosure for the pedagogical relationship as well as the need for teachers to be enthusiastically engaged with both the curriculum and students.

It proposes, instead, a gifted way of life that is constituted by possibilities and is open to all persons. The hermeneutic paradigm of textual interpretation (in which the whole must be understood in terms of the parts and vice versa) is applied to a conversation with a 12-year-old gifted student interacting with an advanced text. Four possibilities for ontological giftedness are discussed: imagination, confusion, ignorance, and fusion of horizons. The familiar concepts of giftedness as high potential and gifted children as a civilization's treasure are challenged. The language arts  are seen as a subject area in which any child can lose himself and find himself as a gifted human being. (Contains 30 references.) (DB)",

        "description":"A survey was conducted of Minnesota families of students with disabilities (n=60) and without disabilities (n=60), and responses were compared to identify practices related to public school choice. Results indicated that the media were the primary source of information for families of general education students, while principals and teachers were the main source for special education students. Primary reasons for changing schools were quality of services, the new school's location, academic and athletic reputation, course variety, and climate for learning. For the most part, the reasons for transfer identified by families of students with and without disabilities were similar. School personnel seldom participated in transfer decisions by families of students without disabilities,  but were heavily involved in such decisions for students with disabilities. Families of students with disabilities reported school visits as being helpful in making the enrollment decision more often than did families of students without disabilities. Families of students with disabilities reported more improvement in academic performance than did other families. Family involvement for both groups remained relatively constant after the enrollment change. (Contains 26 references.) (JDD)",

The report then presents a study which evaluated opinions of families (n=75) of students with disabilities participating in one of Minnesota's school choice options, open enrollment. In addition to general demographic information, the survey included items related to open enrollment information sources, family decision-making, and the effects of the decision on participating students. Results indicated that: (1)  most parents did not experience any problems obtaining information; (2) over half the parents thought the services would be better as a result of a transfer; (3) over half the respondents felt that positive behavior changes in their children as a result of open enrollment included increased confidence in abilities, improved motivation to learn, improved academic performance, satisfaction with teachers and learning, better relations with friends, increased sense of responsibility, and higher education aspirations. Results suggest generally favorable responses for families of students with disabilities participating in the open enrollment option. (Contains 26 references.) (JDD)",

Results indicated that academic and educational concerns were some of the main reasons that prompted gifted students to transfer. Specific concerns were provision of more advanced courses, more course variety, better teachers, and stronger academic reputation. The most valuable sources of information about the open enrollment option were the mass media and the school principal. Parents of students with special talents moderately increased their involvement at their chosen school compared to their former  school.

The survey examined demographic characteristics, sources of information, reasons for transfer, and changes in parental involvement with schools. Most of the rural students with special educational needs who chose to participate in open enrollment were Caucasian and required services for a learning disability or speech disability. Parents procurred information on open enrollment from the radio, television, and newspaper about as often as they received information from principals and teachers combined. The most important reason parents of rural children with special needs cited for applying for open enrollment was to better meet the children's educational  requirements. Parents reported similar patterns of participation across activities at their child's former school and chosen school. Comments by parents of students with disabilities were most concerned with teacher effectiveness and transportation/school location issues; comments by parents of gifted students noted the curricular and extracurricular activities available. The study also observes that it is important to consider that the transfer of students with special needs into or out of a rural school district affects the financial welfare of that district and thus affects the quality of services provided.

Obstacles and barriers to implementing the philosophy of permanence planning, especially for children and youth with disabilities, are discussed. The paper: (1) describes programs sponsored by various state and private agencies that have overcome these barriers; (2) reviews Illinois expenditures in family support, showing that there is a need to increase fiscal and program effort; (3) discusses services for children and youth who are removed or placed out of their natural homes, but for whom adoption, foster care, or other alternatives to institutional care have not  been made available; (4) contends that the state's extensive use of out-of-home placements not only works against the goals of permanence planning, but diminishes the state's ability to fund supports and services that would enhance the ability of families to keep children at home; (5) outlines concerns related to the risk of child abuse in out-of-home placements versus the risk of abuse in family homes; and (6) offers excerpts from state reports on government-funded residential facilities that provide residential services and active treatment for persons under 22 years of age. Fifteen recommendations for Illinois policy development are presented.

The first component provides an overview of state school finance systems in general and considers the relationship between general and special education funding programs. It is geared to policymakers (and others) who are not experts in school finance concepts and practices. This  section includes information on basic support funding (e.g., foundation programs, percentage equalization, guaranteed tax base/yield programs, flat grants, and full state funding) and information on categorical aid, including approaches to special education funding and criteria for evaluating the various special education funding models. The second component provides an abstract of each state's special education funding mechanism for the 1992-93 school year.

Eight smaller &quot;breakout&quot; sessions examined the topics of equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, economic self-sufficiency, issues related to special populations, emerging issues, building a disability studies discipline, and creating a common nomenclature and classification. The document contains presentations, discussion, reports from the breakout sessions, and recommendations. Appendixes contain the conference agenda, participant and speaker lists, and a description of the National Council on Disability. (JDD)",

        "description":"This theme issue on acceleration of gifted students offers an Ontario (Canada) perspective on early entrance to school and grade-skipping. It begins with a history of acceleration programs and then outlines their current status, with less than 40 percent of school boards with gifted programs using some form of acceleration. It goes on to analyze acceleration's effectiveness; outline reservations of educators; examine research on social and emotional effects of acceleration; and review identification of candidates for acceleration. Guidelines on how and when acceleration should be used are presented, pointing out that a comprehensive assessment must include noncognitive factors, that acceleration of cohorts of children can help avoid social difficulties, that the system's  readiness to support the child must be assessed, and that the possible consequences of not accelerating the child should be considered. A concluding section revisits the definition of acceleration, concluding that it is not simply a controversial theory but a recognition of the needs and skills of individual students.

The focus of this document is to: (1) show how persons with disabilities can better participate in their rehabilitation programs; (2) lay the foundation for shifting attitudes about this process; and (3) outline how professionals in research and practice can improve their effectiveness through collaboration with all concerned. After an introductory chapter, the second chapter defines terms used in the study. The third chapter considers the historical and philosophical background of the issue of consumer participation. Next is a review of current systems of rehabilitation research and practice and  the relationship of these to consumer involvement. The strengthening of applications from research through the involvement of consumers and practitioners is the focus of the fifth chapter. The sixth chapter proposes a methodology for maximum inclusion of consumers, practitioners, and researchers into the traditional research and development methodology. The following chapter applies this methodology in a case study of &quot;how to devise an equitable approach to counselor performance evaluation.&quot; The final chapter presents the 12 recommendations.

National estimates are presented of the risks of chronic health conditions causing disability--including activity limitation, work disability, and need for assistance in basic life activities--based on an analysis of data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a continuing survey of the health of the noninstitutional United States population. Risks of disability are estimated and compared for 62 specific chronic health conditions or groups of health conditions adjusted for age, gender, and other social and demographic factors. Major highlights of the report include: (1) most chronic conditions do not have high  risks of disability (about 11.7 percent cause activity limitation); (2) the risk of disability is inversely related to prevalence of chronic conditions; (3) the epidemiology of disability is quite different for children than for adults; (4) risks of disability increase with age for most conditions (e.g., risk of chronic conditions causing work limitation is 4.3 times higher at ages 45-69 than at ages 18-44); and (5) mental illness conditions have low to moderate risks of causing disability, compared to physical health conditions.

In part 1, national statistics on disability and insurance status are provided for different measures and categories of disability. Estimates of the percent of the population with various types of insurance coverage or with no insurance coverage are provided by sociodemographic and disability status. In part 2, logistic regression models controlling for sociodemographic factors measure the impact of insurance on utilization of health services. In part 3, the relationships of poverty, employment, and disability with private  insurance, public insurance, and no insurance are examined in the context of policy options. Among highlights of the report's findings are: (1) an estimated 11.5 percent of the 35.3 million uninsured people in the United States have some activity limitation; (2) adults with activity limitation are slightly more likely than those without limitation to be uninsured; (3) men with severe disability have more access to Medicare than women, but women have more access to Medicaid; (4) children with activity limitation are as likely as those without limitation to be uninsured (about 15.8 percent); and (5) uninsured adults with disabilities have from 19 percent to 44 percent fewer physician contacts than similar adults with insurance.

Preliminary information includes an Indian Student Bill of Rights, discussion of the problem of talent identification, and discussion of special issues including diversity within the Native American population and cultural assimilation versus accommodation. Eight principles of identification are then presented. These include, among others, using assessments that go beyond a narrow conception of talent; using appropriate instruments with underserved populations; and using a multiple-measure/multiple-criteria approach to identification. Specific practices are then considered, which address: balancing the ideal and the practical;  deciding on a concept of talent; recognizing the issues of a particular school; identifying traits that may influence manifestations of talent; recognizing behaviors that distinguish some Native American students from the general population; looking for manifestations of talent potential, alternative behaviors, situations, and interpretations; selecting and constructing appropriate assessment tools; and using the collected student data to make decisions. Recommendations address technical assistance, professional development, assessment portfolios, experimental programs, and program funding. Five appendices include technical information concerning evaluation measures, two sample case studies, and a list of assessment instruments. (Contains 77 references.) (DB)",

Subjects representing two proficiency groups--beginning/intermediate and highly advanced--were asked to undertake an acceptability judgment task for five indirect request expressions in Japanese and English, respectively, for each situation. The transferability rate was computed for each situation by subtracting the acceptability rate of the English indirect request from the acceptability of the corresponding Japanese indirect request. The obtained transferability rate was considered as representing the psycholinguistic markedness of each strategy, which  determined its language-specificity/neutrality. The results indicate that contextual factors played a major role in determining transferabilities at the pragmatic level. Furthermore, some proficiency effects on the transferabilities of those indirectness strategies were identified. Based on those findings, further attempts were made to explore what kind of contextual factors were most likely to affect transferability. (Contains 16 endnotes and 51 references.) (Author/AB)",

The intended result is to heighten students' environmental awareness, knowledge, appreciation, and protective efforts through learner-centered instructional approaches, including learner-generated materials, cooperative learning, encouragement of creativity, integration of subject areas, and involvement with the community. The paper has three main sections. First, environment education is described and placed in the context of a global approach to  education. Controversies in environmental protection are discussed briefly here. Second, the psychological and linguistics roots of a learner-centered approach to education are contrasted with those of a teacher-centered approach, and learner-centered classroom techniques are described. The third section contains environmental activities for second language learners using a learner-centered approach, including songs, data-based exercises, problems in decision-making, and making resolutions about protecting the environment.

The 3-year period of the federal grant for program development had three stages. The first involved initial research and needs assessment. During this stage, three studies were conducted: theoretical approaches to curriculum development; assessment of the college's curriculum design in comparison with those of other Illinois higher education institutions;  and characteristics and circumstances of the college's population that affect learning. Findings of the last study are summarized. The second stage consisted of development of curricular strategies and design, using this information. Testing plans and courses developed during this stage are described, highlighting design considerations. The third stage involved evaluation and assessment of the changes introduced. (MSE)",

        "author":["Raymond, Patricia M."],
        "description":"A study investigated whether adult anglophone readers of French could be taught to use the organizational patterns (top-level structures, or TLSs) in expository text and whether they could then use this knowledge (the structure strategy) to facilitate reading comprehension as measured quantitatively through immediate free recall. Subjects were 43 university students of high intermediate level French proficiency divided into experimental (n=21) and control (n=22) groups. The experimental group received training in the use of five TLSs: description; sequence; causation; problem solution; and comparison. Training concentrated on use of the TLSs and their corresponding signal words as strategy for promoting recall. All subjects were pre- and posttested for reading comprehension and  recall. Subjects also completed rating scales to estimate text difficulty, memorability, affect, interest, background knowledge, clarity of argument, organization, recommendations, content, and discussion of content. Results indicate that: text topic was a significant factor in recall, suggesting that effects of training in structure strategy cannot be predicted across topics; more proficient readers appeared to have the structure strategy already, and those trained in it had improved recall; structure strategy is teachable; reading time was not significantly related to recall; and longer passages seemed to offer no disadvantages.

Specifically, the focus of the study is on the sequencing of other-introductions; namely, in an introduction that involves at least three participants, who gets introduced to whom? Three kinds of patterns are discussed based on collected data. First, four basic rules are formulated, each according to one distinct conditioning factor such as social status (when it is unequal), social distance, situational context, and the introducer's intent (when social status is equal). Next, four combined patterns with congruent factors are discussed. Finally, four overriding patterns that include two  conflicting factors are suggested; however, only the pattern regarding social status and situational context is confirmed due to the limited data set.

Socio-historical background is provided about Portuguese standardization and spread, the distribution of the language in the world today, and the development of its spelling norms. Discussion of the Accord and the ensuing debate is carried out through an analysis of the positions taken and of the arguments used by authors in a selection of scholarly and journalistic articles. These arguments are contrasted with Geerts, van den Broeck and Verdoodt (1977) who reported on a similar case. It is concluded that while most of the  debate revolves around issues of linguistic efficiency, the Accord and its proponents are primarily concerned with political and diplomatic efficiency.

Through participant-observer visits to minority student households, researchers and teachers became aware of these funds of knowledge. As a result of these research activities, teachers have come to view their students as competent participants in households rich in cognitive resources, and have consequently raised their expectations of students' abilities. Specific  sections of the digest discuss the following: researching funds of knowledge, which describes a research project carried out in Tucson, Arizona; teachers as learners and reflexive practitioners, which discusses the difficulties involved in implementing this research model; and funds of knowledge as transformative principle, which highlights the underlying transformative potentials in viewing the households as repositories of funds of knowledge.

        "description":"A discussion of second language program evaluation focuses on the interpretability of test scores as a criterion in program evaluation. It looks at both test design and research design issues. First, eight method-comparison, program evaluation studies that compare acquisition-based and analysis/practice based methods are described. Acquisition methods are defined as those in which students are exposed to the language as a whole, anticipating that the student will acquire structure subconsciously; traditional methods also use analysis, practice, and explanation to build language competence. Then two test-design issues are examined: test content (achievement vs. proficiency) and the kind of scale (norm-referenced vs. criterion-referenced) used. The choices made in the eight studies  are analyzed. Next, the effect of research design on interpretation of test scores is examined, with particular attention given to two issues: the purity of the instruction used and the background of the subjects. Two of the studies are selected as more easily interpreted than the others. The results of the studies are then summarized and compared, and implications for test development and valid use of test results in program evaluation are outlined. (MSE)",

The study was investigating whether: (1) realistic estimates of training needs were being made; (2) data from other tests would enable better prediction of student outcomes, and therefore of student admission criteria; and (3) some guidelines could be established for balancing test preparation and post-course language use in classroom instruction. Subjects were 129 students in 8 academic English classes. Results from one administration each of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the Canadian Test of English for Scholars and Trainees were used to predict gain in scores on a second TOEFL  administration. Results show the entry TOEFL scores to be misleading as to the homogeneity of the group and to provide an inadequate baseline for assessing student progress. Implications are found for both the design of the training program and for the use of gain scores in program evaluation.

Two seminars were conducted for evaluators. The first focused on determining priorities for evaluation, simulation of a presentation of results to teachers, and creation of an evaluation plan. Following this seminar, site visits were made to refine the plan. The second seminar included a report of the site visits, review of principles and techniques of evaluation, and preparation for analysis,  interpretation, and reporting of evaluation findings. Results of these seminars and field work were that the evaluators gained knowledge of and skills in evaluation procedures and became aware of support mechanisms available to them, and that teachers in the field provided feedback important to the evaluation process. The training provided both theory and needed practical guidance for participants. (MSE)",

First, the difference between applied linguistics research (classroom or institutional) and program evaluation are enumerated, and a distinction is made between advocacy and evaluation. It is suggested that a research-like procedure can masquerade as evaluation, and eight ways in which  program staff can turn this procedure into a cooperative process are outlined.

It is proposed that the process model, which negotiates content and procedure on the basis of student needs, perceptions, and learning styles, is the most direct and effective way of teaching, but that this requires that teachers develop self-assessment skills and sensitivity to learner needs and objectives. This approach was used in the practicum portion of a graduate training program for teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). First, trainees  identified the areas of classroom practice with which they needed the most help. Subsequently, the five most frequently mentioned needs (giving instructions, meeting the needs of mixed-ability groups, meeting the demands of mainstream work, questioning techniques, and reinforcing and practicing new language patterns and structures) were addressed through microteaching. The third stage involved reassessment of trainees' needs and perceptions, and the fourth repeated the microteaching cycle. Preliminary observations find the process model to be effective in improving classroom teaching and increasing trainee confidence. (MSE)",

It is argued that course evaluation by learners is based on their assessment of their own communicative performance, and that they are likely to attribute a general sense of progress, at least in part, to class activities. However, if self-direction is an instructional goal, a general sense of progress is not an adequate criterion. Evaluation of methodology should be encouraged from the outset and be focused on specific tasks. If learners see value in the tasks, they are more likely to use them for independent work. If teachers were to examine instructional tasks to determine whether learners can evaluate them positively  for effectiveness, they would find that the tasks are often inappropriate. Therefore, tasks should be: (1) identifiable by learners as involving a specific type of performance; (2) designed in such a way that they can be staged easily by a learner working on his own; and (3) include an element of enhanced feedback and practice to demonstrate improved performance. Incorporation of these elements in learning tasks is viewed as part of a broader strategy to develop learner self-direction. (MSE)",

The program provided inservice training for secondary school teachers of English as a Second Language, using locally trained Nepali staff and an expatriate training officer. The evaluation study involved comparison of language performance of students taught by program-trained teachers with that of students taught by untrained teachers. Baseline measurements of student performance were taken at grade 8 in 12 experimental and 12 control schools, and posttest results were ultimately available from 11 experimental and 11 control  schools. In addition, teachers were observed in class, were interviewed, wrote reports of their lessons, and submitted samples of pupils' work. Selection of participating schools was heavily influenced by serious problems of communication and information gathering in Nepal. Methodological problems were found in the following areas: the design of language tests used; quantity and reliability of data gathered; potential for bias in the observation structure; use of external evaluators; and sampling. Some recommendations are made for improving the process. (MSE)",

Subjects were 101 students from a variety of native language backgrounds. Results suggest that two background factors (extensive outside reading and high teacher proficiency in English) have a significant positive effect on TOEFL performance, and that communicative oral use of English in and outside of class  affects TOEFL performance through its positive influence on outside reading behavior. Student observations also highlighted the importance of proficient and qualified teachers. It is concluded that these criteria should be incorporated in evaluation of English programs, focusing less on specific test results than on the conditions that promote the ability to function in the target language.

The new syllabus emphasizes the processes and context of language learning, encourages exploitation of information technology, and provides less highly structured learning objectives. The curriculum is organized around themes supported by meaningful activities through which language skills can be integrated. It was first tested to determine how teachers responded to and used  it, and to gain feedback about problems encountered in implementation. The draft syllabus was implemented in a stratified random sampling of 12 schools (six primary and six secondary), with assistance of specialists, and teachers completed a survey about their opinions of the draft syllabus as a document, planning an integrated sequence of lessons based on it, implementation of the lessons, and teacher training and materials development needs.

The first of these techniques is a systematic approach to program data collection using varied kinds of information: qualitative and quantitative, formal and informal, and information that is both directly and indirectly relevant. Sources of information include test scores, student feedback, language teachers, program and university records, academic faculty, administrators, alumni, sponsors, and other programs. The second technique is a dual focus on evaluation process and product. Efforts are made to maximize the time, expertise, and  motivation of participants and to produce an annual program report useful to both program staff and outsiders. The third technique involves viewing the program from two additional perspectives: (1) having a role as part of a larger &quot;ecosystem,&quot; and (2) making decisions by balancing each option with the direct or indirect costs of an alternative. These techniques have been found useful at IUJ for reducing the problems inherent in program evaluation. (MSE)",

The studies were analyzed according to the following dimensions: the environment in which the data were collected (classroom, naturalistic, simulated classroom, or laboratories); rationale of the research; research design and data collection; type of data collected (quantitative or qualitative); and type of analysis conducted (grammatical, statistical, and/or interpretive). It is concluded that while there have been considerable advances in the field, future research would benefit by incorporating: more contextualized (classroom-based rather than classroom-oriented) research; an extension of the  theoretical bases of research agendas; extension of the range of research tools, techniques, and methods, adopting and adapting them where appropriate from content classroom research; re-evaluation of the distinction between process-oriented and product-oriented research; and a more active role for classroom practitioners in applied research.

        "description":"If teacher education is to train second language teachers to be principled practitioners, it is essential to resist the attraction of panaceas and recipe-type solutions to instructional problems, and to promote teachers' better understanding of what constitutes successful language learning. Second language acquisition (SLA) research, both applied and theoretical, can play an important role in this process, particularly in the areas of interlanguage and errors, learning vs. acquisition, and learning styles and learning strategies. The SLA component in the training program can be presented in the form of basic training in classroom research or incorporated into an experiential learning cycle in either pre-service or in-service training. In the latter case, trainers play a mediating  role. However, teachers and researchers must cooperate to turn theory into practice. Teacher trainers can supply both learners, needed as subjects by researchers, and ideas for useful research; researchers can provide research results to be translated into classroom practice. Such collaboration requires that trainers and researchers understand each others' terminology, possibly through an intermediate literature that makes research accessible to classroom teachers. In addition, more teacher training material on SLA is needed. (MSE)",

Three university students of differing language backgrounds, all non-native speakers of English, were interviewed in autumn and again 3 months later. On both occasions they were asked a range of general questions about their studies and reasons for choosing the university. In the first interview they were also asked to describe a short picture story, and in the second they were asked to recount the old story and a new picture story. Changes in the performance on the first story were analyzed for whether they: (1) could be attributed to knowledge of the first story; or (2) were also reflected in performance on  the second story. Analysis looked at pauses (filled and unfilled), repairs, vocabulary complexity, and syntactic complexity. Results indicate that one student seemed largely immune to all effects of familiarity except in clause subordination. That student improved mainly in linguistic complexity, another improved only in fluency, and the third improved in both areas, suggesting different patterns of oral development. (MSE)",

        "description":"In second language instruction, it is important to examine the learner's effort in carrying out classroom activities in order to relate teaching activities to learning theories. Any impact of a teaching activity on the learner's language development must result from what the learner does, not what the teacher does or intends for learner to do. The different forms of effort made by the learner can be classified and used to link theory to practice. Several distinctions can be made: most broadly, between imitation (repeating what the teacher does in an exemplary role) and cerebration (making sense of a problem, finding solutions, and testing them); within imitation, between reproduction (imitation of the language form itself) and simulation (reproduction of language behavior with  attention to its context); and within cerebration, construction (cerebration focused on language itself) and deployment (cerebration focused on a knowledge of the world handled through language). Classroom activities involving reproduction and simulation are form-focused and role-focused, respectively. Construction and deployment use activities that are rule-focused and meaning-focused, respectively. Reproduction and construction focus on language as an autonomous phenomenon. Simulation and deployment focus on things outside language as a formal entity. This categorization can inform construction of classroom activities. (MSE)",

        "description":"A discussion of diary studies, research on second language learning and teaching that uses student journals about the learning experience, defines the method, reviews a number of such studies, and examines the pros and cons of this approach. It is noted that diary studies are first-person case study research, a form of empirical (data-based) research enhanced by introspection and analysis. Introspection can be concurrent with the learning event, immediate retrospection, or delayed retrospection. Diary studies span this continuum. Problems associated with the method include: sampling limitations (small samples, biased subjects); data collection issues (those inherent in self-reporting, bias in retrospection, limitations of introspection, quality and breadth of entries, and  commitment of the diarist); and data analysis concerns (limited generalizability of small quantities of information, inappropriateness of causal statements, and all problems typically associated with qualitative analysis). The method is seen to have advantages for: teachers, in re-examining the language learning process; learners, for whom diaries are a safety valve for frustration, promote awareness of learning processes and pitfalls, and are evidence of progress; and language learning research, by adding to the knowledge base and also revealing new issues and factors to be considered.

However, it should be considered as an alternative research perspective for four reasons: (1) the writing off of personality variables in second language research has been unjustified, and results from giving credibility to studies based on ill-conceived assumptions; (2) a sufficiently detailed and elaborated theory of personality exists and could be built on profitably; (3) mainstream psychological research indicates variables and interactions that might be investigated in second language classrooms; and (4) such research is likely to be particularly relevant in cross-cultural studies because of distinctive national/racial personality profiles and mental ability profiles, particularly  in Asia. Research in the field suggests that personality may be of potential importance in a number of areas of second language learning and teaching, including general instructional approaches, choice of specific methodology, task-based learning, paired and group work, use of praise and reinforcement, range of classroom stimuli used, and testing.

Listeners do not know that the speech samples are from the same person, but judge the two guises of the same speaker as two separate speakers. The technique has been used to investigate a variety of sociolinguistic, social-psychological, and educational issues: attitudes of foreign language learners toward target language speakers and community; linguistic bases of teacher prejudice; attitudes toward different language varieties and codes; attitudes toward the speech of nonnatives or language learners; the phenomena of convergence and divergence; and the effect of speaker and hearer variables on comprehension, recall, or evaluation. Two recent applications of the  matched-guise technique in Japan investigated: (1) female Japanese high school students' attitudes toward English- or Japanese-speakers introduced as having lived in the United States or not thus introduced; and (2) native Japanese-speakers' reactions to code-switching (Japanese/English). Analysis of the technique's use suggests that some of its supposed advantages may be overstated, and that some alternatives may be as good or better. The overall soundness of the research appears to be more important than the use of this specific technique. Contains 82 references. (MSE)",

It is now generally accepted by academics, education leaders, and politicians that this should be a language already spoken by the learner. Research suggests that this will contribute to better, not worse skills in English at a later point. However, another issue to be considered is the kind of language (formal or vernacular) to be taught. In early PNG colonial history, written language was seen by native people as an almost mystical force because of the uses to which it was put by the Europeans. Cognitive skills required for literacy include visual skills to make the connection between sounds and symbols, skills for linking linguistic structure and meaning,  and skills in the ability to decontextualize language. Literacy materials should be produced or selected according to two main criteria: the language used must be real (meaningful) to the learner; and there must be a match between the materials and the learner's cognitive skills. Use of pictures in literacy materials also provides context for written text. A source of materials to be exploited is the newspaper.

The credit course was originally designed for native English-speaking students to address their academic writing needs. However, based on the idea that the writing tasks of native speakers and non-native speakers are similar and that their writing deficiencies are not significantly different, the course was open to learners of English as a Second Language. Early in the course, students complete a diagnostic writing assignment and initial writing exercises follow the pattern of the diagnostic assignment, drawing on students' personal experiences. Academic discourse is then introduced into instruction, along with strategies of invention, editing and proofreading, details of conventional  usage, and genre. In 1992, when non-native speakers were first enrolled in the course, a study was undertaken to test the idea that the two groups could be successfully integrated in the course. Subjects were 33 non-native speakers, of varied linguistic backgrounds, and 65 native speakers of English. Performance of the groups on the initial diagnostic assignment, course work, and final examination was compared. Results indicate that in general, native speakers attained higher grades but non-native speakers showed significant gains. However, a specialized course for non-native speakers is recommended.

        "author":["Dogancay, Seran"],
        "description":"Turkish language reform began as a language simplification effort by literary figures of the late 19th century, gathering momentum in the 1920s and 1930s to become a large-scale planning activity to save Turkish from domination by foreign influences. Change in script was easy due to low literacy rates, but purification of the lexicon, by stylistic simplification and lexical modernization, was always controversial. Reformers followed four strategies for finding authentic Turkish substitutes for foreign borrowings. A recent study in two Cyprus high schools investigated language usage in relation to Turkish language reform efforts and to assess results of some of the language-related educational policies. A total of 213 students from English-medium and Turkish-medium classes were  surveyed and tested on their knowledge of reform-based Turkish neologisms taken from daily newspapers, and their written compositions were analyzed for language usage. In addition, teachers and administrators were interviewed about their views on teaching and using the Turkish language. Results suggest that although Turkish language reform reshaped the language, it is now a much reduced effort, little reinforced in policy implementation in general and specifically in Cypriot schools. Further language planning is recommended. (MSE)",

Discourse analysis studies examined include research on classroom language, discourse in other settings such as work environments, business telephone communication, news media discourse, and student language use. Sociolinguistics studies include those on English, Cantonese, and Cantonese-English Mix. In the category of survey research are two language diary studies, many questionnaire studies on both attitudes and usage, and several matched-guide attitudinal studies. Research shortcomings are noted. It is concluded that while research problems existed before 1990, more recent studies have been characterized by more attention to research  design, rigor, and standardization of procedures and reporting conventions.

        "description":"Models of teacher training have tended to emphasize development of competencies in teachers that emphasize cognitive aspects of learning, and minimize affective factors. Second language teacher education has adopted this emphasis on learning as cognitive rather than as a strong interaction of cognitive and affective factors. In fact, affective factors are more important at the early stages of second language learning. Analysis of the classroom practice of a good second language teacher indicates that it is oriented toward development of the whole student and of appropriate affective states that enable students to learn more effectively. Salient features of good teacher behavior include treatment of students as persons whose needs are both intellectual and emotional. Transcripts  of classroom videotape recordings illustrate the principles. Little emphasis is placed on personality factors in teacher hiring. More attention must be given to the role of attitudes in second language learning, particularly in the earlier stages. (MSE)",

The needs assessment team conducted a number of surveys of students and teachers, including two assessments of student objectives and learning style preference and one of faculty perceptions of curriculum needs. The team addressing curriculum aims, goals, and objectives used data from the surveys to establish desired competencies, performance standards, conditions, and assessment tasks. The cognitive development team gathered and  collated research and practice in the area of cognitive development and learning strategies. An important contribution of this group was identification of student attitudes and beliefs that might hinder learner independence. Writing teams began to develop the 12 books planned for the course. Activities focusing on learner cognitive development are highlighted here. The learner assessment research team also focused on mechanisms for teaching students self-assessment and individual responsibility for learning. Further research needs are outlined. (MSE)",

Psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic functions of the term are examined, including its etymological and usage history and images associated with its application in a variety of locations and cultural contexts around the world. The debate over whether Creole is a non-standard dialect of another, usually dominant European language or is a language in and of itself is examined briefly, and further formal analysis of the non-European origins of Creoles is recommended. Haitian Creole is seen as belonging to a family of Afro-centric Creole languages deserving of further study, rather than as a &quot;poor relative&quot; of French. It is proposed that  linguistically, the most consistent approach is to view the modern indigenous language of Haiti as Haitian, having a status as a language equal to that of common European languages. Official acceptance of this status and terminology, including an amendment to the constitution, and its incorporation into the educational system are urged. (MSE)",

Subjects were 460 students in a number of disciplines at Chulalongkorn University. Results indicate that second-year EAP achievement is directly correlated with: student gender; secondary school program; general English background; motivation; teachers' qualifications, English-teaching experience, experience in an English-speaking country, and major field of study; teaching method; and supplementary teaching. An additional five variables had statistically significant indirect effects on student achievement. Some explanations for the results are offered. (MSE)",

The first course leads to a diploma in elementary/secondary ESL teaching, and is characterized by both written and practical work done only internally, a series of small essay examinations replacing the traditional final examination, and content and methods emphasizing the teaching of young learners. It is intended to upgrade the skills of experienced teachers. A certificate course was designed for inexperienced ESL teachers, especially non-native speakers, consisting of language improvement and methodology components. Two proposals for training of qualified  teachers without formal training in ESL instruction include one for training oriented to specific age groups (5-10, 11-14, and 15-17 years) and one that makes no distinction between native English-speaking and non-native teachers. Both are assessed and found inadequate. These and other considerations in designing ESL teacher training curricula are outlined. (MSE)",

The languages considered are French (the official language), two national languages (Lingala and Munukutuba), and mother tongues. Data are drawn from interviews with 253 individuals of different ages and genders and in different locations (Brazzaville, towns, and villages). Results indicate that differences in parental and child language use are least in villages, greatest in the city, with subjects changing more often from mother tongue to Lingala or  Munukutuba than to French. Mother tongue knowledge was virtually universal, with knowledge of national languages somewhat less common and French knowledge least common. Younger subjects were more likely to know French or national languages. Distinctive patterns of language use in different domains and by different age groups were also revealed. It is concluded that: national and official languages are gaining in importance; men know and use more French than women; each language type is relatively more important in some domains than in others; and Congo is in linguistic transition.

Despite follow-up questions that encouraged them to talk about one personal narrative at length, Japanese children spoke succinctly about collections of experiences rather than elaborating on any one experience. Conversations between mothers in the two cultures were examined in order to account for the way in which cultural narrative style is transmitted to children. Comparison of mothers yielded the following contrasts: (1) Japanese-speaking mothers requested less description from their children than English-speaking mothers; (2) Japanese mothers gave less evaluation and showed more attention than English-speaking mothers; (3) Japanese mothers paid attention more  frequently to boys than girls; and (4) at 5 years of age, Japanese children produce 1.22 utterances per turn on average, while English-speaking children produce 2.0 utterances per turn. It is suggested that the production of short narratives in Japan is understood and valued differently from such production in North America. (Author/AB)",

This digest summarizes the existing types of programs that prepare English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) adults for the workplace or help workers whose first language is other than English who are already on the job. First, the meanings of &quot;workplace language instruction&quot; are discussed (pre-workplace classes, &quot;work-centered&quot; approaches, &quot;worker-centered&quot; approaches.) Next, current perspectives on workplace learning are highlighted. The final section of the digest looks at constraints on ESL workplace program development, focusing on needs assessment, assessment measures, participant attitudes and expectations, enrollment management,  language choice, financial and organizational support, building coalitions, and decentralization.

The first section of the bibliography is a review of the materials found during the course of the literature search. The section is divided into three parts: large scale assessment, alternative assessment, and published reviews of tests. Large scale assessment refers to assessment information and strategies used at program and/or state levels. The annotated materials deal with issues and problems of accountability and large scale assessment. Also, assessment strategies of the Northwest Workplace Basics project and JTPA are summarized. The  alternative assessment section includes information on types of assessment that are not standardized. The articles reviewed in this part deal primarily with classroom assessments, which can be used to improve instruction and monitor learner progress. Articles relate to assessment practices in English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL), Adult Basic Education (ABE), and public education programs. Sections two, three, and four have updated citations on alternative assessments--portfolios, reading alternatives, and mathematics alternatives--that are available through the Test Center at the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. These have been kept separate in order to facilitate procurement for examination by interested professionals. (AB)",

        "description":"Research findings are reported that suggest that valid interpretation of assessment scores on illiterate and preliterate learners requires the use of ethnographic data. Data from observation notes, photos, and audiotapes indicated that learners' understanding of their tasks affected their performance in assessment situations. Previous findings from studies involving English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) learning suggests the need to combine qualitative and quantitative research methods. The following recommendations are offered for procedures in cross-cultural educational research: (1) supplement written information about the subjects' culture with interviews with cultural informants and participant observations; (2) conduct a pilot study with individuals from the target culture;  (3) determine how subjects view their participation in the study and anticipate a high number of noncompleters; (4) check the reliability of translators' messages to subjects; (5) accommodate cultural patterns in procedures; (6) verify subjects' familiarity with media used in the study; and (7) contextualize quantifiable outcomes with the ethnographic data collected during the study. Future directions for research on ESL literacy are noted. Appended materials include tables displaying quantitative data, a sample of translated documents (post-instruction interview), sample observation notes, and a sample drawing. Contains 142 references.

        "author":["Lado, Ana"],
        "description":"This article is an exploration of differences among adults studying beginning English as a Second Language (ESL). Data was obtained through interviews with 20 Washington, DC-area Spanish-speaking adults enrolled in beginning ESL classes who had a range of different literacy levels in their first language. The interviews included two phases, one focusing on sociological factors and the other on testing and teaching, and the students' differences were examined in terms of both sociology of language learning and classroom instruction. The discussion bridges theories in adult literacy and ESL literacy with examples drawn from classroom-based research. Literacy is seen not as an autonomous skill but part of a non-autonomous framework. Illiterates are identified as a distinct social  group, and the ESL literacy classroom is shown to be a cross-cultural situation in which the teacher's literate view and usage of language contrasts with the illiterate student's oral ways of using language and of learning. It is concluded that general notions of the effectiveness of current ESL programs wrongly lead to notions of complacency about the success of ESL literacy. ESL classroom programs are mismatched to the needs of the lowest level illiterate immigrant. ESL literacy models are needed that reflect an understanding of the cross-cultural nature of an ESL literacy classroom and of the relationships between literate teachers and illiterate students. Results suggest that the illiteracy of adults from Spanish-speaking countries indicates a host of other sociocultural  characteristics that affect their ESL attainment and integration into U.S. society.

This curriculum guide is the result of those efforts. In addition to the basic objectives of developing such a curriculum, the ten particpating tutors shared the added objective of bringing their adult students to an understanding of how the rights, protections, and responsibilities that come from the Constitution and the Bill of Rights affect their own life, the  lives of others, and the life of the community of which they are a part. Each of the lessons is developed around each of the Amendments and include language development activities and reading, writing, and discussion activities.

Data for the earlier years came from the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS). Highlights of the findings note that in 1992-93 full-time instructional faculty on 9- and 10-month contracts earned an average salary of $44,700; also that for the first time during the 10-year period average salaries for professors and associate professors showed an equal annual increase of 2.4 percent. Trend analysis showed that in both 1982-83 and 1992-93 professors and lecturers in private institutions had higher average salaries  than faculty in public institutions and that average salaries in constant dollars continue to be higher for males than for females. The bulk of the document consists of six tables showing average salaries by academic year and rank; by control of institution; by rank and sex (current and constant dollars); by academic rank; by type and control of institution; and the Consumer Price Index factors for the decade.

A discussion of strategic planning's part in CQI adoption argues that successful efforts should &quot;begin with the end in mind.&quot; Another section describes current new efforts at Western  Michigan University and Florida State University to implement CQI planning. Lessons from their initial efforts are to start in administrative areas, to employ a &quot;small gains&quot; strategy, to make participation voluntary, to lead by example, to &quot;just do it,&quot; to let people choose their own projects, to avoid using business buzzwords, to maintain a low initial profile, not to promise big cost savings, and to celebrate successes.

        "description":"This paper describes some lessons learned from the first 2 years of Total Quality Management (TQM) implementation at the Coast Guard Academy (New London, Connecticut). Key issues for TQM adoption at the Academy included leadership, training, organization, total involvement, and measurement. It was found that top management must define the institution's direction and support change. To implement TQM the Guard invested heavily in training 5 percent of its work force. The Academy provided a 3-day training course for 32 senior and middle managers and a 9-day course to 10 facilitators from every division. New organization efforts included formation of a Quality Management Board (QMB) to prioritize and coordinate projects. To lay the groundwork for total involvement the Academy started  by implementing TQM first in the service departments and by chartering a study group to recommend a process for adding TQM to cadets' educational and professional development programs. Difficulties were found with measuring change and efforts are continuing to work to improve and simplify quantitative documentation. Early efforts have used surveys and measures of timeliness and dollars saved. A conclusion emphasizes that TQM implementation is a long range project with great potential benefits to the institution and its customers. (JB)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the principles of strategic planning and how they can be applied in open and distance learning for greater student success. The model selected for discussion is the Applied Strategic Planning Model which proposes nine important steps for strategic planning: planning to plan, values audit, mission formulation, strategic business modeling, performance audit, contingency planning, gap analysis, integrated functional plans, and implementation. The paper argues that the rate and depth of change in the world demands strategic planning for effective, holistic response to complex situations. A further section elaborates on the profound global and educational changes now taking place, changes that are bringing education to the threshold of a different reality.  Effective response demands that planners completely rethink their approach to planning and particularly that they abandon linear planning and be open to challenging all assumptions about change. A discussion of technology's impact suggests that traditional institutions may advance beyond distance education in taking advantage of technological improvements. In planning, the factory model where the learner is product will not work. Planning must enable learners and learning. A conclusion urges distance educators and institutions to be awake and responsive to these changes. (Contains 23 references.) (JB)",

        "description":"A research study of the use and perceived value of minority-targeted scholarships (MTS) by undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools is reported in this document. The research used a mail survey of financial aid directors at 300 four-year undergraduate and graduate schools and another survy of 349 dental, law, and medical schools. In addition, case studies were done of the impact of such scholarships on six schools' goals of increasing minority representation. The survey results showed that, though many schools award MTS, these scholarships account for a small proportion of total scholarships and scholarship dollars. Most schools awarding MTS used race or ethnicity as an eligibility requirement, while few used gender, religion, or other minority status. Race or ethnicity  was rarely the sole criterion with other criteria commonly being financial need and/or academic merit. Students receiving MTS were a small percentage of all racial or ethnic minority students. Schools funded MTS through private endowments and income from tuition and other fees. Four of the six schools in the case studies used MTS fairly extensively and found them valuable in recruiting and retaining minority students. Extensive appendixes contain aggregated responses to the questionnaires, information on the questionnaire scope and methodology, the six case studies, and a list of contributors to the report. (JB)",

Using written questionnaires, interviews, participant observation at the site, and photos of art work done by participants, the study gathered information on career choices, perceptions of the job market, choice of courses, jobs held while in school, previous training, and advising and support. The 22 students questioned were all upper division Art students. The study identified themes which showed that participants chose a Studio Art major for avocational reasons, that many had past negative work experiences, that for career advice they did not seek advice beyond the Art Department and their peers, that most planned  graduate work in order to teach art at the college level, and that most expected that their earnings after graduation would be very low. The study also found a lack of coordination with other parts of the institution and possible outside resources. (Contains 22 references.) (JB)",

An introductory section offers a preface, information on the authors and a first chapter &quot;University Colleges Today&quot; by Diane W. Strommer which examines the implications of an institutional unit for freshmen and reports on a survey of university colleges conducted during 1991 and 1992. Chapter 2, &quot;An Historical Perspective (Ohio University)&quot; by Samuel Crowl, looks at how the University College at Ohio University has served students for nearly 60 years. Chapter 3, &quot;The Retention of Students (Ball State University)&quot; (Indiana) by Barbara Weaver, examines the evolution over the past decade of the University  College specifically designed to retain students. Chapter 4, &quot;Coherence through Coordinated Advising (The Pennsylvania State University)&quot; by Eric White depicts an undergraduate division developed to provide coherence in a large, diverse, research university. Chapter 5, &quot;Flexibility at a Comprehensive University (The Ohio State University)&quot; by Thomas L. Minnick describes how this large university assists students in coping with the choices and changes at a multiversity. Chapter 6, &quot;Valuing the First-Year Student (Butler University)&quot; (Indiana) by Marilyn K. Spencer, describes how a university college functions within a relatively small, private university, particularly in the college's mission to manage a core curriculum. Chapter 7, &quot;Constancy, Change, and Campus Politics (University of  Rhode Island)&quot; by Diane W. Strommer, discusses some of the political issues surrounding university colleges especially at the University of Rhode Island. Chapter 8, &quot;Supporting Students in the Historically Black University&quot; (Alabama A&amp;M University and others)&quot; by Fran Johnson, addresses the role of the university college in the historically black university. Chapter 9, &quot;The Differences Made: A Sampler and Data from Institutions with No Freshman College&quot; and Chapter 10, &quot;Issues for New University Colleges&quot; both by Diane W. Strommer, draw conclusions about how university colleges make a difference. Appendixes contain the Association of Deans &amp; Directors of University Colleges &amp; Undergraduate Studies constitution, guidelines for oversubscribed or impacted programs, and sample mission  statements and organization charts.

The case studies describe strategic review and planning efforts in times of fiscal austerity. They look at streamlining, but also explore permanent changes to the budget incentive systems to help faculty and staff looking for ways to streamline. Some address vertical rather than horizontal program cuts. Others consider refocusing mission in light of taxpayer revolts which altered where universities thought they were going. The studies describe an expanded commitment to serving their communities, and explore enrollment growth financing. The approaches described range from creative  partnerships to programmatic changes in scale and scope to quality management projects, but they all have a common result: significant resource economies without diminution of quality or access. Institutions included in the case studies are the California State University System, Cleveland State University (Ohio), Southern Oregon State College, State University of New York at Geneseo, Towson State University (Maryland), University of Central Florida, University of Maine System, University of Southern Colorado, University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, and Washburn University (Kansas).

        "description":"This newsletter issue focuses on the roles played by higher education finance and student financial aid in ensuring broad access to higher education. Specifically, the report discusses trends in family income and college costs that affect the need for student aid. The report finds that income remains a primary determinant of students' educational opportunities. Students from higher income families enroll in college at rates three to four times greater than students from lower income families. Government student aid programs have not successfully overcome financial barriers to college and significantly increased the college enrollment rates of students from lower income families. Colleges themselves, through institutionally funded grants, provide an important part of the access  currently available to low-income students. College is becoming less and less affordable for lower income and middle income families. Because a high and increasing proportion of all American children are in lower income families, their access to college is likely to erode unless action is taken. Overcoming the financial barriers to college will require increasing amounts of student aid and guidelines that carefully target aid to the neediest students. Seventeen graphs present college-going rates by family income, percent of young adults enrolled in college, and trends in college costs. (JDD)",

The study combined the baccalaureate origins of education doctorates with the rankings of countries, and considered each country's cultural, social, economic, and political practices. Findings include: (1) the top five ranked countries which produced the most doctorates in education were respectively, Canada, Thailand, Iran, South Korea and Taiwan (tie), and Nigeria; (2) the countries that produced the most men doctorates in education were Canada, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and South Korea; (3) the countries which produced the most women doctorates in education were Thailand, Canada, Taiwan, South Korea,  and the Philippines; (4) the top-ranked countries which produced more men than women doctorates in education were Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Iran, Canada, and Egypt; and (5) the top-ranked countries which produced more women than men doctorates in education were Thailand, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Brazil, and West Germany. The study notes that the U.S. produced more doctorates in education than all the other countries combined between 1980 and 1989, and it hypothesizes that those nations with egalitarian values, booming industries, and stable governments would most likely have more students seeking higher education. An appendix provides complete data for all countries. (Contains 10 references.) (JDD)",

The five strategies are incrementally more complex--they require increasing levels of faculty skills, resources, and system-wide cooperation for implementation. Faculty development options targeted at both arts and letters and business faculty are discussed, such as curriculum development seminars, business vocabulary workshops, and international travel and  teaching. Seven steps are presented that outline a strategic change process that can facilitate moving toward internationalization. The paper discusses the factors that influence choice of internationalization strategy and presents a case study of the development, implementation, and future plans of an integrated, internationalized business and liberal arts curricula strategy at San Diego State University. An appendix offers suggestions for developing and implementing &quot;ideal&quot; internationalized Organization Behavior and Human Resources Management curricula that facilitate implementation of internationalization strategies.

In response to these criticisms, changes in management education are being made primarily in three areas: interdisciplinary approaches, international business, and foreign languages. A comparison of changes being made at two leading business schools (the University of Michigan and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania) is presented. The two schools were found to parallel each other in such areas as enhancement of the global focus, exchange of students and faculty with other educational institutions, team teaching and learning, problem-centered courses, and commitment to continuous innovation and improvement. The  University of Michigan was found to be unique in having courses comparing how various countries approach business, and having language programs for students and faculty. The Wharton School was unique in offering the opportunity for students to develop cross-functional majors, using 6-week teaching modules, and having a pre-entry 4-week period for all first-year students. Factors that other institutions might want to consider in determining what changes are appropriate and practicable for them are listed. (JDD)",

        "description":"A globally responsive education is needed to prepare students to work and live in the 21st century. A combination of knowledge of languages, cultures, and business will enable individuals to successfully work with others and better understand and respect the diversity of world cultures. University education should provide a balance between the transient interests of a particular society and time in history (the professional aspect) and the enduring truths of civilizations (the liberal arts, the humanities). International education must be committed to making all students more knowledgeable about the world and business management as it is practiced in a global context. The only way to accomplish this objective is through a core curriculum or general education requirements that  will &quot;touch&quot; every student. Courses in world civilization, American foreign relations, and area studies help students acquire an international perspective which will in turn help them better understand their own country. Minimal proficiency in foreign language and cultures and some basic knowledge in international business should also be required. Students should be encouraged to spend at least a semester abroad. An affiliation should be developed with an institution of higher education in a foreign country, for the exchange of students and faculty. Faculty development is also essential.

Eight mock negotiations are conducted, involving the countries of China, Japan, South Korea, India, Germany, France, Nigeria, and Brazil. Two student teams participated in each negotiation, with one team representing an American firm or association and the other team representing the government of the foreign country. The Framework for Global Business Negotiations is utilized, which outlines 4 components  that are divided into 12 variables influencing the success or failure of the negotiations: (1) policy (basic concept of negotiation, selection of negotiators, role of individual aspirations, concern with protocol, significance of type of issue); (2) interaction (complexity of language, nature of persuasive argument, value of time); (3) deliberation (bases of trust, risk-taking propensity, internal decision-making systems); and (4) outcome (form of satisfactory agreement). Students were uniformly supportive and complimentary of this phase of the international business management course. (JDD)",

One of the goals of the course was to explain the history, traditions, and values of Latin American societies through chosen themes. One of the themes chosen was the search for identity by the Latin American people and the repercussions in the international business sphere, targeting specifically Mexico. The unit of study began with a review of Latin American geography, which led to discussion of the mixture of races and its consequences. Literary texts were chosen to recreate the historical epoch in  which the issue of identity was vital; such texts present cultural behaviors which sometimes conflict among themselves, thus creating a microcosm. Students also presented reports about modern Mexico and discussed current events there. In order to avoid presenting only cultural contrasts, stereotypes, and isolated characteristics, the course recreated a more complete system of cultural practices in extended contexts with authentic materials.

This knowledge should include familiarity with the economic, political, social, and cultural diversity that is part of the human heritage, and an understanding of how these factors structure the contexts in which business is done. With these considerations in mind, Illinois Benedictine College constructed a multidisciplinary program combining traditional functional instruction with discipline-based instruction in international history, comparative economics, and other relevant international social sciences and humanities, including an 18-hour foreign language  requirement. Many special courses were developed by the history, political science, economics, and language departments; some were team-developed and/or team-taught. The major builds an understanding of the nature of culture and cultural processes that can be applied to specific social and cultural systems. Some area-specific culture and business courses are also offered. Two additional programs developed include weekend minicourses outlining social and cultural contexts of business in specific countries, and a 5-year program that allows students in some majors to earn a master's degree in business with 1 year of additional enrollment past the bachelor's degree.

The purpose of the tour was to explore and assess innovative business strategies, international business strategies, the role of quality, and cultural adaptation in the business environment in Asia and Europe. Instructional components included presentations by prominent business and government leaders, 5-hour visits to companies in small groups, and cultural tours. This paper presents findings on participants' attitudes based on pre-tour and post-tour survey data. Results indicated that: (1) the largest changes in  participants' attitudes occurred for those statements relating to participants'&quot;comfort&quot; levels; (2) in all cases, participants felt more comfortable after the overseas study tour; (3) after the tour, participants responded that it is less difficult to enter a foreign market than they had felt prior to the tour; and (4) the tour increased the awareness of management practices and negotiating similarities around the world. The paper concludes that overseas study tours should become an increasingly important component of Executive MBA programs everywhere. (JDD)",

The report summarizes governing board reports and the actions institutions have taken to assist students toward timely degree completion. It also summarizes board responses to three particular areas of concern which the bill mentions, namely: (1) possible effects of a reduction in the number of degree programs offered; (2) potential effects of increased student costs due to extended time to completion of degrees; and (3) possible effects on core curricula. Finally, the report outlines Commission  recommendations for further action. Among the recommendations are the following: (1) governing boards of higher education should define and clearly communicate to students the number of credits and the number of semesters of full-time study normally expected for completion of undergraduate degrees and identify the conditions that would justify degree programs that exceed those guidelines; (2) academic council members and Colorado Commission of Higher Education staff should identify possible incentives for students to take greater advantage of advanced placement courses and credits as a means of enhancing their academic standing when they enroll in postsecondary institutions; and (3) an increased emphasis on specific data and action plans addressing academic persistence should be included  in two-year and four-year institution accountability reports to the Commission.

Specific discussions address the preparation of Virginia's institutions of higher  education for the next century within the context of budgetary constraints and cover curriculum changes and new ways of teaching, organizational restructuring of colleges and universities, and the expansion of educational capacity. Also examined are the expected capital outlays in the 1990's, during which time it is suggested that, between the years 1992 and 1998, outlays of at least $1 billion are needed for educational and general space.

Restructuring in the areas of staffing productivity and curricular change is urged. Recommendations are offered in the context of the expectation that at least 65,000 additional students will seek higher education by the year 2001 and the approval by voters, in 1992, of $472 million in bonds which will allow accommodation of about 40,000 more students. The report urges that the following specific tasks be completed by 1996: efforts toward de-bureaucratization and decentralization of  both state government and the colleges and universities; state enrollment planning to restructure at a reasonable pace; increased institutional planning; Council of Higher Education advocacy of faculty salaries and development; construction, renovation, and maintenance of instructional and research space; procurement of superior instructional and research equipment; funding for library materials; and provision of adequate student financial aid. The report suggests that funding increases should be targeted toward improving salaries and providing incentives to help institutions extend the reach of current faculty. Tasks to be completed by century's end include changing to a competency model rather than the current &quot;credit-for-contact&quot; model of educational delivery and effective use of  technology in classrooms and laboratories.

Part 1 of the report responds to House Joint Resolution No. 211, which asks Virginia's Council of Higher Education to study the transition between high school and college. Programs are discussed that are designed to facilitate the transition, including an Advanced Placement Program, the Virginia Community College System's Dual-Enrollment Program, the International Baccalaureate, and dual-credit courses offered by four-year institutions. Part 2 responds to the Appropriations Act Item 151 that asks the Council to examine the feasibility of a 3-year college degree. It concludes that high  school seniors who take advantage of the previously described programs can complete the degree in 3 years. Part 3 responds to the House Joint Resolution No. 142 that addresses barriers to college graduation including elements in the student's background, choices students make, non-academic pressures on students, and the role of decreasing institutional resources.

Three objectives are addressed: access, quality, and effective use of resources. The Council recommended that an additional $223 million should be appropriated from the state general fund for higher education in 1994-96. If allocated, annual tuition and fee increases need not exceed three percent, roughly the projected increase in Virginia's per capita income and the Consumer Price Index. The presidents also  commit their institutions to: (1) freeing up of 1.5 percent of the academic and administrative budgets for 1994-96; (2) evaluating and improving faculty productivity and compensation; (3) improving retention and graduation rates; and (4) publishing admission profiles, graduation and retention rates, the results of employer and alumni surveys, and other measures of the results being achieved. The presidents ask the state government to: keep the state's funding of colleges and universities at 12 percent of the state's general fund budget, provide faculty salary increases, provide an equipment trust fund with lease payments paid entirely from the general fund, and continue to provide operating funds and capital outlay for those initiatives already funded implement the recommendations of the  Commission on the University of the 21st Century.

        "description":"A study was done of faculty job satisfaction and mobility at Michigan State University (MSU) by surveying all full-time faculty and specialists there. A multiple-item survey was sent to each participant during February and March 1991. Responses totaled 1,014, a 51 percent response rate. Most respondents had tenure, were hired between 1967 and 1980, and their average age was 49 years. On analysis of the data, several findings emerged, including the following: (1) most respondents spent 35 percent of their time teaching, 26 percent conducting research, and the rest on other activities; (2) most would like to devote less time to teaching, service, and administrative activities; (3) job satisfaction was high with 73 percent &quot;somewhat&quot; to &quot;very satisfied&quot;; (4) 23 percent were  interested in leaving MSU, 21 percent were uncertain about their intention, 11 percent planned to retire, and 23 percent would resign for a similar position at another university; (5) of 44 possible reasons for leaving MSU the top 5 were availability of research funds, research opportunities, reputation of the department, departmental leadership, and salary; and (6) faculty were concerned about a proliferation of administrative positions that isolated them from decision-making. Overall the study concludes that the faculty wants and needs a productive environment for quality teaching, research, and service; a stronger voice in the decision-making process; and while institutional loyalty remains strong, the temptation to exit only lies slightly submerged below the daily activities of the  faculty.

        "description":"A study was done of private liberal arts colleges and universities and their recent experiences with conducting capital campaigns. A 24 question checklist-style survey was mailed to 29 institutions in 17 states. Participants were either currently engaged in a capital fund raising campaign or had recently completed one. Twelve of the 29 colleges responded to the first mailing. This was followed by telephone interviews. All 29 colleges eventually responded either by mail or by telephone. Data were analyzed by calculating simple means for most of the questions. The typical institution was a 125-year-old private institution with 65.5 percent claiming a religious heritage. The larger the trustee body, the greater the percentage of the total goal was their personal giving. The average  percentage for all boards was 27.2 percent. On average 47.5 percent of alumni gave to campaigns. In addition, the largest gift to a campaign was: typically from an individual; given before the campaign was publicly announced; and in the $2 million to $6 million range. The institution's president was important to campaign success as an active participant and visible leader. Successful planning initiated and led by the president tended to draw trustees into the campaign planning. Timing in response to economic conditions was often mentioned as an important consideration. Most colleges exceeded their overall campaign goals. (JB)",

Though retention enhancement programs work best when institution-wide support and commitment are behind them, the techniques described here can be implemented in the classroom with significant results even while lacking all institutional support. The techniques described have all been used extensively by the author, a teacher. They are: (1) learn their names; (2) assign specific required office hour visits early in the semester; (3) use \"calling cards\" (a system of telephone networking between students\"; (4) touch each student (handshakes especially encouraged); (5) use peer tutors and counselors; (6) use collaborative learning  frequently; (7) use 5-minute get acquainted sessions (formats suggested); (8) encourage joining of clubs and campus activities; (9) walk them through the campus; (10) take field trips; (11) vary instructional mode; (12) make very short term assignments; (13) set very short term goals; (14) include everyone in classroom discussions; (15) make a scrapbook about successful role models; (16) be fair, firm, demanding, consistent, and predictable; (17) provide all materials from the beginning; (18) be animated in your instruction; (19) teach a memory skill; and (20) be \"up beat\" and cheerful.

        "description":"A planning and study process was undertaken to formulate a new governance system for higher education in Kansas. The research portion involved review of the literature, individual interviews with over 25 decision makers in the state, and consultation with national experts. The work indicated that the state needed to restructure higher education governance. Four recommendations were advanced: (1) development of a Master Plan for higher education; (2) careful and precise definition of &quot;higher education&quot; and involvement of all segments of education in Master Plan development; (3) enabling legislation to permit community colleges and Area Vocational Technical Schools (AVTS) to come under the jurisdiction of the Board of Regents; and (4) consideration of two alternatives for  restructuring the governance of higher education. The first alternative would bring Washburn University and the community colleges under the jurisdiction of the Board of Regents with redefinition and merger of certain AVTS components into community colleges. The second alternative would interlock the two existing governing boards with new members forming a joint committee which would oversee community colleges and appoint an executive director for community colleges. A proposed implementation schedule is also included. (Contains 47 references.) (JB)",

        "description":"Approximately 20% or 400 teachers leave the public school system on Guam every year. This attrition rate has been attributed to a host of interrelated local issues. Frequently, many of these teachers are recruited from off-island for 2-year contracts. The Guam Public School System (GPSS) spent an average of nearly $2 million per year on recruitment alone yet teacher retention remains a dilemma. In 1991, the Twenty First Guam Legislature established the Guam Teacher Corps Scholarship (GTC) program to address teacher recruitment and retention. GTC expanded the Government's then existing 2-year Teacher Training Scholarship program and extended student participation to high school seniors on a limited basis. In the fall semester of 1992, 60 recruits at the University of Guam (UOG)  were selected for awards. By the end of 1993, over 250 recipients were actively participating in the program with a waiting list of 40 more eligible students. Demographic information revealed that students were generally older, had extensive work experience, and had families to support. Innovative recruitment and retention programs have been developed and appear to be working. The success of the program indicated that collaborative partnerships between government agencies and higher education institutions are the future hope for teacher recruitment and promoting careers in education.

        "description":"This study compared the responses of 4,068 alumni with different academic majors on a questionnaire of dimensions of growth and development (personal/social skills, quantitative skills, verbal skills, and cultural understanding skills) to determine if students with different academic majors responded differentially to these dimensions. The Alumni Satisfaction Survey was administered to graduates from the Universities of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Martin, and Knoxville. Analysis revealed considerable differences among alumni with different majors. Alumni who majored in such areas as as communication, education, human ecology, and nursing believed their education developed their personal/social skills; whereas alumni who majored in agriculture, business, engineering, science, and  nursing felt their majors facilitated growth and development in quantitative skills; agriculture and communication majors felt their educational experience developed their verbal skills; and alumni with architecture, communication, human ecology, humanities, or social science majors believed that their education contributed to their cultural understanding. Findings suggests that, although the curriculum, and possibly the ethos, of an academic department appears to reinforce certain dimensions of growth and development more than others, the context of the collegiate experience may have the strongest influence.

Study results revealed that although satisfaction with salary and working conditions was not significant in predicting commitment to the department it was significant in predicting commitment to the university. Full professors were found to be significantly more committed to the institution than lower ranked professors. Regression analysis revealed the importance and the power of faculty members' perceived influence on policy and  participation in meetings were powerful predictors of organizational commitment. This finding suggests that, to increase faculty members' commitment to both the department and the institution, it is important for campus leaders to strive for participatory policy decision making. Findings also suggest that faculty exhibit more commitment to the department than to the institution across all ranks, with full professors exhibiting the highest commitment scores.

        "description":"Running a university is fast becoming more challenging than managing a large corporation, in part due to greater quality demands by more groups in the face of shrinking resources and budget cuts. This paper argues against universities conducting business as usual in the face of societal change and increasingly greater challenges, and presents ideas on how a multi-campus public university can use Total Quality Management to meet quality goals. It is suggested that the President of the institution must first ask for volunteer faculty and staff to establish a quality think-tank on campus. This group's responsibilities would include: developing a vision statement, articulating a mission, developing procedures, training, providing a forum for groups to report their experience, and  being \"on call\" to answer questions. When using the many tools used for quality measurements (check sheets, control charts Pareto diagrams, etc.) care must be taken to consider the school's special needs and to ensure that the tools are not used inappropriately. Cost and benefit analyses for various projects are also important to control any serious long-term negative consequences for campus and student well-being. Employee empowerment in conducting continuous improvement contributes in making quality a discipline. (GLR)",

Among the findings are the following: (1) total R&D expenditures increased by almost 7 percent, from $17.6 billion in fiscal year (FY) 1991 to $18.9 billion in FY 1992, compared with a national inflation rate of 3 percent; (2) R&D expenditures sponsored by the Federal Government increased by over 8 percent, and R&D spending from non-Federal sources increased by 5  percent; (3) the greatest percentage gain by non-federal source of funds over FY 1991, nearly 8 percent, was in industry-sponsored R&D expenditures; (4) seven of the eight major science and engineering fields outpaced the 3-percent inflation rate; and (6) expenditures from current funds for academic research equipment totaled just over $1 billion in FY 1992.

        "description":"This paper examines Virginia's campus-based assessment process in the areas of curriculum improvement, academic management, accountability, and reporting. While there is considerable variation among institutions, assessment has demonstrated a moderate to substantial impact on most campuses in the area of curriculum improvement. There is evidence that the process has resulted in the redesign or modification of major programs and a recent trend toward combining assessment with program review. There is a concern, however, that the assessment process used at the management level to make negative decisions (e.g., program elimination) may jeopardize the objectivity with which faculty approach the task. The assessment process, it is argued, must not only address institutional  accountability in terms of efficiency but must also contain indicators that reveal improvements in the quality of the outcomes of that education. Only with this double approach can higher education institutions convince the general public of the value of their investment in higher education. Finally, a recommendation is made for changing the assessment process so that assessment reporting would first involve the submission of an assessment activity summary for review, followed by a presentation by appropriate institutional officers during which reactions to the assessment would be given, follow-up information requested, and advice given for program improvement.

        "description":"This summary report presents major findings of a study comparing repayment of student loans and the impact of educational debt on students' life decisions in 1985 and 1991. A survey was sent to a random sample of approximately 3,000 borrowers during repayment of their student loans in both 1985 and 1991. Useable surveys were received from 628 borrowers in 1985 and 551 in 1991. Small samples of defaulters were also contacted. Among findings were: 70 percent of 1991 respondents said loans were essential for their enrollment in college; average debt increased by 50 percent between 1985 and 1991; average annual loan repayment as a percentage of income increased from 5.4 percent to 6.3 percent for undergraduates and from 6 percent to 11.3 percent for those who borrowed as graduate  students. The report addresses the following issues: increases in loan debt, amount of annual payments, growth in income, trends in debt service as a percent of income, other loan programs reported by Stafford borrowers, borrower debt and demographics, degree to which debt affected borrowers, borrower debt and income by highest degree obtained, income and payments by debt levels, and loan program variables at the time of borrowing. Also included are a brief history of federal student loans, respondents' comments suggesting program changes, and sources of loan information. Summary tables provide additional detail. (DB)",

The following eight steps were undertaken: literature review, scanning and selecting of provider criteria, decision-making, participant assessment, a workshop, mentoring, evaluation, and intra-organizational LISTSERV. The provider deemed AT&amp;T EasyLink services most appropriate. The workshop, orientation materials, and mentoring process resulted in the initiation of a global network for EES using e-mail. Once a provider was determined, implementation among new users appeared possible with a single-event workshop, detailed orientation materials, and a mentoring arrangement.  E-mail had a significant impact upon an international educational consulting agency with the most definitive difference being financial. The recommendations included publishing the summary tables of possible network providers, informing the parent organization of the impact of e-mail networking, and using workshop/mentoring (both for EES and client institutions in Eurasia) to initiate other technological tools. Questionnaires and a compendium of electronic resources are appended. (Contains 86 references.) (TMK)",

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has supported interactive radio in Africa, Asia, and Latin American to provide supplementary training to students with poorly prepared teachers. An example was a language arts program in Kenya, where evaluators concluded that radio students were consistent in their statistically significant superiority over control students in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Despite these findings, other studies concluded that interactive radio is better for teaching math, which has a limited number of correct answers, than language. USAID also has funded interactive radio projects in  science, mathematics, teacher training, and high-school equivalency. Some critics of interactive radio say it is too dependent on expensive hardware and that Third World students are not well enough motivated, cannot read well enough, and cannot work well enough on their own for distance education to significantly affect educational progress in developing nations.

CNN Newsroom is a 15-minute commercial-free newscast aimed at students in public school classrooms. Supplementing the newscasts are daily curriculum guides (available electronically) that outline questions and concepts for teacher-directed activities in the classroom. The purpose of this study was three-fold: (1) to determine demographic and logistical factors influencing use; (2) to determine teacher practices characterizing use; and (3) to obtain user ratings of the CNN Newsroom by enrolled users. A 22-question survey instrument was designed and sent to all 621 educators in Georgia who had enrolled in the free CNN Newsroom program. The majority of  the users who responded: were from county school systems; work at the elementary level; teach a social studies curriculum; have 16-to-20 years experience; and hold a master's degree. Generally, the teachers spent five minutes or less introducing the segments and use the service occasionally rather than daily. The user questionnaire is included in the appendix.

        "description":"In response to the changes in curriculum as a result of educational reform and the introduction of information technologies into school library media centers, media specialists need to ensure that all students acquire the skills needed to manage information. This study sought to determine what assistance methods eighth-grade students would use to learn to search the online catalog and to determine whether a relationship existed between the gender of the student and the assistance method the student preferred. The five assistance methods offered to the target population were: printed instructions; lessons from the media specialist; assistance from the media staff; assistance from the teacher; and help from another student. A questionnaire surveyed student preference for assistance  methods used during a 5-day search period. The results showed that students used a variety of methods to perform searches but that assistance from another student and a demonstration from the media specialist were the methods preferred most; and females preferred extroverted methods while males preferred independent methods. These findings suggest that learners possess a variety of learning style preferences which the library media specialist should consider. The survey instrument and the online guide are included in the appendix. (Contains 18 references.) (Author/JLB)",

This research project is an attempt to update information on American Association Bible College libraries and give a face and some personality to these &quot;invisible&quot; libraries. The research was conducted by mailed questionnaire. Contact was made with 107 Accrediting Association of Bible Colleges (AABC) affiliated libraries, and 80 made viable responses, a response rate of almost 75%. Results indicated that most of these libraries had not yet automated any part of their operations; in some categories of automation, the negative response rate was above 90% with 70% of the  respondents still using the Dewey classification system. Another finding is that most full-time Bible college library staffs are very small; 47% report a staff of only one professional, with no assistance. It was also found that 62% of the workforce in the responding libraries were between the ages of 40 and 60, and nine of the respondents were close to retirement age.

As a result, teachers are using the public library more frequently, borrowing greater quantities of books and materials, and asking librarians to assume non-traditional roles such as that of curriculum planner and teacher. The purpose of this study was to examine how librarians view their changing roles, what lending procedures are in place to deal with greater demand for materials, and what materials and services are available to accommodate the whole language teacher. A questionnaire was mailed to 170 children's librarians employed in Ohio public libraries. The results of the study show that the role of the librarian is changing and that librarians welcome this change and view it as a positive one.  Librarians are willing to take their skills and move beyond the walls of their library, are becoming knowledgeable about whole language, and are creating services to meet the needs of the whole language teacher. Librarians are attempting to solve the problem of serving the patron fairly while allowing whole language teachers to borrow the quantity of materials they need for their students.

From its birth at a 1957 conference of 17 librarians, the association has grown to over 300 members. The association strives to promote, develop, and advance standards of library service in libraries of evangelical Christian institutions of higher learning. The association encourages Christian librarians' growth in spiritual, professional, and scholarly pursuits and provides opportunities for fellowship and service. Through the associations' journal, &quot;The Christian Librarian,&quot; issues of concern to those engaged in service to institutions of Christian higher education are addressed. The&quot;Christian Periodical Index,&quot; begun in 1959 and produced through volunteer member indexing, provides indexing access to numerous periodicals not covered by other indexes or abstracts. Various association members have contributed to missions through voluntary service to libraries both in the United States and abroad. The association published the &quot;Library Manual for Missionaries&quot; to assist untrained personnel who must provide library service. The Association of Christian Librarians has grown from a group of librarians seeking fellowship and professional interaction into an organization which not only seeks to better its own members but to contribute to the larger field of librarianship in Christian higher education.

The findings show many areas of similar resource use. Despite some similarities, differences in access and method remain. Historians remain more traditional, using mostly older print sources, while the political science scholars use more current up to date resources like CD-ROM and online databases. Overall, many of the findings strongly support what has been found in  previous studies.

        "description":"The Insurance Division of the Special Libraries Association began an index to insurance magazines, the &quot;Insurance Periodicals Index&quot; (IPI), in 1962. This study examines its historical development. The index was published monthly in an insurance trade journal and then cumulated into an annual edition. Part of the background for its development included the reduction in number of insurance periodicals which were indexed in H. W. Wilson Company publications. Only four insurance periodicals were indexed in the &quot;Business Periodicals Index&quot; during the late 1950s and 1960s. Choice of the vocabulary (subject headings) to be used in indexing was the major problem faced in developing the index, because insurance terminology was not standardized. The Insurance and Employee Benefits Division  joined with NILS Publishing Company in the early 1980s to produce an online, as well as printed, index. The early IPI is compared with the indexes produced since the 1983 development of an automated insurance periodicals database; both sets of indexes are evaluated on their content and physical properties. The IPI has from its beginnings been a bibliographic tool for those in the insurance community. It has provided a link between those who need information and one source of information, periodicals.

        "description":"This project is a historical study of the Duns Scotus Library in Sylvania, Ohio. The library serves Lourdes College, a four-year, co-ed liberal arts college run by the Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis on the grounds of their motherhouse. The library originally served the sisters of the convent and the postulants who studied there as high school students. As the educational needs of the sisters grew, the school progressed to the junior college level, and then to the baccalaureate level, eventually opening up to the general public. As the school developed, the library itself evolved to meet its changing requirements. This study traces the history and development of the institution, as its evolution parallels the expanding role of the Sisters of St. Francis throughout the twentieth  century. The interview schedule is appended. (Contains 22 references.) (Author)",

The biography examines events in her life which have led to her development as a critically and internationally acclaimed children's author, with special emphasis placed on her childhood, since so many of her works have been inspired by her memories of those early years. Biographical and autobiographical materials published through February 1993 have been used. The bibliography, which includes all of her materials published in the United States through December 1992 (33 titles), is annotated; prominent awards or honors and selective reviews are included. The literature review supports Cynthia Rylant as an author destined to become a classic children's author and well-deserving of in-depth  study. (Contains 16 references.) (Author)",

        "description":"This paper examines the portrayal of librarians in poetry written from 1958 to 1993 in order to find out whether technological and social changes which occurred during this period had any effect on the image of librarians. Content analysis was used in examining the 32 poems and the 36 librarians present in those poems. Adjectives and descriptions of the librarians were analyzed and evaluated to see whether the images were positive or negative and whether any change in the portrayal of librarians has come about through the years. Some of the major findings of the research are: the librarians in the poems are equally likely to be male or female; they are hard-working and enthusiastic about their work; and physical description is not a part of these poems. As a result, the typical  old-maid librarian with mousy hair done in a bun stereotype is not present in the poems used in this content analysis. The coding sheet used in the analysis is appended.

Results show that anthropologists' information requirements differ somewhat from those of other social scientists. Reference lists in journals and books are often used to locate information sources; journals are the most important information source. Most of the information needs of the majority of respondents are met by their university's library. Older scholars tend to use databases less than younger  ones do; online abstracts and indexes are more important to anthropologists than their print versions are. Some respondents express a great desire for a database which would include current references, abstracts, and articles in anthropology.

This analysis uncovers the recent trends in law library employment qualifications. A vast majority of law library employers expect the candidate to possess at least an MLS (Master of Library Science) degree; most university or law school employers will require, or strongly prefer, both an MLS and a JD (Juris Doctor). This is important since over half of the jobs advertised in the &quot;AALL Newsletter&quot; during the study period are  positions within university or law school libraries. Experience in a law library is highly preferred, particularly if the candidate possesses skills in computer-assisted legal research using databases with both legal (Westlaw and Lexis) and non-legal (Dialog) applications.

A patron survey was conducted during July 1993 in three branches of Cuyahoga County Public Library, located in northeastern Ohio. The sample was determined by the patrons who had used the reference services at the branch and chose to complete the survey. The survey included questions which measured the friendliness and the helpfulness of the reference librarian during the reference interview. The results substantiate the opinion that patrons rate library service highly when they are comfortable with librarian behaviors. Librarian friendliness and helpfulness seem to affect patron rating of library  services. Patrons rate service as average when comfort level with the librarian was low or if the librarian appeared to be indifferent to the query. The survey instrument is included in the appendix.

The study looked at a systematic sample of reader response forms taken from the young adult summer program. These forms asked for the reader's name, phone number, school and grade, and title and author of book. The participant was asked to circle which library branch was used, to choose one of nine categories for the book (love story, mystery/suspense, historical fiction, realistic fiction, science fiction, fantasy, nonfiction, humor, or horror/occult), and to rate the book as&quot;Great!!!&quot;&quot;O.K.&quot; or &quot;No Way!&quot; The major findings of the study were that more girls than boys participated; most girls preferred different categories than did boys; the favorite categories were realistic fiction and mystery/suspense; none of the seven favorite authors (i.e., R. L. Stine, Francine Pascal, Ann M.

Statistics include the age of the searcher, the experience with searching indexes, the experience with computers, recall and precision retrieval results, and user satisfaction with retrieval results. Problem areas considered in InfoTrac were variant headings assigned for one individual and one heading assigned to two different people. The  results of the study indicate higher user satisfaction with the electronic index even when recall and precision rates are lower than when using the print index. Overall results indicate users' precision scores are lower when multiple variant headings are used with no cross-references and that users are not aware of the inaccuracies of their searches.

Four libraries were opportunistically selected, and the director and children's librarian in each were interviewed. The emerging hypothesis was that some restriction would occur. The written policies and procedures of each library were examined to determine if they were practiced in reality. The study determined that there is a trend toward restriction of audiovisual material, especially video cassette tapes, to those under 18. Other less obvious restrictions on print material are also covered in this study. Through reading the literature on this topic, it was determined that these libraries are not unusual in their practice of  restricting video tapes to adults only.

The method of study included both catalog analysis and telephone interviews with faculty members. Data collected included the number and type of coursework hours needed for the attainment of the first professional degree; absence or presence of computer-related requirements for admission to and graduation from the programs; characterization of the place in the curriculum of the ITs; and the degree to which the ITs are taught by hands-on experience. Eight programs  offered exposure to at least one-half of the studied ITs through required courses, electives, or non-curricular activities. Instruction about or experience with electronic mail, local area networks, Internet/Bitnet use, PC operating systems, and database creation/handling was present in every studied program. Three programs included 14 or 15 ITs in their curricula; six included between 10 and 12. The interview schedule is included in the appendix. (Contains 21 references.) (Author/JLB)",

Since children's audiovisual materials are a popular part of library collections, the multicultural content of nonprint materials should also be analyzed. This study analyzed the lyrics of 405 songs on 23 sound recordings to determine their multicultural content. The recordings were selected from the influential lists of \"Notable Children's Recordings,\" released from 1975 to 1993 by the Recording Evaluation Committee of the Association for Library Service for Children (ALSC). In general, there was more multicultural content in the recordings published after 1983. African-Americans were the best represented minority group, but there  was also representation of Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Native Americans. People with disabilities and the Appalachian culture groups were well represented. Elderly people received the harshest treatment of any group represented in the songs; they were portrayed in a stereotypical manner, and were often seen as comical characters.

The study investigated five areas: (1) library staff; (2) library users; (3) other libraries; (4) parent organization; and (5) geographic location. The study aimed to be a census and required a high response rate. From 130 questionnaires mailed out, a response rate of 81% was obtained, and 39 occupational safety and health libraries in 18  states and the District of Columbia were identified in the survey. Thirty-three respondents agreed to have their libraries appear in a directory of occupational safety and health libraries.

The Americans with Disabilities Act codified what librarians have long espoused: equal access to information for people with any type of disabling condition. This study's objective was to identify and examine current or planned programs dealing with staff education about disabilities in the public library setting. An exploratory research design using survey methodology was executed; the data were collected through in-depth, unstructured interviews with library directors or their designees at seven public libraries in Stark County (Ohio). Analysis of data was conducted using the &quot;concept book&quot; technique of qualitative content analysis. Research data are presented in three formats: (1)  categorized, coded statements arranged in lists with full explanation of the coding; (2) a table of the number of unique statements by category and code; and (3) a data matrix prepared so that categories and coded themes for each library may be examined.

Details of the services offered to the public by these libraries were gathered through a questionnaire soliciting information about individual programs. The questionnaire was completed by 35 librarians in Ohio--in each case, the librarian most responsible for the day-to-day operation of the bookmobile. Data collected covers: stops and stop selection; staffing; collections; services and programming; and characteristics of the bookmobile, age and make; and budgets. Among major conclusions is the finding that bookmobile libraries in Ohio are decidedly lacking in their ability to offer patrons adequate reference service. Catalogs of the bookmobile's collection, as well as the collection of the host library,  are not available, and only a very small percentage of bookmobiles in Ohio are accessible to the handicapped.

A survey of a random sampling of member schools of the Association of American Law Schools was conducted on the issue of faculty status for academic law librarians in response to the ever-growing need and demand for recognition and equality. The results of the study imply that some action on the part of university/law school administrators and/or boards of trustees is necessary to close the gap between the wishes (and possibly the demands) of academic law librarians and actual personnel policies as they presently exist. The results also indicate that communication between academic law librarians and their administrators must be forthcoming if any real changes  can be made.

A review of the relevant literature is made in order to gain insight into the different ways in which the problem has been tackled across the country. Data on the situation in Ohio is collected through survey methodology using the heads of cataloging departments in major academic and public libraries as the population sample. The data are analyzed, and conclusions are drawn on the basis of the findings. The findings suggest that size of library has little to do with the presence of backlog and that backlog is created by factors other than volume of collection. There also appears to be no significant relationship between backlog and types of libraries, in that  backlog exists both in academic and public libraries. However, there is indication that the volume of backlog appears to be low in public libraries and high in academic libraries. Gifts to libraries contribute to the problem of backlog. Overall, the main cause of backlog has to do with the inadequate number of cataloging staff as well as sudden staff departures. The paper concludes with some general insights drawn from the study and some recommendations. The survey instrument and cover letter are appended. (Contains 18 references.) (Author/TMK)",

Of the 102 respondents, the largest categories were library directors/administrators and public services librarians, of whom 56% possess the MLS (Master of Library Science) degree with formal courses in health sciences librarianship. Even though they are employed in a scientific field, 42% have a humanities undergraduate background; about 50% have a pure science or applied science background. Among difficulties described are learning the nomenclature of the field and a lack of subject background knowledge. An overwhelming majority  (90%) indicate they acquired their specialized skills on the job. The most popular means of staff development is through personal coaching or training by other library personnel. Findings reveal that the Medical Library Association (MLA) and the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) continuing education courses are focused efforts in bettering health sciences librarianship in the United States.

The purpose of the survey was to identify cooperative activities which have taken place between Ohio's public libraries and schools and bring to light factors which have led to the success or failure of those cooperative ventures which have been attempted. The librarians' views of available resources, attempts at collaboration, and subsequent results of tested ideas have been assessed to provide a description of cooperative programs in Ohio communities. Certain correlations can be seen from the resulting data. The survey results support the theory that a library's available resources will have an effect upon the amount of cooperation that occurs with the  schools. Also substantiated is the premise that communication with school personnel corresponds directly with the success of cooperative ventures. The cover letter and survey are appended. (Author/TMK)",

A 10% systematic sample was taken of the circulating nonfiction adult shelf list of the Franklin Public Library (FPL) in Franklin, Ohio. Biographies were excluded. The objectives of the research are to determine if the FPL circulating adult nonfiction book collection is current and to determine the relationship that exists between currency and usage of the collection. Data revealed that FPL past collection development of nonfiction materials has succeeded in meeting the currency guidelines proposed in the &quot;Standards for Public Library Service in  Ohio.&quot; The relationship between currency and usage was analyzed graphically by comparing average circulation during a 5-year time period to the age of the titles collapsed into 5-year time intervals. Data analysis revealed that titles less than 15 years old in the science and social science subject areas showed increased usage over titles greater than 15 years old. Humanities titles showed a more even distribution of usage across all time intervals. (Contains 18 references.) (Author/TMK)",

In order to assess potential library costs for using the vendor services, a mix of 40 midsize libraries comparable in their size of collection, number of cataloging staff members, and annual cataloging output, were randomly selected to participate in the study. Information gathered was then analyzed in order to calculate the annual total cost and the average cost of  cataloging per work hour. The methodology employed in this study can be utilized as a model for libraries to assess the cost of cataloging output and serve as a guide for the allocation of resources.

Approaches in the alternative paradigm include Sense-Making, Value-Added, and Anomalous States of Knowledge. From an analysis of these approaches and related research, a conceptual model has been developed. The model focuses on several elements that should guide the design and implementation of information systems: (1) the information system should be user-oriented (oriented toward the individual or group with the information need); (2) information needs should be determined as they relate to users in particular situations or contexts; and (3) in information systems mediated by intermediaries, the success of the user-intermediary interaction is of prime importance in  determining information need. The model also focuses toward the development of a theory of relevance that considers qualitative and contextual judgements. (Contains 51 references.) (Author/JLB)",

The field of library science has recently begun to study this activity among the members of its profession. More research is needed to determine the extent of influence this area of career development has had on the careers of librarians. This study was undertaken to gain the mentoring histories of a representative sample of 100 Ohio public library directors to determine if their gender had any relationship to the gender of their mentor(s). Seventy-six members of the sample responded to a questionnaire, and the data from these responses showed Ohio public library directors to be similar to other professionals in one study but different from those in another study. Women directors  were found to give more mentoring to other women, but men were found to be more likely mentored in this study compared to women in another library science study.

The assumption underlying this research is that before one can address the effectiveness of reference paraprofessionals, it is necessary to understand the extent to which they are used; the tasks they perform; and the conditions associated with their use. The purpose of this research is to describe the extent to which paraprofessionals are found working at the reference desk. The second emphasis will be to explain why some libraries use reference paraprofessionals more than others by examining library size, hours of operation, workload, and nature of training. The results showed widespread use of reference paraprofessionals: they work in 85% of the libraries surveyed  and provide half of the reference service in 58% of the libraries. Their tasks range from basic (directional and instructional) to complex (supervision and collection development). Analysis indicated reliance on paraprofessionals was greatest in small and medium-sized libraries. Included in the appendix is the public library reference survey. (Contains 34 references.) (JLB)",

        "description":"This paper examines attitudes toward and practices concerning preparation and storage of archival copies of dissertations at the 15 Ohio doctoral granting institutions. The purpose of this study is two-fold: to determine the extent to which archivists and graduate school deans are aware of the preservation standards regarding theses and dissertations as well as the attitudes of archivists concerning responsibility for the care and storage of these documents; and to ascertain the actual physical condition of theses and dissertations. To accomplish this, two surveys were sent to these institutions: one to graduate colleges presumed responsible for drafting standards for production of dissertations to ascertain those standards; the other to archivists to determine the level of care  dissertations receive while in their custody, knowledge of national standards, and attitudes concerning responsibility for storage. To determine whether concern over deterioration of dissertations is warranted, a condition survey of Kent State University's dissertations was conducted. Included in the appendices are: a list of archivists and graduate school deans surveyed; the archivists survey; the deans survey; and the book condition survey. (Contains 29 references.)

A survey conducted on a random sample of college and university students working at Cedar Point Amusement Park in Sandusky, Ohio, during the summer of 1990 was designed to determine the type and amount of library instruction each student has received and if he or she found or would find it beneficial. The significance of a student's field of study and the size of the library used were considered in relationship to his or her attitude. To supplement the survey, interviews were conducted to gather more detailed information about what students know about certain library resources and what skills they possess. The findings of this survey may assist librarians who are  responsible for planning bibliographic instruction programs in demonstrating the practicality of the material and perhaps stimulating interest in the topic. Included in the appendices are the questionnaire; the interview schedule; and a tally sheet showing number of respondents for each item. (Contains 10 references.) (JLB)",

        "author":["Barb, Patricia Ann"],
        "description":"This exploratory survey analyzes the toddler story time program at the Westerville Public Library (Ohio) for a 9-month period. One hundred thirty-five children between the ages of 24 and 36 months participated in the program with a parent or care giver. Each program was limited to 15 children with their parents and consisted of a 20-30 minute program one day each week for a total of 5 weeks. Parents pre-registered their child by either calling or visiting the library. Children currently enrolled in one session were asked to wait an additional three days from the opening date of registration before re-enrolling to give more children an opportunity to participate. Because this was a new program for the library, and due to the lack of existing data in print from other public  libraries, numerous variables were experimented with, such as seating arrangement, repetition of stories, use of nursery rhymes, use of routine, and use of puppets. The pros and cons of each session were evaluated through a questionnaire which each parent was asked to complete on the fifth week of each session. Additionally, the storyteller evaluated those aspects which succeeded and failed during each session. A toddler program offers many benefits to the child and his parent, the storyteller, and the library. Fear of the unknown, however, makes this a difficult project to initiate. More research and documentation will allow public librarians to benefit from the experiences of others, and will in turn benefit the children being served. Included in the appendices are a list of toddler  characteristics and books; suggested new titles for toddlers; a sample publicity flyer; a letter to parents; sample programs; and the evaluation questionnaire.

In order to study the effectiveness of the system from the Chinese language users' point of view, a field test was conducted to collect information. Each subject was given five unique citations in Chinese scripts and asked to conduct a search in both the roman mode and CJK mode with three types of search keys: title; author or corporate author; and author and title. Their search processes and results were recorded on a search sheet. Information collected by this field test was used to evaluate the OCLC CJK Chinese part from the following aspects:  whether or not the designed input methods, character subsets, and homophone qualifiers enable the various Chinese language users to have access to the OCLC Online Chinese Catalog; whether or not searches on CJK mode could be as successful as those on roman mode; and what the sample users' general perception of the OCLC CJK system are.

Data were gathered by using a survey which was distributed to approximately 240 11th grade students at a suburban Cleveland (Ohio) public high school. The current study supports results of earlier studies that have shown that females spend more time reading than males; that certain types of books are typically more or less appealing to members of one sex or the other; and that males prefer reading books with male protagonists. The research indicates that females also prefer male protagonists and identified  with them more often than with female characters. In contrast to previous studies, this research shows that males identified with characters more frequently than females. Included in the appendices are the questionnaire used in the study; the categories of books that the respondents like to read; the three top-ranked choices of categories; newspaper sections in order of those most read; and choices of magazines by type.

Through the use of a questionnaire sent to all of the state library agencies in the United States, data was collected by structured and open-ended questions. The results of this study show that the use of LSCA funds for latchkey programs is still a fairly new and untapped source. Only 6 of the 39 state libraries that responded had received and approved LSCA grants for latchkey programming. A majority of the states are aware that there are problems in the public libraries because of latchkey children, but these libraries have not gone to their state libraries for help. Brief program descriptions of  latchkey programs are included by state. The questionnaire administered in the study is found in the appendix. (Author/JLB)",

This paper provides a review of the findings, recommendations, and limitations of the Ford Foundation report. Following an overview of the study conclusions, the paper offers a critique of findings in six sections. The first section discusses the study's evaluation of the proportion of high school graduates continuing their education, suggesting that the conclusions of the study did not provide adequate explanation of the data.  The second section focuses on the relationship between freshman enrollment at four-year campuses and BA attainment, arguing that the data from the five sample states simply do not support the study's suggestion that a higher proportion of first-time students at baccalaureate campuses leads to a higher proportion obtaining degrees. Section 3, dealing with ethnic enrollment and attainment, highlights the study's inability to draw a conclusion based on the data gathered. Section 4 suggests that the transfer rate formula used was deceptively low and that the study's conclusions were unsubstantiated by any data. Section 5 discusses the effect of the College-Level Academic Skills Tests on BA attainment rates. The final section describes discrepancies arising from the study's investigation of  the relationship between funding capacity and bachelor degree attainment. (MAB)",

The students had entered English 101 classes by way of ESL 110, the highest level composition class for non-native students. The purpose of the study was to determine whether these students were more or less successful in English 101 than their native English-speaking counterparts, to compare the success rates of the Asian and Hispanic groups, to assess the predictive validity of ESL grades for English 101 success, to determine whether the non-natives failing English 101 were as likely to fail other classes requiring moderate to heavy  writing, and to examine whether additional hours of ESL preparation would significantly improve student performance in English 101. Asian students represented 16% of the English 101 enrollments for the period under investigation, while Hispanic students represented 20%. Study findings included the following: (1) the no-pass rate was 20% for native students, 15% for Asian students, and 23% for Hispanic students; (2) grades in ESL 110 were not reliable predictors of success in English 101, with A and B students failing at almost the same rate as C and Credit students; (3) a majority of the students who failed to complete English 101 did succeed in other departments such as history, political science, sociology, and philosophy; and (4) of seven current and recent ESL 110 instructors, all  felt that current ESL offerings did not provide adequate preparation for English 101.

        "description":"Two computer programs were developed to enhance community college students' critical thinking skills in the areas of \"Comparison and Contrast\" and \"Analysis.\" Instructors have several options in using the programs. With access to an LCD panel and an overhead projector, instructors can use the programs in the classroom, manipulating the computer themselves to either deliver a lecture or generate a class discussion. Instructors can proceed through the program in the sequence as designed, or skip around in the hypertext program based on the students' level of prerequisite skills. Another option is to use the program in a lab situation where students can work together or each individual student can progress at his/her own pace. Working alone, the student may quiz him/herself often,  do as many of the exercises as he/she would like, and progress through the program linearly or jump around to areas of interest. The \"Compare and Contrast\" program analyzes \"Lee and Grant,\" by Bruce Catton, while the \"Analysis\" program analyzes \"How We Listen,\" by Aaron Copland. Either may be read in its entirety on the first \"card\" or read a few paragraphs at a time for better comprehension.

        "description":"A project undertaken to observe an instructor in three college courses in three consecutive quarters provided an opportunity to examine the teaching process in a holistic way, seek students' views in the classroom, and describe a collaborative approach to teaching assessment and development. Factors taken into account in the holistic model of teacher evaluation used in the project included individual differences among students, instructor style, instructor-student interaction, environmental factors, and organizational factors. To investigate student differences, surveys were distributed to students on the first day of classes each quarter, soliciting information on their educational backgrounds, goals, motivations, expectations, characteristics, world views, personality  characteristics, and styles of creativity. The instructor also completed personality and world view inventories to gather information on instructor style and was observed and videotaped to examine in-class dynamics, exchanges, feedback to students, and the social-psychological climate. In addition, students were surveyed about the course and interviewed to determine their perspective of teaching and learning in the course. These students showed that they were very perceptive about the instructor's goals, had constructive suggestions for improvement, and enjoyed being asked about their ideas. The holistic approach proved a benefit to the instructor, the students, and the researcher, who all gained insight into the collaborative teaching-learning process. The survey instruments are  appended. (BCY)",

MTTS's three-phase curriculum has evolved to include the changing training needs of IBM's employees, while at the same time overlapping with DCC's Computer Integrated Manufacturing Program. Employees who complete all three phases acquire 75% of the credits required for an associate degree. The key to successful college-business partnerships is a willingness to resolve conflicts based on the realization that each organization possesses a distinct culture that shapes the assumptions and expectations of individual  members. Colleges planning to offer re-education programs with business/industry should recognize that programs carrying academic credit bring more of a college's culture to a partnership than do non-credit programs; be aware that the buyer/vendor relationship with which business is accustomed will not produce successful programs; ascertain the most important aspects of the industry's culture and management style; and develop a pool of faculty who are flexible with regard to extended class hours and off-site locations and willing to accommodate changes in course content. A list of references, enrollment statistics, curricula descriptions, tutoring guidelines, selected final grade patterns, and a chart of mediation strategies are included. (MAB)",

These changes are especially affecting bank tellers, who will need new skills to adapt to the changing workplace. To develop a timely and relevant training program that could be offered on a national basis, a partnership was formed between the Institute of Canadian Bankers; Humber College (HC), in Ontario; Douglas College (DC), in Vancouver (British Columbia); and College Bois-de-Boulogne (CBB), in Montreal (Quebec). The first phase of the project involved an extensive needs assessment to determine the skills and attributes that would be required by the banking industry. The related attributes  were then pulled together into nine course modules, and course materials were developed. The program was implemented at HC in September 1992, enrolling two sections amounting to 60 students. The nine courses are structured into a two-year business program, which includes general education and English courses. At DC, the program also began in September 1992, and 10 of the 11 courses required were business courses. Also, many of the courses in the DC program are transfer courses which may be applied to a four-year degree. Finally, the financial services program at CBB was modified to reflect differences in Quebec's educational system. The program was blended with the three-year technical &quot;stream&quot; that students can choose after completing Grade 10 in the province. (BCY)",

To develop a resource manual that would provide guidelines for the development of study guides at NMTC, a study was conducted to determine the elements that should be included in a faculty resource guide. A review of the literature was undertaken and responses to the study proposal by NMTC department chairs and the Academic Vice-President were collected. In addition, all 50 faculty at NMTC were surveyed regarding their current practices in preparing course guides and sample guides were collected from 20 other professionals at other institutions. Based on these activities, a draft resource manual  was developed and submitted for review to the campus leadership. The resulting manual was based on the following conclusions: (1) study guides serve the two main functions of direction setting and assisting in study material processing; (2) manuals should provide guidelines for both course syllabi and study guide preparation; (3) the materials and techniques used should meet the unique learning needs of the student audience; and (4) NMTC should establish standards for syllabus and guide preparation. It was also recommended that NMTC faculty be provided with the manual and that inservice training be provided. Letters of support, the faculty survey instrument, and the faculty resource manual are appended. (Author/BCY)",

The institutional research component is managed by the Retention Information System (RIS), which collects demographic, withdrawal, performance, and tracking data from the mainframe student information system. Intervention strategies focus on academic and social orientation of new and existing students, assessment of students early in the first semester, peer tutoring and support groups, learning strategy seminars, and the creation of offices of Special Needs and Student Success. Intervention strategies are evaluated by comparing retention rates in programs  by semester and comparing retention outcomes for programs with strategies and those without. The SSP is unique in that it has developed from grass-roots efforts in the college and was not mandated by senior administration. It arose from a pilot project to analyze outcomes in high attrition areas in the fall of 1987, and the subsequent formation of a consultative team for student success. Currently, it operates out of the Office of Student Success, which maintains a full-time coordinator, part-time statistician, and part-time research assistant. Over the past 3 years, the SSP has raised awareness of student success issues at the college, continued to develop the RIS, and significantly reduced attrition in at least six program areas. (BCY)",

Study findings, based on 2,375 completed questionnaires, included the following: (1) 24.1% of the students first entered CPCC from high school graduation and 29.6% from the workforce; (2) the two most important factors given by respondents for choosing CPCC were low tuition and desired academic program; (3) respondents showed the highest level of satisfaction with library facilities  and services and the quality of full-time faculty; (4) industrial arts/shop facilities received the lowest ratings, although about 40% considered these facilities to be good or excellent; (5) registration and the bookstore were the most used services by respondents, and were ranked two and three in satisfaction of service; (6) while the attractiveness of the campus and overall image received the highest ratings of campus amenity factors, over 70% of respondents thought that parking facilities/availability and eating facilities were average or poor; and (7) an analysis of factors influencing student satisfaction indicated that the specific areas of admissions, classroom facilities, instructor availability, and the helpfulness of CPCC staff were directly and significantly related to ratings  of overall quality. The survey instrument and a summary of student comments are appended. (BCY)",

        "description":"A study was conducted at Mercer County Community College (MCCC), in New Jersey, to compare the perceptions of full-time faculty and administrators of the impact of selected societal factors on the college and provide MCCC with a theoretical basis for implementing its strategic planning model. A survey inventory of 34 societal factors was constructed, including such issues as funding in higher education, declining enrollments, technological change, and business needs, and distributed to 47 administrators and 90 full-time faculty at MCCC. The inventory asked respondents to rank each issue from not important to most important and to provide information on their gender, number of years at MCCC, and current rank or title. Study findings and recommendations included the following: (1)  the total absolute percentage (TAP) difference between faculty and administrator perceptions exceeded 33.3% on 27 items using a 5-choice scale and on 31 items using a 3-choice scale; (2) the TAP difference between responses by males and females exceeded 33.3% for 10 items on both the 5-choice and the 3-choice scales, indicating that gender was more influential than employee category in perceptions; and (3) based on the analysis it was recommended that college-wide projects begin with surveys of affected employees, that equal gender representation be sought in project committees, and that outside input be sought in any project process.

        "description":"In response to a statewide call for a review of general education in Virginia community colleges, the Student Assessment Committee (SAC) was formed at John Tyler Community College (Virginia) to evaluate student outcomes for the college's general education component. After concluding that standardized tests did not provide an adequate measure, the SAC decided to focus on the evaluation of students' critical thinking skills as a measure of college success. A flow chart for interviewing students to determine their critical thinking capabilities was developed based on the following elements of critical thought: (1) identifying the problem; (2) stating the problem; (3) interpreting facts which must be known to solve the problem; (4) posing a possible answer; (5) developing an  applicable solution from the answer; and (6) applying the solution to similar problems. Interviews were conducted with 47 of 100 associate degree candidates for graduation in 1993 which identified students by program and noted differences in critical thinking levels. The flow chart strengths include the tangible character of the model, which allows interviewers to physically see relationships of thought, while weaknesses include the possibility that the structure may be difficult to change if evidence suggests it is no longer appropriate. The SAC plans to further clarify the model and expand interviewing in the future. Flow charts and SAC members are included. (BCY)",

        "description":"The emergence of vocational curricula each with specific proficiencies has led to a new concept of the major dominated by technical rather than liberal learning. Although this has occurred at both two- and four-year institutions, applied curricula tend to disadvantage two-year students more than than their four-year counterparts because of less attention devoted to general as compared to technical education. Open-door institutions like community colleges can rethink general education in specialized curricula in the following three ways: (1) improving distribution requirements to include more general education in career tracks while still complying with accreditation standards; (2) developing interdisciplinary courses to include communication and thinking skills in  occupational-technical courses; and (3) extending general education values into applied coursework via writing-across-the-curriculum or including group work, class discussions, essay exams, out-of-classroom projects, and other active learning strategies in technical courses such as accounting or business. Community colleges can encourage a deeper engagement with the liberal arts and encourage greater attention to academic skills such as writing and problem-solving by requiring evidence of their orderly and incremental study in their career and professional programs.

One such partnership has been formed with Universal Instruments (UI), a manufacturer of automation equipment for electronics assembly and testing. The partnership has adapted the concepts of Tech Prep education to establish a non-credit certificate program in applied technology at UI. The six-course program is targeted at UI employees without college degrees working in technical positions and offers instruction in math, principles of technology, communication, and problem-solving. A total of 36 students were placed  in the initial certificate program, the graduates of which are eligible to enter one of several Associate in Technology degree programs at BCC which are designed to maintain a competent and skilled workforce. The certificate program uses video tapes, hands-on and laboratory experiences, and applied academics, rather than traditional lecture methods, and results have been encouraging. Employee feedback has been extremely positive and UI officials have indicated that updated employee skills have been a tremendous asset to the company. (BCY)",

        "description":"Changes in the way contemporary organizations conduct business demand a concurrent redesign of teaching and testing methods. Maintaining instructional quality must begin with knowledge of the quality revolution in contemporary organizations in order to meet the demands of these organizations for self-confident, self-directed, self-motivated, team-oriented, quality-sensitive, and customer-directed employees. Teachers must assure the complementary development of student interest, appreciation, pride of workmanship, and skills in learning, constant improvement, leadership, and collaboration. In a quality classroom, the teacher and students share responsibility for learning course content and for developing thinking, judgment, and interpersonal communication. Quality teachers  envision and manage their classrooms as exemplary organizations, and minimize student fear and competitiveness. At Santa Fe Community College, in New Mexico, instructors have been teaching and testing students with an emphasis on principles of collaboration and continuous quality improvement (CQI). The CQI approach to objective testing begins with a class discussion of the demand for collaborative work in contemporary organizations, explains the linkages between collaborative learning and future employment opportunities, and evaluates students both on their individual and collaborative knowledge. After tests are taken by both individuals and teams, the instructor notes the most frequently misunderstood questions to identify the &quot;significant few&quot; learning points that need continued  instruction. Data collected in a recent Business and Management course indicate that this quality testing approach delivers measurable improvement in student learning as defined by continuous improvement on unit tests. Student responses further substantiate the merit of quality teaching and learning processes. (AC)",

        "description":"To address a decrease in the number of local high school graduates enrolling in Capital Community-Technical College (CCTC) in Connecticut, a project was undertaken to develop a story board for a video to inform prospective students of the benefits of a college education at CCTC. A literature review was performed to find information about the production of educational media materials, the use of media in promotion and marketing, the needs of college recruitment programs, and the subject of related video. Internal input was received from CCTC admissions and recruitment officers, financial aid personnel, and the student work coordinator, while external input was obtained from the director of educational television for the community-technical college system in Connecticut and a video  production company. In addition, volunteer students were given the opportunity to prepare video materials which could be adapted to the story board for other students. As appropriate items of information were located, sketches were made indicating how they might be presented visually and then placed in order and replaced by finished drawings. The information was then assembled into a story board for planning a video. Conclusions from the project included that, given the ease of created animated sequences, these were more effective than presenting information through acting, and that student video work provided an added appeal for the target audience.

        "description":"Discussions about whether to implement associate degrees in British Columbia (Canada) date back to the mid-1970's, with the debate focusing on transfer arrangements and the viability of community college diplomas. One of the first acts of the British Columbia Council on Admissions and Transfer, created in 1988, was the recommendation to create an associate degree. As a first step, the Council sponsored a provincial workshop on the purpose, benefits, and problems of establishing an associate degree. Subsequently, the Council created a Provincial Task Force to recommend a two-year curriculum leading to an associate &quot;credential,&quot; thereby side-stepping the most controversial part of the Council's original proposal--the term &quot;degree.&quot; In evaluating various approaches, the Task Force  agreed on three general criteria: academic standards, simplicity, and transfer, with transfer being the most difficult to achieve. General degree requirements were established as 60 semester credits of first- and second-year courses, a minimum of &quot;C&quot; required in each course counting toward the degree, and 30 semester credits completed at the degree-granting institution. Specific requirements were also developed for associate in arts and associate in science degrees. The recommendations were circulated across the province and gained support from the Council and the government. In July 1992, the legislation was passed that currently enables the colleges to offer associate degrees. The availability of the degrees has implications for promotion, college planning, university entrance  requirements, grade point average requirements, and the number of degree-granting institutions. Future considerations include the need to create associate degrees for university programs, the possibility of creating an associate of general studies degree, and the desirability of extending the degree concept to career programs.

        "description":"As part of an effort to meet the specific educational needs of local business and industry, a cooperative educational renewal program was developed between Carroll Technical Institute (CTI) in Carrollton, Georgia, and the Southwire Company, a local producer of aluminum and copper materials. A thorough training needs assessment was conducted and, due to the classified nature of Southwire's manufacturing processes, CTI's involvement was limited to areas from basic literacy skills through front-line supervision. Critical job tasks were identified and analyzed to determine how competent workers use literacy skill applications in their jobs and a group of diagnostic tests were administered. The results indicated a serious deficiency in basic academic skills. As a solution the research  program included three district components: workplace literacy, secretarial training, and an Applied Manufacturing Technology (AMT) diploma program in supervision. The workplace literacy component, taught on the CTI campus, was designed to raise the literacy level of Southwire employees to improve their job performance and has served 254 employees since 1987. The secretarial certification program was designed to increase the skill levels of Southwire secretaries who could not demonstrate an acceptable level of competence on the exemption test. It has resulted in reports of improved productivity, reduced absenteeism, and higher morale within secretarial staff. The AMT program consists of a core of general academic courses, selected fundamental technical courses, and academic credit for  related work experience. (MAB)",

        "description":"In 1991, staff at the Business Resource Center (BRC) at Tacoma Community College, in Washington, began to reevaluate their approach to serving students. Up to that point, the BRC had been teacher centered, with staff operating under the assumptions that only the students who succeeded were actually \"college material,\" that students would cheat if not monitored, that they would attend only if forced, and that self-paced students could not meet deadlines. The BRC sought to shift from teacher centered to student centered learning and envisioned an environment where students felt valued and respected, were motivated to be actively involved with their own learning, could learn from each other, and discover their unique learning style. The change in attitudes was reflected in the  center's procedures. Students were encouraged to learn by creating their own tests and correcting their own work. A sense of community was established at the BRC with warm welcomes, shared lunches, and a relaxed work environment. Team testing was implemented to promote tutoring and group support. Finally, the center began to inform students of course objectives, guidelines, resources, standards, and consequences of their actions to help students take responsibility for their learning. Since the changes, the program completion rate has been around 72%, and the BRC continues to set new goals. Ten worksheets for establishing a student centered learning environment are attached.

        "author":["Prager, Carolyn"],
        "description":"Tech prep was created to serve high school students in the two middle quartiles who neither prepare for further study nor gain adequate technical workplace skills by blending liberal and practical arts into a 2+2 secondary-postsecondary articulated curriculum leading to an associate degree. Tech prep is a cornerstone of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technology Act Amendments of 1990, the first major federal initiative promoting comprehensive, sustained links between secondary and two-year college sectors. In addition, the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges (AACJC) has offered Tech Prep/Associate Degree (TPAD) Program Partnership Awards since 1990 to community colleges for the development of articulated curricula involving the colleges, local secondary  schools, and employers. The optimal high school tech prep academic portion of the curriculum contains two years of principles of technology and/or another applied science, two years of applied math, and a course in applied communication. Although tracking the program's success has been difficult due to the recency of its creation, TPAD seems to be a win-win alternative to the college prep/baccalaureate degree course of study because it improves student academic performance, high school graduation rates, and college attendance at the associate degree level. As an unanticipated outgrowth of TPAD, some 2+2 tracks have evolved beyond the associate degree into articulated 2+2+2 programs culminating in a baccalaureate degree. (MAB)",

        "description":"In an attempt to provide a more useful and economical alternative to the traditional college catalog, St Louis Community College at Florissant Valley (SCC), in Missouri, has developed a hyptertext program. The hypertext format links pools of information that can be accessed at the rate and depth of detail that the end user desires. The hypertext catalog is organized into several levels. The first level is the introduction and main menu, which provide degree and certificate menus, a calendar, and academic policies. The second level of information provides more specific information, including lists of Associate in Arts programs alphabetically, academic events by semester, and admissions procedures. The next level provides a link between course listings and course descriptions, and  a subsequent link leads to listings of course prerequisites. Finally, there is a glossary and help function, which provide definitions of college terms and detailed explanations of the keyboard command structure. Users may use the program's print command to print a paper copy of some portions of the catalog, such as the curriculum for a class or an application form. Responses by high school guidance counselors and library users to the catalog have been very positive and SCC has seen considerable savings over the printed version. (MAB)",

        "description":"To address an unacceptable failure and withdrawal rate in an introductory psychology course at Ulster County Community College (UCCC), in New York, a project was undertaken to develop a Learning Assistance in Psychology course to help students with skills and concepts. First, a literature review indicating the need for remediation highlighted the necessity of institutional commitment to a successful program, and described characteristics of successful remediation programs. Next, a pilot assistance course was developed and reviewed by the UCCC Skills Center staff and Psychology Department. The resulting one semester-hour course focused on general study skills, specialized vocabulary, style of quizzes and exams, analysis of learning style, and appropriate note-taking techniques,  and was offered to eight students in Fall 1993. Five of the eight students achieved a grade of &quot;A&quot; or &quot;A minus,&quot; while three withdrew. Informal discussions held with the completing students indicated that more than half believed that participation in the course assisted their understanding of concepts and success. Recommendations from the course validation process included the following: (1) the course should be further analyzed cooperatively among the Skills Center, Psychology Department, and student personnel services; (2) the course should continue to be offered and promoted; and (3) the questionnaire for course participants should be further analyzed and developed. Appendices include the course proposal, a course description and outline, a taxonomy of basic skills, related  correspondence, suggested class topics, and the student questionnaire.

        "description":"A study was undertaken at Mercer County Community College (MCCC) in New Jersey to establish a human resources development (HRD) utility role for the college's Office of Institutional Research (OIR). The study involved a search of current literature; a survey of OIRs at 14 New Jersey community colleges; interviews with 24 senior faculty members; and planning meetings with the president and deans at MCCC. Study findings included the following: (1) most of the community college OIRs provided a range of services to full-time faculty (e.g., student profiles, program evaluations, and test score analyses); however, only 5% to 10% of the faculty actually took advantage of these services, and services to faculty amounted to only 2% to 7% of the OIRs' annual activities; (2) faculty members  informed of OIR resources felt that these resources could help them in self-development and improve their teaching and their management of the learning environment; (3) a practitioner-based research program would address the needs of faculty as expressed by both faculty members and administrators; and (4) senior MCCC administrators favored the idea of establishing an HRD-utility role for the OIR and were willing to support its implementation. The research produced five guiding principles which were used to develop an HRD-utility role for MCCC's OIR. Initial programs and services have been well received by full-time faculty. These principles can be used as a blueprint for other colleges to establish cost-effective HRD programs. (Contains 40 references, 2 survey instruments, and a 3-year  implementation plan.) (KP)",

        "description":"In June 1992, the New York State Office of the Comptroller performed an audit of Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) and Supplemental Tuition Assistance Program (STAP) awards at Bryant and Stratton Business Institute's Buffalo Campus (BC). TAP, the largest student grant and scholarship program administered by the Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC), is designed to provide tuition aid to full-time students enrolled in approved programs. STAP is a special program providing up to one additional year of aid for educationally disadvantaged undergraduate students. As a result of the audit, 63 awards totaling $53,993 were disallowed in the following three main categories: (1) students not in pursuit of a program, accounting for 49 disallowed awards totaling $41,267; (2) students  not enrolled full-time, accounting for 13 awards and $11,776; and (3) one student who was not matriculated but had received $950. Additionally, 11 students were found to have graduated without successfully completing all program requirements, 15 TAP awards were paid on behalf of 13 students who should have been certified for STAP, and BC had not reported that one student had been granted a waiver to regain TAP funding after losing good academic standing. The auditors recommended that the HESC recover $53,993 plus applicable interest from BC for its incorrect TAP and STAP certifications, review BC certification procedures, and ensure that BC reports all waivers when granted. Additionally, it was recommended that the State Education Department ensure that BC is graduating students who have  met all program requirements. (MAB)",

        "description":"One of the more pervasive fiscal trends of the past three decades is the use of state-sponsored lotteries to raise revenue, often earmarked for such publicly supported institutions as public colleges. Evidence exists, however, that lottery revenues, which are unstable in nature, tend to supplant stable general revenue funds. Moreover, lottery ticket purchases can suppress other state tax sources, thus causing a further redistribution of a state's general fund expenditures. To examine the fiscal results over time of earmarking lottery funds to a public community college system, a study of changes in available resources and actual expenditures was conducted in the Florida Community College System (FCCS) since the inception of the state's Education Lotteries in 1987. Study findings,  based on a review of revenue and expenditure trends for 23 fiscal years, included the following: (1) the implementation of lottery funding was associated with a decrease in community college expenditures, and with a decline in general revenue allocations to the FCCS; (2) there was no statistically significant evidence that lottery funds supplanted general revenue funds in Florida, since allocations represented a small percentage of total allocations; (3) the FCCS was shown, however, to be increasingly dependent on non-state sources of revenue since the inception of the lottery; and (4) when lottery funds were distributed without categorical restrictions on their use, the overall level of state support was found to be lower than when funds were allocated with categorical restrictions.

        "description":"In the past 5 years, the Mathematics Department at Saint Louis Community College (SLCC) in Meramec, Missouri, has made major curricular modifications and changed the role of faculty members in helping students succeed. These changes have been made in an effort to bring the curriculum in line with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' 1986 standards for K-12 education; to implement the proposals of the Calculus Reform Movement; and to accommodate students with poor math preparation. Changes that have taken place within many mathematics departments throughout the country include the following: (1) mathematics departments are more accepting of the use of technology and computer-managed instruction, offering underprepared students an alternative to traditional classroom  situations; (2) faculty are working with increasing numbers of disabled students to identify the academic adjustments that will help them succeed; (3) faculty are facing the attitudinal effects of grade inflation; (4) faculty teach study skills during the course of the semester, and many feel the loss of prestige associated with teaching developmental classes; (5) faculty are involved in making referrals to college writing centers, study skills labs, and tutoring centers on campus; (6) mathematics departments are more accepting of the use of calculators and computers in mathematics courses; and (7) department chairs are more involved in facilitating classroom instruction. Among the change-related issues still to be resolved are the difficulty of involving aging faculty in staff  development activities that will help them adjust to changing students and instructional technologies; the need to involve part-time faculty in departmental meetings and professional development activities and to provide them with needed support systems; and the difficulties associated with developing assessment instruments, policies, and procedures.

        "description":"The implementation of Total Quality Management (TQM) in an organization implies a fundamental change in the way that organization functions. Therefore an examination of the adoption of the TQM philosophy necessitates a review of the most significant and latest literature on change theory and on the impact of organizational culture on change, as well as a review of the historical development of TQM. The three major figures in the TQM movement are: W. Edwards Deming, originator of the Fourteen Points of TQM; Dr. J. M. Juran, author of the Juran Trilogy; and Philip B. Crosby, who outlined the \"Four Absolutes of Quality Management.\" Undertaking any quality program calls for sweeping organizational changes. American corporations initiated TQM programs in response to falling market  shares and educational institutions followed suit. TQM programs have been undertaken at Fox Valley Technical College in Wisconsin, Lamar Community College in Colorado, and the Maricopa County Community College District in Arizona. TQM principles have been applied to classroom management and curriculum reform. A survey of 22 higher education institutions beginning TQM programs found participants frustrated by resistance to change. Factors necessary for successful TQM adoption include the development of a long-range leadership team working towards a shared vision, institutional commitment, and the need for those affected by the changes to play a role in its design. Authorities agree there is great potential for TQM in higher education if properly implemented and given sufficient time.  (KP)",

        "description":"Throughout all levels of American government, a shift is taking place from the rigid, wasteful, centralized bureaucracies of the industrial era to the more flexible, entrepreneurial, decentralized government needed to succeed in today's world. This shift has been brought about by an unprecedented, ongoing fiscal crisis that has created a sudden urgency to improve services and heighten productivity with fewer dollars. Entrepreneurial governments are: (1) catalytic, leveraging private-sector actions to solve problems; (2) community owned, empowering families and communities to solve their own problems; (3) competitive, moving away from traditional monopolistic models in education, policing, transportation, etc.; (4) mission driven, developing budget systems and rules that free  employees to pursue goals; (5) results oriented, providing incentives for people to succeed rather than fail, measuring outcomes, and rewarding success; (6) customer driven, putting resources directly into the hands of the intended recipients of the service (e.g., job training or child care) so that they can make choices based on quality and price; (7) decentralized, taking advantage of the possibilities afforded by telecommunications advancements to give those laboring in public organizations authority to make their own decisions; and (8) market driven, restructuring the marketplace when necessary to fulfill public purposes. Government is the instrument by which problems are solved collectively; if the instrument is outdated, it is time to remake it. The applicability of these principles  to community colleges is discussed briefly. (ECC)",

Study findings, based on a 73.2% response rate, included the following: (1) of the 96% of respondents who indicated that they provided workforce training, almost all customized programs to meet the needs of local employers; (2) the majority of the workforce training programs operated on a modest scale; (3) the companies served were most likely to be small or medium-sized, with less than 500 employees; (4) 39.2% of the participating employers were involved in manufacturing; (5)  job-specific technical training and computer-related training were the most commonly provided services; (6) training locations were evenly divided between on- and off-campus sites; (7) over 90% of the responding colleges coordinated workforce training programs under continuing education or community services divisions; (8) training programs were supported by employer-paid contracts, college funds, tuition, or state and federal resources; (9) 85% of the respondents perceived that they were meeting employer needs effectively; and (10) the most cited obstacles to effective training were inadequate training budgets, employer inability to afford training, difficulty in being recognized as training providers, and lack of experienced trainers. The survey results suggest that community colleges  are providing effective workforce training, though on a limited scale; that resource constraints are the principle obstacle to expanding this scale; and that college and business leaders must work to spur private investment in community college training programs.

In the ACCLAIM model, community colleges are seen as a moving force in promoting greater collaboration among community-based organizations, formal and informal leaders, and citizens in seeking resolution to major and complex issues. The model consists of a series of tasks: (1) the community college critically examines its mission, philosophy, goals, and structure to assess its readiness to assume the role of a community-based  institution; (2) the college increases its knowledge of the social, cultural, economic, and political environments of its service area; (3) the college then establishes a mechanism for scanning its external environment; (4) issues identified by environmental scanning are ranked and confirmed by community leaders; (5) the college analyzes, identifies, and maps the publics within its service region directly affected by each issue; (6) the college initiates dialogue and forms a coalition among community leaders and other stakeholders in a given issue; (7) the college leads the coalition in developing, coordinating, carrying out, and evaluating a plan for addressing the community problem; (8) coalition leaders report to their respective constituencies on progress and results; and (9) the plan  elements to which the college has committed resources must be incorporated into the college's planning and budgeting processes.

Despite criticism that their missions are already overextended, some community colleges are seeking to respond to critical community needs. In 1991, the Hitachi Foundation funded the League for Innovation in the Community College to develop and pilot test a process that could be replicated by community colleges nationwide to build the capacity of local citizens to address critical community issues. One of the intended outcomes of the project is the development of guidelines describing how to plan and conduct  community forums. The second major objective is to build the capacity of the nine pilot colleges and communities to deal with real problems. One of the pilot projects was a community forum conducted at Delta College, in Michigan, that focused on unemployment, the major problem facing the Tri-Cities area. Over 400 area residents attended a forum entitled, &quot;Now That You've Lost Your Job, How Are You Going To Get One Back?&quot; After all of the pilot projects were completed, the participating colleges shared the insights they gained in conducting community forums and found that they had common problems, including the difficulty of focusing on a topic and the tendency to underestimate the work involved. In spite of such concerns, the colleges all reported that their forums helped their local  communities confront wide-ranging and controversial topics. (ECC)",

Critics have seen the extensive use of part-timers as a disturbing trend, and several groups have attempted to set limits on the ratio of part- to full-time faculty. However, part-time faculty are good and highly motivated teachers, receiving the same ratings and achieving the same student outcomes as their full-time counterparts. They bring breadth, depth, and relevance to the curriculum and allow colleges to teach subjects that would otherwise be excluded from the curriculum. They can provide a strong link to the community and to the workplace, as well as a  tried and tested talent pool for recruiting full-time faculty. If care is taken to provide for their professional development and integration into the mainstream of the institution, part-time faculty can be key institutional assets. The professional development of part-time faculty should include an orientation workshop, a mentor program, and workshops and seminars on topics such as testing, grading, and teaching. Part-time faculty should also be provided opportunities to contribute to the instructional program and be recognized and be paid for their contributions. Colleges are overdue in viewing part-time faculty as full and equal members of the collegium. (ECC)",

        "description":"Studies suggest that the traditional technique of one-way lectures used most often by teachers results in about 42% retention after class, and 17% a week later. To improve both student learning and institutional effectiveness, colleges should support faculty development programs that expose teachers to two-way teaching and learning processes. Using two-way processes, teachers facilitate learning by means of cooperative and active learning strategies and strive to receive immediate and anonymous feedback from students using strategies collectively known as Classroom Assessment Techniques (CATs). One example of these techniques is the assignment of a short paper requesting students to describe the most important concept that they learned in the class that day or state what  important questions remained unanswered. From Fall 1988 to Spring 1992, the College of Marin, in California, participated in an on-site pilot-test of the CAT program. In Spring 1993, 58 of the 70 participating faculty were surveyed regarding their experiences. Of the 20 faculty who responded, 85% were still using the CATs; another 85% saw a beneficial impact on their teaching; and two-thirds felt that the CATs positively impacted students. Grades, examination performances, progress, and project quality all improved during the 4 year program. To implement effective faculty training programs in CATs, colleges should plan ahead carefully, design programs to last at least one semester, use sound teaching and learning principles, provide ongoing support, use faculty participants as recruiters,  offer tangible and intangible incentives, and make participation voluntary and non-threatening.

        "description":"As contributions to community colleges from traditional sources such as government agencies and alumni have declined in the current economic climate, corporations have emerged as a significant source of potential revenue. The task of securing gifts from corporations usually falls to the college president, who must understand that: (1) corporations do not see any particular college as a high priority; (2) fund raising is very competitive; (3) corporations have strong preferences for charitable giving that enhances consumer loyalty and corporate image or affects community welfare; (4) charitable giving requires a series of necessary approvals; (5) the tax benefits from typical contributions may be quite small; (6) corporate donors are impressed with evidence of a college's  fiduciary responsibility, and must be provided with documentation that a college is truly tax exempt and in good standing with state agencies; (7) promoting corporate giving requires patience and nurturing; (8) requests should be made through appropriate channels; (9) corporations often make gifts in response to employee initiative and interest; and (10) once a gift is made, the college must exercise good stewardship in its use. With these guidelines in mind, college presidents should first prime the target corporation by sending a speech, brochure, newspaper clipping, or some other statement of what the college does and follow up on contacts made at civic events. The president should develop a set of specific selling points about the college, but should also be able to answer any  question a corporate contact might have about the college and alternative ways of giving. Community colleges' success in workforce training and economic development help make the best case for corporate giving. (ECC)",

The technological base of American industry has changed dramatically in the direction of greater complexity and interdependence, requiring workers to possess not only higher levels of basic skills but also new skills in critical thinking, problem solving, initiative, and collaboration. The following principles can guide the integration of general education and vocational training: (1) the critical thinking skills that come from the general education curriculum are central to the successful implementation of new technologies and the understanding of how technologies fit into production strategies; (2) instruction in  basic skills is necessary if workers are to compute, deduce, and communicate answers to on-the-job problems; (3) the ability to learn, grow, change, and transfer skills is increasingly required in the workplace; (4) workers must be able to integrate basic skills with the shifts in workplace and market demands; (5) community college vocational faculty need to relearn and update their own knowledge and skills; and (6) workers need to expand their skills to include information gathering, analytical and critical thinking, and decision making. The result of integrating general and vocational education will be workers with higher skills, paid higher wages, and able to compete in the global economy.

The implications for higher education are enormous in the following areas: (1) instruction, where the impact is seen in advances in open classrooms, customized personalized learning, distance education, and intercollegiate collaboration; (2) library operations, which are affected by increasing  percentages of library holdings in digital form and capacity for all the resources of the library to be brought together technologically; (3) distributed, networked administrative resources, from executive information systems to electronic transcripts and student charge-account systems; and (4) improved relations with both the external and internal community. The ubiquity of desktop computers and the proliferation of networks and useful networked information has changed not only the characters of institutions, but also the expectations of students, faculty, and staff.

The children were videotaped constructing an art project during two sessions: first, in same-sex dyads, one-third of which were both LD, one-third both NLD, and another third mixed; and again in same-sex groups of six containing both LD and NLD children. In general, LD children behaved less competently than NLD children in both dyads and groups, although both LD and NLD behavior was related to  gender, group size, and peer acceptance. Specific findings included the following: (1) NLD boys tended to ignore the LD boys in dyads and to engage them in the activity through instructions in groups, while NLD girls tended to positively interact with LD girls in dyads but ignore them in groups; (2) negative remarks by LD boys were less evident in dyads than in groups, while LD girls engaged in high levels of giggling in dyads but were extremely passive in the group situation; and (3) for both boys and girls, more active NLD children were more liked, while more active LD children were less liked. Detailed findings for dyads and groups by sex and an inventory of verbal exchanges are appended. (BYC)",

The paper notes that art therapy is, primarily, a means of fostering the development of a sense of identity and promoting maturation in general. It is both an essential component of the therapeutic milieu and a form of therapy which complements or supports psychotherapy but does not replace it. The paper recommends that, when working with children and their drawings, counselors need to help children verbalize their thoughts and feelings about the content of the pictures.

Workshops and training sessions were developed to examine the physical environment of the classroom, discuss play theories, and review skills that children can develop during play sessions. Pre- and posttests, along with classroom observations of teachers and children, revealed that most teachers who participated in the intervention changed their views and practices regarding indoor play. Teachers became both more aware of the role of play in helping children develop physical, emotional, cognitive, and social skills, and more involved in the children's play to promote these skills. Rooms were rearranged to allow for freedom of movement in and  around newly created theme centers. The children became more focused on their role-playing, more verbal with their peers, and more involved in imaginative situations.

Background study of the school and community indicated approximately a 25% turnover rate of new families and students. Attendance at parent education workshops and school orientation tours before program implementation was low. A survey indicated that parents' work schedules, lack of time, and lack of child care were the main obstacles to workshop attendance. To make parent participation more convenient, several videos were made with students and teachers at the school, including a school orientation video and a video on how to prepare for a science fair. The school set up a parent education resource lending library from which these and  other videos, as well as books and booklets on study skills, school subjects, and school-related social issues, could be checked out. The school's monthly newsletter proved to be an effective forum to announce the new resources to parents. Through an order form provided in the newsletter, parents could check out materials by mail and have them delivered to their homes. As a result of the program, there were more than 430 requests by parents for videos, books, and booklets; there was a 123% increase over the previous year in the number of parents who indicated that they had participated in a parent education event; and 87% of the parents indicated that the opportunities provided in the program were effective methods for obtaining information from the school.

Parents participated in language enrichment activities and reviewed and completed materials printed by the school district. Handbooks were developed for parents and for the teachers and school staff. Results of the practicum indicated that the organization of a parent  resource center in the public housing community helped parents build self-confidence in their ability to gain access to school and community resources.

Of the three main criteria for judging the quality of curricula--breadth, balance, and coherence--coherence has been neglected by teachers and planners. Curriculum coherence, often confused with curriculum commonality and consistency, should be seen as the degree to which each student perceives connections between the various subjects the student is learning. The study is based on interviews, conducted once per school term, with three groups of secondary school students. The first interviews were  conducted when the students were 12 years old and the last interviews will be conducted when the students are 16 years old. The interviews on which the present report is based were conducted when the students were 14 years old. Though student comments occasionally betrayed an awareness of connections within and among school subjects, students generally showed little awareness of coherence within subjects or across the curriculum. The students were acutely aware of when they did not understand what they thought they should be learning, however, and when asked about their sense of connectedness to school subjects, occasionally expressed a feeling of being lost with a whole subject. Various teaching methods, such as field trips and project work, were identified by students as helping them  feel connected to their studies. (ME)",

The program focused on the case conference, a forum in which coordinators, teachers, home visitors, and sometimes parents meet to gather information used by teachers in planning teaching strategies. A deficiency in the teachers' ability to refer to language development in assessing a child's developmental stage was identified. To address this problem, workshops were developed in which a certified speech pathologist presented information to teachers about children's language acquisition and development, and also held informal discussions with the teachers. As a  result, the six teachers participating in the program began to refer to children's language as an indicator of developmental stage during case conference meetings. Of the 52 case conferences reviewed after the workshops, 34 included references to language development. The evaluation of the program indicated that training focused on providing information, when associated with a practical application, enhanced teachers' job performance. (ME)",

        "description":"A pilot study was undertaken in preparation for a longitudinal study of the influences of early childhood experiences on children's competence. The pilot study was designed to try out the interviews, observations, and other record-keeping procedures to be used in the main study. The pilot study sample consisted of 19 families with a child 4-to-5 years of age in a family day care or center-based care setting. The children were observed within their early childhood setting a minimum of five times during each of three separate occasions, and two interviews were conducted with their parents or primary caregivers. Pilot study data includes demographic information, parents' perceived benefits of early childhood care, comparison of parents' and teachers' perceptions of their children's  competence, and characteristics of early care settings rated high on several variables. The results of the pilot study enabled researchers to: (1) test the instruments and field-work procedures, and the scoring, data entry, and analysis procedure; (2) modify instruments and procedures to ensure that the main study will be effective and manageable for the resources available; (3) prepare guidelines for fieldworkers and coders; (4) indicate important parameters for the main study sample; and (5) indicate some preliminary patterns in the data.

Based on a survey of 434 centers in 5 California counties selected for their ethnic and geographic diversity and large child populations, the report presents several types of information. First, it documents the scope of the demographic challenges facing child care centers by presenting the findings of the demographic analysis of the centers surveyed. Second, the report provides an understanding of the importance of culturally and linguistically appropriate early care and education by referring to relevant research and literature. Finally, the report describes the everyday activities of several innovative child care centers in California that offer examples of culturally and  linguistically appropriate care. The report makes recommendations for further research and calls for immediate action from the following groups: (1) California state agencies; (2) the federal government; (3) professional associations; (4) the statewide resource and referral network in California; (5) training institutions; and (6) private foundations. Three appendixes contain a methodology report, the child care center survey instrument, and a 63-item annotated list of books, articles, and other materials.

Through ethnographic interviews and observations, it was determined that teachers preferred mixed-age groups: they considered planning for mixed age groups to be more open-ended than planning for same-age groups. Staff who were more experienced used strategies to enhance social and intellectual development more often than less experienced staff. Some  teachers tended to focus on specific skills rather than intellectual and social abilities with mixed-age groups, and teachers' life experiences had an impact on how they felt about mixed-age grouping.

        "description":"As more and more middle school students come to the classroom with no real, stable connections outside the school setting, it is increasingly important for educators to reach out to them in a variety of ways. This paper addresses that need by offering educators suggestions in the following five areas: (1) comprehending the unique characteristics and needs of young adolescents; (2) providing an accepting climate; (3) designing a curriculum and delivery system based on young adolescents' characteristics and needs; (4) connecting with their parents; and (5) sharing with the students an attitude of caring and compassion. Schools need to be responsive to adolescents' developmental needs, such as the need for diversity, competence and achievement, and for positive interaction with  peers and adults. The school environment needs to be a welcoming, supportive, and secure place. The curriculum to achieve such goals would be characterized by the active and cooperative involvement of learners and would use integrated and interdisciplinary themes. Ways that educators can increase parental involvement in the schools are presented and various ideas to think about are outlined. The paper concludes by noting the importance of dealing with the whole child, by addressing social-emotional development as well as intellectual development. (TJQ)",

In a brief interview, 58 mothers were asked about their satisfaction with their relationship with their child and with a non-attachment topic (division of household chores). Mother-child attachment was assessed using the Ainsworth Strange Situation Procedure. Results indicated that mothers in secure attachment relationships with their children were rated more truthful, consistent, realistic, complete, clear in terms of meaning, and clear in terms of discourse as they discussed their satisfaction within the mother-child relationship than were mothers in insecure attachment relationships with their children. Significant differences  were also found between mothers in anxious-avoidant and anxious-resistant attachment relationships with their children. As expected, no differences in coherency were found between the same mothers in their response to the non-attachment question. (Author/MDM)",

Because parents are their children's primary teachers, there is a high correlation between parent involvement and their children's academic achievement, and a constituency of the family would make a significant difference in public policy. Early childhood education leaders need to: (1) listen to parents; (2) provide family supports for meetings; (3) use everyday language, not educational jargon; (4) link parent participation to real change and real power to policy; (5) talk to, not at, parents; (6) develop environments that value values; (7) offer skills building to parents, not just parent education; (8) develop new messengers, such as art and  music, to reach parents; (9) take into account the value of the parents' religious beliefs; (10) use parent mentors; (11) allow for the psyche; (12) encourage fathers' involvement in the education of their children; (13) recognize that parents are more important than service providers; and (14) let parents define goals for action, skills development, and leadership. State policies should withhold funding to educational programs that do not include parent participation at some level, involve parents in leadership training, and design teacher education courses about parents.

Chapters 1 and 2 provide an introduction and an overview of the hazards of lead-based paint. Chapter 3 describes the universe of housing in the United States and the objectives that guided the framework's design. Chapter 4 details requirements for private property owners, which include maintenance practices, deadlines for hazard evaluation and control, and monitoring requirements. Chapter 5 describes how  most private housing units can be made lead-safe in response to effective private-sector forces, while chapter 6 emphasizes the importance of state and local enforcement. Chapter 7 calls for insurers, lenders, appraisers, and the judicial system to reinforce action by owners. Chapter 8 presents a summary of the roles and responsibilities of all key players.

        "description":"Children whose temperamental traits are significantly different from the average risk abuse or neglect from parents who do not recognize this &quot;differentness&quot; as legitimate expressions of individuality. This paper discusses how parents can learn to cope with &quot;difficult&quot; or temperamental infants, by explaining the work of the Indiana University South Bend (IUSB) Parent Project, an ongoing project designed to discover the most effective ways to educate parents about individual differences, specifically differences in temperament. Because a key dimension underlying a parent's perception of the child is that of demand (how much--or little--time, energy, and worry does this child demand?) a model of temperament was developed based on that demand. The &quot;challenging&quot; children are those on  the extremes of the demand model--those called &quot;easy&quot; and those labelled &quot;difficult. The Parent Project has followed 18 two-parent families since the birth of their first child, with trained parent educators visiting each family monthly to provide information on child development and observing the child's current development. When a child is rated by parents as extreme on a temperamental scale, parent educators respond by giving the parents a temperament information sheet. Families will participate in the study until the child is 3 years old, at which time the child will be evaluated in terms of social and cognitive development. Parents' satisfaction and confidence in their parenting role will also be assessed, and the children's performance will be compared to a control group. It is  hypothesized that the children in this study will outperform the control group in both social and cognitive development. Three case studies are also reported which provide examples of &quot;sensitive,&quot;&quot;active,&quot; and &quot;easy-going&quot; temperaments. An appendix provides a list of temperament traits.

        "description":"This practicum was designed to heighten preschool teachers' awareness of gender bias in the classroom and provide information on gender equity issues and the pursuit of the study of mathematics by girls. Its goal was to enable 20 preschool teachers in 3 preschool programs to increase their knowledge of gender equity and to use this knowledge in the classroom. Three workshops were presented to three separate groups of teachers that included experiential exercises on defining gender bias, making changes, and exclusion. Through pre- and post-tests and workshop evaluations, it was found that preschool teachers who participated changed their attitudes and demonstrated heightened awareness of gender-biased behavior in the classroom. Ten appendixes provide copies of teacher and  counselor surveys, pre- and post-test questionnaires, workshop agendas and outlines, activity outlines, follow-up workshop outlines, and workshop evaluations.

Child care in Sweden is considered a public responsibility, and is financed by the state, local municipalities, and parental fees. Parents sending their children to part-time preschools and part-time group care pay no fees, while day care centers, family day care centers, and leisure centers for school-age children receive  partial state subsidies. Early childhood curriculum, staff training, and programs for special needs and immigrant children are also discussed.

These policies, procedures, and systems are then analyzed to determine the extent to which they support &quot;seamless&quot; services; that is, a child care delivery system that offers continuous child care assistance as families move from public assistance to self-sufficiency. In reviewing the Kansas subsidy system from the perspective of seamless funding, the report explores the mechanism used to pay for child care subsidies; the rules, regulations, and procedures that govern each of these  funding streams; and the administrative structure and fiscal management structures. The report also assesses the extent to which families who participate in the SRS subsidy system are able to choose from a range of child care options and select care that they feel is most appropriate for their family. The report makes 33 recommendations for: (1) ensuring consistency in rules, regulations, and procedures; (2) streamlining administrative procedures; (3) creating an automated seamless system; (4) expanding supply and demand data; (5) strengthening parent choice and child care supply; (6) expanding training and staff development; and (7) improving coordination with other funding streams.

The coalition was founded in 1992 in response to a draft Professional Development Model for family day care providers produced by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). The NAEYC report contained what the FAAIR Coalition considered to be unfair training burdens for family day care providers and unfair definitions of what constituted a child care professional; the Coalition claimed the report was prepared with little or no input from family day care providers or advocates. A more recent version of the NAEYC report has addressed  some of these deficiencies, but is still unacceptable to FAAIR. Family day care providers are urged to join the FAAIR Coalition to help it advocate appropriate standards for family day care. (MDM)",

Questionnaires were distributed to parents at four preschools and to parents of children attending a test site preschool with a peace studies program. A teacher focus group was also surveyed, as well as spokespersons from local alternative schools. Results of the study indicated that: (1) parents thought teaching children nonviolent living skills was important, and they would pay more and participate to get such programs for their child; (2) the quality and quantity of parent-staff communication and parent education is critical to a peace program; (3) parent involvement is important in promoting the benefits of such a  program; (4) parents do not view preschoolers as too young to start learning nonviolent living skills; (5) teachers need a supportive environment in which to implement a peace program; (6) a preschool curriculum for this kind of program needs development; and (7) longitudinal studies of children who have participated in preschool peace studies programs would be helpful in ensuring optimum outcomes for children in future programs.

        "description":"This paper, a session proposal for a rural and small schools conference, reports on a project undertaken by 166 parents and staff of South Carolina's Target 2000 Parent Education Program to assess the effectiveness of the program's design and implementation process. The main research question studied concerned what were found to be the most effective parent education strategies for involving parents of at-risk preschool children in activities designed to strengthen the parent's status as their children's primary teachers. Through parent and staff interviews and questionnaires, it was found that the most effective parent program practices included: (1) using parent education activities that strengthened the family's literacy environment; (2) carrying out home visits that included  both school readiness activities and services based on the individual needs of families; (3) involving parents in both parent-child literacy experiences and adult education; (4) using interagency and community resources to effectively meet parent and family needs; and (5) planning with parents in order to meet various family needs.

All foodstuffs in their natural state will deteriorate and become unfit for human consumption due to internal factors, such as enzyme activity, or external factors, such as insects, rodents, and microorganisms. Food preservation techniques have relied on: (1) a reduction of water activity through drying and smoking; (2) a modification of the acidic level, through fermentation or the addition of an acid; (3) heat, through blanching, heat sterilization, and pasteurization; and (4) cold, through refrigeration and freezing. Various techniques for the preparation, storage, and conditioning of food, as well as the nutrition-related consequences  of food processing, such as vitamin, mineral, and protein loss, are examined in detail.

Incoming grade 6 students from five K-5 feeder schools were receiving insufficient articulation from the new middle school to permit them to make a smooth transition. An intervention program was developed and instituted which included middle school visitation days, a student handbook, parent orientation evenings, an open house, student-produced media presentations, pen-pal letters, and parent information booklets. Pre- and post-test surveys of new grade 6 students found that student attitudes were more positive about the middle school experience after participating in the program than prior to it. It was also found that the number of student schedule change requests  declined.

Sixty-one advisors participated in the program, which consisted of a series of five staff development meetings, formulation of a new lesson plan to be included in pre-service orientation, and revision of a segment of the advisor handbook. Surveys of advisors' experience with competency-based assessment, review of advisors' reports, and an on-going Context Input Process Product (CIPP) evaluation were used in formulating the training program. Results of the program indicated that the advisors increased their use of competency-based recorded observation in meetings  with interns and participated enthusiastically in the staff development meetings, and that the design of the meetings successfully promoted reflective discussion among participants. The program also prompted discussion among participants over whether the purpose of recorded observations was to provide encouragement or assess competence. Six appendixes contain the CDA advisor survey instrument as well as samples of program materials. Contains 31 references. (ME)",

Chapter 3 describes the parent education program in Providence, Rhode Island, that focused on empowering Cambodian parents to discipline their children. Chapter 4 relates the experience of the Tacoma, Washington, project that helped  parents and children understand each other in their new life in the United States. Chapter 5 describes the Bronx, New York, project, which helped parents become closer to their children and improve their parenting skills. Chapters 6 and 7 offer program planning advice based on the content of the program descriptions. Chapter 8 analyzes the outcome evaluations of the three parent education programs, while chapter 9 offers some conclusions to the evaluation chapter and to the guide as a whole. (TJQ)",

The importance of adult beliefs and expectations regarding the inner capabilities and health of each child and the importance of creating a climate of respect for the uniqueness of each individual are highlighted. Helping adults to listen, respect, and invite students' input and participation is also discussed as a key strategy for eliciting students' natural health and potential as is knowing and acting on the knowledge  of this health and potential. The paper concludes with a summary of results of an intervention program aimed at high-risk middle school youth, their teachers, and their parents. The central feature of this intervention is a focus on quality adult-youth interactions and relationships in a transformed context, provided by the integration of the &quot;Reciprocal Empowerment Model&quot; of McCombs and Whisler and the &quot;Health Realization Model&quot; of Mills and his colleagues into an &quot;empowerment philosophy.&quot; (Author/HTH)",

        "description":"Rural communities can successfully integrate service learning into academic subject areas. In service learning, students develop a deeper understanding of academic subjects while engaging in meaningful service to their school or greater community. Barriers to implementing service learning in rural areas include lack of time, transportation, student supervision, and teacher experience. Schools can begin by identifying and expanding voluntary community-service activities already being done by school-age children and youth. Instructional time is not wasted when projects involve skills such as typing or proofreading a mailing list for a service agency, monitoring the local water supply, or interviewing community residents. Innovative ways of finding transportation for students to  engage in service activities are suggested. Experienced students and adult volunteers can serve as trainers and supervisors for new students entering a project. Teachers can be trained through courses in service learning or by mentors who supervise adult volunteers. Service learning in the school could involve peer tutoring, beautification projects, or light maintenance. All these activities integrate help to the community with academic skill building. (KS)",

Families were encouraged to interpret the meanings and traditions of the cultural elements of the program to their children. To facilitate family involvement, training sessions were conducted at Head Start monthly meetings to familiarize parents with learning packets and  curriculum. Screening tests of children entering kindergarten revealed a significant increase in program participant scores when compared to students who had not participated in the program. Families responded well to the program, especially materials dealing with traditional stories, fingerplays, games, music, dance, jewelry, and Native language.

Parent participation may be placed on a continuum from communication between school and parents to autonomous control of the school by parents and community. Demographic data show that Saskatchewan has a large and growing aboriginal population that will continue to have a significant impact on the province's education system. The majority of aboriginal students are now attending band-controlled schools. Forum participants emphasized the following key points for making parental involvement successful: (1) developing a welcoming climate; (2) fostering a sense of mutual respect; and (3) sharing a common cause and a meaningful  reason for being involved. Participants also identified driving and restraining forces that influence the engagement of Indian and Metis parents in the delivery and governance of public education, and suggested ways to overcome restraining forces. The report describes current school governance structures and options for change that would encourage Indian and Metis involvement. Appendices include the forum agenda, participating school boards and organizations, further ideas for parent involvement, and guidelines for action planning. (KS)",

The school is located on the Navajo reservation and serves 450 K-2 students who are predominately &quot;at risk&quot; and limited-English-proficient. Over a period of 8 months, the faculty researched and discussed the concept. Eight teachers highly committed to the idea decided to launch a SWAS. There were three kindergarten, three first-grade, and two second-grade teachers. The philosophy of the SWAS was child-centered, process-oriented, and literacy-based. Teachers on the team visited each other's classrooms, met frequently to plan thematic structures, and engaged in collaborative activities. Camaraderie developed among teachers and students in the SWAS, and  transitions to the next grade were easier for all involved. Higher student achievement within the SWAS was indicated by scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, the Gates MacGinitie Reading Test, a district-wide writing assessment, and assessments of attitudes toward reading. The nonparticipating portion of the student body served as the control group. The school expanded the instructional team concept and is now divided into three smaller SWAS. (KS)",

        "description":"This pamphlet discusses strategies for reducing baby bottle tooth decay (BBTD) among Native American children. BBTD in infants and toddlers is a painful disease characterized by extensive decay of the upper front and side teeth. It is caused by prolonged exposure of teeth to carbohydrates, such as those contained in infant formula, milk, and fruit juice. Treatment for BBTD is painful and expensive as affected teeth must be capped, filled, or extracted, which sometimes involves sedating and hospitalizing the child. Long-term affects of BBTD include a higher incidence of orthodontic problems and psychological and social problems affecting children embarrassed over their appearance. Recommendations for effective community intervention programs include encouraging community members  to participate in program development, training community members to act as peer counselors, and targeting caregivers. Other strategies include collecting data on the prevalence of BBTD at the local level and initiating a mass media campaign to raise community awareness of BBTD. Essential in developing an intervention program is assessment of community cultural belief systems to identify factors that have a direct impact on child-rearing practices. The document includes resources for additional information and a parent information sheet on BBTD. (LP)",

Although the program is federally funded, school districts provided various support services, such as transportation, use of staff, availability of school buildings, availability of computer labs and books, and other resources. Services to children aged 3-21 included: (1) health physicals; (2) reading, math, language arts, and career awareness activities; (3) English language instruction; (4) social skills training; and (5) meals. The State Education Agency implemented an evaluation process in which the 10 school districts reported on 7 &quot;desired outcomes&quot; with respect to early childhood education; secondary  education; parental involvement; two support services such as health, nutrition, or transportation; and two academic subjects such as math, reading, or social studies. This report lists desired outcomes and results of on-site evaluations for each school district. Appendices list parent activities, chart demographic data on the migrant students, chart numbers of students receiving various instructional and support services, and provide a table of results of desired outcomes by district.

        "description":"Like urban America, rural America faces problems with drugs, crime, unemployment, poverty, inadequate health care, teenage pregnancy, suicide, etc. Almost three quarters of all public schools in the United States are in rural areas. At least 30 percent of America's current school-age children are at risk and have become educationally disadvantaged. Factors that contribute to student failure are poverty, negative attitudes toward school in the home and neighborhood, single parent households, drug abuse, violence, and inadequate preschool opportunities. Early intervention provides the best opportunity to break the cycle of dependence for disadvantaged children. High rates of teenage pregnancy perpetuate the cycle of generations of children who live in poverty and are at risk of  school failure. The school and individual classroom teachers may have the last opportunity to rescue these children from an unproductive and difficult life. The school with a smaller student population generally has a better opportunity to provide the individual attention needed by the marginally achieving student. Rural educators should build on this advantage and offer at-risk students encouragement and a positive attitude to help them achieve. Contains 78 references. (KS)",

        "description":"In October 1992, Congress passed legislation supporting American Indian tribal demonstration projects that would consolidate employment services, job training, and related services to improve the effectiveness of such services, reduce unemployment, and further tribal goals. In September 1993, a Senate hearing received testimony concerning the extent of implementation of these pilot projects. Representatives of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Health and Human Services reported that: (1) these agencies had established a management framework specifying their roles and responsibilities with respect to the statute; (2) the agencies were developing written guidance for tribes on project implementation, as well as consolidated program report  forms; and (3) 55 tribes were willing to participate in program implementation during fiscal year 1994. Representatives of tribes and Indian organizations discussed: (1) the importance of federal agencies treating the tribes as full partners in the implementation process; (2) concerns that federal agencies not create barriers to implementation; (3) the relationship of this initiative to ongoing tribal self-governance initiatives; (4) the need for data collection that would allow program evaluation in terms of local circumstances; and (5) concerns over Department of Labor plans to publish new regulations affecting Indian Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs. An appendix making up the bulk of this document contains the text of the legislation (Public Law 102-477), much discussion  about the proposed JTPA regulations, reports on Native unemployment and economic development efforts on reservations and in urban areas, and a description of a planned electronic network linking grantees with each other and with federal agencies.

        "description":"An Indian child welfare agency realized the need for an HIV/AIDS policy when a diabetic child possibly exposed to the HIV virus was placed in one of the agency's licensed foster homes. A focus-group interview process was selected for policy development because this method appeared to parallel the Native American cultural approach toward consensus and decision making. Objectives of the project were: (1) to complete and present an HIV/AIDS policy draft to the board of directors and executive director; and (2) to document a positive change of 20 percent in the aggregate score for AIDS/HIV knowledge and attitudes among focus-group participants. Focus-group participants included agency employees, foster and adoptive parents, and other human-services representatives working with agency  clients. All participants were either of Native American descent or working within the Native American community. Prior to the focus-group meetings, participants completed an HIV/AIDS knowledge and attitude questionnaire and received an information packet. After results of the focus-group meetings were compiled, comparative analysis of group recommendations and other available HIV/AIDS policies revealed that focus-group recommendations were similar to an existing policy that could be modified for the agency's purposes. Post-questionnaire results showed that the objective of a 20 percent improvement in scores was not attained. Appendices include the HIV/AIDS questionnaire, survey results, and other materials cited in the practicum report. (KS)",

        "description":"This report estimates the number of recent immigrant students that would enroll in Texas public schools as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and recommends educational strategies to address the unique needs of recent immigrants. Research approaches included a review of existing research on immigration trends and immigrant education, analysis of selected Texas school district data, and focus-group discussions with school administrators. An estimation procedure based on Census Bureau and Immigration and Naturalization Service data and related California studies suggests that the annual growth of the Mexican immigrant population in Texas will increase by 7.5-14 percent with the implementation of NAFTA. This translates into 75,000-150,000 additional persons  under age 20 during the first 5 years. Other findings are concerned with: (1) school district procedures for identification of recent immigrant pupils; (2) student placement in appropriate specialized programs with timely transition to mainstream programs; (3) monitoring of student progress and support services during transition to the regular program; (4) coordinated comprehensive support services for immigrant students, including health and social services; and (5) orientation strategies for immigrant parents and support for parent participation. This report contains 34 references, suggestions for program planning and strategies, school district questionnaire, focus-group questions, and an outline of school characteristics and educational strategies related to success for recent  immigrant students.

        "description":"&quot;Becoming Successful Problem Solvers&quot; is a 12-episode video series designed for use with middle school students. The materials are intended to create new assessment tools for teachers, to develop instructional devices that are useful in promoting problem solving in middle school classrooms, and to promote classroom discourse about problem solving and misconceptions about mathematics. From a pool of volunteer teachers in 3 counties, 28 pairs of fifth- and sixth-grade classrooms were chosen. In each pair, one classroom was randomly assigned to an experimental group, with the other a control. Sections of this paper discuss the importance of classroom discourse and the nature of the video series; describe one of the 12 episodes (on fitting as many 3&quot; x 5&quot; pictures as possible into a  14&quot; x 21&quot; frame); examine students' and teachers' behaviors while utilizing the series; and report results of an evaluation study of the series. The study compared the misconceptions, beliefs, and attitudes about problem solving of students from 14 classes that viewed 6 episodes of the videotape series with students from 14 classes that viewed 1 episode of the series. Results indicate that: (1) the videotape series offers teachers an easy-to-use method for promoting classroom discourse; (2) a connection was confirmed between problem-solving performance in mathematics and students' beliefs about problem solving, communication, reasoning, and connections; (3) use of the series materials has beneficial effects on those beliefs and students' problem-solving performance; and (4) there is a  plausible causal link between changing students' beliefs and improving their problem-solving performance through discourse.

In both nationalities anxiety, sadness, and anger about environmental destruction were high, but hopelessness was rejected. German adolescents expressed more readiness for pro-environmental action and more consideration in human relations with living things than Russians. While German adolescents were willing to perform small-scale pro-environmental actions, with age they became increasingly reluctant to accept greater commitments for ecology. Females of both nationalities agreed more strongly to emotions and actions than  males, particularly males aged 15 or above. Results are interpreted in terms of differences in environmental values and education in the two countries and in terms of females' higher prosocial attitudes. (Author)",

        "description":"The focus of this report is children's construction and analogical transfer of mathematical knowledge during novel problem solving, as reflected in their strategies for dealing with isomorphic combinatorial problems presented in &quot;hands-on&quot; and written form. Case studies of 9-year-olds, one low and one high achieving in school mathematics, serve to illustrate a general progression through three identified stages of strategy construction (non-planning stage, transitional stage, and odometer stage). The important role of domain-general strategies in this development is highlighted. It was found that achievement level in school mathematics does not predict children's attainment of the third stage, as evidenced by the low-achieving student's construction of sophisticated combinatorial  knowledge and the high-achieving student's failure to do so. Children's ability to recognize structural correspondence between two isomorphic problem sets and the extent to which this facilitates problem solution are also reported. The study concludes that: (1) Children can construct important mathematical ideas through solving novel problems; (2) Level of achievement in school mathematics is not a reliable predictor of ability to solve novel problems; (3) Bright students' ability to generate ideas for themselves can be inhibited by formal mathematical rules; and (4) Assessment of students' mathematical competence must include a range of novel problems.

        "description":"This essay suggests that helping people learn any subject better is a job for everybody who teaches that subject, from preschool to Ph.D. To do the job well at any level requires knowing what teachers and students at all the other levels need to do, and need to have done for them, subject by subject. Most educators have ignored the seamless nature of levels of learning in a particular subject. They do this because they are usually preoccupied with one particular level of schooling, and because they do not think of organizing or reforming things by starting with subject matter or curriculum. They have focused on the processes, not the content, of education. This paper argues that curriculum, the subject matter, needs to come first in educational reform. A hypothetical eighth grade  history course is described in which inclusive strategies of reform have improved the course and the education system as a whole. The paper traces the work of commissions and conferences on educational reform. The importance of close collaboration based on mutual respect among practitioners at the school, college, and graduate levels is discussed. United States Department of Education standards and state frameworks are cited for the development of criteria to establish national content standards that will turn the idea of multilevel collaboration into practice.

        "description":"This report discusses the reactions of the U.S. focus group of the National Council for History Education to proposed standards for the U.S. history curriculum. General concerns of classroom teachers about the proposed standards include the lack of a developmental concept from kindergarten through grade 12, and too much influence of present-mindedness. The participants suggested two serious obstacles to the application of the standards: (1) not enough time in the normal curriculum to cover the recommended material effectively, and (2) the majority of K-12 teachers do not have the educational background and training necessary to teach in a history curriculum based on the adoption of these standards. Group comments are broken down into nine areas: (1) criteria, including  suggestions on wording in criteria 1, 9, 12, and 15; (2) major themes (history of science is not included and should be); (3) periodization; (4) content standards; (5) process standards (the emphasis on critical thinking and historiography may be too optimistic); (6) performance standards (a glossary was suggested, and the standards for grades 9-12 should build on earlier grades, not repeat them; (7) suggested teaching and learning activities; (8) feasibility (the scope and approach of the standards would almost certainly require more than two years of history); and (9) accommodating variability. The group suggested that ideally the United States history and the world history teams should get together to develop several model programs so that curriculum planners could have effective  guidance.

        "description":"This document discusses the movement to bring original historical sources into the classroom. Because students of history need access to sources of information that provide direct or primary evidence about reality, teachers must show that realistic alternatives to the traditional history text exist. In the first section of this paper, efforts to make original sources available are traced to their origin in pamphlets distributed by the Old South Meeting House in Boston and based on a series of summer lectures delivered in 1883. The contributions of historians Edwin Doak Mead and Frederick Jackson Turner, who believed that the scholar's highest obligation in a democracy was to support and nourish public history education, is contrasted with the rift that set in later between  history scholars and history teachers sometime in the 1930s. In the second section, the need to allow history teachers the freedom and time to seek out instructional materials and primary sources that emphasize themes and fill needs that these teachers have encountered in their classes is stressed. The third section illustrates the human and dramatic quality of literature in which ordinary people, especially young people, tell their own story, with examples of contemporary accounts of a young mother's survival of an Indian attack in Massachusetts in 1676, of a soldier in the American Revolution, and of a 92-year-old former slave woman. The paper suggests that such documents may illustrate different viewpoints and experiences, as well as the process of conflict and change in society. The  fourth section lists different biographies and series of books that can be used. The fifth section suggests how changes can make primary source materials available. (DK)",

This paper uses data from the March 1991 Current Population Survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census along with some common statistical techniques to chart the specific impact of age, education, race, and gender on earnings. It is shown that earnings tend to begin low, rise well through middle age, then decline during the final years of an individual's work life. It also is shown that expanded earnings are associated with increases in education. With the first two variables examined--age and education--as with the others, charts and tables are included to convey the data described. The differences among races are markedly less if comparisons are made at comparable levels of education.  Finally, lifetime earnings of males are higher than those of females among all races and at each level of educational attainment. (DB)",

The fourth chapter discusses the content of the three subjects and synthesizes their concepts. Chapter 5 attempts to get at the dynamics of ethics and morality, while the sixth chapter provides a brief historical summary. Separately,  the seventh chapter records various efforts to make the approach to ethics more scientific. Chapter 8 underlines the enjoyment of life, suggesting that the &quot;good life&quot; emphasizes the individual, &quot;quality of life&quot; emphasizes the group, and &quot;proper life&quot; emphasizes the culture. In the ninth chapter is a summary of conclusions about personal behavior, findings, understanding, and enjoyment. The book represents an attempt to combine technical accuracy with clarity of presentation. (SG)",

        "description":"Through the narratives of North American slaves a vivid picture of their lives, struggles, hopes, and aspirations emerges. The slave narrative arose as a response to, and a refutation of, claims that blacks could not write. Slave writings were often direct extensions of speech. Through a process of imitation and repetition, the black slave's narrative came to be a communal utterance rather than merely an individual's autobiography. The narrators went to great trouble in learning to read and write. Some whites taught the slaves, some unwittingly, some for their own benefit, and some out of a sense of Christian duty. Blacks who learned to read and write, and the people who taught them, faced stiff punishment. Some slaves were whipped, others killed. The most common penalty was  amputation. The hardships of life as a slave made learning nearly impossible. Literacy for the slaves was a means of empowerment, a necessary foundation for cultural action for freedom, and a means of developing critical thinking skills. For the slave narrators, writing was also a vehicle for expressing self-identity, as well as a political demonstration of resistance. Literacy was the key to spiritual, mental, and in some cases, physical freedom. (SG)",

        "description":"This document discusses the roles of secondary schools, two-year colleges, and the upper level university in the University of Wisconsin System. Because of close ties with the host communities, Wisconsin's two-year institutions are uniquely situated to function as community resources. The paper discusses the advantages of a collaborative relationship between secondary school history faculties and the history departments at the two-year schools. Significant numbers of students are deficient in the essential skills of critical thinking and writing. In an attempt to solve this problem, university historians and secondary school history teachers in Marathon County, Wisconsin, have established a history teaching alliance. As a result of close contact, university professors have been  able to encourage a stronger discipline orientation in secondary education and assist pre-collegiate teachers in maintaining their command of the literature, a primary concern. They have been able to promote the concept that history and history instruction must involve critical thinking more than the simple accumulation of a set of disconnected facts. Interaction with high school teachers has helped strengthen the content, course materials, and standards introduced in the feeder institutions, while it has improved the understanding of the techniques employed by pre-collegiate teachers in the preparation of students for the university. The role of the history instructors at the two-year institutions also must be to prepare students to go on to advanced level history studies. Professors at  four-year campuses need to recognize the connective relationship between general education and the major. (DK)",

        "description":"Because students should not only know stories about the past, but also understand the interpretive nature of historians' work, this study sought to discover whether instruction can develop elementary students' ability to engage in some aspects of historical interpretation. The study focused on fifth grade students. The research consisted of direct observation of classroom instruction over the course of a 5-week unit, informal conversations with teacher and students, analysis of 24 student compositions produced during instruction, and 4 open ended interviews with focus groups of 4 students each. After participating in activities in which they took the perspectives of different groups of people in the past, students were able to explain how these groups understood events  differently, as well as the way in which present day perspectives affect the way stories about the past are told. The ability of students in the class to engage in historical interpretation cannot be understood apart from the teacher's instructional activities. The instructor frequently presented information through short lectures, in which discussion was encouraged by asking students to draw inferences or conclusions about the motivations of groups or individuals. When presenting information, the teacher frequently mentioned the way in which opinions and perceptions differed. The students were highly skeptical toward the reliability of present day historical accounts, and demonstrated their understanding that there is no single story with a straightforward and unproblematic meaning.  Students had little understanding, however, of the way in which historians use and evaluate primary sources in order to construct stories. (DK)",

        "description":"This document discusses the advantages of integrating social studies--geography in particular--and reading skills. Time is saved because literature based reading is a high interest means of introducing social studies concepts and vocabulary to children. Skills can be taught using the vocabulary from the social studies unit. This paper presents generic activities that can be used in many ways and adapted to almost any social studies unit or literature based reading program. The reading skills activities presented in this article are vowel sounds, blends, rhymes, digraphs, vocabulary drill, alphabetical order and sequencing, describing words, sorting and classifying words, compound words, syllable identification, and compare and contrast exercises. Integrating social studies and  reading skills serves two purposes: (1) to reinforce reading skills and (2) to reinforce social studies vocabulary and concepts. Integrating reading skills with social studies vocabulary allows teachers opportunities to see if students can apply these skills in a non-reading situation. Activities discussed are brainstorming, crossword puzzles, sorting and classifying, puzzle boxes, word searches, alphabetical lists, word and picture matches, and designing travel brochures and posters. Illustrative figures are included for brainstorming, sorting, crossword puzzles, classifying, sorting, acrostics, blends and digraphs, puzzle boxes, word searches, vowel sounds, alphabetical order, dot to dot tracing, word and picture match, and describing and rhyming words.

The program is a traditional instructional program that grows conceptually with the student and is designed to meet the needs of students and society. The elementary program meets state guidelines and is the expanding horizon program researched and recommended by the National Council of Social Studies. The program begins with a study of self in kindergarten and progresses to a study of family, neighborhoods, communities, regions, and United States history. The secondary curriculum also meets state and national guidelines. This program includes local, state, and national government, world and United States history, economics, and African American studies. The program provides a  balance between American and world studies, history and current issues, and emphasizes a multicultural and nonsexist approach. The program is strenghtened by a variety of interesting and challenging experiential programs. Input evaluation discussed funding and expenditures for teacher training, salaries, and classroom materials. Des Moines social science teachers included 570 elementary school, 40 middle school, and 59 high school teachers. Process evaluation shows that annual goals for the previous year were achieved. Needs identified in the social science area included time allotment at the elementary level, selection of the most effective delivery systems at all grade levels, teacher time and support for continuous effective inservice and staff development, equipment and training for  use of advanced technology, and teaching strategies.

        "description":"This paper discusses the ideas of Conrad Fiedler, a 19th century German philosopher of art, concerning art criticism, or the judging of works of visual art. In addition to a brief biography of Conrad Fiedler, the paper's main subject is Fiedler's ideas on art criticism as expressed in his book &quot;On Judging Works of Visual Art&quot; (1876, translated 1948). The paper also includes translation of some of Fiedler's aphorisms and statements from his other writings. Fiedler rejected the idea that art is based on contemplation of beauty. He strongly disagreed with the Kantian idea that art was only an undeveloped, rudimentary step in the acquiring of cognition. He saw art as a mental process involving another kind of cognition rather than abstract, conceptual cognition. Unlike the art  educators and aestheticians of his day, Fiedler saw artistic consciousness as an inherent endowment of the human mind, that shows its presence already in the behavior of children. Fiedler identified an entire domain of the human mind, an intuitive domain consisting of artistic thinking, artistic cognition, and artistic configuration. These are holistic in their nature, being inherent endowments of gestalt, unifying lawfulness of the human mind. In accordance with Fiedler's views, using the term &quot;aesthetics&quot; without defining it, or treating it as an equal with art, or failing to realize the subjectivity of its criteria for art criticism may confuse and mislead art students.

The Common Core specifically defines what is expected of Connecticut students and schools. It details what school graduates ought to know and know how to do. The Common Core is organized under three major headings with subheadings that reflect significant groups of skills, knowledge, and attitudes. The first major heading is Attributes and Attitudes. This group includes self-concept, motivation and persistence, responsibility and self-reliance, intellectual  curiosity. interpersonal relations, sense of community, and moral and ethical values. The second heading is Skills and Competencies, under which the subheadings are: reading; writing; speaking, listening, and viewing; quantitative skills; reasoning and problem solving; and learning skills. The third major heading is Understandings and Applications. The subheadings under this group are the arts, careers and vocations, cultures and languages, history and social sciences, literature, mathematics, physical development and health, and science and technology. The order of the three major headings represents a logical sequence of assuring effective learning. The Common Core is a statement of the student outcomes expected to result from the entire K-12 school experience.

        "description":"This paper suggests that by thinking about a number of parameters in art and of the array that each parameter suggests, curriculum planners might select, organize, and relate particular experiences with greater assurance that the curriculum will provide adequate and representative ranges of art forms, and address their underlying modes of thinking in programs. The parameters should be applicable to all art experiences and to the four dimensions of engagement: (1) creating art; (2) responding to art; (3) historical inquiry; and (4) philosophical inquiry. The first operating principle for the parameters is that it should be possible to identify some primary characteristics of an art experience with an aspect of each parameter. The second operating principle is that the parameters  and their aspects can provide some assurance that the fullest possible range of art experiences is provided. The parameters and their aspects are: (1) art area (fine, environmental, pragmatic); (2) medium (immediate, technological, conceptual); (3) mindset (spontaneity, precision, ingenuity); (3) dimensions (four, three, two); (4) process (manipulate, add, subtract, transform); (5) approach (juxtapose, realize, synthesize); (6) intention (interpretive, expressive, formalistic); (7) imagery (realistic, abstract, non-objective); and (8) subject (people, surroundings, ideas and emotions, art). Explanations of each parameter and its aspects are excluded. Perspectives provided by the dimensions are identified and discussed. For example, creating and responding are defined as the interchange  between significance and form, hence responding to art is an equally creative act; while in the matter of response and historical inquiry, the response can be fuller if the context within which the piece was created is understood.

        "description":"This document consists of remarks introducing a collaborative panel on women's art and art education. By exploring the realms, relevance, and resources on women's art in art education, the panel hoped to address new and continuing issues, and to clarify continuing misunderstandings. The panelists shared the belief that only through consciousness raising can one be prompted to take necessary action for social change or vision building. Therefore, the session was designed to raise consciousness by sharing perspectives and approaches to increase the relevance of art as it is being redefined to include more kinds of people--women and others--in its production and appreciation. By linking these ideas to the curriculum, the art teacher's art forum, the panelists hoped to bridge the gap  between issues in art and its disciplines, and issues in the classroom. This paper traces the history of the women's art movement as changing from a concern with finding great female artists to a recognition of the values, ideas, and traditions that have fostered a minimal presence, if not silence, of women's artistic voices, expressed or repressed through their visions. Recent books are discussed, and it is observed that art teachers create art history each time they select slides, choose textbooks, lecture to students, write papers, or jury art work. Teachers recreate art history in the minds of the children they teach and thus define what art is to children. Teachers are responsible for recognizing the power of art ideas and forms as well as the way those concepts are taught.  (DK)",

The report is a policy review study conducted from 1985 to 1990, of the factors that act as critical filters or positive factors that hinder or help women's access to and progression in certain scientific and technological disciplines. The report draws on a major review of published research, specially collected statistical data, and group interviews with professors, deans, and school heads based on a set of discussion papers dealing with the 10 core factors that provided the central theoretical framework of the WISTA project as a whole. These factors are: (1) same sex role models as a positive influence for women; (2) mentors; (3) image of  different branches of science and technology; (4) male and female attitudes toward women in &quot;nontraditional&quot; disciplines; (5) single sex versus coeducation; (6) prerequisites and curricular choice as critical filters; (7) math as a critical filter; (8) career education and guidance; (9) women's support networks; and (10) affirmative action intervention. These 10 factors in turn are related to 4 concepts of wider significance, namely: institutional ecology, critical mass, attribution of disciplines as male or female and the constructed style and content of scientific and technological disciplines. The findings and conclusions include such challenges to current received wisdom as: (1) that use of personal same sex role modeling is an ineffective and inappropriate policy mechanism; (2) that  mentorship is an influential but still unacknowledged and underestimated policy mechanism in higher education; (3) that a major paradigm shift is needed from examining girls and women to examining the institutional ecology and the ecological niche of disciplines; (4) that single sex school education does not advantage the mainstream of girls in nontraditional science and technology; and (5) that mathematics remains a critical filter, but contains a further filter giving girls a different mathematics profile from boys at grades 11 and 12.

The 10 factors and papers concern: (1) same sex role models as a positive factor of influence for women; (2) the mentor process, potentially negative or positive; (3) the image of different branches of science and technology (male, female, or sex neutral; socially responsible or systems and machine oriented); (4) male attitudes to females in nontraditional disciplines; female attitudes (self-esteem, or towards peers); (5) single-sex versus coeducation as positive or negative influences; (6) prerequisites and school patterns of curricular choices as critical filters; (7) mathematics as a negative critical filter; (8) careers education and vocational  counseling as positive or negative influences; (9) women's support networks as positive influences; and (10) affirmative action projects in science and technology as positive influences.

        "description":"This document is a collection of three lessons to assist high school teachers in introducing the Arab world to their classrooms. The intended purpose of the lessons is to promote greater cross cultural awareness, understanding of the interdependence of peoples and nations, and appreciation for the different approaches other cultures may choose in trying to solve the social, economic, political, and environmental problems that everyone share. The three lessons contained in this document are: (1) Women and the Family in the Arab World; (2) Central Asia, Past and Present; and (3) Government and Democracy in the Arab World. Each lesson includes lesson objectives, classroom exercises and activities, and suggested background references. The first lesson includes a background essay on  women and the family, an essay on the veil and one comparing marriage and family law in the United States and the Arab world, and a short story. Statistical charts on urbanization, labor, education, and literacy also are included in this lesson. The second lesson has a background essay on Central Asia and an essay on the Aral Sea in crisis. Three charts are included: (1) Cyrillic and Arabic alphabets; (2) land and population in Central Asia; and (3) steps to environmental crisis in Central Asia. Maps show trade routes and Central Asia today. The last lesson includes a background essay on government and democracy in the Arab world, individual country profiles, and perspectives on democracy in the Arab world. A timeline shows the course of reform in Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, and Yemen.  (DK)",

        "description":"Global education is an approach to learning that transcends national boundaries and involves the interconnection of cultural, ecological, economic, political and technological systems. This perspective promotes multicultural sensitivity that enables young people to see more clearly their own responsibilities and opportunities in today's world. This model has been developed to be used by school personnel of Texas to infuse a global perspective into the K-12 curriculum. It is designed to serve as a proposal to direct the thinking of a group and to serve as a launching pad. The paper lists 10 benefits to be gained by students from a curriculum with a global perspective, and 11 benefits for teachers. The model is divided into five sections: (1) cultural systems; (2) ecological  systems; (3) economic systems; (4) political systems; and (5) technological systems. Each section includes suggested goals, objectives, strategies, bibliographies, and resources. Cultural systems are explored through genealogy, folktales, mythology, the arts, language, clothes, food, customs, holidays, habitat, religion, education, geography, family, sports, games, and medical practices. Ecological systems are studied with activities grouped under three different objectives. Economic systems are compared through international trade, economic systems, tourism, careers, and natural resources. Under the section for political systems students learn to understand and evaluate various political systems and processes in order to acquire the skills necessary to participate as responsible  citizens. The section on technological systems uses various media including video, laserdisc, computer software and hardware, electronic encyclopedia, CD-ROM products, electronic database, online database, and telecommunications.

        "description":"This paper reports a study on how prospective elementary school teachers make sense of teaching social studies through conceptual mapping, and therefore provide an opportunity for teacher educators to assess the value of conceptual mapping as a pedagogical tool. Pre- and post-course concept mapping was incorporated into three sections of an elementary school social studies methods course. The general research questions included: (1) How do preservice teachers make sense of teaching elementary school social studies? (2) How do preservice teachers experience the sense making process of constructing a concept map to organize and represent their thinking about teaching elementary school social studies? (3) In what ways are concept maps a viable tool for teacher educators to use to  assess student thinking about elementary school social studies? The data obtained was used to generate two assertions. The first assertion is that concept mapping is a viable tool to help prospective teachers reflect on their memories and conceptions of elementary school social studies. Concept maps constructed by prospective elementary school teachers as they enter methods courses indicate that they view social studies as a body of facts that exists independent of the individual. The second assertion is that final course concept mapping engages prospective teachers in the process of constructing personal knowledge regarding the teaching of elementary school social studies, as they reflect on their experiences in light of what they have learned throughout the semester. During map  construction, prospective teachers reflect on their beliefs regarding knowledge as they pass through four stages: (1) comfort; (2) trepidation and frustration; (3) resolution; and (4) elation and pride.

        "description":"This document discusses the experience of a history professor at a two-year college. The professor's students sit placidly through class, exhibiting politeness, but no interest in the lecture. Different teaching methods are discussed. One solution would be to just accept the students as they are, deliver neatly packaged lectures, give multiple choice examinations, and make sure all students get high marks. To do so would be cheating students out of a good part of what a college education should entail: being challenged, learning to think analytically, learning to write in an organized, purposeful, and insightful way; thinking about things one had never thought of before; and changing one's mind about things one had always taken for granted. The instructor uses only essay  examinations as the only way to check in any sort of real way to see if students have thought about the materials at all, if they have some sense of historical connections and chronology, and if they can see what is important and what is not. The examination questions are given out well in advance in the belief that the students are unable to cope with reading, thinking about, and answering a question in the same class time. The professor stops the lecture often, asking questions in order to get the students to participate. Occasionally carefully planned discussions in which students have an opportunity to represent different factions are scheduled. Also, students are assigned a family history project rather than a term paper because of poor library facilities and plagiarism problems, and  these assignments usually arouse real interest and involvement.

        "author":["McWhinnie, H. J."],
        "description":"This paper reviews some of the recent research relative to the thoughts and writings of the English art critic, Clive Bell, one of the leaders in British art criticism for the first part of the 20th century. Bell's conception of &quot;art as significant form&quot; is considered with specific reference to the following educators: (1) Roger Fry and Herbert Read; (2) Albert C. Barnes and John Dewey; and (3) Quentin Bell. In addition the doctrine of formalism is considered in light of current issues in art education such as discipline based art education (DBAE). Bell argued that aesthetic emotion arises from certain combinations of color and line, not from the subject matter of works of art. Significant form is what differentiates art form non-art. Herbert Read attempted to advance upon and  improve the earlier formulations of both Fry and Bell by suggesting that it may not be significant form that separates art from non-art, but symbolic form. By so doing he moved aesthetic theory beyond the purely formal consideration. Bell may have conceptualized his idea of significant form as projections of the aesthetic object itself. The paper discusses Barnes's attempt to remove significant form from a property of the art object through his insistence on the significance of form as the basis for education in art. Barnes and Dewey evolved a method of art education that had a formal basis. The expression theory presents no consistent view concerning the implication of &quot;art expresses feeling&quot; theory. Susanne Langer, finally, presents an aesthetic theory that may reconcile the opposing  assertions of formalism and expression theory. Borrowing elements of both, Langer achieves an aesthetics that is formalistic, expressionistic, and &quot;semiotic&quot; all at once. &quot;Art,&quot; Langer says, &quot;is the creation of forms symbolic of human feeling.

Study One compared scores on an experimental battery of artistic judgment tests for three groups: professional artists, Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation examinees in art-related professions, and Foundation examinees not in those fields. Study Two compared the two groups of Foundation examinees on the standard Foundation battery and the interest scales of the Career Occupational Preference System (COPS). In Study One, the artists and nonartists differed significantly on all tests in the experimental battery. On the Barron-Welsh Art Scale (BWAS), the professional artists scored significantly higher than a nonartist sample studied previously. In Study Two, on  the standard battery tests, artists scored significantly higher than nonartists in Inductive Reasoning, Structural Visualization, Paper Folding, Memory for Design, Observation, and Tweezer Dexterity. Study Two also showed that artists and nonartists differed in their occupational interests, with artists showing significantly higher interest in artistic occupations, and significantly less in science, business, and computation related fields. The Design Judgment Test, Visual Design Test scales, and the Proportion Appraisal Consensus and .67 scales were shown to be valid in distinguishing artists from nonartists. Further research should be conducted into the relationship between artistic judgment and education and training in the visual arts. (Contains 104 references and four appendices.)  (Author/SG)",

        "description":"A discussion of the role of teachers should begin with some of the fundamental questions that teachers themselves raise in discussing such matters. The starting point for teachers' work is the curriculum, the officially prescribed set of courses of study that they are expected to teach. The basic curriculum structure that most countries use evolved from 19th century public schooling models. Many countries are now trying to enlarge the traditionally narrow definitions of culture. Cultural and intercultural aspects of education include a variety of topics with overlapping, sometimes partially contradictory, meanings as reflected in different nations' curricula. Most countries give teachers a primary role in acquainting citizens with the cultural heritage. At the same time, almost  all nations attempt to help students develop artistic talents, and teachers often express willingness to play a dynamic part in promoting artistic and aesthetic education. Teachers also have a role to play in promoting knowledge about the culture of the community, in teaching special populations, and in teaching about other cultures. Specialized institutions, such as research and university institutions and nongovernmental organizations can help promote meaningful change as well. (SG)",

Interest is growing in the relationship between the two, because of the pace of technological change, the effects of social currents, and the decision by the United Nations General Assembly to observe 1988-1997 as the World Decade for Cultural Development. One of the main objectives of education is to prepare the young for integration into society. The school also can serve as a cultural center of a given community, by providing a meeting place and cultural link between teachers, adults, children, and the communities in which they live. Educators can take advantage of the positive effects of the mass media upon society both through the use of educational technology in teaching and through teaching  students how to use and critically evaluate the media. Schools can promote cultural awarness and development with the help of cultural and ancillary workers in curricular activities. Education increasingly is taking on the dimension of cultural project, while culture is considered an indispensible tool of education. (SG)",

A concept of \"interculturality\" now exists, signifying the importance of the interaction between different cultures. There must no longer be a distinction between the \"high class\" culture of the erudite and the \"low class\" culture of the lower social strata. It is necessary to recognize all of the influences upon the culture of the developing nation, even those influences that spring from former colonizers. Identity of self evolves through knowledge of the other. It is impossible to understand a nation's culture without understanding its arts. Any sound education develops personal expression and social integration, and art in particular contributes to such development. To be effective,  art education must relate artistic production with aesthetic appreciation and historical information. Education must pay attention to visual literacy, to prepare children to understand and evaluate all sorts of images. Furthermore, in learning to appreciate and decodify works of art, children develop creativity. Art education also mediates between art and the general public. Training in art is important economically as well, in that many jobs relate directly or indirectly to art. Art is also critical for emotional development.

School in general stresses cognitive development and uses authoritarian methods to impose its view, thereby promoting imitation over initiative and critical thinking. School counterbalances the economic and technical tendencies of the dominant ideology and can promote international understanding and promote peace. Cultural development requires understanding of the past and present. Individuals should be aware of cultural contributions to their nations from other cultures. Such awareness can come through the study of all disciplines: literature, history, the arts, and so on. An interdisciplinary approach is necessary not only  because it corresponds to the global character of modern life, but because the rapid pace of change requires teaching that brings about attitudes which are ready to adapt to change. Education should make students aware of the planetary interrelationships (economic, political, etc.). School should leave room for imagination and emotion, to foster the development of artistic and literary sensitivity and creativity. Only by moving away from an intellectualist approach will education give children the means to understand their society and epoch and to find their proper balance and create their own lives. (SG)",

As informal education is inadequate to fill social needs or actualize children's potentialities, societies create schools. Since a school cannot teach everything, selection is inevitable. One basis for selection ought to be a range of cultural resources from different cultures. Educators should choose material on the basis of: (1) the excellence of the content; (2) the psychological readiness of the individual students; and (3) the diversity of the forms of representation. It is important to consider the \"implicit curriculum,\" the underlying norms and structures that  exist in the schools. A school that views students as raw materials to be processed to meet the needs of consumers is unlikely to promote the individual artistic development of those students.

The conference was attended by key researchers in each of the arts education disciplines, arts educators, artists and artist teachers, representatives of arts institutions and organizations, and persons from groups and organizations that influence the priorities, development, and conduct of research efforts. The goals of the agenda are: (1) to focus the attention of arts educators, researchers, and the broader community on basic issues in arts education that can improve teaching and learning in the arts; (2) to identify what arts educators view as priorities, given limited resources; (3) to provide a conceptual framework and overall philosophy for inquiry in the  field of arts education, as other disciplines are doing with their respective research agendas; and (4) to connect theory and practice, and to make research an agent of improvement in teaching and learning. The agenda was developed to articulate the many unanswered questions in three main areas of arts education: (1) curriculum and instruction; (2) assessment and evaluation; and (3) teacher education and preparation. The document consists of five parts plus notes, a bibliography, and an appendix of conference participants. The first section is an introduction of this field generated document, discussing trends in U.S. education that influence arts education. The second chapter on curriculum and instruction discusses what should be taught and how. The third chapter is on assessment, and  the fourth on teacher education and preparation.

        "author":["Smith, Charles W."],
        "description":"Through professional development schools (PDSs), the College of Education at Texas Tech University has attempted to link school and teacher education renewal with research. In 1990, the university and Lubbock Independent School District initiated PDSs at a junior high school and an elementary school. Three additional PDS sites have been initiated since then, including a rural K-12 school. In addition to discussing steps involved in initiating the professional development school collaborative, this paper describes several specific PDS initiatives. Considerable emphasis has been placed on staff development, which focuses on building the capacity of university- and school-based faculty for educational renewal. Each partner in the collaborative actively participates in planning  research and inquiry designed to test ideas, practices, and innovations. At each PDS, a functioning cadre exists to promote the reflective practice, inquiry, and research that are seen as central functions of the PDS. Both process and outcomes data are being collected from individual PDSs, and a description of collection procedures and a list of the research studies underway are included. The university's PDS-related research efforts are linked to other collaboratives: West Texas State University, Wayland Baptist University, Lubbock Christian University, two regional service centers, and multiple school districts in the Panhandle-south Plains of Texas.

        "description":"The case study presented in this paper describes the thinking-in-action of a first grade teacher who, within the natural setting of her classroom, was constructing a new way of teaching language arts by changing to a whole language approach. In contrast to traditional implementation models, this study highlights the constitutive nature of innovation and accounts for the teacher's beliefs and values, her established version of practice, and her interpretation of the innovation. Data gathering and analysis occurred simultaneously and were based on observations of classroom activity, planning sessions, interviews, journal notes, and audio and video tapes of lessons. The bulk of the document deals with the composition of a new way of teaching described as \"worldbuilding\" that  included: a new world of interaction between teacher and student with innovation constituted in the interaction; the initiation of \"small conversations\" composed of four worldbuilding patterns (participating as a learner/reader, naming actions, assuming possibilities, and changing boundaries); a view of the world that draws children in through patterned thought and action; and the ability of the teacher to interpret whole language through the lenses of her beliefs, values, and goals. A diagram of changing practice as a worldbuilding process is provided. (Contains approximately 75 references.) (LL)",

Data were collected from: (1) 48 students in a beginning teacher education course who kept journals of their experiences; (2) student teachers' writings; (3) interviews with beginning teacher educators; and (4) the author's experiences. The paper emphasizes the beginner's feelings of aloneness, nervousness, uncertainty, lack of confidence, vulnerability, and overriding concern with planning and organizing. It notes the beginner's chronic state of experiencing unsafe interactions and sense of being judged about their competency. It describes the beginner's concern with surface  structure or immediately evident details and their classification, rather than deep structure understandings. It also outlines the beginner's uncertainty about the usefulness of past schemas and uncertainty about which details are most important, which leads to a focus on all of the details. The paper also discusses the question of when people actually are beginners and proposes that people come to this world not as blank slates but with personality and talents which unfold and grow in response to their environment.

        "description":"This publication contains two articles which focus on the teaching profession within the context of systemic reform. The first article, &quot;Systemic Reform: Teachers and the Condition of Teaching,&quot; discusses the role and the preparation of teachers. The level of coordination among the various systems that relate to the teacher's role is greater for current systemic reform efforts than for earlier reform efforts. Professionalizing teaching may be a starting place for changing the role of the teacher, and both teacher preparation and teacher development are vital components of the overall process. With regard to policy development, ideas that support and promote systemic change include: coordinated policy development, new governance structures, new incentive structures, leadership  development, and new teacher development systems. One promising teacher development strategy is the establishment of professional development schools. The second article, &quot;Two-Way Streets: Improving Attraction and Access of Minorities to Teaching,&quot; focuses on the education pipeline that produces minority teachers. Demographic, economic, and social forces are producing an educational context which demands increasing representation of minority group teachers within the profession as part of a coordinated approach to providing equal access to education for all children. Both the informal context of education (e.g., family, community) and the formal context (e.g., schools, government, state boards of education, professional associations) influence whether minority group students are attracted  and retained by the teacher preparation system. Ten proposals for improving minority access to teaching are listed. (IAH)",

This paper, which includes a lengthy literature review (14 pages), describes a study conducted to examine the opinions of one group of teachers regarding the safety and security climate in the school where they teach. A questionnaire entitled &quot;Teachers' Safety and Security Perception in the Chicago Public Schools at Cabrini-Green&quot; referred to as the &quot;TSSP&quot; was developed and administered to elementary school teachers (N=40) working in Cabrini-Green, a low-income high-rise Chicago Housing Authority project known for high statistics in violence and crime. The teachers were employed at the Sojourner Truth elementary school with a population of about 600  students. According to the data analysis, 94 percent of the sample feel safe in the school (it should be noted that participants work in a school with a full-time security staff); 53 percent have been victims of crime at school; and 58 percent report an increase in school security in the last 5 years. It is further indicated that more crimes take place in schools than are reported by teachers to either administrators or police. Since the majority of teachers have been victims of school-related crime, it is recommended that more dialogue take place with law enforcement officials and schools administrators to help make public schools safer. The paper includes a table of the responses to the TSSP. (LL)",

Buckminster Fuller to the educational process: &quot;To be optimally effective, undertake at outset the most comprehensive task in the most comprehensive and incisively detailed manner.&quot; The principle of synergy can be used to determine when something is &quot;optimally effective.&quot; One example of how teachers can deliberately use the principle of synergy is by integrating the curriculum so that multiple skills develop simultaneously. To undertake a &quot;comprehensive task,&quot; education should be approached in the context of holistic and global realities (thinking and acting from whole to parts). A &quot;comprehensive and incisively detailed manner&quot; for accomplishing this would begin by actively nurturing a holistic attitude orientation in educators,  students, and policymakers. An interdenominational, unifying ethic that could inspire people worldwide would be valuing the whole. Holistic education is a key to unlocking the potential for self-empowerment. The call to educators and others is for a rapid evolution of consciousness, approaching ever deeper into &quot;comprehensivity,&quot; which Fuller considered to be a deeper level of realization from which one can better perceive and shape reality.

Placebound students are defined as students who, because of time, work, and/or family commitments, are unable to enroll in college courses taught during traditional time periods on a typical college campus. The collaborative program was initiated when a state-supported four-year branch campus was proposed for a rural area underserved by state-supported institutions of higher education but served by a private, nonprofit college (Heritage College). The demography of the rural Yakima Valley; the demography of the institutions (Yakima Valley Community College, Central Washington  University, and Heritage College); and the history and development of the collaborative program are described. Six major areas of concern are addressed, including: integration of curricula and academic calendars; faculty assignments; awarding of degrees and certification; application process; tuition differences; and financial aid. By sharing facilities, faculties, expertise, and programs, each institution has been able to deliver instruction to underserved students at a lower cost and over a larger geographical area. An appendix provides institutional profiles and course requirements. (JDD)",

        "description":"The pedagogical development of teachers has been described in five stages: novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, and expert. This study sought to determine if a survey instrument called the Method Acceptance Scale for Teachers (MAST) would be useful in revealing differences among teachers in different stages of development with regard to their instructional decision making. The MAST uses a 4-point scale for teachers to self-report the criteria that they feel are most important to them when they make instructional decisions. Administration of the MAST questionnaire to 120 preservice teachers and 768 practicing classroom teachers revealed differences among teachers having varying years of experience. Comparison of MAST responses of 87 expert teachers with the responses  of experienced nonexpert teachers indicated that expert teachers rated two factors higher than experienced nonexpert teachers: enhancing student understanding and motivation, and compatibility of the instruction to their own philosophy and experience of success. Experienced teachers rated colleague support and external approval from peers, parents, and administrators higher than did expert teachers. The paper concludes that there may be quantitative differences between expert teachers and nonexperts with 15 or more years of experience, and that the MAST questionnaire shows promise in being able to reveal differences among teachers.

The changes had the goal of increasing the quality and scope of education students' thinking about education, and they involved restructuring the organization of course work so students could spend a concentrated amount of time in classrooms. Juniors spent 1 day a week in field placement during their first semester. The second semester then consisted of the major methods courses (taught at the field site) and a practicum of 2 mornings a week during the first half of the semester and four consecutive days during the second half of the semester. Students planned and  carried out a thematic unit that integrated science, social studies, and reading/language arts. This activity pulled the methods courses and the field experience together. Reflection about practice was encouraged throughout the semester. Data from 13 preservice teachers revealed that the revised program was effective in accomplishing its goals. Students practiced reflection not imitation, found support not isolation, connected theory and activity for transfer, and experienced normatively situated dilemmas instead of only technique. Themes emerging from the evaluation data include: ownership/partnership; risk taking; planning, teaching, and learning; realities; and relationship of changes to larger program goals.

The chaotic situation brought about by the dramatic and rapid changes that have taken place since the collapse of the Soviet Union has resulted in hyperinflation, political instability, a decaying infrastructure, and a changing legal system. Although physical conditions were barely tolerable, faculty members relished their newfound freedom to read whatever printed matter they chose and to think more freely. Technology such as telephones, computer systems, and facsimile machines reflected great inequities on campus. The hierarchical structure among faculty and administrators was clearly evident.  Professors' involvement in publishing scholarly works in Russia and abroad was directly related to their professional advancement. Russian professors were strongly devoted to developing a uniquely Russian personality theory rather than simply adopting or transplanting an American or European theory. Much of the inservice training being carried out with teachers in the public schools revolved around the theme of humanizing the school and helping teachers become less authoritarian. (JDD)",

The training follows a four-step model developed by David Lazear which involves awakening, amplifying, teaching, and transferring intelligences. In awakening, the intelligence is engaged; amplifying allows for that intelligence to gain strength; teaching uses that intelligence to learn material; and transferring helps enable the person to understand the intelligences and how they might be utilized and integrated into daily learning and  activities. The training sessions have been rated very positively by participants, and participants believed unanimously that the multiple intelligences material would help them do a better job of teaching and/or supervising staff.

        "description":"The Teacher Induction Partnerships program was developed by the University of Northern Colorado and several Colorado school districts. The program represents an approach to teacher induction which serves to support beginning and reentry teachers, foster collaborative relationships between the university and school districts, and increase new teacher retention rates. The program provides the opportunity for the beginning and reentry teacher to assume the responsibilities of a regular staff member while receiving support and assistance, feedback on teaching practice, and graduate-level course work in education. The program model includes: (1) legal contracts between all parties stipulating program policies and procedures in addition to personnel roles and responsibilities; (2) a  three-person support team for each partner teacher, consisting of a university field consultant, a school-based mentor teacher, and the building principal; (3) orientations for partner teachers, mentor teachers, and principals; (4) graduate seminars for partner teachers; (5) assistance and training for mentor teachers; and (6) release time for partner teachers to observe other teachers and pursue professional growth activities. This paper describes the roles of the partner teacher and each of the team participants and outlines application and placement procedures. (JDD)",

        "description":"This paper reviews statements by the New York State Commissioner of Education, the New York State Board of Regents, and various task forces and committees on the importance of infusing a multicultural perspective into programs of study for New York's schools. The learning outcomes for English language arts presented in these statements call for students to respond sensitively to texts and performances with diverse social, historical, and cultural dimensions. The paper then presents impressions gathered from an investigation of commonly used textbooks in English/language arts at the upper elementary and secondary levels. Methods of presenting multicultural literature include: (1) textbooks devoted to literature from a specific ethnic, racial, or cultural group; (2) collections of  writings from many ethnic groups, organized thematically; and (3) inclusion of multicultural literature in standard anthologies. The implications of these initiatives for teacher education programs include, among others: a definition of multiculturalism is needed; an attitudinal survey can clarify students' beliefs and values; students should read widely and share their insights; and prospective teachers must practice their new understandings in a courageous and proactive manner in classrooms. Appendices provide a sequence for multicultural literature study, a five-phase approach with Black literature and with Hispanic literature, a bibliography of multiethnic literature, and an attitudinal survey.

        "description":"This paper reviews research on preservice teachers' need for a multicultural education program, finding that preservice teachers who have not developed their awareness, knowledge, and skills for working with diverse populations will be inadequately prepared to meet the classrooms of a diverse society. A survey was conducted concerning students' perceived beliefs about their cultural sensitivity, biases/prejudices, and multicultural education. The respondents were 45 students from methods classes at California State University, Northridge, and Pacific Lutheran University; both groups of students had experienced multicultural concepts in various components of their educational program. Respondents indicated a high degree of cultural sensitivity in both pre- and post-administration  of the survey. Respondents attributed their perception of being seldom biased/prejudiced on the belief that all people have value and worth as individuals; they viewed multicultural education as a vehicle to learn about, respect, and accept all cultures. They conceptualized multicultural education partly as a reformative and partly as an additive process. They perceived an effective multicultural teacher as one who recognizes the individualities of students and meets their unique/diverse needs. Four out of five respondents were concerned more with teacher control than student needs. (Contains 31 references.) (JDD)",

        "description":"The major purpose of the research reported here was to determine how teachers from middle school to high school levels acquired their understanding of cooperative learning, how they used it in the classroom, and how they kept students accountable for performance. Eleven teachers were interviewed and observed in five disciplines (language arts, mathematics, physical and health education, science, and Spanish). Teachers gained their knowledge of cooperative learning from coursework, peers, and professional organizations. Cooperative learning was primarily used for completing worksheets or textbook-type assignments, reviewing for tests, or reviewing homework. Typically, the teachers assigned students to groups to maintain a balance of abilities; they assigned roles to students and  expected students to know their roles, but students often did not know what they were expected to do in their roles. Higher level thinking was observed often, but seldom seemed to be a primary objective. Teachers held cooperative groups accountable for completing tasks together and submitting the group's assignment. Usually a combination of group and individual grades was assigned, or individual grades were assigned with some extrinsic reward for the group. The classroom observations indicated that the teachers were generally not very \"risk taking\" in their use of cooperative learning, but that they were successful in the strategies they used. A cooperative learning interview form and an observation form are appended. (JDD)",

The program uses a project approach to organize the interns' experiences and offer a coordinated approach to the curriculum which helps interns to unify experiences more completely. The projects are assigned and assessed through a general methods class. The projects assigned are: a teaching platform; a comparative child study; collaboration with other interns on a thematic integrated unit; the artifact collection (videotapes of three planned lessons which are analyzed, and an action  research report); a response journal; and a portfolio. Through these projects, the program models that: teachers are guided by students' progress; learning demonstrated through a project, not a paper and pencil test, may be longer lasting; student-selected work reveals things that required work does not; the product is important, and so is the process required to produce the product; and opportunities for students to unify their learning through a variety of modes is an effective strategy.

Portfolio assessment provides students with opportunities to determine which skills are most congruent with their respective areas. The main body of this paper describes a teacher educator's experiences with portfolio assessment in each of four semesters. Data sources included the teacher educator's reflective journal, student journals, notes and observations made during class discussions and activities, notes from portfolio exit conferences, discussions with colleagues, sample portfolios, and course materials related to portfolio development. Lessons were learned and refinements made in each of the four  semesters. Among the items found to be helpful for a teacher initiating portfolio assessment were: clearly identify purpose(s); involve students in the process; schedule work-in-progress and information sessions; provide written descriptions, explanations, and expectations; display exemplar portfolios; link process/product to overall program goals; conduct exit conferences; systematically monitor impact on student learning and modify accordingly; and, if possible, work with a colleague to initiate or refine use of portfolio assessment. Appendixes provide: samples of a formative assessment (midterm portfolio); a final portfolio; assessment criteria; a portfolio scoring rubric; discussion of portfolios as progress and product: a construction metaphor; and portfolio summary data including  categories of evidence such as growth and development, and change in perspective or belief.

Along with coursework, students plan and teach lessons for children in a partnership school in which teachers have begun the process of holistic curricular change. Reflective practice is interwoven throughout the course as students respond in journals to course content and the effectiveness of their lessons, children's learning, their own professional learning, and life in schools. An initial study involving three outstanding preservice students was followed by a study involving nine outstanding and average preservice students. Findings revealed that: the co-constructed  syllabus did not meet students' needs; the majority of students did not find journal writing to be personally helpful; students responded positively to small group work within class sessions, demonstration lessons, and parallels between the methods class and the kind of teaching advocated for young children; and students' concerns after having classroom experience centered around classroom management and meeting individual needs. Implications for teacher education are discussed. The appendixes contain information about the research design, the field experience, and group interviews. (Contains 34 references.) (JDD)",

Results indicated a significant groups-by-gender interaction for three variables (matching instruction to each student's abilities, teaching students to think for themselves, and showing enthusiasm when teaching). Interaction patterns revealed that females across groups responded similarly, and at a higher level than males, to each variable; administrators were the most similar in their responses; and professors exhibited the most difference in gender perceptions.

        "description":"This paper describes a tri-level model of supervision of secondary teaching interns at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and presents research evaluating its efficacy. The supervision model involved the following elements: (1) the university supervisor met with the interns once per week, discussing such topics as lesson planning, assessment methods, and classroom management concerns; (2) the university supervisor met with all mentoring teachers once per month to discuss the status of the interns and any problems; and (3) the university supervisor met with the assistant principal and the faculty associate to discuss the progress of the interns, prior to regular meetings with the interns and mentoring teachers. A questionnaire administered to 2 school administrators, 6  interns, and 10 mentor teachers revealed that regularly scheduled meetings with the university supervisor met their needs and were held often enough; most felt that they were reasonably informed regarding the internship experience; and respondents felt that the internship model had been well coordinated. The study concluded that clear, well-communicated, and mutually decided upon expectations for all parties concerned are a prerequisite to a successful internship program. Appendixes list required courses for the fifth-year teaching internship, outline expectations for interns and mentoring teachers, and provide copies of the questionnaires. (JDD)",

        "description":"This paper defines service-learning as an individual or group act of good will for a person, group, or community, based on planned educational outcomes. Philosophically, ideas of service-learning emerged in the Progressive Education Movement and later in the philosophy of reconstructionism. A university goal should be development of students' sense both of social responsibility and of what is learned by contributing to society. To attain this goal, the university needs to provide access and motivation. In a legitimate service-learning project, there will be ample opportunity for decision making and problem solving, as well as interpersonal skill building, critical thinking, cooperation, and identification of priorities and values. Serious commitment to service-learning demands  that it be regarded not as an add-on course, but as an integral part of institutional thinking. The College of Education at Mankato (Minnesota) State University is developing service-learning in its curriculum. The program will grant four credits to students who serve 40 to 50 hours in an area community agency, attend a weekly class, make site visits to communities practicing service-learning in their schools, and develop recommendations regarding integration of service-learning into teacher preparation.

        "description":"This study examined the effects of peer coaching on elementary school teachers' professional attitudes and beliefs. Peer coaching programs are nonevaluative and are based on observation of classroom teaching followed by constructive feedback aimed at improving instructional techniques. An experimental group of teachers (n=23) voluntarily receiving peer coaching training was compared with a similar group of teachers (n=26), acting as a control, who did not receive the treatment. Both groups had positive attitudes and beliefs prior to the study. Training included sessions on supportive skills, the art of questioning, teachers' nonverbal communication, learning modalities, and thinking skills. Findings, based on a short survey administered to both groups before and after the  training sessions, indicate that participants in the peer coaching experimental group exhibited no significant change in professional attitudes and beliefs, comfort level at taking risks experimenting with new instructional techniques, feelings of isolation, or job satisfaction level compared with teachers in the control group. The reason for this result may be that both groups had positive attitudes and beliefs prior to the study and that peer coaching may or may not have had an effect on maintaining the positive attitudes of the experimental group. Since peer coaching programs are designed to increase instructional effectiveness, longitudinal studies of the effectiveness of peer coaching are recommended for future research.

The seminar courses used a writer's workshop model, with students forming peer response groups to help each other prepare preliminary and final drafts. The journal has provided graduate students with a way to demonstrate for a broader audience the issues of particular interest to them, their scholarly investigation of those issues,  and their practical application in their own careers. The graduate students felt that the effort they put into their research would be acknowledged and respected.

The students gathered artifacts such as early school papers and report cards, documented their recollections, and interviewed significant caretakers. Data from the autobiographies are discussed within the following categories: attitudes about reading development in school; young readers' strategies in school; teachers' strategies for reading instruction; beyond the basal; attitudes towards written language in school; handwriting in  school; beyond handwriting in school; home read alouds; reading before schooling; home reading during elementary school and during high school; home writing before schooling, during elementary school, during high school, and before college; oral language in the home; lacking enjoyment and lacking skills; enjoying reading; strategies readers use; enjoying writing; and barriers to writing. Analysis of the data indicates that not all preservice teachers loved reading and that they reported reading and writing for a wide range of reasons. Implications for the design of methods courses and for future research are discussed. (Contains 47 references.) (JDD)",

        "description":"The Department of Educational Foundations at Western Illinois University developed a model preservice curriculum to respond to the problem of preparing teachers who can influence their environment rather than be victims of it and who can effectively transmit that message to students. Entitled Empowerment through Cognitive and Social Management (ECOSOM), the program employs a cognitive frame-of-reference construct which involves the ability to monitor, regulate, evaluate, and modify the learning process. The core of the ECOSOM paradigm is the self-regulated learning model postulated by Reinhard Lindner and Bruce Harris (1992) consisting of epistemological beliefs, motivation, metacognition, learning strategies, contextual sensitivity, and environmental utilization/control. Project  ECOSOM is based on the belief that the self-regulated learning perspective in combination with an apprenticeship orientation makes for a potent approach to training future teachers. Project ECOSOM responds to the need for reflective practitioners who value critical thinking and self-regulated learning as &quot;habits of mind&quot; and commitment to the ideals of reflective thinking, assessment, and learning as an ongoing, life-long process. The curriculum relies upon course work, workshops, technological instruction, and participant action research experiences. Charts outlining dimensions of self-regulated learning and characteristics of self-regulated learners are appended. (Contains approximately 50 references.) (JDD)",

Results indicated a lack of basic knowledge of AIDS among the majority of respondents, with a mean score of 14 out of 21 points (67 percent). Several of the most frequently missed questions dealt with the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus. Data indicated no linear relationship between various teacher demographic characteristics (such as age, grade taught, gender, and school type) and knowledge of AIDS. The 19 teachers who reported knowing someone with AIDS produced mean test scores similar to those who reported not knowing someone with AIDS. Community setting also seemed to have no influence on test scores.  The study concludes that although more research is necessary, at the same time teachers need to be educated concerning AIDS.

Statistical data from the YRBS are provided in the following areas: (1) intentional and unintentional injuries (seat belt use, motorcycle and bicycle safety, motor vehicle safety, carrying of weapons, physical fighting, and suicide); (2) tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use; (3) sexual behaviors that result in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, other sexually transmitted diseases, and unintended pregnancy; (4) dietary excesses and imbalances; and (5) physical inactivity. SHES  data are provided on the topics of provision of HIV prevention education, training received by staff members that provide HIV prevention education, percentage of schools teaching HIV functional knowledge topics and skills by specific grade level, and barriers to implementing effective comprehensive health education and HIV prevention. The report concludes that Wyoming youth engage in behaviors that put them at risk for significant mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems extending from youth to adulthood, and that effective school-based health education programs are needed to replace these behaviors with healthy behaviors.

        "description":"This symposium addressed key findings of the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development-sponsored book &quot;Promoting the Health of Adolescents: New Directions for the Twenty-First Century.&quot; A panel of experts focused on science policy implications of critical issues in adolescent health promotion that have proven difficult to address such as the effects of poverty, adolescent sexuality, and violence. Included on the panel were experts from Canada and Mexico who provided an international perspective on adolescent health promotion. Following an introduction by Elena O. Nightingale, special advisor to the President, Carnegie Corporation of New York, the following chapters are presented: (1) &quot;Historical Perspective on Adolescent Health Promotion&quot;; (2) &quot;Health-Enhancing and Health  Compromising Behaviors during Adolescence&quot; (Delbert S. Elliott); (3) &quot;Poverty, Health, and Adolescent Health Promotion&quot; (William Julius Wilson); (4) &quot;Promoting Healthy Adolescent Sexuality&quot; (Herant Katchadourian); (5) &quot;Promoting Safety and Nonviolent Conflict Resolution in Adolescence&quot; (Mark L. Rosenberg); and (6) &quot;Cross-National Perspectives; Views of Adolescent Health Promotion from Canada and Mexico&quot; (Ivan B. Pless--Canadian Perspective, Anameli Monroy--Mexican Perspective). In his concluding remarks, David A. Hamburg, President, Carnegie Corporation of New York, states that most risky behavior is still tentative and exploratory. There is, therefore, an opportunity for preventive interventions, provided that individual development, the social context of development, and the biological  variability that makes different individuals more or less vulnerable to different kinds of environmental insults are understood. Research can offer important insights for the construction of more rational preventive interventions. (LL)",

        "description":"For mentoring to remain as one viable component of quality teacher induction, the roles of mentors, the benefits of mentoring and the obstacles to effective mentoring must be scrutinized and questions about the overall value of mentoring must be addressed. In the study discussed in this paper, 24 teachers who served as mentors for beginning teachers were asked, in a first phase, to describe and categorize their ideas of the mentor role, and benefits of and obstacles to effective mentoring. The 687 ideas that they named were collapsed into 55 elements representing those ideas. The same teachers were then asked to give weighted rank to the 55 elements. In general, the study supported the perspectives of most practicing mentors. Mentor roles were represented as providing emotional  support, information about overt matters such as formal policies, and covert matters such as the school culture, and general assistance with teaching skills and classroom management. Mentoring was viewed as especially beneficial for the beginning teacher, but also for the mentors; and since few obstacles to mentoring had been encountered, subjects approached this area from a hypothetical point of view. Nine tables display additional information. (LL)",

        "description":"This paper considers leadership within colleges and universities toward creation of a continuum of professional development. Changes in the headship of schools/colleges/departments of education (SCDE) among member institutions of the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education were studied, revealing that the mean &quot;time in position&quot; for SCDE heads is about 4.5 years, with a trend toward shorter periods of time. A survey of 255 individuals who left a position as SCDE head between 1983 and 1992 was then conducted, to gather information regarding the length of time it takes to develop, implement, and institutionalize a major professional development change. Respondents estimated that the average time required was 3.8 years, with a range from 0.5 to 10 years. About 84  percent of respondents stated that the length of time he/she served as head allowed enough time for one or more major programmatic changes. After leaving the headship, the greatest number of former deans/chairs accepted lower-level administrative positions or teaching/research positions at the same institution. The most frequent reason for leaving the headship was &quot;frustration/burnout.&quot; The study concluded that continued shortening of the &quot;time in position&quot; of deans/chairs could eventually cause an inability to accomplish meaningful change.

Principals of the 24 diocesan secondary schools were allowed to choose whether their school would participate in the systemwide program, and all chose to do so. Teachers selected a pupil free staff development day to hold the large-scale professional development program. The program was designed to reinforce the notion of the Key Learning Area (KLA) as the basis for curriculum organization. Twelve different programs were conducted, for approximately, 1,250 teachers. Each program was planned and implemented by school-based personnel, with the Catholic Education  Office providing general direction, necessary resources, and overall coordination. The program was characterized by two factors identified by M. Fullan as important in realizing curriculum change--a strong sense of determination to realize the KLA objectives, and well-developed support frameworks in the areas of curriculum and professional development. Evaluation by organizers, participants, and principals indicated that the professional development program was a success. (JDD)",

The portfolio assessment was designed as an &quot;end of major&quot; assessment with three goals: provide a continuous assessment of the program of studies, determine the quality of program graduates, and serve as a resource for school district personnel in recruitment and hiring. It is believed that effective assessment should include procedures which reflect the student's ability to demonstrate the critical teaching skills of assessment and program development, implementation, and evaluation. Students are introduced to the portfolio assessment process at an orientation meeting, and they meet with their academic advisors at least once each quarter  to review the portfolio and receive help with difficulties. A checklist is provided to structure the communication process between the student and advisor concerning portfolio development. Minimum requirements for the portfolio include: research on the student's practicum population and eligibility criteria of all special education students; a comprehensive case study on one student; behavioral studies; an assessment process; an instructional plan; materials modification plan; individualized education program; transition plan; and parent-community involvement plan. Portfolio assessment recommendations are offered based on this university's experience. (Contains approximately 50 references.) (JDD)",

        "description":"Arguments for replacing standardized multiple choice tests with performance assessment that encourages teachers to devote more attention to higher order skills, and thus results in increased student achievement, are based on three assumptions: (1) the teaching profession, key decision makers, and parents will accept performance assessment measures as valid indicators of student achievement; (2) the use of performance assessment for accountability purposes will influence teachers to place more emphasis in their teaching on content that has significance for real-world tasks; and (3) the technical problems associated with developing performance assessments are solvable and the cost (in time and money) of this form of testing can be sustained. This paper examines evidence for the  soundness of the three assumptions. The paper concludes that these assumptions may overlook critical facts about how professionals and parents are likely to respond to the introduction of performance assessment measures in schools, and suggests that a number of obstacles are likely to be encountered in the process of reforming assessment practices in schools.

This criticism is based on the following points: (1) terms such as &quot;modernism&quot; and &quot;postmodernism&quot; are used without adequate definitions; (2) the book inadequately makes the case that knowledge comes from within the knower; (3) the book uses Popperian evolutionary epistemology, which does not fully support its position concerning knowledge from within; (4) the book also poorly supports its claims that learning occurs better without purposes and that transmission of knowledge from teacher to student is immoral and prevents further growth; (5) in the book's discussion of transactions from teachers to students, it confuses  authoritarian with authoritative transactions; (6) the book asserts that children are born with &quot;understandings,&quot; yet it states that without language, understanding cannot exist; (7) the book insufficiently anticipates problems in dealing with students' individual needs and interests in large, diverse classrooms; and (8) the book argues that individuals can know from within and can do so without any justification, which rejects a justificatory theory of rationality. The commentary agrees with Perkinson that students should not merely be filled up with facts, that knowledge has no ultimate justification, and that education should be tailored to the individual.

Teachers' student learning goals and the specific type of study skills they reported students to be deficient in were categorized. Test and practice items were rated on level of processing (whether the item required basic knowledge, integration, or application) and item format (recognition or recall). Overall, teachers wanted their students to develop  a general interest in and understanding of the subject area and its real world applications. They also wanted their students to develop higher-order study skills by interpreting information, managing their time and effort, and thinking critically. But their assessment practices did not support these goals. On average, over half of both test and practice items required only basic knowledge, while almost none required application.

The internship program includes Analysis of Teaching for Professional Development (2 credit hours), Professional Internship in Teaching (12 credit hours), Clinical Studies (4 credit hours), 6 credit hours in appropriate teaching methods, and 12 credit hours in an approved concentration. Forty principals directly involved with the supervision of interns who completed the University of Tennessee, Knoxville fifth-year teacher preparation/internship program were surveyed, and eight were interviewed. Results revealed  general support for the internship program. Principals gave high ratings to statements about interns developing effective professional relationships with mentoring teachers, the year-long time frame, and interns' exposure to extracurricular activities. Principals gave low ratings to interns' pursuance of a master's degree, the content area skill of interns compared to student teachers, and intern performance on the Tennessee Instructional Model compared to student teachers. Maturity and confidence of interns were perceived as program strengths. The study concluded that a fifth-year teacher preparation/internship program compared favorably with fourth-year student teaching programs. (Contains 15 references.) (JDD)",

The course included an examination of the context within which the end product is based. The techniques of problem based learning (PBL) were used to look at design as a problem solving activity for engineers. This report provides the outline for an engineering course that includes communication skills as a deliberate part of the design and places a strong emphasis on process and interaction. The style of the course delivery means, in practice, fewer  lectures, more tutorials, and the use of cross cultural models to modify activities that would be appropriate for the group. Awareness of the specific culture and language of the engineering profession was given increasing attention throughout the course. Course orientation transfers the initiative from the lecturer to the student and immerses students in an environment that challenges them to think and to take responsibility for identifying and learning skills.

        "description":"Historically, the study of measurement and evaluation has not been highly valued by elementary education majors. In fact, research suggests that only a minority of teachers show evidence of adequate preparation in these areas. To motivate students to have more interest in the subject, this study examined the contents of a tests and measurements course and its relevance to the needs of elementary school teachers. A survey instrument was developed and each of 42 students in the Spring 1992 class was required to contact 3 elementary school teachers to provide responses. These practitioners were asked to determine which information, from a provided list, was pertinent to the course's content. For content validity, information was taken from the course text Tuckman's &quot;Testing for  Teachers&quot; second edition (1988). Students were promised that any content claimed to be unnecessary would be dropped from the class curriculum. The main body of this document provides the results of 123 responses to the survey instrument distributed by grade levels. Most of the teachers surveyed were from grades 1-5. Results indicate that the vast majority of subject matter included in the Tuckman text appears to be needed by practitioners; no additional content was suggested, and appropriate use of existing material was recommended. A copy of the Diagnostic and Evaluative Procedures in Education Survey is appended. (LL)",

        "description":"The study discussed in this paper examined changes which occurred during the student teaching experience of elementary education majors regarding their ability to teach selected critical thinking skills. Data were obtained from student teachers (N=45) immediately before and after their student teaching experience. Self-confidence was measured by scoring the Mississippi State University Survey of Confidence in Teaching Reading (SCTR) piloted exclusively for this investigation. The SCTR contained five clusters of reading skills typically taught by classroom teachers in elementary schools. A critical thinking skills cluster contained 13 items on which students were asked to rate their perceived confidence or ability to actually conduct selected assessment activities with children in  classrooms. Findings indicated that following the student teaching experience subjects exhibited significantly more confidence in their ability to conduct reading activities that involved critical thinking skills. Consistent with the literature, this study concludes that a powerful impact derives from the student teaching experience. A summary of T-Test Comparisons between pre- and poststudent teachers on critical thinking skills is provided in tabular form. (LL)",

Marymount University (Virginia) developed the program and is responsible for its implementation. Upon successful completion of admissions requirements, candidates who have the appropriate undergraduate degree are eligible to enter a graduate program in one of two areas--early childhood/elementary education (39 credits) or secondary education (36 credits). Both programs provide the opportunity to earn Master of Education degrees and to qualify for teacher certification. This publication is divided into four chapters presenting the program's  purpose, requirements and components, process, and background information on five military people that are part of the program. Appendices provide a description of educational competencies to be demonstrated by students; descriptions of courses required for both the early childhood/elementary and secondary programs; procedures for faculty; an academic needs assessment; advertisements and introductory materials; an example of previous course offerings; and miscellaneous informational details.

        "description":"To study the perceived needs of the rural science teacher a random sampling of rural and non-rural Tennessee teachers (200) responded to a survey which addressed several areas of concern. This paper deals only with questions concerning microcomputer use--the availability of computers for teachers' use, frequency of student computer use, frequency of teacher computer use, and primary purposes for using the computer. Data analysis revealed that computers have had little impact on science education in Tennessee's secondary schools and are being used to only a limited degree; in a large percentage of schools, computers are not being used at all. There did not appear to be any inequities in computer availability between rural and non-rural schools, however, science teachers appeared  to be uneasy about fitting computers into their daily routines. In light of the findings in this research, two recommendations are made: the study should be expanded to include findings of the other participating states, and combining of data across the states would result in a large enough pool of computer teachers for effective comparison with noncomputer teachers. It is suggested that science teachers be made aware that computers have the potential to be tools for instruction, providing ways for students to increase problem-solving skills and engage in higher-order learning. Six statistical tables are included. (LL)",

The purpose of this study was to identify current attitudes of preservice teachers toward children from different family structures. Student teachers (N=85) were asked to identify their perceptions of children in 4 family structures: (1) an intact family; (2) a divorced-single parent; (3) a never-married single parent; and (4) a divorced, gay parent family. It was hypothesized that the intact family and the divorced family would be perceived more positively than the less common family structures. The student teachers completed a questionnaire comprised of vignettes followed by 30  adjectives--half positive and half negative. Findings indicated that perception of the stigma of divorce on children has lessened; divorced, single-parent families had the most positive characteristics; the child seen most consistently in a negative light was from a never-married family; and surprisingly, the child in a gay household was described more positively overall than the child in an intact family. The limited nature of the sample, primarily rural and possibly naive concerning societal changes in family structure, is emphasized. (Contains 19 references.) (LL)",

        "description":"This paper reports on a study conducted to examine a shift in responsibility for learning to the students in an advanced placement American history class. Specifically, the extent to which students (N=9) were analytic in their thinking and writing and self-directed in their work was investigated. Naturalistic inquiry and comparative analysis were used to identify emerging themes among the data collected through interviews with the students and the teacher, classroom observation, analysis of student papers, and a student questionnaire. A rubric for analysis, including student background, interpretation of the meaning of analytic skills, perspective towards history, and the meaning of self-directed learning, provided a framework for the creation of case studies, four of which are  presented in the text. Regarding student analytic skills, more evidence of evaluation and interpretation was found in student writing, and more justifying orally was discovered in student interaction. Use of content seemed to be the least emphasized. All nine students perceived student directed learning (SDL) as doing and completing assignments on their own, not as an intellectual growth process, i.e., using their minds well by developing an internalized, historically grounded perspective. Only one student's work approximated the criteria for SDL; the others had attitudes grounded in their backgrounds, not perspectives grounded in American history. Appendixes provide a class survey for classroom restructuring, rubric for analysis of five remaining students, and an interview excerpt.  (Contains 30 references.) (LL)",

Subjects were students who applied for an internship placement during their senior year, were admitted to the program, but failed to enroll. A comparison was made between internship placement requests and actual internship  enrollment over a 3-year period. An attempt was made to speak to each student by telephone. It was discovered that a total of 594 graduates were eligible to enroll during this period, but 58 or 9.8 percent of students failed to matriculate. Reasons given for student failure to matriculate into the fifth year included relocation of residence, financial problems, or enrollment in graduate school. (LL)",

Kentucky recognizes the significance of diversity and includes it in its valued learners outcome. Multicultural education is therefore addressed in a majority of education courses, and embedded in many required courses. A sample consisting of student teachers (N=115) was asked to write a comprehensive definition of multicultural education. A definition adopted by the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education was analyzed, levels of depth and sophistication were identified, and quality indicators were given a numeric  value. Data analysis supported the fact that multicultural education is addressed during preservice teacher education--65 percent of the students are aware of cultural differences compared to 19 percent who know nothing, and 10 percent have some understanding of diversity. While an adequate level of awareness exists, if this is considered in relation to the criteria suggested by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education, it must be concluded that this level of awareness is not sufficient. To prepare preservice teachers to function effectively in a multicultural society, current efforts need to be improved. (LL)",

The project referred to as the Partnership Schools Initiative teams local school campuses with regional education services and the TEA for a 3-5 year period. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the faculty and administrators of Bean Elementary School in Lubbock decided to experiment with a voluntary professional growth program designed to replace mandated teacher evaluations for most teachers. This program used peer coaching and collegial support teams (CSTs). Twelve CSTs of classroom and support teachers were organized. Each team member was required to develop a teacher  professional development contract, which included the teacher's goals for professional growth. At the end of the 1992-93 school year, a formal evaluation of each CST was conducted by the principal. Although the full import on student achievement is not yet known, the first year of using CSTs for professional growth was very successful as perceived by both teachers and administrators. Some selected references and resources used in planning and operating the program along with samples of teacher professional development contracts are provided. (LL)",

Student self-motivation improvement activities were employed over a 12-week implementation period. Strategies developed were all based on Total Quality Management (TQM) principles of empowerment that effectively transform the nature of student/teacher interactions so that they become more positive and less punitive and coercive in nature. Levels of success were measured by administering the Arlin-Hills Attitude Survey, an empirical measure of student motivational levels, to pre- and post-test target populations. In addition, a questionnaire was developed and  administered to pre- and post-intervention groups to ascertain differences in the target population's overall commitment to remaining in high school. The results indicated improved levels of student motivation for the target group when comparing their pretest and posttest. Additionally, it was concluded that students participating in this practicum project were more likely to remain in high school as a consequence of the TQM intervention.

The paper begins by describing gender equitable sports programs as ones in which either boys or girls would be pleased to accept as its own the program of the other. The digest then explains briefly the legal basis for gender equity in sport, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The main body of the digest presents a discussion of monitoring gender equity in middle and secondary school athletic programs. In sports programs, gender equity requires that equal athletic opportunities be provided for both genders and encompasses equivalence measures in the following areas: (1)  accommodating the athletic interests and abilities of females, the historically underrepresented sex (including the selection of sports and levels of competition); (2) equipment and supplies; (3) scheduling; (4) opportunity to receive coaching (and academic tutoring); (5) assignment and salary of coaches (and tutors); (6) travel and per diem allowances; (7) locker rooms, medical, and other facilities; (8) housing and dining facilities and services; and (9) publicity and promotion.

States throughout the country are actively pursuing systemic educational reform. The survey and interviews reveal that states approach the development of new or revised assessments in the following ways: (1) developing totally new assessments to accompany new goals; (2) reconfiguring or supplementing existing assessments; (3) revising traditional assessment instruments and raising standards; and (4) leaving assessment development to local school districts. The first  three approaches are highlighted in this discussion. It appears that there is not a single best model for state assessment and that innovation should be supported and encouraged. Assessment and reform efforts should foster the same goals, and teacher involvement is essential. Quick fixes will not be the answer. If states change assessment without changing instructional practices, there is little likelihood of improved student performance.

Overall, the average grade today is a &quot;B.&quot; Comparisons of schools in high-poverty areas and those in more affluent areas indicate that &quot;B&quot; students in high-poverty schools have about the same NELS:88 test scores as do students receiving &quot;D&quot; or lower in schools with the lowest concentrations of poor students. &quot;C&quot; students in the poorest schools had about the same test scores as failing  students in the most affluent schools. While NELS:88 scores are only one indicator, other indicators also show the need to improve the quality of education in schools, particularly in poverty areas. Parents need to ask how grades are determined, and whether the student is receiving an appropriately challenging education. (Contains 3 references.) (SLD)",

To measure intelligence, Wechsler believed one must measure the various aptitudes that contribute to the total behavior of the individual. The WISC-III has six verbal subtests and seven performance subtests. The verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) is obtained by adding the scaled scores of all the verbal subtests except Digit Span, and the performance IQ (PIQ) is derived from five of the performance subtests. The PIQ is not as good a predictor of school achievement as is the VIQ. Indexes derived from the WISC-III subtests include: (1) verbal comprehension; (2) perceptual organization; (3) freedom from distractibility; and (4) processing speed.  Subtest scatter and possible causes for significantly high and low subtest scores are explored and include reasons for differences between VIQ and PIQ. Factors that have been identified based on the WISC editions are listed, and ways in which subtest scores may suggest possible brain damage and emotional disturbance are reviewed.

These exercises are based on realistic situations that cadets might encounter as commissioned officers in the Coast Guard. Participants must make a series of decisions that are deliberately designed to require integration of knowledge and skills from different parts of the curriculum. An interactive computer format is used to make the exercise more interesting and flexible; this format also facilitates the collection of response data for later analysis and feedback. Initial testing with samples of 65 and 49 cadets was followed by a test with almost  an entire Academy class (282 cadets). Early results indicate that the exercise concept is beneficial to both students and faculty. Appendix 1 presents the Academy's core curriculum; Appendix 2 lists the desired outcomes of an Academy education; Appendix III provides the first exercise scenario administered to freshmen cadets at the beginning of their first term.

Emphasis is placed on the cadets' academic achievements, their military performance, and their resignation status to determine whether the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) preferences can be used to predict success in these areas. A brief description is included about the incorporation of the MBTI into the Academy culture, with an attempt to build on the description of applicability to the United States Naval Academy made by Rousch (1989). It is hypothesized that individuals with Introversion (I), Intuition (N), Thinking (T), and Judgment (J) MBTI preferences are more suitable to academic and military success at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy than are  individuals with other combinations of type preferences, and that low academic success at the Academy will adversely affect a cadet's military performance, which in turn could lead to resignation. The results of this study do indicate significant correlations among personality preferences, academic success, and military performance, as well as significant correlations between academic success, successful military performance, and persistence at the Academy.

In study 1, 37 second- and third-year law students nearing the end of a course on negotiation participated as experts, while 248 high school students served as novices in negotiation. Results support the construct validity of the measure, clearly distinguishing between experts and novices. In study 2, 51 high school students randomly assigned to groups performed the simulation as teams. As expected, three-person teams performed somewhat better than two-person teams, but there were no  significant effects of group size. Results indicate that a collaborative environment is feasible. Both studies also demonstrate that cognitive biases are associated with lower negotiation performance, and that experts exhibit more self-regulation than novices.

        "description":"Items of Altemeyer's 1986 version of the &quot;Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale&quot; (RWA Scale) were analyzed as philosophical propositions in an effort to establish each item's suggestive connotation and denotation. The guiding principle of the analysis was the way in which the statements reflected authoritarianism's defining characteristics of conventionalism, aggression and submission, and by implication, what it may mean, in each case, to harbor authoritarian principles. The analysis was undertaken largely in response to concerns expressed by several subjects who had completed the RWA Scale, as to how anyone could agree in any way with protrait items. Such concerns were often a two-part expression: bewilderment over what must be going on in the heads of authoritarians, and the  follow-up hypothesis that they must not know to what they are assenting when agreeing to authoritarian propositions. This project is an effort to get at just what it is that authoritarianism connotes. As to whether authoritarian personalities are conscious of the philosophical implications of their beliefs is a matter for further research. Appendix 1 lists components of authoritarianism, and appendix 2 presents a definition. (Contains 13 references.) (Author)",

        "description":"The 1992-93 school year was the second year of the implementation of the Vermont assessment program. Evaluation of the 1991-92 year yielded mixed results, with some evidence that the assessment program was having a strong impact on instruction, but other indications that the reliability of the portfolio scoring in both writing and mathematics was so low that most of the planned uses of the data were abandoned. This interim report provides initial results of the 1992-93 school year evaluation. It discusses only the quality of the assessment data. In this year, simple total scores for each portfolio showed moderately high reliability of scoring for mathematics, particularly in the eighth grade. In contrast, the reliability of the writing portfolio did not improve substantially. The  state would like to report scores for supervisory unions, local districts, or schools, but the evaluation finds that supervisory union scores are not especially informative because they show little variation and have large margins for error. The use of portfolios contributed little to these problems, which appear to result from the number of students scored and the choice of supervisory unions as the reporting unit. Four figures and four tables present study data. (SLD)",

Effective self-regulation requires that students have goals and the motivation to attain them, and maintain a sense of self-efficacy for learning and performing well. A social cognitive view of self-regulation is presented that highlights the roles of goals, progress feedback, and self-efficacy. Research is described in which elementary school children were taught to use a paragraph writing strategy and received either a process (learning) goal, a product (performance) goal, or a general goal. Some process goal students also received goal progress feedback that linked their performances to use of the writing  strategy. Providing a process goal with progress feedback led to the highest levels of self-efficacy, strategy use, and writing skill. Suggestions for fostering students' motivation during classroom writing instruction are provided. (Contains 25 references.) (Author)",

        "description":"Self-regulation refers to the process whereby students activate and sustain cognitions, behaviors, and affects, which are systematically oriented toward attainment of goals. Effective self-regulation requires that students have goals and the motivation to attain them, and make attributions (beliefs about the causes of outcomes) that enhance motivation. A social cognitive view is presented in which attributions influence self-regulation largely through their effects on self-efficacy, or personal beliefs about one's capabilities to learn or perform skills at designated levels. Attributions enter into self-regulation when students compare and evaluate their performances against their goals. Research substantiates the idea that self-regulation depends on students forming attributions  that sustain learning efforts and promote self-efficacy. Research is reviewed on the self-regulatory role of attributional feedback that links students' outcomes with one or more attributions, and on correlational and causal relations among attributions, self-efficacy, and achievement outcomes. Suggestions for future research are provided. (Contains 35 references.) (Author)",

        "description":"The purposes of the present paper are to address the historical development of statistical significance testing and to briefly examine contemporary practices regarding such testing in the light of these historical origins. Precursors leading to the advent of statistical significance testing are examined as are more recent controversies surrounding the issue. As the etiology of current practice is explored, it will become more apparent whether current practices evolved from deliberative judgment or merely developed from happenstance that has become reified in routine. Examination of the history of analysis suggests that the development of statistical significance testing has indeed involved a degree of deliberative judgment. It may be that the time for significance testing came  and went, but there is no doubt that significance testing served as an important catalyst for the growth of science in the 20th century.

The critical difference between the two experimental programs was that one, Feuerstein's Instrumental Enrichment (IE) method was taught out of curricular content, while the other, Strategies Program for Effective Learning/Thinking (SPELT), was taught directly within curricular content. The effectiveness of these two programs was compared with traditional instruction at grades 4 and 7 for 900 gifted, learning disabled, and normally achieving students. Results indicate that cognitive education was effective in improving student thinking, especially for the grade-4 learning disabled students, and to a  lesser extent for the gifted students, in reading comprehension and comprehension monitoring. The SPELT program tended to produce more positive changes than did the IE program, and SPELT was better received by teachers, parents, and administrators, although both programs were favorably received.

It is designed to help at-risk students by coordinating services between the community and the school, with the goal of keeping students in school and helping them gain skills that lead to employment, further education, and a healthy life-style. From its inception, the program has contained a strong assessment and evaluation component, but the database was not fully computerized until 1991-92. This advance has made the SBYSP year-end evaluation and monitoring much easier. How the databases were developed, from the construction of survey instruments through the assessment of student outcomes, is described. Information was obtained from  student and customer satisfaction surveys, parent surveys, academic and attendance records, telephone interviews with graduates, four case studies, and focus groups at the project schools. Suggestions are given for improving the usefulness of the data collected and the assessment of program impact. Seven tables and three figures present study findings.

The overall grade-4 results indicate that the curriculum was well covered. Students seem to have learned well, particularly in &quot;hands-on&quot; areas, and teachers appear to have been adequately trained. The comparison of grade-5 current  results with those from 1982 showed a high degree of similarity, but the mean scores for grade-10 were generally lower in 1991.

It explores the apparent effects of two reporting approaches, the anchor-point method used by the Educational Testing Service and the National Center for Education Statistics since 1984 and the achievement-level (performance standards) method instituted in 1990 by the National Assessment Governing Board. In presenting anchor points and achievement levels the majority of writers incorrectly portrayed performance as discontinuous and ignored the continuum of success and failure. P-values, when provided, were frequently misinterpreted. Only a minority of articles mentioned the judgmental nature  of the levels. Use of these metrics appeared to help the press by providing quotable and seemingly clear expressions of test results, but many articles were simplistic or incorrect, and important information often went unreported. Neither method as implemented for the 1990 results was adequate. Some suggestions are made for improved reporting. Two tables present details about the methods. (Contains 40 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The present paper suggests that multivariate methods ought to be used more frequently in behavioral research and explores the potential consequences of failing to use multivariate methods when these methods are appropriate. The paper explores in detail two reasons why multivariate methods are usually vital. The first is that they limit the inflation of Type I error rates, and the second is that multivariate methods best honor the reality to which the researcher is purportedly trying to generalize. Three general analytic premises provide a framework for the discussion: (1) all statistical analyses are correlational; (2) the OVA (analysis of variance and covariance) analyses do not in and of themselves yield the capacity to make causal inferences; and (3) statistical significance  tests do not evaluate the probability (p) that results will replicate. Eleven tables illustrate some analyses. (Contains 51 references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"One potential approach to the authentic assessment of what students know and can do in science is concept mapping. A concept map is a graph consisting of nodes representing concepts and labeled lines denoting the relation between a pair of nodes (concepts). The external concept map constructed by the student is interpreted as representing important aspects of the organization of concepts in that student's memory (cognitive structure). This review of the literature found that concept mapping techniques varied widely, with no less than 128 possible variations identified. Methods for scoring maps varied almost as widely. The review leads to the conclusion that an integrative, working cognitive theory is needed to begin to limit this variation for assessment purposes and to serve as  a basis for psychometric studies of the reliability (generalizability) and construct validity of concept maps. Other issues arising from large-scale use of mapping techniques are explored, including the importance of students' familiarity with and skills in using concept maps and the possible negative impact of teachers teaching to the assessment, thus requiring students to memorize concept maps provided by textbooks or themselves. Ten figures and two tables present review findings. (Contains 41 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Average and above average 16-, 17-, and 18-year-olds served as comparison groups. Students were given three algebra problems with solutions, followed by two target problems to be solved without a solution procedure. In Condition 1, none of the initial problems were related to either target, but in Condition 2, two of the initial problems were related to the target in deep structure or in surface structure. Metacognition was explored through analyses of videotaped think-aloud protocols and two standardized measures, the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory and the Action-Control Scale. No  transfer effect was found for the highly gifted, but there was a significant effect for the gifted. Neither of the two high school groups showed positive transfer. Protocol analysis shows that high metacognitive control is associated with greater positive transfer, higher accuracy, and overall higher ability. Some negative transfer effects are discussed. Results from the standardized measures indicate that failure to recover from negative transfer may be related to effects of anxiety on metacognitive control (Contains 2 tables and 23 references.)

In this study, the criteria are reviewed. An instrument to assess the Southern Association criteria was developed based on input from the association's institutional effectiveness committee. The instrument was mailed to 2,300 college alumni, and 1,019 were returned. A survey of student assessment of the criteria was distributed to 1,100 college students, and 1,047 were completed. The surveys to assess the criteria were validated from these samples. Factorial validity of both surveys was evaluated with the Statistical Analysis System principal components program. Findings overall suggest  that three second-order factors represent the alumni instrument, and six second-order factors represent the student survey. The developed instrument items and the subsequent psychometric analyses do provide a basic instrument for assessing the SACS criteria. Eight tables present rotated pattern coefficients. Five appendixes contain both surveys, responses to each, and a list of the criteria. (Contains 29 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Commonality analysis is an attempt to understand the relative predictive power of regressor variables, both individually and in combination. Despite their utility, these methods have not been used with great frequency, perhaps because these methods are not fully automated in commonly used statistical packages. This paper explores the applications of commonality analyses by reanalyzing data from a study of the relationships among  anger and stress in predicting depression among 247 undergraduate students. This data set is employed as a heuristic to make the discussion more accessible. In addition, a Statistical Analysis System (SAS) computer program procedure for obtaining all possible R superscript 2 values is discussed as an efficient method of implementing the required analyses.

This paper is a generalizability study of the American College Testing Program (ACT) Achievement Program Mathematics Test (AAP), with the content areas of the table of specifications representing multiple dependent variables. The results are presented with respect to variance and covariance components and to estimates of error variance. Also discussed are alternative weightings of the content categories. The pattern of mean difficulty of the four content areas is the same for 1989 and 1990 data. It appears that the specifications for the mathematics examination are resulting in fairly consistent levels of difficulty at both the test and content strata  levels, although the form-level standard deviations for trigonometry are generally smaller than the standard deviations of the other content areas. In general, examination of the variance components leads to the conclusion that universe scores, item effects, and residuals make fairly consistent form-to-form contributions to the variability of scores in the content areas with relatively large proportions of the test's items.

Ideally, a learning system would adapt its commitments to the demands of a particular learning situation, rather than relying on fixed commitments that impose tradeoffs between the efficiency and utility of a learning technique. This article presents an extension of the COMPOSER learning approach that dynamically adjusts its learning behavior based on the resources available for learning. COMPOSER is a speed-up learning technique that provides a statistical approach to the utility problem. The system identifies a sequence of transformations that, with high probability, increase the Type I utility of an initial planning system. The approach breaks the  task into a learning phase and a utilization phase. This extension to COMPOSER adopts a rational policy that dynamically balances the trade-off between efficiency and utility. Implications for learning systems are discussed. (Contains 24 references.)

        "description":"This annual publication is designed to show North Carolina's rank among the states on a wide variety of educational and related statistics. This information may be useful for a number of planning and evaluation purposes. Data are presented in the following areas: (1) population; (2) enrollment and attendance; (3) faculty; (4) general financial resources; (5) governmental revenue; (6) school revenue; (7) governmental expenditures and debt; (8) school expenditures; and (9) miscellaneous. Data in each area are followed by tables of educational trends in North Carolina. Over 100 statistics related to public education in North Carolina are presented. In 1991, the school-age population was 17.2% of the total state population, with over 1.1 million children in elementary and secondary  schools served by over 75,000 instructional personnel. Thirty-five states pay a higher average annual salary to teachers, and 34 states have a higher per capita personal income. Thirteen charts present these and other statistics. (SLD)",

The present paper reviews one very popular multivariate analytic method that explicitly invokes weighting to optimize one criterion: the analytic method that researchers have come to call predictive discriminant analysis (Huberty and Barton, 1989; Huberty and Wisenbaker, 1992). Predictive discriminant analysis (PDA) is differentiated from descriptive discriminant analysis (DDA) (Dolenz, 1993) by a focus on predicting membership in intact groups. The paper is intended as a  primer introducing researchers to the distinction between PDA and DDA and explaining analytic issues related to the PDA application (Van Epps, 1987). For example, adding predictors can actually result in worse prediction in PDA, though in no other analytic methods can adding predictors result in worse effects. Methods for evaluating predictor variable importance using leave-one-out (L-O-O) strategies are also explored. Included are two tables and one figure. (Contains 17 references.) (Author/SLD)",

MBTI Form G and a self-descriptive adjectival checklist, the &quot;Personal Preferences Self-Description Questionnaire&quot; (PPSDQ), were administered to 191 college students. The four dimensions of personality measured by the MBTI are: Extraversion-Introversion; Sensing-iNtuiton; Thinking-Feeling; and finally, Judging-Perceiving. The purpose of our exploratory study was to evaluate whether the adjectival self-description checklist may provide a viable method of quickly obtaining initial type information. Data were analyzed by computing classical test theory reliability statistics and principal components analyses. Results are generally favorable regarding at least three of the four  constructs presumed to be measured by the PPSDQ. Additional items must be formulated to tap the fourth dimension (Judging-Perceiving). Six tables and one figure are included. (Contains 17 references.) (Author/SLD)",

First, the statement &quot;the test is reliable&quot; should be recognized as being inappropriate, and professional standards and editorial guidelines should make this clear. Second, an important implication of the realization that reliability inures to data, rather than tests, is that reliability should generally be explored whenever data are collected.

The number of concepts used and the number of detail concepts in the explanation protocols showed an inverted U-shaped relationship with level of expertise, whereas the experts' protocols matched better with canonical explanations of the cases. Constraining the processing time did not affect diagnostic accuracy but did affect the elaborateness of the explanations.

No differences were found between intentional and incidental recall instructions or between cases with numerical and interpreted lab data. Diagnostic accuracy increased with the level of expertise.

Most researchers who use multivariate methods take for granted the invariance property of linear regression, and they can now feel the same assurance about principal components. It is not likely that the researcher would ever need to compute the renormalization proposed. The adjustment is hypothetical, but it demonstrates that the choice of units is inconsequential.

The discussion is based on the educational systems of the United Kingdom but is applicable to assessment in other countries. Quality in assessment is seen as the provision of information of the highest validity and optimum reliability suited to a particular purpose and context. Moderation procedures fall broadly into those concerned with adjustment of the outcome of the assessment to improve fairness (quality control) and those concerned with arriving at fair assessments (quality assurance). Approaches to quality control are: (1) the use of reference or scaling tests for statistical  moderation; (2) the inspection of samples by post (e.g., sending a sample of work to an outside organization for an award); (3) the inspection by visiting moderators; (4) external examination; (5) teacher-requested moderation; and (6) group and consensus moderation of internal assessment. Approaches to quality assurance, which are usually made before the assessment, include definition of criteria, providing examples, approving entities carrying out assessment, visits of moderators, and group moderation. The quality of teacher assessments can be enhanced through moderation procedures that support professional development. (Contains 18 references.) (SLD)",

Results indicate that: (1) dyads demonstrated improved learning at the encoding (acquisition) stage of processing, (2) the quality of recall was similar although pairs recalled more propositions, and (3) dyads remembered more micro propositions, but not  more macro propositions.

The present study attempts to examine the effects of context-specific variables through analysis of the generalizability of tutor behavior and the relationship between organizational background and tutoring. Subjects were 427 members of the academic staff of a Dutch medical school. Data were gathered about 2,299 tutorials over 8 consecutive years, with staff members guiding approximately 2 to 4 tutorials each year. Two studies were conducted, one to determine the stability of tutor behavior across different discussion groups; the other to explore influences on tutoring of  departmental background. Results of the first study indicate that stability and generalizability of tutor behavior is low over multiple time points. Correlations between two consecutive tutorials were approximately 0.20. The second study shows that tutor behavior is related to departmental background. It is concluded that what a tutor does in a discussion group depends on context-specific characteristics and on organizational background, both features that should be considered in future research. Four tables are included. (Contains 17 references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"An empirical approach is adopted in this paper to explore a possible model for prediction of students' science achievement in China and the United States. Construction of the model is based on the ninth-grade data base from Phase 2 of the Second International Education Association Science Study (SISS) in the United States and the SISS Extension Study (SES) in Hubei province in China. The common independent variables of science achievement are classified into gender, attitude, home background, classroom experience, and personal effort, according to the distinction between visible and latent characteristics and scree plots from principal-components analysis. Latent factors are represented by the first principal components in each of the four latent categories of student attitudes,  home backgrounds, classroom experience, and personal effort. Predictors of the model are constructed by polynomials of the visible and latent factors and their interactions in a multivariate Taylor series. Significant predictors at the alpha=0.05 level are selected through a backward elimination procedure in the Statistical Analysis System. The structure of the four latent factors and the model complexity have been compared between the two countries in terms of their educational, political, social, and cultural contexts. Eight tables and two figures are included. (Contains 45 references.) (Author/SLD)",

The qualitative method of naturalistic inquiry, specifically a descriptive case study approach, was selected to identify common perceptions of the planning process. Data sources included semistructured interviews with campus personnel and a review of previous plans. Analysis found six major themes related to the strategic planning process: (1) method; (2) comprehension; (3) format; (4) influence; (5) feedback; and (6) results. After considering these themes, recommendations were made for  revising the strategic plan and renaming the annual campus operational plan. Revisions to the annual operational planning procedure were suggested, along with staff and faculty development in the areas of strategic and operational planning and further evaluation of the planning process.

The purpose of this study was to develop and pilot test a readability index for evaluating photographic illustrations in instructional materials. The index uses an interdisciplinary battery of methods adapted from the fields of linguistics, reading, and cognitive psychology to assess the level of visual information processing for viewers in both initial perception and prolonged encoding phases. The Picture Readability Index investigates both stages in the perception of photographs according to the comparison of affective and cognitive domain classifications on a nomograph format. Visual semiotic analysis is also used to investigate ways in which pictorial  elements group to form functional ensembles or gestalts in the first eye centrations. An expert or adoption panel was used to improve the instrument during development. The present format is considered too extensive to use with large populations and in applications with limited time, even though the expert panel suggests that most of the elements included are important. Length could be made more manageable if all components were shortened. (Contains 20 references.) (Author/SLD)",

The sample was composed of 786 current and former teachers identified in 1986 through the Teaching Supplement Questionnaire of the fifth follow-up of the National Longitudinal Study of 1972. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics and survival analysis. Data analysis showed that many of the beginning teachers left teaching in the early years of their careers. Science and English teachers were most likely to leave. Teachers who had a master's degree or who had graduated from 5-year teacher education programs tended to stay longer; those with higher  beginning salaries tended to stay longer than those with lower salaries; and private school teachers were more likely to leave than public school teachers. Elementary school teachers were more likely to stay than secondary school teachers, and teachers who were more satisfied with teaching stayed in teaching longer than those who were less satisfied. Policy implications for teacher supply and teacher education and recommendations for further research are suggested. Three tables and 14 figures are included. (Contains 46 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Student comment forms were designed to enable the student to identify problems with the test material or to explain or justify an answer. Results from seven classes indicate that from 11% to 39% of students actually write comments, and that student comments have been widely scattered across the potential domain. The introduction of the comment sheet has therefore not produced a burdensome number of student remarks. Many comments have little value to instructors and simply reflect personal misperceptions. Although the bulk of the  comments do not offer major insights, the introduction of the comment sheet has been beneficial to the college's program. Students and testing staff are given greater protection against test-content errors and students near the critical standard have additional opportunity to defend their work and demonstrate competence. Appendix A gives comment-sheet samples, and Appendix B contains a student questionnaire. (Contains 7 references.) (SLD)",

Nine low-achieving and 21 high-achieving fourth-year students and 10 low-achieving and 14 high-achieving fifth-year students diagnosed two clinical cases from written descriptions. Students were retested the following year. Analyses suggest that the increased expertise associated with advanced study that had been found in earlier studies are not so much induced by differences in factual knowledge, but rather by qualitative changes in the knowledge base, probably as a result of practical experience. Achievement level appears to have no effect on the  structure measures investigated in this study. There is no indication that high and low achievers develop differently or at a different pace. Accuracy of diagnosis and explanations given by students tend to correlate with achievement level, but effects are less strong than those of experience.

In 1981, Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) replaced Title I. Some Federal funding requirements were modified, but the program functions serving poor children remained essentially intact. Three quarters of all elementary schools, nearly half of middle and junior high schools, and one quarter of high schools are involved. The history and background of compensatory education are reviewed, emphasizing the diverse nature of Chapter 1 programs. In spite of this diversity, most emphasis has been on basic skills and  small-group instruction, with the general approaches being pull-out, add-on, in-class, and replacement programs. A number of studies of Chapter 1 effectiveness and outcomes are reviewed. The most important new trends in compensatory education have been defined by the Hawkins Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988, which spearheaded a shift from fiscal accountability to educational accountability. Its provisions incorporate much of what has been learned about closing educational gaps for the disadvantaged. (Contains 26 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"Educational reform efforts to date in the United States have not been germane or responsive to the social problems of African American children. The reform efforts advanced to date have only been exercises in tinkering around the educational edges. Our educational focus, the origin of which is outlined, must shift in at least two major ways. First, we must turn from preoccupation with talent assessment and its trappings to a commitment to talent development. Second, we must as a nation move away from an obsession with social homogenization and social control to a system based on racial and cultural diversity. This paper discusses the traditional assumptions for psychological and pedagogical processes that underlie the present focus on talent assessment and compares them with  alternative assumptions that underlie a focus on talent development. A second section makes a case for deep cultural structure and the incorporation of Afrocultural ethos into the pedagogical process at the deepest levels of schooling. Overdetermination is proposed as an explanatory framework for the educational process and a structural guide for reform. A table lists implications of cultural deep structure analyses.

Other data examined concern family composition by race and Hispanic origin for 1970, 1980, and 1990; the living arrangements of children under age 18 for 1991; the percentage of children under age 18 living in poverty; the median income of families with children by type of family, race, and ethnicity as  of the year 1990; the labor-force participation of women and men compared for the years 1950 through 1990; and the labor force status of married-couple families with children for the years 1975 through 1990. Based on the data, it appears that there are: (1) more married-couple families without children than married-couple families with children; (2) more families with stepchildren; (3) many more one-parent families with children, most of whom are poor; (4) more fathers raising their children alone; and (5) many more mothers in the labor force with, in 1992, more than 6 of 10 families with children having working mothers.

Participants generally agreed that students are not naturally at-risk, but that risk develops from the interaction of student characteristics and characteristics of the school environment. The conference was divided into three sessions: (1) areas of building on and integrating cultural diversity; (2) encouraging school effectiveness and student persistence; and (3) barriers and  incentives to implementing reforms. Summaries of papers on the following topics are included: cultural dissonance; historical experiences of Native Americans; differences and commonalities in the experiences of Hispanic/Latino youth; differences across ethnic groups in the way children learn; the other at-risk youth--the situation in rural America; reform in New York City; changing school environments to create advocates and mentors for students; barriers and incentives to implementing reforms (keynote); the Chicago School Reform Act; and the Philadelphia Schools Collaborative.

        "description":"The attitudes of parents toward a uniform student dress code were surveyed at a Chicago (Illinois) public school. Subjects were 15 Black parents (10 females and 5 males) and 15 Hispanic American parents (10 females and 5 males) who answered a questionnaire sent home with their children. The questionnaire examined attitudes toward designer clothing and peer pressure, uniform colors as a measure of safety, uniform dress as a financial savings, the impact of the dress code on self-esteem and academic achievement, and dress as a form of self-expression. Seventy-seven percent of parents agreed that children are pressured by their peers over clothing, and approximately 87 percent believed that uniforms eliminated some competition, although 60 percent disagreed that wearing uniforms  promoted positive interactions among students. Most parents thought that uniform dress provided some protection against gangs and identification with gang clothing, and most felt that uniforms were more economical than the purchase of school clothes. A great majority (93 percent) thought that wearing uniforms helps children realize that clothes do not make the person. Parents seem to respond favorably to the uniform dress policy in this school, but parent involvement and support would seem to be a necessity for implementing such a policy. One table presents parent responses. (Contains 11 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The changing nature of immigration, the job market, and the world economy preclude today's immigrants from full participation in the culture because they are without adequate education. This paper provides insights into one group of students that is most likely to have problems in school: immigrant pre-literate adolescents. It describes the effects of a literacy intervention on the dropout rate in a mid-urban school district in Houston, Texas, examining the dropout issue from a sociopolitical perspective. Data from 147 experimental and 50 control students are analyzed to answer questions about dropout rates of pre-literate students compared to the Latino population at large, whether dropouts are true dropouts, and whether there were statistically significant differences in grade  point average (GPA) or attendance between the study's two groups. Results show that only eight percent of the dropouts could be classified as true dropouts, and that the dropout rate of the pre-literate students were lower than that of the estimates of the Latino population at large. It is concluded that nationwide dropout rates among Latino students are greatly inflated and that dropping out is more a function of disempowerment within a hostile environment than a lack of academic or language abilities.

        "description":"There was general agreement among the more than 200 people testifying at hearings held by the Michigan Commission on Spanish Speaking Affairs in the summer of 1990 that the quality of life is lower for Hispanic Americans in Michigan than for the population as a whole. Hispanic Americans lag in average educational attainment, high school graduation rates, college attendance, and occupational status, and they have the poorest attendance, the lowest scores in state and national achievement examinations, and the highest dropout rate. They are denied access to remedial and accelerated programs and are cut off from bilingual education after 3 years. Of the total Michigan enrollment in higher education, Hispanic Americans represent only 1.54 percent and attain only 0.94 percent of the  bachelor's degrees. Improving the quality of the education offered to this ethnic group can begin with systems to obtain more information about the educational needs of Hispanic Americans. Among the many specific recommendations for improvement in elementary and secondary school are more Hispanic role models (teachers and administrators) in school systems, better dropout prevention, better bilingual programs, some language immersion programs, improved teacher education for cultural sensitivity, and improved curricula and funding. Three tables present findings from the hearings. An appendix gives enrollment and graduation rates for Hispanic Americans in the Michigan public university system. (SLD)",

This report begins by describing the seriously dysfunctional structure of the New York City public schools and explains the enormous potential of school-based decision making for solving some of the structural problems. Why New York SBM/SDM has been such a failure is analyzed, and some other school-based decision models, from Dade County (Florida) and Chicago (Illinois) are described. In New York, SBM/SDM has turned out to be a cautious, politically correct, insider's version of school restructuring, with only weak teacher involvement and token parental  involvement. The school-based management component has not delegated any authority from the community school boards of the central bureaucracy, as the experiences of specific schools illustrate. Parents in New York have the choice of working to reform SBM/SDM or working for its reform as well as the implementation of the Regents' New Compact for Learning and the regulation that mandates a plan for school governance at every school in the state. An appendix contains six documents related to the SBM/SDM effort and school reform. (SLD)",

Survey questions were derived from an extensive review of the literature. Seventy-seven percent of teachers agreed with interdistrict choice, but only 41 percent agreed with statewide choice. Fifty-one percent thought that parents should not be able to choose from any school within the state. Sixty-five percent of these teachers thought that vouchers would not be a more equitable way of funding schools than the present equalization formulas. Teachers tended to think that some schools would receive large numbers of students and consequently more money, while others would receive few  students and very little money. Forty-eight percent did not feel that vouchers would make schools more directly accountable to parents, and they did not think that vouchers would help improve schools. The majority also felt that using government funds for religious schools through vouchers is unconstitutional. One table presents a summary of survey findings. (Contains 14 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The effects of Chapter 1 (Education Consolidation and Improvement Act) reading pull-out programs on the reading achievement of participating students was studied for 30 fifth- and sixth-grade students from a Chicago (Illinois) elementary school serving a low socioeconomic neighborhood with a minority enrollment of 99 percent. Fifteen students had received pull-out reading instruction, and 15 had not. Reading achievement changes were established by comparing scores on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) from the end of third- and fourth-grades with scores from the end of fourth- and fifth-grades. Findings were tabulated in terms of means, medians, and standard deviations, and statistically significant differences between the mean scores were determined. Overall, the data  indicate no significant difference in reading achievement between the pull-out and non-pull-out classes over one year. This study points to the need to continue such research using a larger sample and a longer span of time, particularly because other research has cast doubt on the efficacy of pull-out instruction.

Through the use of interviews with the child as well as observations, the author attempts to interpret the child's understanding of friendship according to the theories of cognitive, emotional, and moral development of Piaget, Gilligan, Elkin, Fraiberg, and others. The study attempts to see how well theory could be used to explain individual behavior and thinking, and to challenge the theory if it was perceived to be an ill fit for this child because of cultural dissonance provided by poverty or race. The author concludes that the theories were of help in getting some perspective on the development of this child. In the course of doing the interviews, the  researcher admits to being struck by how poignant and beautiful the child's reflections on friendship are and her potential of attaining the model of friendship that she creates in her mind if circumstances with her peers permit her to relinquish her role as outcast.

Two areas are addressed. The first is understanding the concept of culture when examining multicultural materials. The second is the determination of the specific function for which the multicultural materials are intended. It warns that exposure to a culture without explanation can be misleading and demeaning and that teachers who understand the various ways in which culture can shape the ideas and lives of students are the best suited to select materials for students. Factors that should be considered in determining the suitability of multicultural materials include: (1) whether they  tie in with the teacher's multicultural goals; (2) whether they relate to the activities at hand and are realistic within the context described; (3) whether the teacher has an adequate understanding of the experiences related in the material to permit satisfactory interpretation of the content, and (4) whether and to what extent the teacher can handle material if it is of a controversial nature.

Following teacher graphing of each of the behaviors, students monitored their own behaviors for 10 days and received positive reinforcement through stickers. The results of an A-B withdrawal study showed that adolescents' on-task behaviors, in a regular classroom, can be increased with the implementation of self-monitoring and self-graphing.

The results of the civil rights movement took the nation to visions of integration, and when these faltered, to the recognition of diversity in the form of cultural pluralism, which nonetheless implies structural integration. Cultural pluralism as the focus of a solution for the problem of inequality has diverted attention from the need for structural change and access. In addition, cultural pluralism as a policy has encouraged multicultural education as a kind of cure-all for society's tensions and has served as a proof of commitment to democracy. At its best, multicultural education may create greater awareness and appreciation for people from  all backgrounds, but it cannot effect the real changes needed to provide a just society. Nevertheless, if done correctly, it will have a more beneficial impact on education than did the previous focus on cultural pluralism alone. Multicultural education is the right thing to do, but it is only part of the enormous effort needed to achieve real equality. (Contains 5 references.) (SLD)",

Data were collected from a random sample of 73 Latino undergraduates and a comparison group of 24 non-Latinos. The Latino group represents more than 10 percent of the entire Latino population of 523 undergraduates, who in turn represent only 2.1 percent of the entire student body. Latinos make up 1.1 percent of the faculty. In recent years, only 61 percent of Latino undergraduates have completed their programs within 6 years, in contrast with 77 percent of all Anglos. Questionnaire and focus group information indicates that the majority of Latino students had a  relatively strong sense of identification with their ethnic origin.

        "description":"Empowerment theory suggests that changes in beliefs and attitudes contribute to the participation of individuals in social change. It assumes that in order for individuals to work for the collective good, they must develop a sense of critical consciousness. This study uses experimental methods to test the application of this theory to the Latino community. Participants were a random sample of 73 Latino undergraduates at a large midwestern university. Twenty-three students participated in a control condition and were asked about their experiences as Latinos at the school. Fifty students were assigned to one of two experimental focus groups, one designed to arouse participants' feelings of ethnic identification and one to arouse ethnic consciousness. Results suggest there is a  direct effect of consciousness on the cognitive aspects of political empowerment, but no effect on its behavioral component. This supports the assumptions of empowerment theory and suggests a need for a more complex understanding of this concept. Five tables and two figures present study findings. (Contains 38 references.)

Event-dropout rates measure the proportion of students who drop out in a single year without completing high school. The project supports school divisions in their efforts to provide services for at-risk youth. A statewide survey of Project YES coordinators and an in-depth case study of seven schools found that there is some active attempt to foster parent involvement by Project YES staff. The major focus is on helping the parent help the child with schoolwork and in involving parents as volunteers in  school. Project YES shows community involvement primarily by using service agencies for referrals and for information. Data on parent and community approaches show room for improvement and innovation. The project evaluation team suggests that YES programs might be more effective if school divisions were to devote more time to inservice training and cooperation with local colleges and universities. Ten appendixes present numerical data on dropouts and supporting materials, including the statewide survey instrument and the principal and teacher interview guides. (Contains 63 references.) (SLD)",

        "author":["Deever, Bryan"],
        "description":"This study critically examines the political position occupied by a college laboratory school from 1965 to 1970. The school was located between the desegregated college and the segregated school system, both of which laid claims of control over the school. Existing in both contexts, the Marvin Pitman Laboratory School became a connection between competing political positions around the issue of school desegregation in Bulloch County (Georgia). Using a poststructural analysis of power based on the writing of Foucault, the study reports the results of an investigation into the manner in which power and resistance were and were not mobilized by individuals and institutions during the period. By 1969 the school had the highest rate of integration in the county and the first  integrated faculty, both achieved without the support of either governing institution. Both bodies chose not to take advantage of the power linkage to advance an agenda of compliance or resistance to integration efforts. The unique role of the laboratory school ended with the intervention of the Federal government and forced integration in 1971, but it serves as a reminder that individuals, and not institutions, engage in the politics of resistance against structural and cultural norms they deem oppressive and wrong.

The role of the teacher in diagnosing the physical and learning disabilities of students is not clearly identified, but providing teachers with information about how to identify disabilities is an important and necessary element in teacher training. The feasibility of training teachers to become more knowledgeable about the range of services offered their students was studied and the effects on teacher practice and student learning were observed. Fifteen teachers in the first study were finishing their first year of teaching, and 19 in the second study were  just beginning teacher training. In both studies, teachers learned of the multitude of services, agencies, professionals, and procedures available to their students. Teachers who became more knowledgeable about these things became more sensitive and were more willing to use these agencies to help students. Teachers can be trained as interprofessionals to look beyond the classroom to the rest of the child's environment, and the result is improved teaching and learning. (Contains 5 references.) (SLD)",

The Community Education Initiative operated in seven elementary schools and one satellite site to target elementary school parents of all ages who had not completed their education (the Project Return component). The Babygram Hospital Outreach component operated in 11 health care facilities to target teens who had dropped out of school or were at risk of dropping out because of pregnancy or parenting. Both components used a case management approach. The Office of Research, Evaluation, and Assessment collected data from a variety of sources to evaluate the programs. In 1992-93, there  were 1,096 new intakes by the Return component and 2,392 new intakes through Babygram. Outcome data, available for almost all participants, indicated favorable outcomes for the majority of participants in both programs. In Project Return schools, 81 percent of clients received a diploma or certificate, were promoted or retained at work, or secured employment. Recommendations are made for program continuation and improvement. Fourteen tables present evaluation findings. (SLD",

The Summer Bilingual Program has completed its seventh year, operating at 28 sites and providing services to 4,122 students in grades 9 through 12. Most participants were native speakers of Spanish,  Chinese, or Haitian. Other participants were speakers of English from the Caribbean who were making up courses they had failed during the school year or who were accelerating their studies. They received full academic credit for courses they passed. Project Omega focused on staff training and developing materials for English-Creole-speaking students, most of whom were recent immigrants.

        "description":"A formative and summative evaluation was made of eight school-age child care (SACC) training workshops conducted in 1989-90 for 190 participants in upstate New York. (The focus of the SACC workshops was to &quot;train the trainers,&quot; as well as to provide trainees with quality materials and instruction for future training with their staff members.) All participants evaluated the individual classes at the end of each session as part of the formative assessment. Summative evaluative information from pre- and posttest questionnaires demonstrated a positive change in the trainees' attitudes about the importance of training. There was also marked improvement in their knowledge about how best to provide training to staff members (where to conduct it, how much training to schedule, who should  do the training, and where to get resources). Trainees also rated statements describing high quality behaviors in SACC programs. Scores from the pretest were used to design a 15-item Guttman Scale that demonstrated participants' level of knowledge about desirable behaviors. The Guttman Scale will help trainers identify specific curriculum topics for future staff training. Ninety days following the training, 40 percent of the participants were mailed a follow-up questionnaire in the hope of receiving at least 48 (25 percent) completed and usable questionnaires in return. (In actuality, 58 usable questionnaires were received, for a 27 percent response rate). More than half the respondents reported having used some of the training materials with their staff members immediately after the  training and the remainder said they planned to use the materials in future staff training. Three-quarters of the participants reported planning at least some staff training annually, a significant increase from pretraining levels. As a result of the workshops, participants reported a variety of planned changes in their programs. The trainees' major complaint was that the training workshops should have been scheduled in the fall instead of in the spring. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A statewide needs assessment surveyed felt training needs of administrators, instructors, and advisors of adult literacy programs in Florida. Data were collected in the following ways: questionnaires sent to recipients of Adult Supplemental Grants and advisory-council chairpersons; indepth interviews; a literature review and document analysis; and field research. The first activity phase explored the extent and nature of training activities, resources, and benefits. Findings confirmed significant demographic and geographic imbalances in the provision of training throughout the state. Fiscal resources were used mainly for provision of literacy services; relatively small portions were authorized for provider training. The major benefits derived from participation in education and  training were in the area of personal and professional growth. The second phase of the study used these findings as a basis for assessing the current state of training and for recommending a framework for systematically addressing education and training. The framework encompassed two operational areas of leadership in adult-literacy education: (1) the state/central, regional, and district levels of operation and (2) administrative, instructional, or advisory functions. A proposal was made for roles, functions, and relationships that constitute the initial steps in building a model support system for training. (Appendixes include a 45-item bibliography, letters and instruments, directory of research participants, sample advisory council training materials, and a list of documents  reviewed.) (YLB)",

        "description":"A workplace literacy survey was developed and distributed to 4,104 private-sector businesses throughout Illinois to gain a complete and statistically reliable profile of workforce literacy programs. Employers returned 1,340 usable responses. Findings indicated that 53 percent of Illinois firms reported a need to upgrade employees basic skills, yet only 24 percent of the firms provided such training. Companies provided basic skills training for employees primarily because they were aware their work force was unable to meet new and changing job requirements. Basic skills training in private sector firms was largely company financed; 18 percent received public funds to supplement private training dollars. Companies frequently used a combination of educational providers to organize  and instruct their workplace literacy programs. Approximately 70 percent of companies with workplace literacy programs reported that half or more of the employee participants improved their abilities to efficiently and competently perform required job tasks. Employers judged workplace literacy programs that provided instruction in reading, writing, math, and communication for native English speakers more effective than programs that provided instruction in English as a Second Language. Recommendations were made for employers, other stakeholders, the Illinois Literacy Council, and Secretary of State Literacy Office.

Who's Left?&quot; (Sue Willis) explores the continuing demands that levels of numeracy must be raised and the argument that mathematics is deeply implicated in social inequality. &quot;Address to the ACAL Forum&quot; (Paul Brock) reviews adult English language and literacy provision currently offered by the community-based education sector. &quot;From Now to the Year 2000&quot; (Ann Whyte) considers developments in adult and community education. &quot;Community Literacy&quot; (Kay Schofield) addresses community provision of literacy training. &quot;'New Times' and Literacies that Matter&quot;  (Colin Lankshear) uses a sociological analysis of current economic and social trends within developed countries to review the main forms of literacy requirements. &quot;Removing Cultural Barriers to Numeracy&quot; (Alan Bishop) looks at numeracy as culturally based and socially situated knowledge.

The following common themes were identified as collectively defining integration as a distinct reform effort: (1) richer, better sequenced curricula that enhance academic and generic skills needed by all workers; (2) facilitative instruction that motivates students to learn and provides them with a practical/applied understanding of the world; (3) increased collaboration and coordination among academic and vocational teachers to create a more unified schooling experience; and (4) more attention to the skills and knowledge students need to make an effective transition from school to  work and college. The study also demonstrated that integration can apply to all high schools, should be approached as a school improvement effort, flourishes in a permissive regulatory environment, can take years to implement, and complements other current systemic reforms.

        "description":"A total of 2,118 8th-grade, 12th-grade, and community college students (66% were Mexican American) from 11 Texas school districts and 3 community colleges were surveyed to determine the extent of family influence over their occupational and career choices. In addition, 581 parents completed mailed questionnaires and 100 more responded to a telephone questionnaire. Statistical methods were used to compare the responses of the Mexican American students and their parents. The Mexican American students perceived their parents as having greater influence in occupational and educational decisions than did the non-Mexican American students. Paying for college was a major concern of Mexican American parents and students alike. Nearly two-thirds of the parents responding to the mail  questionnaire reported annual incomes below $20,000. Frequently, the 8th- and 12th-grade students expected their parents to pay for their college education, and most were either unaware of the possibility of financial aid or did not consider it a viable source of funds for college. Among the community college students, availability of financial aid was the biggest factor in choosing a four-year college. Females valued education and their parents' opinions more than males did.

        "description":"Because tech prep has the twin goals of preparing students for entry into postsecondary/continuing education or the work force after high school, tech prep programs require significant modification of conventional curricula and teaching methodologies. Both research and experience have demonstrated that the ability to transfer learning from one situation to another must be learned and that such learning is most effective when students are highly motivated, active participants rather than passive recipients of information and are taught within a contextualized environment. As a strategy for improving the learning environment, integration has three dimensions. The horizontal dimension involves multiple linkages among areas of the curriculum that are currently considered specific  disciplines, the vertical dimension involves not only direct links among the different levels of education but also reconsideration of the sequencing of content in given areas of study, and the third dimension involves connecting new knowledge with work and life experience. This third dimension of integration is the basis of applied academics. Two curriculum models based on the three-dimensions of integration are the curriculum clusters model and the value-centered curriculum model. Each may be adapted to tech prep programs.

        "description":"In view of continuing trends in farming and the trend toward increasing farm diversification and specialization, the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges and individual researchers have proposed their own lists of the skills that will be needed by farm management researchers in the future. Because farm management research increasingly entails research in the areas of agricultural production, economics, and management, future farm management researchers need the knowledge, skills, and training necessary to ensure their competence in all three fields. Included among the many areas that must be incorporated into programs to train future farm management researchers are the following: economic principles, intermediate economic theory, accounting,  agricultural policy, agricultural finance, agricultural marketing, farm and ranch management, agribusiness management, crop production, soils, plant pathology, animal nutrition, livestock production, and animal breeding. Programs to train future farm management researchers should also include an internship component to allow students to learn working skills and gain first-hand knowledge about the industry. (MN)",

        "description":"Community promoters are community members who are selected and trained to perform specific tasks in a project or program. Promoters have worked in education projects throughout Latin American since the 1960s, and their use in programs has shown to boost program success. Whether promoters work in externally directed programs or in more autonomous settings, they are most effective if they are selected from the community itself and share the sociocultural surroundings of program participants. The selection of would-be promoters should be dictated by their personal qualities and the tasks they will perform. Selection criteria should reflect a mix of community- and organization-developed desires/needs. The strategies selected to train promoters must relate the knowledge/technical  skills required of promoters and the cultural values/guidelines that influence their attitudes/code of conduct. The most commonly used training strategy is that of transference, which means training promoters and having them in turn train grassroots groups. Another training model is based on participatory methods. Other key issues that must be resolved on a program-by-program basis are payment/funding of promoters and the relationship between promoters and professionals. (MN)",

        "author":["Vandegrift, Judith A.",
          "Danzig, Arnold"],
        "description":"Two major assumptions underlying the school-to-work transition movement are that public high schools have failed to provide adequate preparation for the school-to-work transition and that work experiences exist into which states can &quot;plug&quot; young workers for pay. These assumptions were analyzed from the standpoint of their applicability to and implications for rural Arizona. The analysis was based on a literature review and interviews with four people involved in the development of Arizona's transition policy. The analysis revealed that, although certain measures of school accountability (dropout rates and educational attainment) indicate that Arizona's rural schools may have failed to prepare students for work, a good deal of the problem stems from the nature of the rural  workplace itself. The analysis further established that rural Arizona generally lacks jobs into which high school students can be placed for pay and that those jobs that are available for rural youths are not the kinds of &quot;work-based experiences&quot; encouraged by the School-to-Work Opportunities Program. It was recommended that policymakers responsible for shaping school-to-work transition programs shift their focus to making such programs developmentally appropriate and, in the case of rural programs, focus on: (1) how best to prepare youths who leave to compete successfully elsewhere; and (2) how to help youths who stay in rural areas achieve success.

The program, known as the Collaborative Transition Services Training Program (CTSTP), is an 18-semester unit program organized into three phases: a 3-unit course on transition programming for youth and adults with disabilities, a 12-unit core of interdisciplinary coursework, and a 3-unit practicum in applied settings. Trainees follow individualized competency-based participant training plans that are typically completed on a part-time basis over 3 successive semesters. The CTSTP has been evaluated by various means, including profile data of project participants, pre- and postprogram completion transition competency self-ratings by trainees,  external review by independent investigators, and follow-up studies of program graduates' career outcomes/changes. Since 1987, 82 trainees from a broad mix of fields (special, vocational, and adult education) have participated in the program. According to the evaluation measures, the CTSTP has helped participants achieve positive career outcomes, improve their job performance, increase their degree of networking and involvement with other transition personnel, and expand services to additional client groups. The CTSTP has also been positively received by employers of its graduates. (Contains 20 references.) (MN)",

        "description":"The antipoverty initiatives of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations were essentially continued and given increased funding during the Nixon, Ford, and Carter administrations. The Reagan and Bush administrations marked the regression of many employment, training, and welfare programs. Employment and training issues were given high priority during Clinton's 1992 campaign but received less priority during the first year of the Clinton administration. Since the Kennedy administration, federal intervention in the area of preparation for work has improved services to neglected groups. Federal funding of secondary and vocational education has never been high, however. It peaked at 9% in 1980 and declined to 5.6% in 1992. The federal government has assumed responsibility for providing  second-chance job training for disadvantaged/displaced persons and ensuring equal access to work. Although employment policies focusing on bringing jobs to depressed areas have yielded disappointing results, direct public service job creation has proved successful. Programs of promise identified in this paper are: Head Start, elementary and secondary education, school-to-work transition, second-chance programs, access to jobs, income maintenance, welfare reform, and targeted job creation. (Appended is a list of 34 assessments of federal human resource programs.) (MN)",

A project advisory committee provided input for program planning, program improvement, and program evaluation. The project provided instruction in the courses required for certification in vocational guidance/counseling programs by the Texas Education Agency. Courses were offered on the following: planning and organizing programs of vocational guidance; occupational vocational education information; vocational student identification, placement, and follow-up; history and principles of vocational education; methods of media for teaching vocational subjects; organization and management of vocational-technical laboratory and shop programs; and  practicum in vocational counseling. Other activities were as follows: completion of transcript analysis and deficiency plans for vocational guidance/counseling program personnel; recommendation of personnel seeking certification; and provision of instruction and handout material to vocational guidance/counseling program personnel to assist them in meeting needs of special needs students. As result of the project, vocational guidance/counseling personnel who completed the required courses gained an increased awareness and understanding of competencies necessary to plan and implement a quality program.

        "description":"The National Adult LIteracy Survey was a nationwide survey of a random sample of approximately 26,000 adults. The survey collected information about individuals' social, economic, and educational histories and their literacy activities. Their functional literacy was also assessed using simulated functional or real-world tasks designed to determine the ability to process information in prose, document, and quantitative tasks. Findings included the following: (1) nearly half of those surveyed were found to perform at the two lowest levels of reading proficiency; (2) literacy proficiencies were found to be closely correlated to such indicators as wages, earnings, and poverty status; (3) 75-80% of Black adults were at the two lowest levels, compared to 38-43% of White adults; (4) at  constant levels of education, Whites earn significantly more than Blacks; and (5) after taking educational attainment into account, wages and earnings are positively related to functional literacy. In other words, the study concluded that there is no difference between Blacks and Whites when both education and literacy are equated. Findings suggest the importance of the following: a broadened approach to educational equity, especially functional literacy; access to literacy learning in all contexts; and incorporation of these concerns into the new standards movement.

        "description":"A study explored whether changes in Nebraska Extension's organizational structure and programming approach, instituted in 1988, had altered 103 extension agents' perceptions of their jobs or job satisfaction. A literature review addressed both the primary variables, including specific aspects of job change, such as issues-based programming, multicounty or clustered work units, agent specialization, and job satisfaction, as well as the Job Characteristics theory. Data from prior research with Nebraska extension agents established a baseline of perceptions about the level of skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, feedback, personal satisfaction, and context satisfaction present in the job of agent. These were contrasted with agents' current perceptions of the  same factors. The instrument was a modified version of the Job Diagnostic Survey (Hackman and Oldham 1980). Findings suggested that agents saw the job dimensions as unchanged and experienced no change in personal satisfaction. Satisfaction with compensation and supervision improved, whereas satisfaction with co-worker relations declined. The conclusion was that implementation of issues-based programming and clustered work units had not altered extension agents' perceptions of core job dimensions or levels of job satisfaction, but may have affected some aspects of satisfaction with the work context.

The income of completers of vocational programs was compared to income of equivalent groups in the general population. The study also investigated the geographic mobility of vocational graduates since 1979. Results indicated predominantly higher incomes of vocational graduates than others in the general population. The result varied by vocational program, but the ratios were higher than 1 for the 1979 graduates in all programs for all years of the study (1983-1988). In all 12 secondary programs,  the ratios were higher in 1988 than in 1983. For the 1979 graduates of the two associate programs, the ratios in 1988 were higher than the 1987, 1986, 1985, 1984, and 1983 ratios.

In 1993, a limited evaluation of the project was conducted. Evaluation data were collected from reviews of 39 state and local documents, interviews with the program manager and 14 project staff members, 2 surveys of 7 local programs, and information presented about the project at 2 conferences and 3 meetings. The evaluation established that the program operated in a manner reasonably consistent with Florida's plan for the adult homeless literacy program and that local program coordinators were generally pleased with the program's operation at the local and state levels. The program served a total of  3,180 participants through 5 school districts, Florida Community College, and Religious Community Services, Inc. Of those adults served, 52.8% were Black, 33.6% were White, and 12.5% were Hispanic. More than half the participants were between the ages of 25 and 44.

        "description":"The University of Glamorgan (Wales) conducted a research project to determine the counseling and guidance needs of its mature students. The project's long-term objective was to develop a new institutional policy for a coordinated guidance and counseling system reflecting the different needs, perceptions, and situations of students and staff, and its short-term objectives were to develop a student support system and staff training programs to meet the counseling/guidance needs of older students. During the project, researchers gathered data through a pilot questionnaire, progressively focused semistructured interviews of students and staff, and group discussions with staff. Data from the survey, interviews, and group discussions were analyzed by using complete and partial  transcription methods. A proposal was drafted for a comprehensive system guidance/counseling and tutoring services for mature students that would focus on the following areas/problems: personal tutoring (personal progress, accommodation, relationships, personal problems, and financial/legal welfare); vocational tutoring (development of self-preservation and career-vocational skills, institutional membership, and career choice/development); and academic tutoring (study skills and specific subject development, admissions, and option choice).

        "description":"Increasing shortages of skilled workers have resulted in numerous changes and innovations in vocational-technical education (VTE). The overriding objective of these changes/innovations is to improve youths' work readiness. At the secondary level, school systems have adopted business-sponsored programs and integrated them into curricula. Efforts to improve education and make it more responsive to business and industry needs are evident in all of the following elements of the U.S. VTE system: high schools, community and technical colleges, apprenticeship programs, private and technical schools, and federal job training programs. Numerous new organizations and programs have been established to accomplish one or more of the following goals: improve integration of secondary and  postsecondary VTE and integration of academic education and VTE; promote consistency, quality, and state-of-the-art currency in VTE curricula; and develop new and stronger connections between business and VTE institutions. Central among such efforts are tech prep or &quot;2+2 articulation&quot; programs and curriculum improvement/coordination efforts to increase employer participation in explicating changing job skill needs and eliminating duplication and waste in existing VTE programs. Legislation to facilitate these reform efforts by changing funding formulas, supporting tech prep, and increasing integration of academic education and VTE is now under consideration. (MN)",

At the school, more than 140 students with diagnosed disabilities are served within a continuum of options as follows: option 1, which entails total inclusion in the VT program with no adjustments to curriculum or specialized support services; options 2 and 3, which provide varying degrees of support personnel and/or curriculum adjustments to help disabled students achieve success in the VT program; and option 4, which is solely for disabled students. Especially in the case of options 2 and 3, the program is based on a team approach that includes input from a vocational evaluator, special needs trainer, vocational  special education coordinator, vocational program instructor, the student, the student's parents, and sending district or home school personnel. Student progress is monitored by the program instructor, and interventions to solve academic, attendance, or behavioral problems that may develop are selected by the team.

Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of 1990, was provided for within the vocational educational curricula. It was determined that many of the component areas of &quot;all aspects of the industry&quot; were included, with both competency profiles and related instructional educational materials, within the existing curricula of most vocational education programs in the state. A program was then developed to satisfy the need to determine the  appropriate specific competencies for each unit so that students gain experience of &quot;all aspects of the industry.&quot; During the program, the appropriate competencies that would provide strong experience in and understanding of &quot;all aspects of the industry&quot; in 15 industry areas were identified; the competencies were validated, and a matrix was developed to cross reference the competencies identified in the 15 areas. (The resulting matrices are included in the report. They link the competencies identified under the headings of planning, management, finance, technical and production skills, principles of technology, labor issues, community issues, health, safety, and environmental concerns, and professional conduct to the occupational clusters in agricultural production, agricultural business,  health services, food services, construction, transportation maintenance, printing and graphic arts, drafting, marketing, computer and data processing, office occupations, electrical and electronics occupations, metal trades, personal services, and child care occupations.)

        "description":"A study explored the extent to which 154 federal programs that provide employment training assistance overlap in the populations targeted and services provided and whether such overlap has any potentially adverse effects. The research was conducted in the following ways: categorizing the 154 programs by the primary target populations served; reviewing the authorized services for the 9 programs that targeted the economically disadvantaged; examining whether these programs had similar goals and structures for delivering services; and identifying the administrative costs. The nine programs were as follows: Job Training Partnership Act (Adult, State Education, and Incentive Grants programs), Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Program, Food Stamp Employment and Training, Vocational  Education, Employment Opportunity Centers, Student Literacy and Mentoring Corps, and Family Self-Sufficiency Program. Many federal employment training programs targeted the same populations; the overlap ranged from a low of 4 to a high of 18 programs. Individually, each employment training program generally had a well-intended purpose; collectively, they created the potential for duplication of effort, raising questions concerning the administrative costs associated with the multitude of federal, state, and local agencies involved in their operation. Analysis of the nine programs that targeted the economically disadvantaged showed they had similar goals, often served the same categories of people, and provided many of the same services using separate, yet parallel, delivery structures.  The overlap could add unnecessary administrative costs at each level of government. (Appendixes include federal employment and training programs proposed funding levels by agency, comparison of authorized employment training services by five main areas for the nine programs, and descriptions of the programs.)

        "description":"A study used data for the 1987 calendar year from the 1986 and 1987 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to examine the impact of union membership on women's wages and job tenure. The data set included 17,200 sample members, representing about 79 million workers, aged 16-64. The study mapped the distribution of union women and men workers across the economy in terms of occupation, industry, and size of firm and by education level. This map illustrated the changing face of unions as women become a higher proportion of their membership and reflected the changes in union membership from blue-collar to white-collar occupations, from manufacturing to professional specialty industries, and from high school to college graduates. Findings helped explain the  increase in union membership among higher wage women workers between 1984-87 and suggested union membership was increasingly characterized by a new diversity. Statistical regression techniques were used to estimate the importance of union membership, relative to other factors, in increasing hourly wages for women. Unions increased women's wages by 12 percent; for union members, unions decreased the wage gap between men and women from 32 to 25 percent; and unions appeared to especially benefit minority women who gained 13 percent per hour. Unionized women workers had twice as many years on the job as nonunion workers. (Appendixes include 15 references and a technical appendix.) (YLB)",

NET was designed to identify and demonstrate strategies to increase the number of women entering and succeeding at nontraditional training in the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) system. Three sites reflected differences in the JTPA system so that lessons learned in the demonstration would have wide application: Hartford, Connecticut; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and the state of Montana. Four types of data were used: JTPA-mandated data, questionnaires filled by samples of trainees, eligibility data, and focus groups. In comparing the sites pre-NET with mid-NET, the study found that the number of women in nontraditional training increased, with this increase  overwhelmingly concentrated in Milwaukee (Wisconsin). Comparisons of women on a variety of characteristics did not result in a distinctive profile of the &quot;nontraditional woman.&quot; The Milwaukee site gave prospective trainees direct and positive exposure to nontraditional jobs, support services, and retention efforts. Other factors and issues, across all three sites, that contributed to success in nontraditional training for women were as follows: intake workers brought their own attitudes and experiences into the process; women needed the support of other women; JTPA structures and practices restricted programs' ability to respond to changing circumstances; and programming in each site had to be customized.

Particular attention was given to their actual and potential effect on the economic status of women. Data confirmed the overall increase in the education level of workers in the U.S. economy. Findings were as follows: college-educated women and men were equally likely to use computer skills on the job; at any other level of education, women were much more likely to use computer skills at the workplace; and the gap between men and women in the rate of computer use widened between 1984-91. The higher rate of computer use among women was a reflection of the continuing segregation of men and  women across occupations and industries. Use of computers was highly correlated with use of math on the job. Regression analysis showed that the economy-wide returns to computer use ranged from 13.1 to 18.8 percent in 1991 or about 2 percentage points higher than in 1984 and that, at the level of individual workers, computer skills rewarded men and women equally well. Because women used computers at a higher rate, the gap in average earnings between men and women narrowed slightly with the spread of computers at the workplace.

Senior staff and practitioners described excellence in a CVE practitioner in terms of personal characteristics and knowledge- and  skill-based characteristics. They felt the purposes of staff development were updating in subject-specific knowledge and skills training for CVE. All respondents regarded standards of performance with respect to teaching as being implicit and identified formal and informal mechanisms for feedback. Factors that motivated lecturers to work in this area related either to personal satisfaction or career goals. Senior academic staff most often identified organizational barriers as barriers that prevented good practice from being realized. Practitioners also cited career, status, and conditions of service and barriers concerned with income generation. (The instrument is appended.) (YLB)",

Findings indicated a very wide range of facilities for use in CVET courses. Availability of primary-use and suitable facilities for CVET enabled a university to compete more successfully in the CVET market. A significant minority of British universities had or were committing themselves to having primary-use, purpose-built teaching and residential facilities for CVET on or  near a campus site. Lack of residential facilities was perceived as a factor in some universities' capacities to develop more CVET provision. Respondents having purpose-built or adapted facilities were satisfied with them. Respondents in most universities recognized availability of appropriate teaching and/or residential facilities as a limitation on current CVET provision. All universities looked to expansion of CVET in the near future. Most respondents recognized availability of suitable facilities as fairly important to expansion plans.

Findings indicated that all universities accepted the requirement for CVE to be self-financing and adopted their own definition. The primary objective of CVE was rarely income generation, although this was likely to be a necessary condition for sustainability. Universities believed CVE budgeting and accounting should be managed by staff who understand CVE and are trusted professional colleagues in its administration; the  ways in which financial regulations were administered were often more important than the regulations. Other findings were as follows: CVE units needed to combine academic credibility and strong links with central administration; the opportunity cost of CVE was rarely fully included in the costing of courses; overheads were extremely variable, as was the range of services they included; much financial administration was driven by costs; and some universities were creating conflicting pressures on CVE units by requiring them to be self-financing and accept institutional responsibilities.

A questionnaire that sought to relate employer involvement in ED to wider issues of workplace culture, personnel, and training policies was sent to 70 firms; 50 percent responded. Only 14 questionnaires (20 percent) sent to a control group were returned. Follow-up visits were made to 11 firms. Findings indicated that many firms were laying off employees but were expecting more of those who remained. Broad-based ED schemes reached a significant percentage of the work force. In some firms there was cooperation over ED, but two other prevalent attitudes were that ED was a management prerogative and ED was a  way of dividing the work force. Positive outcomes for ED participants were as follows: compensation for negative experiences in earlier education; elimination of barriers to participation caused by shift work; employee development beyond current job requirements; equal opportunities; personal confidence; and preparation for an unpredictable labor market. Employers hoped ED would help employees better understand the organization, encourage flexibility, develop a learning culture, and create an internal labor market. Recommendations were made for short-term changes in practice and long-term changes in policy. (Appendixes include contacts' addresses, abbreviations, and 72 references.) (YLB)",

        "description":"This booklet presents the concepts of essential and generic skills and issues raised by their incorporation in New Zealand's National Qualifications Framework (NQF). The first section discusses the concepts of essential and generic skills. The second section addresses three major reasons for wider understanding and discussion of these concepts: curriculum and assessment requirements resulting from the New Zealand Curriculum Framework; need to identify essential and generic skills arising from the development of unit standards and qualifications spanning a range of occupations; and similar developments in the assessment and recognition of skills overseas. The third section raises the following issues that must be addressed before decisions on essential and generic skills within  the NQF are made: the place for separate essential skills units in the NQF; recognition of essential and generic skills in the NQF at all levels; development of essential and generic skills in meaningful contexts; transfer of skills to new situations; and reporting of skills achievement. The final section presents four alternatives for recognizing essential skills in the NQF. These four models are the separation, adjunct, integrated, and combination models. Advantages and disadvantages are listed. Appendixes include 15 references, Record of Achievement (skills list), Ministry of Education essential skills descriptors, General Vocational Qualifications: Unit in Problem Solving, and glossary.

As of 1993, the QA had initiated a contract for the development of unit standards for persons administering/implementing RPL and unit standards to assist candidates in preparing for the RPL assessment process. The booklet provides practical information on the RPL assessment process and identifies the relevant requirements of the QA for its implementation. The following information is presented: the development and purposes of the RPL process, principles  underlying the RPL process, potential candidates for RPL, providers and assessors permitted to award credit for unit standards, extension of provider accreditation to implement RPL and National Standards Body accreditation to register RPL assessors, and procedures for moderation of RPL assessment. Appended are the following: a model of good practice in implementing the RPL process, personal profiles of eight individuals who have applied for credit for their prior learning, the QA policy on RPL, a glossary, and an annotated bibliography of 19 selected publications related to RPL.

        "description":"England's National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) are statements of competence that are based on national standards for performance in employment. NVQs are organized into five levels of achievement and areas of competence as follows: introductory, trade, technical/craft and supervision, &quot;incorporated&quot; equivalent, and &quot;chartered&quot; equivalent. General NVQs (GNVQs) are designed to be pursued by candidates not yet certain of their career goals or wishing to use the qualifications as a step toward higher education. The primary developers of NVQs are industry lead bodies consisting of employers and key organizations and industrialists. Educators have not yet been significantly involved in development of NVQs. The relationship between NVQs and other standards is unclear. One potential  problem regarding NVQs is that they are being developed on an industry-wide basis whereas current academic courses and professional institutions are organized along discipline-based lines. Other emerging problems in the development of NVQs include problems related to underpinning knowledge and understanding, defining competence, and determining the role of assessment and assessors in the NVQ system. Single-discipline educational institutions will soon be faced with applications from candidates holding GNVQs and NVQs and must decide how to use them in the admissions process. (MN)",

The review confirmed that conflicting eligibility requirements and differences in annual operating cycles are hampering the ability of programs to provide participants with needed services. Recommendations called for standardizing all terms related to income definitions, standardizing the term &quot;job loss,&quot; and developing standard income- and age-related eligibility criteria so as to facilitate coordination among agencies and between the different levels of government. (Appendixes constituting over 80% of this document include the  following: a list of federal ET programs and their proposed FY94 funding levels by agency, statistics regarding the four target groups included in the analysis, eligibility standards for economically disadvantaged persons, age requirements in older worker programs, lower and upper age limits for youth programs, definitions of job loss among dislocated worker programs, programs' annual operating cycles, and a list of major contributors to this report.)

        "description":"The objective of popular education has been associated with the creation of identity of popular groups in society. Education has been considered a key in the process to reform and modernize social structures. In the 1990s, democratic governments have promoted popular participation to solve development problems. This context poses new challenges that have practical and theoretical implications for popular education and evoke new themes for discussion. Innovative methodologies are needed to improve the quality of educational processes. The theme of transmission of knowledge and power appears to be very important. The perspective of an active relationship between educators and students with reciprocal processes of transmission and appropriation places the problem of autonomy of  popular groups in a different perspective. Popular education must undertake a new type of analysis that permits an understanding of economic, class, and gender relations from the point of view of indigent cultures. In some cases, new relationships of cooperation with the state must be created to attain a more extensive and national implementation. Popular education must take account of gender differences and promotion of creativity and personal development. The problem facing educators is how to combine leadership with the equalizing discourse on which most of their action is based. (YLB)",

Case studies of three area companies offering workplace BST programs were conducted along with a telephone survey of 56 local employers (of 200 originally contacted) to gauge their awareness of and attitudes toward workplace BST and their perceptions of their companies' need for such training. Most employers were not currently providing BST, and most were unaware of the few BST programs that do exist. Only 4-12% of those interviewed perceived BST as yielding specific benefits to employers and employees, whereas up to 44% cited various barriers to BST. The case studies revealed additional barriers. Recommendations for facilitating BST development  included the following: publicizing the benefits of BST; encouraging universal access to BST; increasing coordination among/commitment from employers, training providers, and trade unions; ensuring confidentiality; creating favorable learning environments; developing appropriate curricula; providing opportunities for progression; and monitoring program quality.

        "description":"In April 1992, 16 individuals who were all employed in manual or nonsupervisory jobs and who had all participated in employer-funded adult education courses offered partly or entirely during work hours attended a weekend retreat in the north of England. They spent the weekend talking and writing about their experiences with work-based learning, its effect on their lives, and the broader benefits of work-based education programs. This book presents the collected writings of the weekend program's participants. The writings are in various formats, including reports, essays, and poems. In the introductory section, two participants describe their involvement in workplace learning and its significance in their lives. The writings in chapters 1 and 2 describe typical workdays in the  lives of service occupation and factory workers, and the poems and essays in chapter 3 focus on the participants' reasons for taking work-based adult education courses and the personal and career benefits of the courses. The works presented in chapter 4 offer reasons why giving employees access to education during work time benefits employers and include points for employers to consider when developing work-based learning programs. In chapter 5, participants offer their views of the weekend retreat. (MN)",

        "description":"A British research project investigated the influence of 1960s culture on adult education by surveying 340 people who started work in university adult education or the Workers' Educational Association (WEA) during the period 1965-75; 87 responded. The questionnaire examined the extent to which these people brought aspects of the 1960s political culture with them into adult education and whether this political culture influenced their attitudes to their work and their expectations of what they might achieve through the medium of adult education. It explored their views on the purpose of adult education, their adult education priorities, their opinions of the 1973 Russell Report, and the extent to which a commitment to socially purposive adult education brought them into conflict  with their employers or paymasters. Findings showed they brought their cultural baggage and their attitudes with them into the world of university and WEA adult education. They tended to be a socially mobile meritocracy, risen into the ranks of the middle class by virtue of their education and/or professionalization. They were overwhelmingly &quot;Guardian,&quot;&quot;Observer,&quot; or &quot;New Statesman&quot; readers and had imbibed the sixties radical intellectual culture. They tended to be center-left, politically active, antiestablishment protesters. They believed the world could and should be changed for the better. Their reasons for coming into adult education were quite mixed and not always clearly planned. (Contains 49 endnotes.) (YLB)",

        "description":"A study identified the factors that assist or impede women's access, participation, and progression within education and training in Britain. The project rationale was as follows: women face continuing inequalities in the labor market, there are signs of a diminishing concern with equal opportunities, and women's position and experiences in education and training have been underanalyzed and underreported. Difficulties participants identified in relation to gaining access to education, training, and employment fell into three broad clusters: personal and domestic, dispositional or psychological, and structural constraints. Course components that help women move to employment or other levels of education or training were core or basic skills, study skills, educational and  vocational guidance, planning for change, job search and acquisition skills, accreditation, and assessment of prior experiential learning, experience, and skills. The most effective reentry or threshold learning activities for women shared features common to all good community education: sensitive recruitment, informal venues, flexibility, and empathetic staff. Problems women experienced in moving from an informal to a formal education or training environment arose largely due to lack of information and guidance, lack of coherent learning routes, and lack of support and practical assistance.

Population pyramids that provide an overview of the age and gender structures of individual black/ethnic minority populations. Specific findings are presented for these populations: African-Caribbean elders, Asian elders, and refugees. The second part contains seven case studies that outline the background and requirements of some of the other ethnic minority elders. They demonstrate clearly that, although black elders have much in common in terms of their experience of  institutional racism and isolation from mainstream services, they each have a unique set of circumstances that providers can address only if they are prepared to enter into creative partnerships and ongoing dialogue with the communities themselves.

The evolution of the enterprise is reviewed in terms of four developmental stages or phases: preliminary, planning, operational, and review. Chapter 3 is an account of the implementation of the venture that is based mainly on five case studies of agencies authorized to recognize access courses on behalf of the central authorities. Topics include the following: mandate, structure, and  resourcing of authorized validating agencies (AVAs); roles and relationships; quality assurance mechanisms; and curriculum issues. Chapter 4 is a concluding commentary of the character, influence, and direction of the framework. The introduction of the framework is evaluated in terms of the original purposes and principles established to guide the formation and implementation of the scheme.

        "description":"A major review of vocational education and training has occurred across the United Kingdom since 1986. Employment requirements are being identified in the form of occupational standards that provide the foundation for the new system of vocational qualifications, National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs). Standards describe what people need to be able to do in the work environment and are expressed in terms of the outcomes people are expected to achieve. Each NVQ is made up of a selection of units from the standards. Each unit consists of element titles, performance criteria, and range statements. A nationally agreed methodology for developing standards has been established and refined under the aegis of the Employment Department. Employers are to play a key role in setting and  operating the national standards. They are expected to set up assessment systems approved by awarding bodies and ensure that they have the capacity to provide training or to negotiate for training needs to be met through contracts with outside providers. Benefits for employers attributed to standards and NVQs include the following: improved staff motivation, improved quality of product or services, a tool for workforce planning, skill-mix review and job redefinition, attracting and retaining staff, and recruitment advertising. Individuals benefit, since the movement towards flexible delivery of learning materials is given considerable impetus through NVQ developments. (Contains 11 references.) (YLB)",

In Texas, the law now requires assessment of the educational level of all probationers and parolees to be followed by referrals to education programs for those whose literacy level is below the sixth-grade level. The following elements in Henderson's (1990) partnership framework can be applied to the development of cooperative efforts between community corrections adult education programs and traditional adult education programs: mutual benefits, trust, sharing knowledge and unique resources, and  linkage-operational guidelines. Successful programs in Texas are as follows: Adult Education Co-ops; programs operated by the Private Industry Council, Job Training Partnership Act, and Council of Governments; community college programs; and independent school district programs. The majority of the programs are being used in rural areas. Rural communities can expand the number of educational services offered to the community by combining resources through cooperative efforts. Sources of volunteers who can be the backbone of an education program are senior citizen organizations, churches, community service groups, and private organizations. Local literacy programs provide one-on-one tutoring by trained volunteers. (YLB)",

After citing a number of reasons why it is difficult to recruit low-literate individuals for research, most respondents stated that recruiting was more successful if the research project was linked to individuals' personal goals and if research- and medical/social service-related visits were paired. When asked to evaluate low literacy health communication strategies and materials, most respondents favored formative research and health  education strategies that were interactive and had limited objectives. Most respondents favored including health messages in literacy curricula and reported doing so. There was general agreement that health professions need to be aware that many patients are low literate and that they should keep their verbal and written communications simple and clear.

The curriculum emphasized basic academic skills, and its primary objective was to improve deaf adults' skills in using print and print media for purposes of communication and self-expression, gathering information, and accessing community and employment-related resources. During the program, 33 learners made significant progress in their ability to perform basic academic skills as measured by assessment instruments  developed at Gallaudet University. Participation rates remained high throughout the program year. The participants produced a newsletter called &quot;The Deaf Connection.&quot; The program has received endorsements and support by a broad coalition of community leaders, deaf persons, and providers of services to the adult deaf community.

Six were networking programs each of which involved several agencies, and one program was designed on a center-based model. During the study year, all of the programs experienced staff turnovers or reductions. No program made radical changes to its components. The programs generally experienced growth; however, funding reductions forced one program to reduce its services drastically. Four programs expanded into new sites. All of the programs experimented with new curricula or innovative programming ideas. At one program, families participated in a unique  computer workshop conducted in Spanish. Another program worked to increase children's access to books and men's involvement in family literacy activities through &quot;make and take nights&quot; featuring activities such as bookshelf making. Other innovative activities at individual project included training college students to conduct home outreach and conducting a one-day course to build self-esteem and nurture adults' needs within families.

Parent-child interaction activities were presented, and educational personnel served as models to reinforce target skills. Home visitors visited homes to help parents with specific needs. During the project grant period, 131 families attended family workshops and family nights. At least 35 families attended programs for 3 or more months. Among the workshop participants were 8 families from local adult  literacy classes, 34 families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and 88 families from shelters. All of the parents participating in a project evaluation meeting reported spending much more time reading to their children, and many reported attending more activities at their children's schools.

A curriculum to teach parents how to read to/with their children effectively was developed by the project director and presented at four workshops. Among the workshop activities were a model story hour program, training in reading aloud, and information on using the library. An instructional guide was developed to enable continuation of the Read with Me curriculum in the local community education program. Questionnaires  administered to workshop participants before and after each workshop confirmed the workshops' effectiveness in meeting their stated goals. The Read with Me program will be incorporated into the local ABE program.

Existing models and model components for designing and implementing basic skills CAI programs were identified and reviewed to determine their appropriateness to adult basic education. Five components (curriculum, software, hardware, procedures, and trained staff) were selected as the foundation of a model for implementing CAI curricula. The model components were field tested, refined, and organized into a package for use by adult educators. A training package was  designed to assist users in implementing the model. Formative and summative evaluations established that the project staff were successful in producing a curriculum-driven model that is suitable for duplication and/or expansion to design inservice training in basic skills CAI for other adult education staff.

        "description":"More than 58 percent of all women working in the U.S. labor force, many of them sole supports of their families, and 67 percent of women with children under age 18 are working. Therefore, more flexible work options are being made to allow a balance of work and family. Increasingly available options include work at home, compressed workweeks, resources for elder and child care, job sharing, part-time employment, telecommuting, and flextime. Making use of flexible work arrangements, however, may have negative effects on one's career, such as limited work responsibilities, ineligibility for promotions, no salary increases, lack of prorated benefits, and lack of visibility. Benefits include the chance to keep current in one's occupation, continued identification with the work force,  and the opportunity to meet personal and family commitments. Flexible staffing, which may temporarily reduce hours or workers, is more beneficial to employers than to employees. Flexible work schedules take the following forms: flexitours, variable days, variable weeks, maxiflex, flex year, summer hours flextime, compressed workweeks, and a gliding schedule of starting times. Benefits of flexible work arrangements to employers include retention and attraction of quality employees, higher productivity, improved morale, and the capacity to respond to operating requirements with staffing flux.

Some of the findings of the study were the following: (1) nearly 14 percent of the women received a promotion within the preceding year; (2) women with at least a high school degree, women who work full time, women  who work in large establishments, and women not employed in service occupations were more likely to receive a promotion than other women; (3) about 87 percent of women who were promoted received higher pay, and about 82 percent accepted more responsibility; and (4) nearly three-quarters of the promotions involved greater authority over other workers.

The activities in the first eight sessions, which are designed to be completed before the children's first visit, are based on a mix of children's literature and reading materials dealing with child development and parenting. In session 9, the fathers are asked to write about their children's first visit and to complete activities dealing with reflective listening and communicating with children. Among the topics covered in the remaining sessions are the following: learning styles, newspaper reading, low-cost gifts for children, empowerment, reading to children, family communication, dealing with children's problems, problem solving, consequences, and natural and  logical consequences. Each section includes some or all of the following: session objectives, session activities, lists of materials needed and recommended books, instructional handouts, worksheets, and discussion questions. Appended are instructions for various games, recipes, songs, and arts and crafts projects to be completed during the individual sessions and a sample report card.

They are also affected by economic conditions in the industries that typically employ workers with different levels of education. Annual earnings are influenced by the number of weeks worked in a year and the usual hours worked each week. The ratio of annual earnings of high school dropouts or college graduates to those of high school graduates is affected by all these factors; it is a measure of the earnings disadvantage of not finishing high school and the advantage of completing college. Generally, the earnings advantage of college graduates is greater for females than for males. The earnings advantage of  having a bachelor's degree was more than double the earnings advantage of having attended only some college. (A chart illustrates the percentage difference between median annual earnings of wage and salary workers who are high school graduates and workers with other levels of educational attainment by sex, race/ethnicity, type of worker, and age. Four charts show percentage of difference between median annual earnings of all wage and salary workers who are high school graduates and workers with other levels of educational attainment for these four populations: males 25-34 years old, males 45-54 years old, females 25-34 years old, and females 45-54 years old.)

Response was 93 percent (1,924 teachers). Almost all teachers taught full time and had a significant amount of teaching experience. Class size was slightly lower and class length was somewhat longer in vocational courses. Vocational courses differed by the activities and teaching methods used during class. Homework was much more likely to have been assigned during a 5-day period in academic courses; vocational course students were about twice as likely to have used some kind of instrument, tools or equipment, and computers. Large proportions of  both groups of teachers planned to include written examinations and quizzes. Vocational teachers were likely to administer a performance test or assess a student's portfolio. The mathematics and science content of most vocational courses was limited. Teachers in both groups reported the leading determinants of students' grades were basic reading skills, completing work on time, creative thinking and problem solving, and self-management skills, although occupational skills were significantly more likely to contribute to a vocational student's grade.

        "description":"Seven small business owners, professors, and leaders answered the question of whether academia can help small business owners. In the opinion of a small business owner, academia offers too much theory and too few real skills. According to the president of the National Federation of Independent Business, academia can play a role in the development of small business, but colleges and universities must first overcome many barriers. From a chief executive officer's point of view, business and academia must form a dynamic alliance; if the premise of universities is to provide pure theory and no specifics, the premise is wrong. The president of the Association of Small Business Development Centers finds that strains exist because small business owners and academics both question the  value of the relationship. A professor presents educators' viewpoint: academia can help many entrepreneurs, but there are barriers to a successful working relationship: client-counselor mismatches, antigeneralist bias, and entrepreneurs' ignorance of all available sources of help. According to another professor, if research and insights could be expressed clearly to small business owners and emerging entrepreneurs, a great deal of experience, research, and knowledge could be networked among those interested in improving the competitive edge. The administrator of the Small Business Administration reports that the traditional role of universities has never been more important to small businesses. (YLB)",

        "description":"A literature review and two major studies discovered four approaches to job design, each geared toward different sets of outcomes for individual employees and organizations. The motivational approach tries to design jobs to provide the worker with autonomy and the opportunity to make decisions about how or in what order tasks are done. The mechanistic approach is based on the assumption that the work should be broken down into highly specialized jobs, tasks simplified, a minimum of idle time obtained, and repetition should be used to benefit from practice. The human factors approach designs the job to limit the amount of information to which the worker must pay attention or remember. The goal of the biological approach is to reduce the physical demands of work and the resulting  discomforts and injuries. All of the approaches have advantages and drawbacks. Although each approach can help make a job better, all contain unintended consequences that advocates tend to ignore. For example, too liberal an application of the motivational approach can increase the mental demands of the job and increase training time and make it more difficult to find qualified employees. The mechanistic approach may lead to less interesting, satisfying, and rewarding jobs. The human factors approach may unintentionally decrease mental demands to the point of boredom. A drawback of the biological and human factors approaches is the financial cost. (Recommendations for further reading are made.) (YLB)",

The cure for their fear of the unknown is information and education. Exports have a number of advantages: increased profits, spread of overhead costs, smooth seasonal fluctuations, increased productivity and competitiveness, tax advantages, and extended product life cycles. In many ways, international trade is not different than expanding into a new region of the United States. It is different in some ways: new needs and tastes; different forms of distribution duties, quotas, licenses; more complicated and costly shipping, documentation, and insurance; and different financing and payment terms and methods.  The best place to begin is at the nearest office of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Its International Trade Administration offers information services through Commercial Information Management System in three categories: identification and assessment of markets, contact services, and promotion. Books on exporting are available from the government. Other useful government agencies are the Export-Import Bank of the Small Business Administration and the District Export Council. Individual states are becoming increasingly active in encouraging, stimulating, and servicing medium and small businesses that wish to explore and expand into exporting. World Trade Centers, local trade associations, private consultants, export management companies, and private trade firms offer market research  services and other support. (YLB)",

        "description":"A survey of 255 owners of independent businesses in the Midwest investigated their planning activities. Findings indicate that a large majority of the owners of existing businesses engage in both long-term and short-term planning. They believe that some of their planning is beneficial. However, most believe that they are only moderately well organized and they are only moderately satisfied with their efforts. Educators can help small business owners improve the quality of their planning. They need to be familiar with a definition of planning and the seven most common types of plans: strategic, business, marketing, financial, human resource development, operation, and action. Most small businesses need only three main classes of plans: long range, program, and annual or budgets.  One widely held theory says that resistance to planning stems from resistance to change. Change is more acceptable when it is understood, does not threaten security, follows a series of successes, is inaugurated after prior change has been assimilated, and has been planned and if the organization has been trained to plan for improvement. Another important factor to consider is skepticism about the value of planning. Educators should be aware of potential problems and help business owners avoid them. They need to read books and go through the training process so they better understand and anticipate potential problems. (A planning resources bibliography cites 21 books and 17 articles. Twelve footnotes are appended.) (YLB)",

Findings showed that 62.7 percent of manufacturers attended at least one seminar in the last year. The term &quot;seminar&quot; had a better customer satisfaction rating than &quot;workshop&quot; did. The term &quot;class&quot; did not appeal to them. Workshops were not the preferred method of gaining knowledge; personal contacts were. Associates and suppliers offered more competition than consultants, degree-oriented courses, or government-sponsored programs. Manufacturers were not interested in for-credit courses. Relevance of the course was the primary criterion used when selecting programs. Long-term use was more important than immediate use.  Program cost ranked eighth out of 10 in terms of importance. High technology firms were a good market because they were more education oriented than other firms. Most manufacturers heard about programs through direct-mail campaigns. The primary challenge was to prove the value of education. Manufacturers did not assume that additional education could influence their firm's profit picture or competitive posture. (YLB)",

These three domains--cognitive, conative, and ecological--all make important contributions to understanding student achievement. Their collective influences should be understood when formulating an opinion of student achievement. Thus, assessment becomes holistic, considering not only achievement outcomes, but also the cognitive processes through which the learning occurs, the learning context, and the learner's attitudinal preferences. A comprehensive assessment approach includes a number of assumptions for developing and interpreting measures. These assumptions suggest a number of directions for the focus of assessment. Four  assessment alternatives--portfolio, exhibition, dynamic, and curriculum based--demonstrate characteristics that support the assumptions. Sensitive to the instructional needs of teachers, these alternatives also readily adapt to instructional settings, while addressing the three domains of learning. Moreover, they emphasize the measurement of student performances directly tied to instructional goals, so they could guide classroom curricula as well as measure short-term and long-term changes in students' knowledge.

        "description":"A pilot adult basic education (ABE) language experience curriculum was designed and implemented with older adults in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The objectives were to improve writing skills, to increase self-esteem, and to create a historical record of the area as seen through the eyes of the average older citizen who had lived through many eras. The writings were compiled into a book written by a cross-section of people. The book will become a component of selected social studies curricula throughout the county and will also be available at a local store. As a result of the project, the average reading gain was .4; the pre- and postcourse writing samples showed an average improvement of 12 points; and a self-esteem survey increased from pre- to postadministration by an  average of 15 points. Evaluation of the project revealed that the senior citizens were motivated by a desire to share their experiences, not by a need for academic gain, and they tended to remain in the class only as long as they were interested (the course enrollment dropped from 30 to 13 during the project). However, some students were extremely enthusiastic. (The document includes the writing sample evaluation scale, a self-esteem survey, a curriculum synopsis, and the book of reminiscences produced during the project.) (KC)",

The project had two components: (1) development and presentation of a series of three learner voting workshops; and (2) creation and presentation of a hands-on learning situation in which voting is simulated. All sessions were nonpartisan and stressed being an informed voter. The target audience was the 450 adult learners served by the Lancaster-Lebanon Literacy Council, 350 of whom were not registered to vote. Approximately 40-50 students participated in each workshop, and more than 100 new voters were registered. In addition, some of the students decided to become more active in the  political process, especially regarding literacy issues. Workshop participants were very favorable when asked to evaluate the sessions. (The report includes workshop materials.) (KC)",

Adult learners in two community-based programs representative of Philadelphia's literacy network participated in developing the project by meeting at least six times to discuss, plan, and execute the project. A manual was produced based on the input of these adult learners. The manual was developed around the topics of how to register to vote, how to use a voting machine, and the candidates for the primary election. In addition,  workshops were conducted for adult literacy providers and they, in turn, used the materials with their classes. As a result of the project, 17 students from participating literacy groups registered to vote and voted in the primary election. They felt they had gained more control of their lives and had more respect for the need for education. (The project report packet includes project materials such as workshop materials, field trip materials, lists of candidates, learner essays in Spanish, project publicity, and the manual (separately bound) developed during the project. The manual contains student materials for five lessons on the following topics: registering to vote, elections, voting machines, voting, and the need to vote, and a glossary.) (KC)",

        "description":"A project sought to determine if reluctant learners, about 30 percent of the adult basic education (ABE) population, can be retained in ABE classes through accommodations in the program structure and more effective teacher/counselor intervention. The project was based on earlier research findings that most ABE learners who drop out do so in the first 3 weeks and that often dropout is for attitudinal rather than situational factors. Four groups of five ABE students were selected and treated in one of four ways: a control group, a team approach, a small group approach, and a one-on-one approach. Learning style differences were also explored. The study found that the small group approach worked best. It also found that reluctant learners tend to be highly field dependent in their  learning style. From the project, a testing/counseling intake program to identify ABE reluctant learners was developed; program referral guidelines for intake staff for reluctant learners were provided; and recommendations for teaching reluctant learners were written, forming the basis for learning style teaching techniques for reluctant learners.

Participants in the family literacy program were 19 African-American adolescent mothers from low-income backgrounds whose children attended an early intervention program. Parents' beliefs about learning and literacy were sought through a series of peer group discussions. The data revealed a continuum of perspectives ranging from behavioral to constructivist beliefs, indicating that there may be important intragroup variability within a given sociocultural group. The discussions, however, also revealed shared goals that may be used to forge a collaborative relationship between parents and professionals to improve minority children's early education.  Illustrations from a family literacy program were used to show how parent beliefs may be incorporated into programmatic changes, building constructive relationships that work toward supporting children's success in schooling.

The model was created and implemented at three sites, and a set of guidelines for creating staff development opportunities for all adult literacy instructors was developed. Evaluation of the model used documentation of site visits, recommendations, types of follow-up on recommendations, use of assessment materials in classroom operation, and interviews with instructors and students. The study found that learning to use  informal assessment involves more than a knowledge base and assessment instruments. Instructors must understand what literacy learning is and is not before they can provide students with experiences that enable them to use their knowledge to construct meaning and assess their progress. The study concluded that instructors must do the following: know the extent of their knowledge about the purposes of literacy learning; understand how their curriculum addresses this understanding and how they can use assessment and portfolio development to create informed instruction; use the assessment instruments; and create assessment measures to suit their own teaching situations.

Faced with stiff global competition, corporate restructuring, and continuing federal budget constraints, the federal government can no longer afford to invest in a system that may waste resources and may not help people better compete for jobs. Despite decades of efforts to improve coordination of employment training program, conflicting eligibility requirements and differences in annual operating cycles are hampering the ability of programs to provide participants with needed services. Six different standards for defining &quot;low income,&quot; five definitions of family or household, and five definitions of what is included in income make determining who  is &quot;economically disadvantaged&quot; a complex process. Similarly, differences in age criteria for older worker and youth programs turn coordination into a jigsaw puzzle. Collectively, the current array of programs confuses and frustrates clients and program administrators, hampers the delivery of services tailored to clients' needs, and adds unnecessary administrative costs. Further, some programs do not have adequate tracking systems to know whether participants obtain jobs. A major structural overhaul is needed to create a customer-driven system that embodies four guiding principles: simplicity, tailored services, administrative efficiency, and accountability.

        "description":"A project was conducted to help adult educators in graduate education courses to examine their notions of adult learning, to be lifelong learners, and to engage in self-directed learning. The course was conducted in small self-formed learning groups, and 19 adult learners were observed from various perspectives: through a survey measuring the adult students' awareness of adult learning characteristics, through open-ended surveys, and through observations of the students' interactions with each other and their reflections on their own learning. The study found that the adult students had little knowledge of any of the four dimensions of adult learning. Many students were apprehensive about group work but actually found it helpful and meaningful. At the end of the class, all  students produced a school personnel manual (the object of the course). The most successful students had fully integrated their learning and produced a manual that was useful to them and that reflected their beliefs. They also asserted that they had learned a surprisingly large amount from their classmates and the group work--and that experience would be reflected in their future work.

The career guidance component was developed to provide at-risk adolescents with the experience of career exploration and information about themselves and the world of work as it relates to education and life. Two instruments were used to assess individual interests and personality traits: the Holland Self-Directed Search, and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. Career exploration was facilitated through use of the computer program Choices by Careerware. The personal development guidance counseling components consisted of 3 individual 20-minute sessions handled by 16 graduate students  who acted as counselors for at least 3 students each. The career guidance component served as a builder of self-esteem and an awareness of relationship to others. It also illustrated the student's part in the picture of life and the world of work. Many students realized how varied their interests were. Most important, students saw the relationship of education to salary and jobs through their investigations. They also realized that their likes, interests, skills, and capabilities were important in choosing a career. They learned about occupations they had not heard of before and discovered more detailed information on careers that they knew about. (Contains 10 references.) (KC)",

Since the publication of that article, suggestions have been made for additions to the typology \"tree\" proposed in the article. The typology categorizes adult education by its \"content-purpose\"; that is, the general content type that suggests its purpose. The six major limbs of this tree represent the major types of adult education: liberal, occupational, self-help, compensatory, scholastic, and social action. Several of these categories have subcategories. Self-directed learning is part of the roots of the tree, since all adult education is clearly institution based. The focus in this  revision is on social action and its political dimension. Social action is, by definition, political, and social action clearly implies an agenda for social (political) change. The tree is to be seen as part of a long tradition of categorizing the field of adult education; the image of a tree is appropriate since the effort is always growing and changing. (KC)",

Witnesses included officials from the U.S. Department of Labor, the General Accounting Office, consultants retained to evaluate the program, and several local Private Industry Councils (PICs). Testimony noted that approximately 36 million people face some type of employment barrier and are eligible to participate in JTPA programs, but fewer than 2.5 percent are actually being served, and only two-thirds of the participants are successfully completing their training and finding employment. According to a Labor Department official, JTPA programs have done a good job in training for occupational  skills and job search methods, but have not provided very much help in improving reading and mathematics skills in persons with deficiencies in these areas and have done little in the areas of persons with disabilities. Only about half the program participants found jobs after completing their programs; of these, only half found them through program assistance. More than half the jobs paid less than $5 per hour. Many of the JTPA programs operate in isolation and they fail to serve the most economically disadvantaged persons. However, PIC officials also offered examples of programs that have been very successful. (KC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to describe, discuss, and evaluate a workplace curriculum process in which teachers were actively involved in both constructing and teaching curricula. This process was developed by the Consortium for Worker Education (CWE), a group of 22 New York City labor unions through which 15,000 workers attend more than 300 classes at 40 sites annually. Data collection methods were as follows: a review of related literature; interviews with CWE administrators, teachers, and students; classroom observations; and examination of curriculum materials. The study explored the teacher's process in creating a workplace-based literacy curriculum, considering whether or not this is a feasible and effective method, and comparing it to other worker literacy development  approaches. The major finding of the study is that, because of the remarkable teachers CWE selects and the exemplary staff supervision and development, these classroom instructors were able both to develop and teach inventive and outstanding curricula. Shaped by the CWE philosophy, which is committed to the union concept and its social action agenda, teachers are steeped in a student-centered ideology that values teacher collaboration, student participation, and flexibility in content and presentation. (The report includes a list of 37 references and appendixes and the following program materials: interview and consent forms; examples of curriculum materials from three CWE classroom sites; and examples of a &quot;Workplace Handbook&quot; developed by CWE.)

        "description":"This comprehensive literature review examines the issues involved in practicing psychotherapy with African-American women, and explores the adaptive coping styles utilized by black women in a antagonistic environment. Attention is given to the exploration of traditional resources utilized by the black woman in coping with her environment, such as kin and family support, as well as the exploration of new coping styles to be utilized by African-American women in an effort to deal with their daily environmental stresses. The key to effective coping for the African-American woman may be flexibility. Spirituality is an important construct and coping strategy within the African-American culture. Religious consciousness and spirituality may serve as important coping mechanisms for  African-American women. Because current research on the African-American woman and mental health services suggests that the nature of the African-American woman's life lends itself to implementation of psychotherapeutic strategies, this paper focuses on ways in which traditional therapeutic processes can be adaptive in relation to the culture and ethnicity of the African-American woman. In conclusion, this paper identifies possible therapeutic interventions that will enhance the clinician's work with African-American women. (NB)",

        "author":["Canillas, Gregorio J."],
        "description":"This paper presents a review of the literature on African-American men and the psychotherapeutic process as a coping style. It describes the demographics of African-American men in treatment, reasons for seeking treatment, and common issues being presented in the psychotherapeutic session. Research suggesting that African-American men underutilize mental health services is presented, along with more recent research which suggests that African-American men do seek treatment for work-related issues and depression. Many of these issues are related to unconscious conflicts concerning passivity and aggression, and that many African-American men reported racism to be a causative factor in the development of their problems. It is hypothesized that African-American men enter treatment as  a result of the impact of a racist society and/or to develop more effective coping mechanisms. This paper explores adaptive coping mechanism utilized by African-American men. The important of understanding the impact of the social, political, and economic environment on developing adaptive coping mechanisms in African-American men is highlighted. Ways to help African-American men develop adaptive coping mechanisms are considered. It is recommended that future research focus on adaptive coping mechanisms used by this population as they have significant implications for the treatment of African-American men. (NB)",

        "author":["Wells, Tracey L."],
        "description":"All too often when issues arise concerning the &quot;underclass,&quot; African Americans, and more specifically African American males are disproportionately represented in that description. Black males have been referred to as endangered in areas of education, economics, health and overall self-efficacy. This data would suggest hopelessness in the black male's ability to overcome the multiple obstacles which an oppressive society have placed before him. However, it may be argued that within the context of oppression there are strengths, within the individual and community, which serve as mediating factors and all the African American male to overcome the obstacles which put him at risk. This has been thought of in contemporary terms as self-efficacy. Though this construct is useful, it is  limited in scope. By definition, it involves the capability to organize and integrate cognitive, social and behavioral skills into courses of action to serve innumerable purposes. A more culturally appropriate term to define the mechanism through which the black male copes with oppression may be &quot;learned effectiveness.&quot; This construct may be defined as an integration of one's sense of self (self-efficacy and self-esteem), one's orientation to African American culture (racial identity and world view), and one's orientation to dominant culture (perceptions of racism/oppression and acculturation), in the formation of a culturally specific coping mechanism. The purpose of the present study is to conduct preliminary research focused on empirical validation of the construct of learned  effectiveness, while contributing to a body of literature on positive copy styles of African Americans. This study seeks to establish construct and criterion validity for learned effectiveness as well as investigate intragroup variability on measures of this construct. (Author)",

        "author":["Boley, Ellen"],
        "description":"Although there have been technological and structural advances in the schools within the past 10 years, the social environment for young people has severely deteriorated. Teenage pregnancy, guns in schools, illegal drugs, homelessness, suicide, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, and unemployment are some of the negative mental and physical conditions that plague today's students. Consequently, more recent restructuring models have proposed the creation of a learning environment which emphasizes both cognitive and affective development. The opportunity for active involvement by school counselors in the current restructuring endeavor is obvious. Counselors, with their unique training in communication skills, problem solving, team and group facilitation, consultation, and  coordination, are in positions to play key roles in the current reformation taking place in the schools. It is imperative, however, that counselors thoroughly understand the movement if they are to actively participate. This article clearly defines the restructuring movement and specifically outlines a proposed role for school counselors. Restructuring is defined and major premises of restructuring are reviewed, as are a number of components of restructuring. The counselor's role during the planning, implementation, and evaluation stages of restructuring is described as two-fold: counselors are in a position to manage and coordinate the restructuring movement within the school and to restructure the guidance and counseling program so that it is an integral part of the school system.  Finally, special considerations and alternate delivery models are discussed. (NB)",

        "description":"This report covers the second year (1991-1992) of a 3-year study of substance abuse prevention and intervention programs in New York City public schools, which included a survey of 891 students who received substance abuse intervention services in the schools, plus a field study in 12 sample schools focusing on services that the first year's study had identified as warranting close attention, including peer programs, staff development, and parent involvement. Findings are reported which showed that the largest percentage of students receiving services were in the middle schools, and that these services typically included both individual and group counseling by Substance Abuse Prevention and Intervention Specialists (SAPIS). Other findings are cited in which between 30 and 50% of  students reported improvement in such areas as grades, relationships with teachers, and attendance after receiving these services. Chapter I of this report provides an introduction to the background of the project and the current study. Chapter II presents the results of the student survey. Chapter III discusses the SPARK Peer Players' role in the high school substance abuse prevention program. Chapter IV describes staff development offered by SAPIS and parent outreach efforts. Chapter V offers evaluators' conclusions and recommendations based on the data analyzed in this report. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"This paper presents a brief research synopsis of social speech, noting that the internalization of social speech plays an important role in the self-regulation of the personality. It then examines the phenomenon of relapse in alcohol addiction from the perspective of psycholinguistic research on inner speech, and suggests that maladaptive patterns of inner speech (arising from maladaptive patterns of social speech and self-talk) play a synergistic role in the inability of most addicts to maintain long-term sobriety. Filed observations of alcoholics-in-recovery are presented that suggest that dysfunctional patterns of inner speech may contribute to the high rates of relapse among recovering alcoholics. Approaches to further empirical study of this phenomenon are discussed, as are  some practical treatment approaches which involve changing addicts' patterns of self-talk. It is suggested in a section on milieu restructuring that some of the standard patterns of interaction adopted by traditional 12-step self-help groups may need to be modified, eliminated, or instituted within a more controlled context. The paper concludes that, through better self-management, a more directed therapeutic approach which focuses on the replacement of dysfunctional patterns of social speech with more adaptation-favoring patterns of self-regulatory speech and thinking is recommended.

        "description":"The most comprehensive nationwide research ever conducted on the juvenile detention and corrections field was a study by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) assessing conditions of confinement for juveniles and determining the extent to which those conditions conform to recognized national professional standards. The study covered all 984 public and private juvenile detention centers, reception centers, training schools, and ranches, camps, and farms in the United States. Youth halfway houses, shelters, and group homes; police lockups, adult jails, and prisons that hold juveniles tried and convicted as adults; and psychiatric and drug treatment programs were excluded. Data came from the 1991 Children in Custody census, a special mail survey sent to  all facilities, and 2-day site visits to 95 facilities. The study's findings suggest three major themes: (1) there are several areas in which problems in juvenile facilities are substantial and widespread, most notably living space, health care, security, and control of suicidal behavior; (2) findings do not support the premise that high levels of conformance to national recognized standards results in improved conditions of confinement; and (3) deficiencies were found to be distributed widely across facilities. This report presents a summary of the findings from the OJJDP study, provides an overview of conditions, examines areas with substantial and less substantial deficiencies, looks at areas with minimal deficiencies, and offers 19 recommendations to improve conditions of confinement  for juveniles.

Chapter 1 supplies a context for understanding the report and its findings. After a statistical overview of sample members' activities after receiving their high school equivalency certificate, Chapter 2 explores the meaning of progress for this group of young women. Chapters 3 through 5 cover the experiences of these young women in the  workplace, at school, and in their personal lives. Chapter 6 considers the women's backgrounds before they joined New Chance, then examines their experiences in the program, and, finally, considers their activities after leaving New Chance. Chapter 7 takes note of the significant degree of variation within the sample and its implications for program design. Chapter 8 reviews the study's key findings and then suggests lessons and possible directions for research, programs, and policies that arise from these findings. (NB)",

The 1987 survey was a comprehensive effort to obtain data from 1,000 students living on campus. The next three surveys used a brief format of 50 items, focusing on current counseling center clients. Subjects included 436 students in 1987, 112 of whom had used counseling center services; 116 students in 1990; 109 students in 1991; and 150 students in 1993; for a total of 487 respondents who had used counseling services. The 1987 survey was completed primarily by freshmen and sophomores, 74% of whom were women. Respondents to the three subsequent surveys were primarily juniors and seniors, and between 75% and 83% were women. When clients ranked their presenting  problems, depression and self-esteem were ranked highest in 1990; anxiety/stress in 1991; and relationship issues and self-esteem in 1993. All studies indicated that, in general, the students were satisfied with their counselor and the counseling they received, and felt welcomed by the receptionist. Many students felt counseling had helped them academically and may have been a contributing factor in their ability to stay in school. The three most positive responses were items which indicated that respondents would recommend the counseling center to a friend, would return if further help was needed, and believed that the counseling center provided needed services to students.

Campers took the test on the first day of camp (pretest) and then two weeks later at the camp's conclusion (posttest). All subjects showed a significant increase in self-esteem scores at the end of their camp experience with the older group scoring slightly higher on both the pre- and posttests. Improved self-esteem scores might arise from: (1) the various therapeutic elements of the camp; (2) the independence felt from an extended stay away from home; (3) campers responding favorably to the demand characteristics of the camp; or (4) an initial suppression of self-esteem among campers at  the camp's onset caused by separation anxiety. These factors could also explain differences in test scores between the two groups when one realizes that the older children were more prepared for introspection and self-exploration than the younger campers.

Results indicated that social adjustment was better for Anglos than it was for Asians and Latinos. African-Americans reported the most experiences of racism and Asians reported the least. Asians and Latinos who experienced racism adjusted less well academically and socially than Asian and Latino students not subject to racism. The social adjustment of African-American students who experienced racism was less than those who did not experience racism. Academic adjustment for African-Americans was not differentially affected by racism. That the college adjustment of  African-Americans was less affected by racism than it was for Asians and Latinos was explained in terms of possible differences in expectation, coping strategies, and intra-group support. Racism may have been more normative for African-Americans who were less surprised when it occurred. It was also reasoned that African-Americans may have had a greater sense of community and that this could have been an effective buffer against racism. (Author)",

The cooperative experience appeared to prepare students better to assume a functional role more quickly in their new  organizations than non co-op graduates. Cooperative graduates profited from their cooperative experiences by acquiring more effective learning strategies, accruing greater knowledge, and adjusting to organizational life more effectively.

        "description":"This conference presentation describes how Virginia Wesleyan College's (VWC) arbitration process, in conjunction with the ideas contained in Ernest Boyer's special report, &quot;Campus Life: In Search of Community&quot;, enhances the concept of community at VWC. The paper opens with a brief profile of VWC, a 1,400 student liberal arts school associated with the United Methodist Church, and then discusses the history of the VWC arbitration model. VWC's arbitration project arose from the concept of living and learning. This connection between the classroom and the dorm is also found in Boyer's report which is summarized, paying special attention to three of Boyer's six principles for day-to-day decision making (Just, Disciplined, Caring), and how these relate specifically to VWC and its  community arbitration system. Supporting materials include handouts providing terms and definitions for VWC's community arbitration along with an arbitration flowchart. The paper concludes that VWC's model works well in being sensitive to the &quot;Boyer&quot; principles by incorporating mediation, personal responsibility and a well-defined governance program.

        "description":"A study examined the impact of both gender and college experience on judgments of the importance of its factors that determine liking. Seniors and freshmen completed a survey on friend relationships. Participants provided demographic information about a best friend (i.e., where the friend is now, age, and sex), and rated the importance of similarity, proximity, familiarity, warmth, sincerity, competence, and physical attractiveness in the friendship. All subjects perceived sincerity, familiarity, and warmth to be more important than similarity, competence, proximity, and attractiveness. Likewise, similarity, competence, and proximity were all judged of equal importance, while similarity and competence were seen as more important than the friend's attractiveness. Freshmen found  familiarity to be more important than did seniors, while seniors ranked competence and attractiveness to be more important to a good relationship than did the freshmen. The results suggest that beliefs about the importance of the factors that contribute to liking differ as a function of age. Still in questions, however, is whether the judgments of the importance of these factors to liking are veridical, and whether a friendship's longevity influences a subject's understanding of importance of the factors that contribute to liking.

Two persons of average height and weight (either a male-male, male-female, or female-female combination) were positioned across from each other in a busy hallway such that there was adequate space to go around or between them, and observers noted whether approaching students using the hallway walked around or through the dyad. The proxemic behavior of 1081 persons was observed over a period of four weeks. In general, more people went around the dyads than between the dyads, however, when space violations alone were considered (i.e., those times that people went in between the talking dyad), the results  indicated that both men and women were more likely to go through two women rather than a man and a woman or two men. These findings demonstrate that when people violate space the space they violate will be women's (even when women do not explicitly yield their territory), and suggest that women are seen as having a lower status, every by other women.

Forty-one percent of the directors indicated an immediate need for difficult-to-provide services such as residential placement for both children and adults diagnosed with AIDS and the reluctance of social workers, daycare, and homecare providers to work with these clients. Ninety-three percent of the county directors believe that by 1997 clients with HIV/AIDS will place large demands on their services. Some of the specific areas to be affected include children and adult services, Medicaid, and transportation. Most directors said  that their staff had received basic training on the transmission and prevention of AIDS, but many of the directors expressed a need for training assistance for new employees. The survey lists the types of training desired by directors along with a list of recommendations and contains an appendix which lists the names, addresses and phone numbers of HIV/AIDS contact people for all of North Carolina's County DSS.

Copies of the book were distributed at regional conferences, state workshops, inservice workshops, and via direct mail. Techniques for choosing the purposive sample differed for each state, reflecting the rationale of describing the use of the book rather than evaluating the extent of its use. A total of 68 administrators, supervisors of reading programs, reading specialists, contact persons for statewide information services, school superintendents, principals, and faculty members of schools of education were interviewed. Tentative results indicated  that (1) the primary users of the publication were persons with inservice responsibilities; (2) characteristics that positively influenced the use of the publication included its content, a sound research base, its question-and-answer format, and the fact that teachers were used as a source of questions to be answered by research; (3) the publication was perceived to be particularly helpful when the individual or the organization placed top priority on reading; (4) effective dissemination strategies included presentation at workshops whose recipients have inservice responsibilities, and introduction of the book by someone or some institution which the recipient values or trusts; and (5) non-interactive strategies (direct mail of unsolicited single copies) were the least productive. Future  research should continue to focus on the relationship between dissemination strategies and use. (Several unnumbered tables of data are included.) (RS)",

Results indicated that as children began to learn how to read, parents began to diminish the amount of time spent reading aloud to their children. This evidence was seen as early as first grade.

        "description":"As a male professing feminism to his female elementary education students, an education professor faced problems, philosophically and pragmatically, as he and his students contested feminist theory and pedagogies in class. During the summer of 1986, 62 of his students conducted oral histories of retired or veteran teachers of literacy in the elementary grades. In retrospect, the professor is embarrassed by his patriarchal tone and his ready use of the teachers' oppressed work roles as a potentially desirable state. The construction of the teachers as heroes/heroines now seems a problematic rhetorical solution. Without acknowledging the oppression that they faced daily, the teachers who were interviewed and those who wrote about them, participated in the production of the  patriarchy. After completing the oral history workshop but before recognizing how little he had critically analyzed the project, the professor saw himself as a feminist teacher and began organizing his courses as such. However, his students in an advanced graduate seminar refused to engage in feminist dialectical exchanges, one of a series of contentious courses that the professor offered. Even with \"feminist intent,\" his patriarchal and occasionally sexist stances toward his students' work was not deconstructed or even named as an overt part of the workshop. As a male feminist, he can study and learn from feminism as an outsider. As a gay man attempting feminist informed teaching and knowing, the professor faces an additional layer of problems, as well as extra promise. (Contains 46  references.) (RS)",

Subjects, 32 children from 10 participating schools broadly representative of the Standard 4 population in Wellington, New Zealand, were identified through screening test and writing samples. A three-step remedial spelling program was developed. All children selected were given six sessions of 20-30 minutes of individual tutoring over a two- or three-week period. Multiple baseline data, pretests, posttests and a control condition characterize data collection procedures. Measures of spelling achievement  were combined to form seven sets of data. Results indicated that (1) participants' knowledge of short vowels and consonants increased significantly; (2) increased knowledge of short vowels did not transfer in a consistently measurable way to spelling in writing; (3) specific knowledge of short vowels and consonants were not related strongly to the other measures; (4) knowledge of short vowels did not predict later performance on the follow-up measures; (5) mean performance on the general spelling test showed some statistically insignificant increases; and (6) correlations between conventional spelling and phonetic spelling increased.

It is imperative that those with expertise in early childhood care and education insist on developmentally appropriate assessment practice and know why they are arguing for such practices. The &quot;Competent Children&quot; project's goal is to find out more about the influences of early childhood experiences on children's competencies as they enter school. The two strands of influences are family background and early childhood care and education. Attempts to align the project with the aims and goals of the National Curriculum have been made. Rather than focusing on only one or two  competencies, the Competent Children project will study numerous competencies (including early literacy, logical reasoning, communication skills, and social problem-solving) and end up with numerous sets of results because no one instrument to measure holistic learning holistically has been developed. It is not possible to offer high quality early childhood care and education without assessment; but, though difficult, assessment guidelines need to be worked on by early childhood educators.

Subjects, 404 high-risk college freshmen, were administered processing, cognitive, and learning styles tests. Results indicated that: (1) 84 students (20.8%) were identified; (2) significant correlation between &quot;failure&quot; and individual measures was found; (3) learning disabled students need to improve their cognitive abilities in vocabulary, comprehension, spelling, and arithmetic; (4) intervention in these areas should be made in conjunction with  processing adjustments in visual spatial, visual figure-ground, auditory, and visual-motor; and (5) the learning disabled students exhibited no preferred specific learning style, except in the areas of visual numeric and social group.

        "description":"Determining the appropriate amount and type of teacher and student input is a complex curriculum and instructional challenge for writing teachers. This paper describes a teacher-researcher's experiences while teaching a fifth-grade class and studying a developing writer's workshop approach to writing instruction. She investigated: (1) how students interpret literacy activities and how participation in social context stressing negotiation, shared responsibilities, student voice, and ownership influences students' self-images as writers, their writing, and their contributions to others' learning; and (2) how the teacher's role shapes students' interpretations. The paper discusses negotiation of the literacy curriculum in a writers' workshop, focusing on two female students'  participation and development as writers. Writing conferences, group work, collaborative writing, and sharing shaped these students' growing sense of ownership and proficiency and transformed the teacher's own role. Certain experiences in the curriculum-negotiation process can be viewed as \"sources for struggle\" among teachers and students. Teachers can use these experiences as rich resources for learning about students' interpretations of curriculum, their participation in the learning community, and the teacher's role in shaping interpretations. Growing mutual respect for variant teacher/student interpretations transcends curriculum \"control\" concerns; teachers gain by learning how to foster writing proficiency in all students. Two tables and one figure detailing aspects of the  classroom literacy environment and the writers' workshop are included. Contains 40 references. (Author/RS)",

After an introduction that presents an overview of what is meant by assessment, the booklet discusses the following 11 standards: (1) the interests of the student are paramount in assessment; (2) the primary purpose of assessment is to improve teaching and learning; (3) assessment must reflect and allow for critical inquiry into curriculum and instruction; (4) assessment must recognize and reflect the intellectually and socially complex nature of reading and writing and the important roles of school,  home, and society in literacy development; (5) assessment must be fair and equitable; (6) the consequences of an assessment procedure are the first, and most important, consideration in establishing the validity of the assessment; (7) the teacher is the most important agent of assessment; (8) the assessment process should involve multiple perspectives and sources of data; (9) assessment must be based in the school community; (10) all members of the educational community--students, parents, teachers, administrators, policy makers, and the public--must have a voice in the development, interpretation, and reporting of assessment; and (11) parents must be involved as active, essential participants in the assessment process. The booklet offers rationales and implications for each standard, and  some standards are accompanied with case studies. A glossary of assessment terminology is attached. (RS)",

        "author":["Poissant, Helene"],
        "description":"A study examined adult low-literate readers' knowledge of their cognitive skills. By better knowing this clientele from both the cognitive and metacognitive angles, several objectives could be met, including remedying a lack of knowledge in their assessment, and building a valid curriculum content closer to their needs. Many studies suggest that a metacognitive approach can give better results than an approach based solely on the mastery of cognitive competencies. The five female and four male low-literate readers studied (in Quebec) obtained scores below the norm on the digit span memory test, confirming some psycholinguistic hypotheses. Short-term memory has a limited retention capacity and processes information mainly in a phonological way. The fact that good readers generally  decode well helps short-term information processing. Faster word processing avoids an overload in short-term memory. Conversely, the beginning reader who decodes with difficulties rapidly clutters his or her short-term memory, which impairs comprehension. Data on metacognitive comprehension shows that few low-literate readers are aware of the relation between reading comprehension and decoding skills. Literate persons (such as the seven men and four women in a control group) establish this link more easily. In spite of these cognitive limitations, low-literate and literate readers do share some metacognitive knowledge. Two tables and a list of tasks and cognitive skills are included.

Ninety-six third-grade subjects were drawn from eight classrooms in four elementary schools in a mid-size metropolitan area in the southern United States. Within each class, six students were assigned to a study group and six to a control group. Each group was balanced for gender and ability as identified by the classroom teacher. Students were given pretests prior to having either an information book or an informational storybook concerning space or earth science read to them. Immediately after the reading, and again 6 weeks later, students completed a 10-item posttest. Results indicated that while the study  and control groups performed equally well on the pretest of subject matter prior knowledge, students who were read the informational storybook made greater gains in scores on both the posttest and the 6-week test than students who were read the information book. Findings suggest that information embedded in a narrative format may be more memorable than information in a straight expository format. (Three tables and two figures of data are included.

        "description":"A preliminary study sought to determine whether preschool, kindergarten, and first-grade children's analyses of English words were governed by perception of onsets and rimes or by perception of phonemes within onsets and rimes. Data were from several previous studies that used a 10-word invented spelling task. High percentages of the 135 preschool, kindergarten, and first grade inventive spellers with all lengths of words produced spellings that were considered unlikely if governed by attention to onsets and rimes rather than by attention to individual phonemes. The percentage of first graders who spelled consonant blends (78%) matches findings of an earlier study. Findings support a child-centered approach to early reading instruction. If children do not treat phonemes as more  difficult than onsets and rimes and are willing to work at the task of analyzing complex onsets and rimes, then it makes sense to use teaching strategies that encourage children's discovery of their own tasks.

Guiding principles that both andragogy and whole language share are: (1) active participation of learners; (2) use of real-life situations; (3) learners learn best when they have a need; and (4) learning is built upon past experiences. Whole language strategies suitable for the adult learner include: the language experience approach; use of meaningful texts; retelling and reacting; writing to solve everyday needs or problems; and strategy instruction. A middle-level manager in a large corporation worked in a tutorial situation for a year-and-a-half  to improve his reading and writing skills. The tutor used a variety of whole language approaches suitable for adult learners. To motivate the adult literacy learner, the tutor used the manager's Vietnam War experiences and his desire to read and write to and for his kindergarten child. Many adult literacy learners, such as this manager, can profit from instruction that combines whole language principles and andragogy. (RS)",

Reading comprehension was a statistically significant covariate.

Most students who were successful in  completing a search task used the book's index. The guiding questions appeared to have promoted success by increasing the likelihood that students would think of and actually use the index during their search.

        "author":["Oldfather, Penny"],
        "description":"Teachers' responsiveness to and empathic understanding of students' perceptions when they are not motivated are critical in promoting students' ownership of the literacy learning agenda; in helping students with their motivational difficulties; and in establishing classrooms that focus on the enhancement of caring. An interpretive study, conducted in a fifth/sixth-grade whole language classroom, provides insights about students' thoughts, feelings, and actions when not motivated for literacy tasks, and examines students' subjective experiences in three different motivational situations. Forty-eight classroom observations were conducted that included a series of 41 indepth interviews over an 8-month period. Results offer clues about the affective and cognitive processes that  enable some students to become engaged in literacy activities and prevent others from beginning them. Findings suggest that a responsive classroom culture that honors students' voices may enhance students' ownership of literacy learning and alleviate feelings of anger, anxiety, alienation, and powerlessness.

        "description":"The common thread that runs through the activities in a literacy course for undergraduate preservice teachers is text. One such activity is a literacy autobiography in which students focus on themselves as learners and teachers. Students are treated as professionals and make their own decisions about how they want to present themselves to their colleagues and their friends in the professional community. Among the students interest is broad and intense. Once completed, the literacy autobiographies are read aloud in small groups, discussed, and written about in students' journals. The commonalities and differences cultivate a discussion of readers and writers and how they got that way. Two other activities are professional development groups and \"kidwatching.\" Each group of  students reads one of the supplementary texts for the course and develops a presentation of the text for the whole class. To understand kidwatching, the students start by watching each other. A few students come to the center of the classroom and think and talk out loud as they prepare egg foo young using a wok--an elaborate and complex text that the instructor and students struggle to explain to each other. Texts such as these can be viewed as concentric rings which have spaces in them that allow the flow and overflow of learning to occur. (A figure illustrating concentric rings of texts is included; five references, the four required texts for the course, and the 11 supplemental texts for the course are attached.) (RS)",

Data included 516 pieces of writing done by the subject, transcriptions of interviews with the subject, and field notes. Results indicated that: (1) sources of the subject's writing ranged from extremely structured situations to &quot;creative writing time&quot;; (2) regular writing activities included phonics worksheets, books and stories, and formal handwriting; (3) infrequent writing activities included lists, captions, and journal writing; (4) nonlanguage functions of writing involved the subject's desire to be seen by the teachers as a good student and a good worker; (5) written language activity was also used to maintain order and quiet; and (6) written language activity also  assumed an economic function in the classroom--certain writing activities had to be completed before students were allowed to work at centers, read silently, or write about things they chose. Findings suggest that: teachers need to look at the function of each writer's engagement in written language activity to understand if the writer is writing the way &quot;real&quot; writers write; a writer's agenda is inextricably linked to ownership; and teachers may see richer, more authentic, and more powerful student writing if teachers allow writers to write from their own agendas rather than from the teacher's agenda.

Since many liberal studies majors transfer to San Diego State University at the beginning of their junior year, most of the portfolio samples are selected from courses in the upper division major. Portfolios must be completed by the beginning of the fifth week of the semester during which the student intends to graduate. The first part of the portfolio allows students to describe their background, explain why they chose a given specialization, and evaluate the major and the portfolio process. The main body of the portfolio includes 15 writing samples  selected from courses in seven major subject areas: language arts, mathematics, science, social science, arts and humanities, physical education, and human growth and development. Students are allowed to include up to nine free-choice, optional entries. Students are also required to write four &quot;connection&quot; essays which are not done as part of a class. Students who have completed portfolios demonstrate that they can synthesize what they have learned and apply it to new situations. (RS)",

Some parents testifying at hearings conducted by the United States Department of Education also rejected student journal writing and any speaking or writing assignments that called for the revelation of personal experiences. It is appropriate for teachers to remind students that effective writing often includes personal experience and concrete details, but the students should have the option of deciding what is to be shared with the teacher. Long before the hearings on the Hatch Amendment, textbook censors Norma and Mel Gabler  found what they charged were invasions of privacy in a variety of textbooks--they objected to questions that call for students' opinions or declarations of values. Charges of invasion of student privacy cannot be dismissed lightly. Teachers, counselors, and administrators must consider carefully the classroom questions, activities, and assignments that call for the revelation of private information about students and/or their families. Guidelines developed by the National Council of Teachers of English suggest that teachers: explain that journals are not diaries but are concerned with the content of courses; do something active and deliberate with what students write; and award points for journals but not grade them.

Even though the way writing is taught has shifted from a product- to a process-oriented approach, teachers' responding practices seem particularly resistant to modification. &quot;Practitioner lore&quot; suggests that students do not necessarily read or understand the comments teachers make on their papers. Also, all the fixing and correcting of mechanical errors, spelling, and grammar may be of no use because when students revise, a new set of problems arise for students. Sometimes, no responding at all can yield surprising results. Students' writing can improve with time, lots of writing experiences and feedback, and maturity--no matter what teachers  write on student papers. Other strategies can help improve students' writing: (1) provide opportunities in every class for every student to write, to read texts aloud, to listen to their own and others' papers, and to talk about writing; (2) open up the conversation of response in which the teacher is the only one reader/responder among many; (3) open up the conversation of evaluation; (4) provide students with alternative strategies for responding; (5) encourage students to read their papers carefully, listening to the words, ideas, and images; and (6) plan to publish. By doing less, teachers can be liberated, freed from the onerous task of endless responding to reclaim the pleasures of teaching writing. (RS)",

The report describes how the teacher established routines to make the unit work, and how the teacher felt that whole language teaching was exhausting yet personally rewarding and effective. The report also notes that the students reinforced the teacher's perceptions--they enjoyed the experience and were discovering how to compose and what it means to be authors. The report provides a formal analysis of students' writings to give a developmental picture of their writing abilities. The report suggests that students progressed in their  writing abilities because the teacher provided support and scaffolding for their learning by reinforcing achievements in writing and helping students extend their ideas. A discussion of the importance of the involvement of school faculty in the study, a description of the expressive autobiographic interview, the interview schedule, writing prompts, students' advice sheets, and transcripts of students' writings are attached.

        "description":"A study investigated whether gender differences in proscribed language behavior, attitudes, and beliefs would emerge from an anonymous self-report questionnaire. A total of 87 men and 87 women enrolled in 6 sections of a required sophomore course at a regional southeastern university voluntarily completed the questionnaire which was designed to check &quot;taboo&quot; language attitudes, beliefs, and usage in various situations. Results indicated that (1) a two-thirds majority of men and women believed that a double standard exists which assumes that taboo language is for the use of men, and that women who use taboo language are criticized for being unladylike; (2) although a majority of men and women believed that taboo language should be equally appropriate for women to use as it is for  men, the majority also believed that college women were less prone to use taboo language than college men; (3) the majority of respondents believed that swearing was a matter of morals, not just a matter of etiquette; (4) almost all subjects reported the use of taboo language with some degree of regularity; (5) male respondents rated themselves as more frequent users of taboo language than female respondents rated themselves; (6) male respondents also reported the use of taboo language in more public places than did female respondents; and (7) 55% of female respondents, compared to 24% of male respondents, reported venting emotion as their only reason for using taboo language. Findings suggest that traditional attitudes are still firmly entrenched in the fabric of southeastern subjects'  lives. (RS)",

        "description":"The question of where the line is often arises as tutors attempt to confine their tutoring within ethical boundaries suggested by the line image. On the surface, some issues look easy. To the question of whether tutors should offer advice on take-home test writing assignments, most writing center personnel would probably respond with &quot;absolutely not.&quot; However, in-class and take-home tests are not the same. There are no set answers to these and other issues. Each writing center functions within a special academic and political context and must address these contexts as it defines its role and policies. The professional staff at the Sheekey Writing Center at La Salle University offers help on grammar, mechanics, sentence structure (but not on the ideas expressed) in take-home test  assignments only after the teacher agrees. A panic-stricken student faced with a poem explication assignment proved a more difficult challenge. A combination of questions, modeling, mirroring, and hints enabled the student to break through his mental block. Tutors at the center inform students about the nature of plagiarism and the gravity of the offense. Even mundane policies should reflect a writing center's philosophy. Policies should be deliberate and purposeful and not the result of tradition or conformity to some abstract ideal. (RS)",

        "description":"Literatures created by American Indians illustrate the positive potential that expanding the literary canon has for helping to achieve a more democratic classroom. Expanding the idea of what constitutes a text worthy of study enhances students' degree of involvement in and sense of connection to curriculum content and helps them become better equipped to participate in democratic processes. Affording students meaningful reading experiences in response to a broadened, more extensive and inclusive set of reading choices increases the probability of their participation and involvement. Three recent young adult novels by American Indian authors include such culturally specific themes as: prejudice and discrimination toward Indians; hopelessness regarding the Indian situation;  mixed-blood ancestry; alienation from non-Indian peers; Indian/non Indian friendships; and capturing/recapturing tribal identity, spirituality, and traditions. Through exposure to the experiences of American Indians (and by extension, those of members of other racial and ethnic minority groups, as well as women), students gain a more complete understanding of the diversity of America.

Language diversity in the classroom is the focus of several essays in the second part of the book. Each essay in the second part of the book is followed by a response. The pairing of essays continues in the third section of the book, where issues such as who controls curricula and who sets the standards for curricula are addressed. The third part of the book also discuses national curriculum movements in New Zealand and the United  Kingdom; English as a Second Language pedagogies; and international underpinnings of the whole language movement. The initial essay in each set is a response to a paper presented at the conference; the second is the original presenter's reply to the author of the first essay.

Much of the course content centered on exploring, extending, and even transforming future secondary English teachers' beliefs about writing instruction and assessment. The culminating experience in the course was the development of a portfolio, a document which contained representative writing samples and demonstrated reflection and growth. The subject's portfolio was organized into six parts: personal history, personal writings, &quot;think&quot; pieces, biography of a &quot;think&quot; piece, student ethnographic project, and final retrospective piece. Qualitative analysis of the portfolio indicated that (1) throughout  her schooling, the subject struggled to find her voice, to feel confident in her own abilities; (2) the &quot;think&quot; pieces helped the subject to get a clearer picture of herself as a teacher; and (3) the mini-ethnographic project proved most meaningful for the subject. Findings suggest that through autobiographical narratives, mini-ethnographic projects, and other experiences, the subject (as well as the other preservice teachers in the course) began to take the first steps toward the construction of their own personally situated theories of teaching, learning, and assessment.

        "description":"A case study examined two preservice teachers' attitudes about literature and the teaching of literature, and examined whether a &quot;Teaching of Literature&quot; course for secondary English education majors influenced their attitudes. Data included in-depth, semi-structured interviews, participant observation, written artifacts (learning logs, portfolios, etc.) and the researcher's ongoing, reflective log. One subject enrolled in the program after a short career as a business executive in a major computing firm. He began the course wanting to learn &quot;techniques&quot; for teaching literature in secondary English classrooms and was uncomfortable with the response-centered literature curriculum presented in the course. Throughout the course, he persistently questioned the purposes of literature  for what he called &quot;non-English majors.&quot; Neither his conceptions of literature nor his attitudes towards students changed as a result of his experiences in the course. Unlike the first subject, the second subject (a member of a minority group) willingly struggled in the course to make sense of his previous encounters with literature and gradually began to view literature and the teaching of literature in new and powerful ways. The course offered the second subject a chance to develop his own voice as a future teacher. Findings suggest that teacher educators: (1) must become models of the kind of teaching they encourage; (2) should provide opportunities for prospective teachers to identify and examine their beliefs; and (3) should realize that their good intentions do not guarantee  results.

During the second session, time was split between editing and performing (with guitar accompaniment, microphone, and amplifier). Many students scrambled during the performances to revise or continue writing. The project was successful because: (1) students wrote in their own voices; (2) they were writing what they know best--themselves and their world; (3) the format of the blues poetry was successfully handled by almost all the students; and (4) the students were given a positive outlet for the attention they crave at this age level.

The diagnostic test which accompanies Houghton Mifflin's &quot;The Riverside Handbook&quot; was administered on a pretest-posttest basis. The same instructor taught both groups and had no knowledge of the experimental design. The treatment group was taught using the process approach. No formal grammar instruction was given to the treatment group. Both groups completed the same essay and other assignments as the treatment group. Results indicated that  the treatment group scored a higher number of correct answers on the posttest than did the control group, and the treatment group attempted to answer more test questions on the posttest than the control group did. Findings suggest that the process approach to teaching writing, which deemphasizes formal grammar instruction, may be more effective in improving students' knowledge of grammar than formal grammar instruction.

While scholarship on peer recruitment is scarce, the literature suggests two foundational principles that can serve as guides: colleges and universities must be willing to develop personal relationships with those students they are interested in recruiting; and students are better at &quot;painting the big picture&quot; than college personnel are. Certain peer-recruitment strategies can contribute to a competitive and progressive speech and debate program on any level: coaches can facilitate associations between high school and university competitors; students can refer individuals from their own high school program; undergraduates can  participate in the professional community; and students can make telephone calls, conduct campus tours, and accompany the coaching staff on prospect visits. Benefits of peer recruiting include: empowering new students by letting them know they feel wanted; creating bonds between the incoming student, the seasoned forensics competitor, and coaches or faculty sponsors; creating an openness among students; taking the sole recruiting burden off coaches; and instilling in students the value of responsibility. By remembering the foundational principles of relationship-building and honesty, observing various strategies of peer-recruitment, and understanding the benefits of allowing students to recruit students, most programs can become more successful in obtaining the kinds of individuals who  accept and thrive within their particular forensic cultures.

One such formula, modified from a methodology initially developed in response to a need at the Missouri Association of Forensic Activities (MAFA) intercollegiate tournament, is based on a percentage system. The formula is constructed on five main premises: quick tabulation; recognition of squad achievement; attempt at equity within debate as well as within individual events; equitable weighting between debate and individual events; and &quot;maximum entry possible&quot; as a reasonable goal. The formula was applied to a moderately-sized regional-draw invitational tournament. In terms of overall sweepstakes, this  particular tournament had no changes in the final rankings of its competing squads after re-tabulation using the modified MAFA formula, although a few changes occurred in individual events rankings. Whether or not this particular formula is worthy of wide-spread use remains to be seen: however, those who have used the methodology believe that it is a progressive step in the right direction. The methodology for scoring and the complete retabulation data (presented in numerous unnumbered tables) are included. (RS)",

Not only does downsizing affect the operational aspects of the restructured company, but also the interpersonal dynamics among the surviving organizational members. Generally, the academic literature on the impact of downsizing concentrates on three distinct stages: what to do before, during, and after the layoffs, but again, not on the communication implications of downsizing. The trade literature presents a different perspective on downsizing: it emphasizes downsizing as a process involving communication; it presents a more optimistic view than the  academic literature; and it provides prescriptive means for individuals to handle the downsizing process. Given the lack of attention paid to downsizing, future research is warranted. In addition to access, other problems that arise when studying downsizing and its effects on the survivors are: (1) the organization's priority list; (2) the ability to study the entire process; (3) deciding upon what research methods to employ; (4) the financial constraints of the organization; and (5) the organization's culture. Research questions that can provide an initial attempt at addressing the communication implications of downsizing involve: centralization/span of control; formal and informal networks; superior-subordinate relations; feedback; communicating the downsizing process to survivors;  socialization; effectiveness; and organizational integration. (Forty-six research questions are included; contains 68 references.) (RS)",

        "description":"An exploratory study focused on identifying editing values of a new mass medium, computer discussion groups known as Usenet newsgroups. A Usenet newsgroup is defined as a collection of articles grouped loosely by subject and accessible by nearly anyone with a computer and a modem. At present, most newsgroup users are affiliated with universities, the government, or the computer industry. Questionnaires were sent via e-mail to all current Usenet moderators. Of the 70 moderators who indicated they edited postings, 33 returned completed surveys. Results indicated that: (1) 72.7% of the moderators said that editing was either somewhat important or very important to group members; (2) for the most part, the moderators are not professional editors; (3) editing standards are not  generally high; (4) the values of usefulness and &quot;flaming&quot; were influential for the moderators; and (5) the moderators used 75% to 100% of the postings to their newsgroup, with most using nearly all the submissions. Findings suggest that the moderators act more as facilitators than gatekeepers in the usual journalistic sense; and that, if computer communication is indeed a new mass medium, mass communication researchers must consider new models for understanding it.

The study examined how the 12 subjects made meaning out of their schooling experience and identified various themes that emerged from the group sessions. The study also analyzed two milk commercials which depict the plight of two &quot;unsuccessful&quot; early teens who begin to drink milk and become &quot;successful&quot; older teens for genderizing of content.

        "description":"A study examined the collaborative process in young children and also the role that the collaborative process played in improving the quality of classroom instruction. Subjects were approximately 60 students in a grade 3/4 pod of two classroom teachers at the University Elementary School, Calgary. A teaching unit of 6 weeks duration dealing with Greek mythology was developed in which a number of plays were shared with the class as a whole, and then the students (working in small groups) developed, wrote, and staged plays. Data were collected through ongoing observations of students in the classroom, field notes, audio- and videotapes of selected small group sessions, and responses to questionnaires. Results indicated that: (1) formal and informal demonstration of the process of  collaboration proved to be an effective way of enhancing understanding of the concept; (2) teacher modeling of the collaborative process was useful and popular with students; (3) talk became the key element in the collaborative process; and (4) selecting group members on the basis of what could be accomplished in the group, rather than forming same-sex groups, allowed for new and innovative relationships to be formed among group members. Implications for instruction include: children need to have the collaborative process modelled for them; the language of collaboration needs to be inculcated in young children; and teacher direction is needed to ensure that collaboration is not restricted to same-sex arrangements.

Forty-four English-language television and radio PSA's produced under the &quot;America Responds to AIDS&quot; campaign were examined. Results indicated that the PSA's: (1) support cultural stereotypes of male carriers and female victims; (2) used inexplicit terminology; (3) employed fear appeals; (4) blocked access to helpful information with a government gatekeeper; and (5) empowered AIDS as an active social phenomena--rather than a medical problem--which attacks helpless victims.  Findings suggest that the PSA's supported &quot;traditional&quot; family and social relationships; denied homosexuals and other disenfranchised groups a voice in the fight against the disease; and failed to address behavioral changes needed to control the spread of HIV infection and AIDS.

        "description":"A study investigated the styles teachers exhibit while interacting with children in literacy-enriched play settings, whether teachers switch between several different styles, and how different play interaction styles affect children's play behaviors. Subjects, seven 4-year-olds enrolled in a university laboratory preschool class, a lead teacher, two regular teachers, and a teacher assistant, were videotaped interacting on two occasions for a total of two hours of video per teacher. Composition of the play group was determined by the lead teacher to ensure that the group was diverse, cooperative, and cohesive. Teachers interacted with the children in their normal manner. Each teacher was also interviewed. Results indicated that (1) the &quot;stage manager,&quot;&quot;co-player,&quot; and &quot;play  leader&quot; styles had a positive impact on children's oral language and the quality of their dramatizations; (2) with this particular group, the play leader style was the most effective for both dramatic and literacy play; (3) children did not sustain dramatic play when the teacher was uninvolved; and (4) when the teacher assumed the &quot;director&quot; role, the children's dramatic play became simple and repetitive. Findings suggest that teacher involvement can enhance children's pretend play, but that the teacher's play style is the critical variable. (Contains 3 figures of data and 16 references.) (RS)",

        "description":"The 4MAT system (an eight-step cycle of instruction that combines four learning style types and students' preferences for right-brain or left-brain modes of learning) can guide instructors in planning teaching strategies to meet students' diverse learning needs. Each of the eight steps of the system emphasizes one of the learning types and alternatives from right- to left-mode information processing. The eight steps are: (1) create an experience or connect to past experiences; (2) analyze the experience; (3) integrate reflections into concepts; (4) define concepts; (5) try out concepts; (6) extend learning; (7) have students evaluate their own applications; and (8) integrate application and experience. After a communication instructor used the system to develop teaching  strategies for numerous units of study, she noted an increase in student interest and better overall student performance. One such unit teaches students how to prepare effective call-to-action persuasive speeches and consists of four &quot;quadrants&quot; that: connect new concepts/processes with personal meaning to create a reason for learning; correlate learners' previous experience with concept formulation; provide students with an opportunity to practice and personalize the new concepts; and allow students to take action, teach themselves, and share what they have learned with others.

Fifty-one scholars identified through previous studies as being the most productive mass communication scholars during the years 1980 to 1985 were sent open-ended questionnaires. Although 31 of 51 surveys were returned (for a response rate of 60%), several of the respondents felt unable to identify key works in mass communication and journalism because their background was in speech communication. Results indicated that: (1) respondents found it much easier to identify &quot;classics&quot; in mass communication and  journalism than to identify &quot;contemporary&quot; core works; (2) several scholars bluntly stated that the field lacks a coherent center; (3) none of the journal articles receiving two or more nominations were published after 1976; and (4) scholars nominated as doing promising work included Steven Lacy, James Carey, Steven Chaffee, and Byron Reeves.

Assumptions underlying the course are that the small group communication class is a general education course (it may be the only communication class taken by undergraduate students); and whatever college students learn in the introductory small group communication class must be useful in other personal, professional, and community settings. Five elements comprise the approach: (1) students identify their own and others' unique approach to group work through communication styles; (2) the theory of group communication of the course uses a structural-function approach; (3) case studies are  used to make the practice lifelike; (4) a problem solving cycle is tied to communication styles; and (5) organized meetings procedures help facilitate the problem solving cycle. Five weeks are spent on learning and teaching a portion of the theory, and the remaining 11 weeks of the semester focus on the full problem solving cycle. Evaluation includes written tests, group work, written problem solving analysis reports, participation grades, and attendance.

Two such studies assessing the effectiveness of OCXC in non-speech courses highlight the difficulties involved in conducting research into course-content learning related to oral communication activities in communication-intensive courses. Four other studies sought to determine if interactive multimedia instruction (IMI) in oral communication enhanced oral communication competence. The most important outcome of these studies is the preliminary empirical documentation of the effectiveness of interactive multimedia instruction in teaching oral communication skills.

        "description":"This paper reviews the existing body of research on the relationship between communication apprehension (CA) and nonverbal behavior. The strengths and limitations of three different approaches are considered. Contextual approaches are studies of CA and nonverbal behavior in which the primary focus is on communicative context (public speaking, small groups, dyadic). Functional approaches examine the ways in which nonverbal signals combine to serve important communicative goals (expressing emotion, engaging in deception, managing conversations). Functional-contextual approaches focus on the dynamic interplay of function and context--both are integral features in theories and models of nonverbal communication. In the latter approach, CA is often studied as an important mediating  variable. The paper concludes with several suggestions for future directions in the study of communication anxiety and nonverbal behavior. (Contains 31 references.) (Author/RS)",

        "author":["Posner, Jeanne"],
        "description":"Psychological theories continue to dominate the study of interpersonal communication, as is evident from dozens of introductory interpersonal communication textbooks. The perspectives most consistently missing from interpersonal textbooks are sociopolitical analyses of relational communication patterns, analyses that locate relational &quot;problems&quot; and &quot;control&quot; in society, rather than in the individual. The exclusion of critical perspectives may result from the discourse and audience of introductory textbooks as well. The voices of radical theorists are difficult to translate into the &quot;polite&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot; vocabulary and tone that characterizes textbook writing. The introductory textbook is a mass medium written to appeal to the majority of the assumed audience--that is, white,  middle income, heterosexual students. Given the authority students often assign to information included in textbooks, the possible consequences of the bias may be significant. Consequences for students include: (1) when any perspective is promoted to the exclusion of others, there is a risk of indoctrination rather than education taking place; (2) the psychological bias may encourage the view that any human conflict can be overcome by changing communication style or behavior; and (3) a multitheoretical approach might encourage a more analytical and less personal method of studying interpersonal communication.

Students enrolled by permission of the instructor, and enrollment was limited to 30 students. The class rapidly filled to its 30-student limit, and a waiting list was maintained. The basic course is hybrid in nature, and an in-house text is used. The special section often started early so that time would be available to address problems and get all the assignments done. Partners were assigned the second week of the course. A caring, supportive classroom atmosphere was soon established. Student evaluations at midterm and at the end of the course were positive. Students completed a variety of survey instruments throughout the semester for research  purposes. The project was successful and will be repeated the next school year. (Contains 11 references.)

        "description":"As a critical activity, academic debate potentially offers its participants a wide choice in deciding how, and on what basis, a proposition can be defended or challenged. Despite this range of possibilities, CEDA (Cross Examination Debate Association) debate at the national level has developed a consistency in the types of arguments offered and the ways in which those arguments are expected to be refuted. As an argument community, CEDA's emerging national circuit has developed powerful norms which are enforcing a particular conception of &quot;good argument&quot; while at the same time limiting the possibility for discussions on the conditions of argument itself. Consensual standards of what is argumentatively appropriate have evolved which strongly favor specific and temporally-bound&quot;scenario&quot;-based interpretations and which discourage meta-argumentative and other philosophical critiques. While the existence of strong norms in an argumentative community may be beneficial, the current norms of the national-circuit CEDA community operate to limit creativity at the highest levels of competitive debate, and to severely restrict the possibilities for those forms of argumentative self-regulation which offer the best hope for maintaining the health of the activity in an environment relatively free of externally imposed norms.

        "description":"For Asian Americans, learning only the skills of verbal communication is not sufficient--they need to develop a sense of appreciation for eloquence, to understand the urgency of freedom of expression in a democratic society, and to internalize the value of speech as an instrument for self-enhancement. The remarkable differences between the East Asian cultures of China and Japan and the American culture make acculturation of East Asians into the mainstream of United States society extremely difficult. Characteristics of individualistic cultures include: the individual as an autonomous entity; egalitarianism; competitiveness; and self-reliance. Characteristics of collective cultures include: individuals as interdependent entities; hierarchism; cooperativeness; and self-denial.  Looked at positively, the experience of individualism, prominent in the American culture, espouses rights for personal freedom and enhancement, endorses the dignity and entitlement of ordinary persons before God, the law, and with other citizens. The long history of the East Asian cultures testifies to the merits of collectivism. The general attitude of East Asian people is toward language and verbalization involving fewer words, supported by the aesthetics of vagueness. In the western tradition, the importance of eloquence has been persistently emphasized ever since the days of Plato and Aristotle. Teaching and clarification of values as part of the curriculum is important for cultivating appreciation and sense of purpose in all the skills taught in speech communication.

The 12 subjects were attending a 3-day, 24-hour workshop in training before the beginning of the semester. All subjects were master's degree students in the speech communication consultancy program. During the workshop, public speaking anxiety was discussed and intervention techniques were explored briefly. Surveys were administered four weeks into the semester, following a director visitation, and during a 2-day, 12-hour winter workshop. Results indicated that the graduate students had varying degrees of public speaking anxiety; and that their concern, and gratefulness for help,  became evident when the problem was approached and intervention strategies offered. Results also indicated that finding out about speaking anxiety, through the use of surveys and discussions, proved to be a positive and useful one for the students. Findings suggest that directors of basic public speaking programs should: (1) address public speaking anxiety as a unit in teaching assistant training; (2) offer an open door for continuing help in this area; (3) encourage teaching assistants to offer help to students in this area; and (4) research this area further.

The first is a newsletter aimed at historically African-American churches and the second is an award-winning video. The newsletter, &quot;Staying in Touch,&quot; is written and edited by Memphis State students and faculty. It provides high school students and churches with news about pressing issues in the African-American community and about the achievement of MSU's African-American students. The newsletter also serves as a primary communication for the ministerial liaison program, which was established to bridge the gap  between MSU and the historically African-American churches in and around Memphis. &quot;Step into Memphis State University&quot; is a 20-minute video produced by a communication professor and a graduate student at MSU. The video is designed to show the minority population that a black student can have a black experience at MSU. The video is organized around a step-dance competition. The fun-oriented group-inclusive video directly meets the challenge of recruiting students who already know of MSU's high academic standards, its academic programs, and its active athletic program. These two approaches have worked well to increase the number of quality African-American students at MSU. (RS)",

The communication functions of MNE's are an increasingly important focus for students of organizational communication. Students need to understand the global nature of international business and economics, how to analyze social and cultural aspects of &quot;local&quot; countries, and how to adapt their messages to account for individual country differences. Several methods can be used for building both a global and country perspective into the organizational communication curriculum; they include: (1) studying general information about  international issues and &quot;local&quot; concerns about which students should be aware; (2) providing specific content areas of a global nature to be treated in an in-depth manner; (3) introducing knowledge of specific countries or regions; (4) using case studies; (5) using campus resources; (6) incorporating global examples into topics already covered in the organizational communication course; and (7) assigning student projects that include a global perspective.

        "description":"Two debate rounds offered at the National Parliamentary Debate Association (NPDA) illustrate how debate could offer both style (the ability to communicate well) and substance (a message of significance and purpose). With the resolution &quot;idealism is better than realism,&quot; debaters and judges were transported into a &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoon. Both teams ended up arguing in favor of Popeye breaking up with Olive Oyl but for different reasons: it was the ideal thing to do according to the government team, and the realistic thing to do according to the opposition. However, the Popeye round fails to pass the tests for effective arguments by example--the example of Popeye is not relevant, only one example is offered, and the example is not typical. Problems arise when parliamentary debaters argue  by example and attempt to use examples as claims. Another debate resolved that &quot;this house should tear down walls.&quot; The government team discussed tearing down walls in relation to the barriers that keep the United States from funding the space program, and the &quot;house&quot; was the appropriations committee. The government team and the opposition team provided legitimate arguments supported by general knowledge evidence to produce a superior debate about real issues. Unfortunately, parliamentary debate does not always have argumentation at its heart because examples are being offered as claims rather than as evidence. Style and effective delivery are important to the development of competitive debate, but style should not be a substitute for substance. (RS)",

Despite a strong endorsement of the text, the instructor had some reservations. For example, although the inclusion of answers at the end of the book is a popular feature for students, its instructional value is questionable. The stated purpose of the course was to offer students a greater awareness of his/her democratic heritage and the responsibilities of effective leadership in groups that use parliamentary procedure when making decisions. Class activities included: lectures, role playing in small groups, reports about attendance at  meetings outside of class, quizzes, a mid-term exam, and a final exam. Some small-group activities worked well, but there were some difficulties with extemporaneous and impromptu &quot;original&quot; main motions and nonscripted dialogue. The Hearst text assisted in reducing the length of lectures to coincide with the attention span of more activity-oriented students. Few students expressed opinions about the text. Some students have used the parliamentary procedures they learned in the course in student government and other contexts. The Hearst text, because it represents a synthesis of basic concepts the instructor learned over the years, was invaluable to the instructor. (RS)",

        "description":"Many topics have been discussed over the lifespan of CEDA (Cross Examination Debate Association) debate, but the topic of judge adaptation (debaters adapting to each judge) is consistently ignored. Lay judges normally do not comprehend the debate process. To many debaters, lay judges are the most difficult to adapt to. The biggest problem with using lay judges is the lack of a predetermined criterion to determine the winner. Inconsistency in judging philosophies is not new and is largely responsible for the inconsistent records of debate teams. Some judges have an &quot;anything goes&quot; attitude towards judging debate rounds. These judges, often referred to as &quot;tabula rasa,&quot; should rethink their ways. Without any proper criteria, debaters are forced to do what they feel is necessary to  win the round. Tabula rasa judges give the debaters the freedom to be undisciplined and make it more difficult for debaters to adapt to the judges. Debaters face a more difficult challenge when they break to &quot;out rounds.&quot; One way for everyone to have a well-defined philosophy, one that debaters can know exactly, is for judges to complete a questionnaire on such topics as what the judge considers a voting issue, what he/she is looking for in a debate round and from debaters, and where they stand on specific topics. Debaters would be better off than they are now if lay judges were equipped with basic vocabulary, structure, a brief background of debate, and clear criteria to determine the winner of the round.

        "description":"This document describes South Carolina's progress during 1991-92 toward achieving the six National Education Goals, first formulated at a meeting between the U.S. president and the 50 state governors in September, 1989. The goals, which are listed at the beginning of this report, are targeted respectively at: (1) school readiness; (2) school completion; (3) student achievement and citizenship; (4) science and math attainment second to none; (5) adult literacy and lifelong learning; and (6) safe, disciplined, and drug-free schools. Each chapter presents the following information related to each national goal: (1) South Carolina's performance toward that goal; (2) factors that influence the state's progress; (3) an overview of the current service-delivery system; (4) an analysis of  the current services' effectiveness; and (5) recommendations for action. Findings indicate that far too many children in South Carolina do not reach schools ready to learn. Ensuring school readiness requires providing conditions at home, in communities, and at school, in which healthy development can occur. The overall rate of eighth-grade students earning a high-school diploma or GED is 70 percent; minority male students drop out at a slightly higher rate than nonminority males. Disparities in academic achievement exist according to race and gender. In regard to science and mathematics lack of agreement on what all students need to know plus a shortage of teachers trained in these fields constitute two major problems. Findings also indicate that enrollment in adult-education programs has  increased since 1990-91. Finally, the reported incidence of alcohol and other drug use among the state's school-age population is, overall, significantly below national indicators. A total of 80 figures and lists of contributing agency heads and South Carolina Education Goals Panel members are included. The appendix contains a copy of the governor's executive order to create the Education Goals Panel. A separately-published 7-page &quot;Executive Summary&quot; has been appended. (LMI)",

        "description":"This document is the second in a 5-year series of reports presented to the Prichard Committee, which monitors the progress of school reform in Kentucky. Three sections examine different aspects of the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA)--primary school programs, school-based decision making (SBDM), and family-resource and youth-services centers. The report on primary education examined nine schools that implemented KERA mandates for primary programs. Findings indicate a need for teacher guidance in authentic assessment, development of a statewide curriculum, and funding for instructional supplies and materials. Other concerns involved problematic student grouping patterns, confusion about the law, and a low level of parent involvement. The section on SBDM notes that the KERA  requires most Kentucky schools to form SBDM councils by 1996. Data derived from interviews with various stakeholders showed that participants in SBDM councils are concerned with the short (1-year) term length, the low level of parent participation, inadequate training of council members in group-process skills, and new faculty and district roles. The third section substantiates findings of a 1992 report, which found that the Family Resource Centers program within the KERA was well designed and effectively implemented. However, issues in evaluation and implementation are raised. (LMI)",

        "description":"Focusing on the area of student participation, this paper considers the findings of a research project conducted by a team at the University of Western Sydney, Nepean, and funded by the New South Wales Department of School Education. The project was broadly focused on investigating the dynamics of communication within the school communities of comprehensive high schools. Data were drawn initially from nine comprehensive high schools in western Sydney. A total of 2,713 students drawn from Years 9 and 11 (generally 14-17 year olds), 232 teachers, 622 parents, and 44 business representatives participated in this phase of the project. Three case studies were then selected from this initial sample for further study. Data confirmed many well-documented negative student attitudes toward  secondary schooling. It also found that efforts to involve students in school decision making through student government were not understood or appreciated by teachers and students. Interestingly, however, the data also indicated a surprising degree of congruence between student and teacher attitudes on a range of issues pertaining to secondary education. Neither students nor teachers seemed to appreciate this congruence. Essentially this study focused on the processes through which schools engage in building an ethos and the means used to communicate among staff, students, parents, and the wider community. Implications are drawn from the data, and improvements in school initiatives in student participation are suggested. (Author/KDP)",

Data were drawn initially from nine schools in western Sydney, with three of these schools being the subject of indepth followup study. The project addressed three major focus areas: (1) the expectations of students' educational needs held by students, teachers, parents and business; (2) the communication processes at work within schools and between schools and their communities concerning education; and (3) the essential characteristics of effective communication. These studies revealed the significant role played by senior school executives,  particularly the principal, in the development of communication methods in schools and their influence on school culture and climate. Decision-making and communication methods in the three schools are examined within the context of each school's environment and implications are drawn for school leadership; staff morale; and staff, student and community attitudes.

This blueprint constitutes the final report of the Committee and is an intentionally broad-based framework designed to move education in Iowa forward into the 21st century. The committee was separated into three groups: school structures, authority, and accountability; human and technological resources and investments; and student learning and development. The three groups each submitted a vision statement, goals, and objectives. The committee's  recomdmendations to the Legislative Council and the General Assembly were that: (1) the General Assembly consider and indicate support for the vision statements, goals, and objectives adopted by the committee; (2) the Legislative Service Bureau draft a school-transformation-enabling bill that would support the vision statements, goals, and objectives; and (3) the state initiate the coordination of a design for a computer for specific use by Iowa's students, their parents, and other learners.

        "description":"This paper presents an overview and description of &quot;significant&quot; education legislation passed during the 1993 Utah Legislative Session. Specific attention is given to legislation that affects the governance and structure of education in the state. The centerpiece of the Governor's educational agenda and the definitive action of the 1993 Legislative Session was HB 100: The Centennial Schools Program. HB 100 represents an attempt in Utah to move toward site-based governance in public education. Although many questions surround its viability as an instrument of reform, the Centennial Schools Program is likely to remain an important part of the Governor's educational agenda. Other reforms addressed include the following: class size reduction; amendments to the state's public  school-choice laws; revision of the Coordinated Service for Children and Youth At-Risk Act, and expansion of the role of the state's Strategic Planning Task Force on Education. Other than the Centennial Schools Program, none of the actions taken by the 1993 Legislature represent a radical departure from existing educational practices. Most represent refinements to existing legislation or the codification of that which reflects the ideas and philosophy expressed in the Strategic Plan for Public Education adopted by the Legislature in 1991. Two tables and a list of concerns about the Centennial Schools Program are included. (Author/LMI)",

        "description":"This paper examines the multiple challenges that emerged during the development of professional community in a middle school that attempted to decentralize decision making. Kruse and Louis' (1993) framework of the dimensions of professional community is used to analyze qualitative data collected at Whitehead Magnet School (located in a large metropolitan school district on the West Coast) over a 4-year period. The framework consists of five structural preconditions and six human-resource dimensions. Five overall characteristics of a professional community include: reflective dialogue, deprivatization of practice, a focus on learning, collaboration, and shared values. The structural preconditions of a professional community were in place at Whitehead; however, teachers reported a  lack of trust among the staff. Barriers to developing a professional community revolved around contextual, leadership, and structural factors: a lack of widespread, long-lasting district support; lack of open communication of the school vision; and a teacher-leadership structure that did not empower all teachers. Although Whitehead had some success in piloting a nontraditional learning experience for its students, it has yet to develop a professional community. Successful development of a professional community requires a team of teacher leaders with a more participatory philosophy and experience. (LMI)",

The FANS project, based at Bryson Middle School in Greenville County School District, South Carolina, collaborated with the county mental health center to offer school-based mental health services to students and their families. The project's staffing, budget, initiation, and collaboration, and role of school leaders are described. FANS also provided alternative functions: a collaborative, in-school, intervention plan for nonviolent criminal offenders; systemic interventions for at-risk students; and counseling for special education students. The project has reduced the social stigma of mental health issues. An 18-month  evaluation of 59 sixth-graders indicated an increase in social bonding and improved academic performance. Although structural approaches vary by site, four components are constant in this type of school-based service delivery model. Such a program must: (1) address all student needs that hinder success in school; (2) include traditional clinical and nontraditional group approaches; (3) promote collegiality among the mental health and school staffs; and (4) constitute a true collaborative effort.

        "description":"The federal government initiated educational reform measures in the United States long before the subject became a matter of national concern. In recent decades, reform has focused on helping children whose special needs were neglected by the school system. Evidence shows that these efforts have improved services to neglected groups, but without increases in federal funding. Still, the role of the federal government in shaping elementary and secondary education is likely to grow during the 1990s. That role is more likely to be in systemic school reform through the design of curricula, model texts, tests, equipment, and the hiring of staff to free up teachers for instruction. Improving preschool education and the transition from school to work will also be emphasized. This report  suggests that federal intervention is necessary if systemic education reform is to be successful. Included is a review of major federal initiatives from Head Start through high school. Other topics discussed are: Chapter 1, students with disabilities (special) education, bilingual education, and vocational education. Reforms outside the school system, improving the basic educational system through national standards and tests, teacher education, text and equipment improvement, staff increases, and school-to-work programs are also considered. A general overview of federal education policy concludes the document. (JPT)",

This paper presents findings of a study that examined the effect of state-mandated teacher evaluations on: (1) teacher performance, and (2) the nature and amount of supervision provided to teachers. Data were derived from a survey of 58 teachers from 21 Tennessee school districts. Only three percent of respondents said that they had received supervision for purposes other than evaluation; almost all reported that they had been supervised for evaluation purposes. In addition, most of the teachers believed that the supervision had little influence on their classroom instruction. They wanted and valued instructional supervision, but did not receive it. Finally, the findings indicate that  building-level administrators played a major role in realizing the expectations of Tennessee's state-mandated evaluation system. (LMI)",

A survey of 500 principals (416 from public schools and 84 from private schools) in 5 southeastern states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi) elicited a composite response rate of 52 percent (210 public schools, 84 private schools). Thirty percent of the public-school principals and 90 percent of the private-school principals supported educational vouchers. White principals believed that vouchers would have a strong negative effect on schools; black principals said that the effect would be slightly negative. The independent variables of type of K-12 school attended, years of administrative experience, education level,  race, and gender had no significant effects on principals' perceptions of vouchers. The degree to which principals supported vouchers appears to be directly related to how they believe it will affect their schools or jobs. Their attitudes may be rooted in financial and personal reasons, rather than in consideration of the effects on education. Sixteen tables are included. (LMI)",

The 1992 Regional Needs Assessment had three objectives: (1) to identify current and emerging issues affecting educators in the Northwest; (2) to identify research and development needs related to these issues; and (3) to assess implications of these issues and needs for NWREL program and policy development. Research and surveys determined the following issues of concern: systemic change, school finance, curriculum and instruction, meeting all students' needs, defining and assessing outcomes, engaging the community, teacher support and respect, and technology. Research and development needs as well as dissemination of  information and service are also concerns of Northwest educators. The implications of these changes and needs for NWREL are many. NWREL must expand its support of systemic change, further strategies for service integration and collaboration, and increase curriculum and instructional assistance. Also, the NWREL must increase support for student assessment, help schools meet all student needs, increase family and community involvement, and coordinate school finance and resource issues.

        "description":"This document contains six chapters that examine the role of teacher leadership in the school-restructuring process. Chapter 1, \"When--Teachers Lead\" (Bruce S. Cooper), provides a general introduction to the content and purpose of the monograph. Chapter 2, \"When--Teachers Share School-Level Decision-Making\" (Sharon Conley and Justo Robles), explores the role of teachers in helping to manage individual schools in an organizational context of collective bargaining, conflict, and coalition behavior. Chapter 3, \"When--Teachers Run Schools\" (Bruce S. Cooper), examines teachers in the role of administrators. The role of teachers in redesigning and restructuring schools is explored in the fourth chapter, \"When--Teachers Re-design Schools around Teaching\" (Roberta Trachtman). Chapter 5,\"When--Teachers are School-District Decision Makers\" (Mark A. Smylie), focuses on the whole school organization and the districtwide role of teachers as part of system decision making. The final chapter, \"When Is Now: A Plan of Action\" (Ann Weaver Hart), integrates the major themes of this monograph--including teachers as local decision makers, school leaders, and districtwide policy makers--and examines the implications for school administration.

        "description":"While examining the broader educational reform movement from a critical perspective, this essay focuses on the national political manifestation of that movement--America 2000. In contrast to more traditional critiques of America 2000, this analysis argues the basic conflict between this reform effort and an \"emancipatory definition of substantive democracy.\" The current infatuation with the market is strongly criticized and the case is made that current reforms, including America 2000, present an agenda that abstracts equity from excellence and social responsibility. What has been valorized in this new language of leadership is an elitist view of schooling based on a celebration of cultural uniformity, the reprivatization of public schools, uncritical support for remaking school  curricula in the interest of labor-market imperatives, and a return to the transmission model of learning. In conclusion, prospective and existing educators and cultural workers should be given the opportunity to develop the following elements of a language of critique and possibility: (1) a language of historical perspective; (2) a language of social criticism; (3) a language of remembrance; (4) a language of critical imagination; and (5) a language that challenges the \"money-and-missiles sense of reality.\" (LMI)",

        "description":"Education law changes rapidly, making it difficult to understand and administer. Even when it is understood, school boards and administrators often must make legal decisions contrary to their own value systems. One way to lessen these conflicts is preventive law, the voluntary revision of school district policies and procedures to lessen or eliminate potential litigation. Chapter 1 of this report covers perspectives on preventive education law. It stresses that the greater the use of preventive law strategies, the less the need for conflict resolution through litigation. Chapter 2 reviews the history of education law and litigation in the United States and presents the political-administrative model for conflict resolution. Conflict settlement through the judicial process is  presented as well as efforts to create a new administrative model for dealing with legal conflict. The emerging concept of preventive law and its promise for avoiding legal conflict is the topic of chapter 3. The origins of preventive education law are covered and a new model for preventive law is offered. Chapter 4 includes preventive law strategies: increased communication among educators and parents, better understanding of education law, stronger implementation of policies and procedures, internal review of school district policy, and an external preventive law audit.

Proponents who advocate the institutionalization of collaborative action research point to its theoretical rationale, a growing research base that documents the value and outcomes of the process, and supporting research on educational change. Opponents cite lack of proof, possible negative effects of institutionalization, and the lack of necessary conditions for successful implementation as reasons against institutionalization. Suggestions for developing collaborative action research in schools include: (1) explicitly operationalize the process; (2) ensure that participants have the necessary attitudes, knowledge, skills, and access to  resources; (3) provide teachers with incentives and released time, or restructure the school day; and (4) conduct additional research on the process and its effects. A conclusion is that collaborative action research is a teacher-friendly process that directly addresses educational practice over time. It directly, actively, and collaboratively involves practitioners in creating and studying change. (LMI)",

Some of the challenges stem from changes in the family structure, lack of family resources, opposition from educators, and larger and more compartmentalized high schools. Different types of parent-school cooperation, as identified by Epstein (1992), are highlighted in the second section. These are categorized as: (1) basic obligations of families; (2) basic obligations of schools; (3) involvement at school; (4) involvement in learning activities at home; (5) involvement in decision making, governance, and advocacy; and (6) collaboration with  community organizations. The third part outlines the following strategies used by middle schools and high schools to encourage parent involvement: developing parent empowerment, creating three-way partnerships, going to school instead of work, expanding the education of parents, and bridging the cultural gaps.

It compares and contrasts 1983 and 1993 across a variety of aspects: (1) the changing constellation of power and authority in school reform; (2) the changes in the capacity of the system to undertake reform; and (3) new directions in the mechanisms of state policies directly targeted on classroom instruction. Major changes that have occurred since 1983 include a policy shift from input-focused education to a focus on results and systemic reform, a rise in the power of local educators and leaders, a closer examination of the capacity of states and local governments to implement reform, and the development of curricular frameworks and assessment  instruments (particularly, testing). This report includes an abstract, introduction, overview, and three sections on the players, capacity for reform, and policy instruments. Appendices contain four case studies of educational reform in California, Florida, Georgia, and Minnesota. (Contains 126 references.) (LMI)",

Victims of campus crime, relatives of murdered students, administrators, law enforcers involved in campus safety, and students who themselves committed crimes in school spoke at the hearing. Witnesses at the hearing made a number of recommendations on how to decrease the number of violent incidences on campus. Issues of gang involvement in the rise of campus crime, the effects that growing up in a dysfunctional family have on a child's propensity to become violent, what teachers can do to instill antidrug and anticrime sentiment in students, and why blame for rising crime in suburban schools is being placed on  busing were all discussed at the hearing. Witnesses endorsed various security measures to ensure students' safety. A district hearings officer summed up the feelings of most at the hearing, saying that crime in schools is a product of today's society and can only be decreased by large societal changes. (KDP)",

A community program in Los Angeles, Community Youth Gang Services,&quot; is a crisis intervention team working with at-risk teens. Both of these community programs are being examined as successful ways communities are becoming involved in fighting crime and drugs. A second way schools are looking into fighting crime is teaching crime prevention programs to educators. The &quot;Boston Conflict Resolution Program&quot; is helping students and teachers learn to deal with conflicts that arise in school situations. Most educational administrators agree that to get any program to work  the students must be involved in the anticrime and antidrug efforts. Suggestions on how to decrease weapons in school range from metal detectors at school entrances, to open cubbies instead of lockers. Why schools are experiencing discipline problems, and what effective discipline policies must contain are outlined in the paper. Two short profiles are presented of communities in Ohio and California who are coping with drug use and gangs.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to offer an alternative explanation of why the Office of Educational Research and Improvement, and educational research in general, has such a low status and its connection to education reform is so remote. Emphasis placed on the differences that divide reformers, researchers, and educators instead of similarities that bind them together lie at the root of why the educational system is still at risk after a decade of reform. A specific group needs to focus attention on how available knowledge is being used. The current system of top-down reform is not working effectively because it does not give teachers and educational professionals a voice in formulating educational-reform policies that they are asked to implement. Imposing educational reform on  teachers contradicts a democratic value that says those who are affected by a decision should have a voice in making that decision. Recommendations to improve the status of educational research include the following: (1) reexamine the traditional assumptions of educational research; (2) focus more closely on the &quot;democratic socio-technical&quot; model, by Wirth; (3) encourage values that bring us together as democratic citizens; and (4) bring more teachers into the process of educational research.

The Diocese of Parramatta, a system of 73 primary and secondary Catholic schools, implemented system-level practices that embody elements of Fullan's (1987) notions of support and pressure. The implementation and relationship of five school-development practices are described: school development processes, principal appraisal, professional development for principals, professional development for teachers, and teacher supervision. Pressure is present in the school-development and appraisal processes, and support exists in the form of teacher and professional development, supervision, and provision of consultancy and resources. A systemic  framework for school effectiveness has been developed, based on commonly accepted wisdom about the role of the principal, the significance of professional development, and the interdependence of school development, appraisal, and professional development.

Harrison's (1979) model of the school as a socio-technical system is used to explore current changes in the locus on decision making in New South Wales schools. Within this model, a school is comprised of four interacting subsystems--curriculum, structure, resource utilization, and human relationships. Focusing on curriculum and administration over three periods in Australian education (pre-1971; 1971-89; and 1990-present), the paper concludes that there has been a fundamental mismatch between the practice of curriculum decision making and that of administration since the early 1970s. An  increase in school-based curriculum development (SBCD) was accompanied by schools' lack of access to and control over the resource utilization and structure subsystems. Despite their lack of power over administrative aspects, however, many teachers and schools successfully implemented SBDC. The future may entail trading the freedom to make curriculum decisions at the school level for a degree of freedom to make resource and structure decisions at the school level. A concern is the possible deskilling of teachers. One figure is included. (LMI)",

Findings indicate that despite the presence of support structures and a high level of teacher involvement in curriculum planning, several initiatives did not find expression in the classroom. Teachers did not see implementation as part of their participation in SBCD, nor did they relate SBCD to personal benefits.

It offers an overview of pertinent regular and special education-reform efforts, discusses recommendations for unified schools that include all students, and reviews literature on political culture theory. Elazar's (1966) theory of political culture is used as a framework for analyzing the potential micro- and macro-political effects of creating a unified education system. A conclusion is that throughout the 1980s, the reform of regular education centered on quality and excellence, whereas special-education reform advocated equity through efficient order. The unanswered question of the 1990s appears to be \"Are both excellence and equity possible in the schools?\" This poses dilemmas of control versus  democracy and equity versus excellence. Recommendations for creating a unified school system include promoting dialogue among all stakeholders, understanding political cultures, and carefully examining the underlying values of the current educational system.

It outlines the structures established for identifying and reporting issues and trends on a systemic basis and discusses some of the implications for the educational system in light of an analysis conducted in the first year of the quality assurance programs. The New South Wales Quality Assurance Model unites two functions of the school system--school development and accountability. The 1993 review report, which analyzed 70 individual school reviews, obtained data from interviews with 1,870 staff, 3,531 students, 2,335 parents, 122 community members, and almost 300 classroom  observations. Findings indicate that, overall, schools set high standards of care for the communities they serve. However, the review suggests a need for development in several areas: the provision of system-wide resource allocation; improvement of participative decision making; improvement of student welfare programs; and development of a statewide assessment policy.

        "description":"This paper examines formal arrangements to encourage successful mentoring partnerships. It asserts that the most effective way to provide access to a variety of mentoring relationships is through formal programs that have clear goals and outcomes. Four phases of a formal mentoring program include development, consolidation, sponsorship, and redefinition. This paper also describes three mentoring programs established within the last 2 years in Victoria (Australia) for educational managers and school principals: (1) the Eleanor Davis Project, which encourages and helps more women to become school principals; (2) the Principals in School Leadership program, which provides experienced principals with access to business or professional leaders; and (3) the Women in Management Program,  which helps women move from middle-level management positions to senior-level public-sector positions. Despite individual differences, each program followed the usual pattern of establishment: establish program rationale and expectations; select a program coordinator; provide adequate financial and personnel resources; develop a program structure coherent with the State Professional Development Plan; clearly document program objectives and processes; implement procedures for monitoring, supervision, and evaluation; and refine procedures.

Based on its 24-month investigation, the Commission found that American students spend an average of five and a half hours in six class periods each school day, but half of that time is devoted to classes such as physical education and electives; however, Japanese, French, and German high school students spend on average five and a half hours studying core academic subjects. During the final 4 years of secondary education, the estimated number of hours required for core academic time for U.S. students was 1,460 hours compared to  3,170 in Japan, 3,280 in France, and 3,528 in Germany. The Commission made eight recommendations: (1) reinvent schools around learning, not time; (2) change the fixed clock and calendar to better use students' time in school; (3) organize the school day so that students spend at least five and a half hours learning core academic subjects; (4) keep schools open for expanded services and activities; (5) give teachers more time to prepare for their classes; (6) seize the promise of new technologies to increase productivity, enhance student achievement, and expand learning time; (7) develop local action plans to transform schools; (8) build coalitions of policymakers, community leaders, educators, and parents to make learning a &quot;national obsession.&quot; (CRW)",

The small group discussions and presentations resulted in 19 recommendations in the following areas: (1) principles of preservice and  inservice education; (2) course development; (3) course content; (4) the practicum; (5) course length; (6) continuing professional development; and (7) professional development of paraprofessionals and nonteaching professionals.

The WTI consists of 134 items requiring a simple &quot;like&quot; or &quot;dislike&quot; response and a reading level of seventh grade. It can be completed in 15 to 20 minutes using a consumable booklet or direct input to the WTI Computer Report. The validity of the WTI is supported by the original developmental analysis, the factor analytic structure of the 12 temperaments, convergent and divergent relationships with measured occupational interests, and the differential temperamental requirements of 91 worker trait groups. The WTI Computer Report generates a normative profile on the 12 work temperament scales and  then lists up to 12 worker trait groups for which the respondent is temperamentally suited. Extensive appendices include instructions for using the WTI Report, a description of the WTI computer program, worker trait group codes, sample descriptions of worker trait groups, critical temperaments for worker trait groups, WTI scale descriptions with examples, the WTI scoring key, WTI norm translations, demographic characteristics of the normative sample, and interest inventory scales.

The Transition Liaison can also help teachers meet the  special health needs of the child in the classroom and devise a system to prevent the child's falling behind if rehospitalization is necessary.

The report first presents some background material on the Medicaid program, including information about relevant laws and regulations. The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment component and its interface with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act are also discussed. Procedures for accessing Medicaid reimbursement are briefly considered in an overview of billing practices that schools can follow. The current status of schools' involvement in the Medicaid program is presented, based on data from a recent survey of all states. Survey results are summarized. Additional issues and concerns are discussed,  especially as related to the fiscal and eligibility features of the Medicaid program. The report concludes that Medicaid reimbursements for services provided to students with disabilities in schools are a potentially significant resource for districts. Appendices include a list of treatment services federally approved for Medicaid assistance and data on the states' activities in accessing Medicaid for student Individualized Education Program services.

A list of commonly held misconceptions about the capabilities of deaf people was identified through a literature review and interviews with deaf professionals. The 35 identified items formed the Opinions about Deaf People scale, which was tested with undergraduate students and then revised to form a 20-item version which was again tested. Data analysis from the second administration resulted in a coefficient alpha of .83 and a split-half reliability of .82. Item-total correlations ranged from .22 to .58. Although there appeared to be one general deaf capabilities factor, a few items also correlated moderately to strongly with an intelligence factor. Construct  validity was established. The study concludes that the Opinions about Deaf People scale appears to be a reliable and valid scale for research in education, employment, and other settings. The scale itself is included. Twenty-six appendices present the study's statistical data, several related questionnaires, and demographic information. (Contains 15 references.) (JDD)",

The paper listed 12 principles to guide deaf education, all of which center around the view that instruction of deaf children should be conducted in a natural sign language (basically American Sign Language). Five panel members then respond to the paper, including David M. Denton, Gerilee Gustason, Carol Padden, David S. Martin, and Roberta Thomas.  Responses address such issues as the use of Total Communication, Signing Exact English, mainstreaming, teachers' signing skills, and low expectations for students with deafness.

Particularly close bonding between the special education teacher and student with severe disabilities can occur, as the teacher provides so many services and works with the same child year after year. As student death is a real possibility, teachers need to receive training in how to respond to death. This paper discusses specific activities identified by teachers, parents, and school administrators as helpful in easing grief. Specific guidelines are offered for dealing with such a death, based on Frederick County (Maryland) guidelines for crisis intervention. These include immediate procedural  guidelines; responsibilities of the building administrator; availability of crisis team members; the funeral; managing memorial funds; and follow up with students, staff, and community.

Central to the 3-year curriculum process was matrixing, or integrating, basic developmental skills across multiple functional, age-appropriate, and integrated activities. Components included the following: (1) assessing families to determine valued activities and routines for instruction; (2) assessing school and community environments for the selection of activities needed for functioning in current and future integrated environments; (3) assessing activities for the selection of basic developmental skills or skill steps in a chained task of instruction; (4) developing instructional objectives based on a concept of  partial participation; (5) scheduling activities throughout the whole instructional day; (6) writing Individualized Education Programs; and (7) developing data collection and analysis procedures. The process was developed and evaluated with 14 teachers and 45 students with profound disabilities. The curriculum process was rated highly positive by both teachers and parents. The staff development course was rated very highly by teachers and administrators. Student progress data indicated greater learning and generalization than in previous years. Teacher maintenance of the process was high. Much of the document consists of the SAMS curriculum process guide and appendices that provide detailed behavioral objectives and other project material.

Among findings reported are that while test-wiseness strategies may be taught, these strategies have limited generalizability across exams and learners who proactively process information, such as test items, are more likely to understand and recall what they learn. Specific strategies validated by the literature for multiple choice tests include: (1) the length of a multiple choice option often signals its correctness; (2) avoid items using the words \"always\" and \"never\" (inclusionary language); (3) avoid grossly unrelated alternatives; (4) pay attention to grammatical clues; (5) choose the mid-range answer;  (6) use deduction on the item; (7) be aware of similarity or oppositeness; (8) adopt the appropriate level of sophistication for the test; (9) consider the purpose of the test constructor; (10) make efficient use of time; (11) use error avoidance strategies; and (12) utilize deductive reasoning strategies.

Innovative aspects included participant self-assessment of perceived competency level in content areas, participant selection of goals and activities relevant to the individual's life or job situation, development of an individualized learning plan based on the self-assessment, and use of interdisciplinary team teaching including parents of children  with special needs as faculty. The semester-long course was field tested at three University of Wisconsin campuses, with adaptations presented in a variety of other settings. Quantitative evaluation revealed that participants exhibited significant changes in skills and knowledge and were highly satisfied with the course. Qualitative evaluation indicated that participants perceived the program as having a high impact on personal, programmatic, and systems levels.

Activities to promote collegial relationships among faculty should be a part of each inclusion team's plan for implementing inclusion at a particular school site. Group building activities can help faculty members become better acquainted with each other, nurture respect for personal differences, build awareness of professional strengths of team members, provide an opportunity to practice skills needed to work together, and provide opportunities for team members to share what has been going well. Essential components of group building activities, which are similar to  cooperative learning activities, include: working in heterogeneous groups, promoting positive interdependence, providing success, rewarding the group for success, and encouraging individual accountability. To generate a classroom climate conducive to acceptance of individual differences and cooperation, group building activities involving students are also needed in classrooms where inclusion will take place. Two sample group building activities are described. (JDD)",

        "description":"This practicum investigated the effectiveness of using music activities to reinforce basic money skills with 10 students, ages 12 to 21, with mental retardation in the trainable range. The program used a combination of music and visual aids as strategies for reinforcing basic money skills and improving student on-task behaviors in the classroom. Pretests and posttests as well as systematic observation were used to evaluate the intervention. Results indicated increased achievement levels of basic coin money skills for the target group. Students also demonstrated increased on-task behaviors. Appendices include student data of previous mastery of basic money skills, the coin money skills pretest/posttest, summary of pretest data, the observation form (used both before and after  program implementation), summary of observation data, lyrics to coin money skills song activities, coin face manipulative reproduceables and coin identification chart, explanation of a schoolwide money skills student video project, and an attachment of recommended music resources to reinforce basic skills.

        "description":"This review of the literature and analysis looks at the concept of full inclusion of students with disabilities in the context of the regular education initiative (REI). The concept of full inclusion is explained as the use of new methods, techniques, and strategies to teach students with and without disabilities in the same classroom. Identification of assumptions underlying the issue precede specific arguments both for and against full inclusion. An analysis of the validity of both sets of arguments considers attitudes of educators, parents, and students. Next, the paper looks at values emphasized and compromised by the full inclusion model such as increased emphasis on cooperative learning and social development and possible compromises in the values of educational excellence  and efficiency. The paper concludes that full inclusion is the preferred condition but should not be the only possibility. Also stressed is the importance of specialists, classroom teachers, parents, and students all participating in student program development and decision making. (Contains 212 references.) (DB)",

It then describes two programs which involve parents/families in the evaluation and monitoring of community services in New Zealand. Basic principles include the importance of written standards, development of policy by service users, and linking of evaluation/monitoring systems with government standards. Several existing evaluation systems and accreditation procedures are briefly summarized. A two-level evaluation and monitoring system for community homes has been developed in New Zealand. At Level 1 local parents/consumers monitor homes and day programs on a frequent basis using a Key Points protocol which focuses on  three areas: (1) the environment, (2) options and activities, and (3) management and staff. Training is provided for the parents, consumers, and volunteers who constitute these teams. At Level 2 less frequent but more comprehensive evaluations, also with heavy parent and consumer participation, assess quality of life issues by means of a 10-step process. The final section of the booklet lists lessons learned from implementation over the past 12 years including the low cost, less than 1 percent of total program costs on a nationwide level. An appendix lists other evaluation and monitoring methods. (Contains 14 references.) (DB)",

The next section considers ways to include people with mental handicaps in CBR projects. These include: community integration through increasing public acceptance, developing and using individual functional curricula and methods, inclusion in local preschools and schools, and  inclusion in local employment and housing. Next, specific strategies for developing CBR services are addressed, among which are a public awareness campaign, establishment of a local committee, networking with local services, personnel training, recreational activities, and development of a volunteer corps. The fourth section considers evaluation of CBR services. It addresses establishing baselines, determining outcome measures, measuring cost effectiveness, and establishing evaluation criteria. A section on resources offers guidance on obtaining help and funding. The last section briefly considers the need for research. Two appendices include a CBR checklist and addresses of resources in CBR. (Contains 51 references.) (DB)",

        "description":"These guidelines for service evaluation arose out of a 1986 meeting of the International League of Societies for Persons with Mental Handicap. An introduction focuses on the concepts of support and service and the need for minimizing restrictiveness and empowering the individual. Seven principles are enumerated, specifying the rights of people with mental retardation to the same rights as other people, to proper medical care and training, to economic security, to life within the family and community, to protection from exploitation or abuse, and to due process. Quality standards are then identified, stressing the need for individualized services, personal autonomy, and social opportunities. The need for standards to address living conditions, education and learning environments,  work, employment and day activities, recreation, participation, and self-realization is stressed. Evaluation methods are then considered, with emphasis on the use of both internal and external evaluators, consumer involvement, and comparability of data. The guidelines also note that the individual life is affected by systems and communities, by services, and by the individual him/herself. Seven implementation steps are outlined, such as identifying issues, setting goals, collecting information systematically, and using the information to influence leaders and authorities. Sample pages from two evaluation checklists are appended. (Contains 11 references.) (DB)",

Survey data were considered within the context of recently approved federal guidelines that expand the responsibilities associated with state CSPD plans. Trends were identified in the certification of special education teachers, including more noncategorical or less categorical certificates, more attention to specific teacher competencies, multiple routes to initial certification, and provision for emergency certification. Shortages of special education and related services personnel were identified, as were barriers  to accurate monitoring of supply and demand. CSPD involvement in recruitment and monitoring of supply and demand prior to the implementation of the 1992 regulations was also described. Finally, areas where collaboration is needed among state education agencies, local education agencies, and institutions of higher education personnel were identified. Eight major conclusions and associated recommendations are offered. Appendices include both parts of the survey and the text of the 1992 federal regulations. (Contains 26 references.) (DB)",

        "description":"This practicum addressed the self-concept and self-esteem problems of 10 upper elementary grade students with learning disabilities through development, implementation, and evaluation of a group counseling program. The program involved educating students about their learning disabilities as well as using counseling strategies which stressed student strengths and challenged their erroneous belief systems. The students were also given opportunities for reverse-role tutoring (in which students tutored first graders in reading). Role models were developed through the influence of an adult model with learning disabilities and a library project on famous historical figures with learning disabilities. Meetings were held with teachers, parents, and the children's regular education peers  to provide information on learning disabilities and enhance the students' acceptance. Results from both standardized self-report measures and informal questionnaires showed that all 10 students demonstrated significant improvements between pretest and posttest in self concept and self-esteem. Reduced levels of anxiety and improved behaviors were also observed. Letters, questionnaires, and forms used during the practicum are appended. (Contains 39 references.)",

The third chapter, &quot;The Expanded Curriculum: Individualizing the System,&quot; also by Lois Adams and K. Kay Cessna, discusses the need to expand the typical curriculum in order to  provide individualized instruction for students with disabilities. Instructional design is the focus of the fourth and fifth chapters. &quot;Behavioral Intent: Instructional Content for Students with Behavioral Disorders,&quot; by Richard S. Neel and K. Kay Cessna, suggests that meaningful behavior curriculum is determined by the student and that problem behaviors should be viewed as diagnostic of needed instruction rather than as the focus of intervention. The complexity of managing appropriate instruction for students with behavior disorders is discussed in Chapter 5 (also by Neel and Cessna), titled &quot;Instructional Themes: A Pragmatic Response to Complexity.&quot; The final chapter is titled &quot;Instructionally Differentiated Programming: Suggestions for Implementation,&quot; by K. Kay Cessna and Jaclyn  Borock. Most chapters contain references. (DB)",

After an introduction and discussion of the available scientific literature, research-supported facts and related questions are presented concerning the following: (1) television viewing habits; (2) program comprehension; (3) commercial advertising; (4) program preferences; (5) perceived reality; (6) parental mediation; (7) governmental mediation; and (8) instructional opportunities. Resulting research-based guidelines are offered. First, although young gifted children spend significantly more hours watching television than same-age peers, this does not necessarily  warrant parental concern. Second, parents should be sure programming matches the child's capability to follow the story line and is sufficiently challenging. Third, younger children should avoid program-length commercials. Fourth, pay television (cable, video, rentals) currently provides the most reliable supply of quality children's programs. Fifth, primetime commercial television offers inadequate and inappropriate role models for gifted children. Sixth, the most effective forms of parental mediation are purposeful program selection and coviewing with the child. Seventh, parents should become involved in influencing the quality and quantity of local children's programming. Eighth, television in the classroom has a place in gifted education. An appendix lists 14 television-related  activities. (Contains 33 references.) (DB)",

The question-answer format considers the importance of reading with young children, other activities to help young children learn to read, normal development of reading and writing skills, the precocious reader, and testing a preschooler's reading ability. Conclusions are organized into recommendations for parents and recommendations for teachers and administrators. An executive summary stresses seven conclusions: (1) children acquire important literacy knowledge and behaviors during the preschool years; (2) effective story reading is interactive and responsive to the child; (3) in early reading  development, the child's developing knowledge of language is most important while in later reading development, his/her knowledge of the world and expressive skills becomes more critical; (4) early writing skills may develop in parallel with or out-of-step with reading skills; (5) learning letter names and sounds is an important part of early literacy development; (6) reading failure can be prevented by the early identification of reading difficulties followed by appropriate instruction; and (7) precocious reading is an example of giftedness.

Principles of the self-examination process are offered, noting similarities to external evaluation models. Principles of self-evaluation efforts include the importance of maintaining a nonjudgmental orientation, soliciting views from the insider's perspective, and triangulating data. The most important techniques in self-evaluation are observation, interviewing, and participation. While self-evaluation maintains an educational program's quality on a daily basis, expert external evaluation is essential to an in-depth and objective understanding. Important considerations in external evaluation include working with an external evaluator and understanding qualitative and  quantitative approaches. Clear communication of evaluation findings is important for both internal and external evaluations. General evaluation guidelines and specific guidelines for evaluating gifted and talented education programs are given. A case study illustrates many of these guidelines, including the importance of context; preparing a program description; the use of verbatim quotations; assessment and analysis; review of the standard program mechanisms (referral, identification, and selection); refinements; analyzing underlying factors; addressing larger sociopolitical concerns; and communicating evaluation findings. Appendices provide further explanation of evaluation components. (Contains 42 references.) (DB)",

The first section considers problems in identification. These include: (1) elitist and distorted definitions of giftedness, (2) confusion about purposes of identification, (3) violation of educational equity, (4) misuse of identification instruments, (5) unreliable data, (6) inappropriate combination of data, and (7) too few students identified. The section on promising practices discusses principles of identification, defensible definitions, and selection of tests and instruments. Topics discussed in the equitable procedures section include avoiding discrimination and charges of elitism; equitable  use of academic achievement data; alternate test procedures for students with learning disabilities or other handicaps; appropriate use of multiple sources of data; data from parents, teachers, and peers; self-nominations; and use of data on student progress. Low-cost high quality program design is also briefly addressed. A conclusion emphasizes that gifted program identification practices should reflect the values of pluralism and equity.

After an introduction, the first chapter considers the definition of neglect including types of neglect, the withholding of medically indicated treatment from newborns, prenatal exposure to drugs, failure to thrive/malnutrition, and chronic versus \"new\" neglect. The next chapter discusses the causes of neglect including parents' developmental history and personality factors, characteristics of children and family system factors, contextual sources of stress and support, informal support systems, and stress. The third chapter examines short-term and long-term consequences of neglect at various  ages as well as mediating effects and neglect-related child fatalities. A chapter on assessment of neglect notes indicators, causes of and barriers to adequate care, and structured assessment measures. An exhaustive chapter on intervention covers the following: (1) general guidelines, (2) interventions to remedy neglect, (3) multiservice interventions, (4) family-focused interventions, (5) family preservation services, (6) group approaches, (7) treatment of neglected children, (8) legal intervention, and (9) preventing burnout. The next to last chapter, on prevention of neglect, considers primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. The final chapter addresses social policy implications such as attention to poverty, improvements in public social utilities, and service delivery systems. A  glossary is provided.

The individuals placed had a wide range of talents and disability severity levels. Typically, a four-person site might have one person with mild retardation, two with moderate retardation, and one with severe or profound retardation. A combination of a single job coach and natural coworker support was provided to foster successful employment and social integration. Six sites were established over the 2 project years, offering nontraditional job opportunities in leading community firms. The job retention rate was lower than desired, and strategies for improving  the success rate are suggested.

        "description":"This monograph provides an overview of the issues surrounding inclusion and testing accommodations for students with disabilities and presents six papers discussing the issues. &quot;Including Students with Disabilities in Systemic Efforts To Measure Outcomes: Why Ask Why?&quot; (Bob Algozzine) argues that excluding any student from testing violates the spirit and practice of full inclusion. &quot;Inclusion and Adaptation in Assessment of Special Needs Students in Arizona&quot; (Paul H. Koehler) describes the Arizona Student Assessment Program, which has tried to include nearly all students with Individualized Education Programs by developing modified (mediated) forms of assessments. &quot;Inclusion of Children and Youth Who Are Hearing Impaired and Deaf in Outcomes Assessment&quot; (Barbara L. Loeding and  Jerry B. Crittenden) contends that accommodations and participation in state and national testing should depend upon the deaf student's primary mode of communication, prior use of an interpreter, and functioning level or amount of hearing loss. &quot;Inclusion and Accommodation: 'You Can Tell What Is Important to a Society by the Things It Chooses To Measure'&quot; (Jack Merwin) points out that excluding students with disabilities from state and national testing affects group averages less than excluding other subgroups, such as children from low socioeconomic status groups. &quot;Consequences and Incentives: Implications for Inclusion/Exclusion Decisions Regarding Students with Disabilities in State and National Assessment Programs&quot; (Daniel J. Reschly) explores three inclusion/exclusion policy  alternatives. &quot;Inclusion and Accommodation in Assessment at the Margins&quot; (Maynard C. Reynolds) suggests that acceptable test results may be gathered from 95 percent of pupils and that the other 5 percent (students in special education) may be assessed through other means.

The report reviews major initiatives in the areas of the national education goals (Goals 2000), standards, and national testing. The section reviewing the national education goals outlines 1993 progress toward each goal. The section on standards discusses content standards, performance standards, school delivery standards, and system performance standards, and discusses the establishment of criteria for standards. The section on national testing focuses on the history of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the push toward national testing, how NAEP  might be adapted, and concerns about linking state/district assessments. The report finds that minimal movement was made nationally toward the recognition that &quot;all students&quot; includes students served in special education programs. There was some recognition of the issues surrounding students with disabilities, in the report that accompanied the Senate version of the Goals 2000 legislation.

        "description":"This paper on identifying education outcomes for students with disabilities proposes a framework for applying an outcome-based approach throughout the education system, by looking at the needs of the three major levels of the system (local, state, and national); defining different uses for the term &quot;outcome&quot; in order to achieve consensus and understanding; and matching uses with the needs of the specific levels of the system. The paper organizes use of the term &quot;outcomes&quot; into three categories: learning outcomes, actualized outcomes, and system outcomes. Education is not seen as a traditional linear system, but rather as an interactive and dynamic system where each level has the power to influence all other levels. Each level of the educational system must attend to four demands  for collecting data--program improvement, policy development, accountability, and public information. Differences in the scope and focus of decisions that must be made at each level, and resulting data priorities, vary from one level of the system to the next. Priorities and degree of specificity should be taken into consideration for both defining an outcome and establishing data collection systems. An outcome-driven education system can then be developed by effectively using the principles that started with the outcome-based education movement and the data collected from an outcome-driven accountability system.

Three issues relevant to the impact of standards and assessment on special education are then discussed: (1) regular education should assume responsibility for the learning of all students; (2) programs and activities should be linked by a common set of goals for all students and a shared vision of the standards used to judge them; and (3) schools and students should be judged in terms of the outcomes they achieve and should receive rewards and sanctions based on those outcomes. Several strategies are presented for increasing the positive impact of standards and assessment for  students in special education, such as developing a set of agreed upon outcomes and standards of performance that have relevance for all students, and adopting reporting formats and conventions that accommodate students with disabilities.

Concerning national standards, the paper points out that experts in math believe that established standards are somewhat appropriate for students with disabilities but not feasible for implementation with most students with disabilities. Concerning state and national testing, the paper reports that most states use large scale assessments and do not include students with disabilities, and when students with  disabilities are included, their data often are not reported.

The disability category for which there was the greatest similarity of terms across  the largest number of data collection programs was speech impaired. Suggestions are provided for improving disability identification in collecting and reporting policy-relevant information.

Stage One involved identifying five alternative models of educational outcomes--an educational model, a sociological model, a political/pragmatic model, a psychological model, and a developmental model--and proposing to develop outcomes and indicators as a function of disability severity and age level of the student. In Stage Two, the terms &quot;outcomes&quot; and &quot;indicators&quot; were defined, a set of assumptions to identify &quot;outcomes indicators&quot; was generated, and the work was reviewed and revised. Stage Three brought about more formal and  broad-based review of the proposed model. Stage Four's focus was presentation of a new model which distinguished between &quot;enabling outcomes&quot; and &quot;educational outcomes.&quot; In Stage Five, additional review and consensus-building took place, resulting in agreement on and publication of a final list of indicators of school completion outcomes.

        "description":"The National Center on Educational Outcomes (NCEO) was established to work with states and other policy groups to develop a model of educational outcomes for students with disabilities and to generate a list of indicators of these outcomes. NCEO developed a technique named Multi-Attribute Consensus Building (MACB) to build consensus among educators, policymakers, administrators, parents, advocates, and other stakeholders. MACB is a quantitative, objective approach for determining a small group's opinion about the importance of each item in a list, through three stages: generation of input, consensus working session, and synthesis of consensus. NCEO produced large lists of outcomes and indicators and used MACB to determine how important these indicators were to various groups.  NCEO used the ratings to determine which indicators and outcomes to use in the model at the school completion, postschool, and early childhood levels. Following a description of the MACB approach, this report discusses equipment needed, technical and logistical issues, ways to modify the MACB process, and advantages and limitations. Figures and appendixes present: (1) a conceptual model of outcomes; (2) MACB stages and tasks to accomplish; (3) a table showing decisions made during the process of synthesizing consensus; (4) a handout on the consensus-building process; (5) an example of an indicator's importance ratings spreadsheet; and (6) equipment configurations.

        "description":"This study investigates the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), in particular the relative contributions to score dependability (analogous to classical theory reliability) of various numbers of items and subtests as well as the decision dependability at different cut points. Research questions that apply to the overall TOEFL battery and to its tests and subtests address classical theory reliability estimates; relative contributions to error variance of persons, items, subtests, and their interactions; dependability for varying numbers of items and subtests; and the effect on score dependability of various cutpoints. The study was based on the item responses of 20,000 test takers from 15 different language backgrounds. Data were collected from the May 1991  administration of the TOEFL at foreign and domestic test centers. Analyses included descriptive statistics, classical theory reliability estimates, generalizability theory, and decision dependability estimates for various cut points. Test dependability analyses indicate that subtests can make substantial contributions to the variance of test scores and thus may affect dependability in important ways. However, these results also make it clear that, in some cases, subtests may have a negligible impact on dependability. Thus, while inclusion of subtests or the expansion of the number of subtest on a test may have a substantial beneficial effect on the dependability of the scores on that test, this relationship cannot be taken as a forgone conclusion. Findings also indicate that on the  present TOEFL the lowest dependabilities along the range are still very high. Analyses are appended. (Contains 20 references.) (AA)",

With the current emphasis on direct assessment of speaking proficiency following the protocol of the Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI), the potential importance of cross-cultural pragmatics is evident. The study reported here explores cross-cultural phenomena in the OPI by comparing the accommodative discourse of six English-as-a-Second-Language interviews matched according to rating outcomes with six Japanese-as-a-Second-Language interviews. Tallies of features of accommodation and control from the 12 interviews are compared to show a clear tendency on the part of the Japanese language interviewer to avoid  interactional trouble and communication breakdown by providing highly accommodative questioning and topic-maintaining interviewer turns. Results suggest that comparable ratings, based exclusively on the speech of the interviewee, may not be equivalent in terms of the discourse and accommodation used by the interviewers, and that interviewer strategies for avoiding trouble may be linked to underlying cultural and pragmatic phenomena.

Staff and consultants provided services to 19,210 individual clients, principally school personnel, at four levels (statewide, regional, multi-district, local), of four  types (technical assistance, workshop, meeting, conference/institute), and on a variety of topics (project management, curriculum and instruction, culture/counseling, parent/community involvement). BEMRC invited state education agency representatives to meet to discuss procedures for coordinating and planning specific activities for each state. A 2-day regional workshop was held for all Title VII project directors or representatives, enhancing collaboration. BEMRC also conducted training workshops in areas of importance to various projects and provided on-site technical assistance services and workshops. Workshops were well received by participants.

In teaching English to Chinese students at Xi'an Foreign Language University (China), a teacher considered several factors (age, level of proficiency, native language, place where English was taught, and motivation) in choosing methods. The teacher's perception of the purpose of teaching (to enable students to acquire strong linguistic competence in the shortest possible time) also influenced the decision about teaching method. One method chosen was the audiolingual method. The grammar-translation method  is also good for promoting language proficiency among students, and the advantages of using this method with Chinese ESL learners are: (1) teachers can bring to the students' attention the conceptual differences between English and Chinese; and (2) translation in the classroom is both economic and effective in explaining a concept. Another approach to grammar rules, the total physical response approach, is also described. When beginning adult ESL learners, the emphasis should be placed on listening and speaking because these skills can help them practice new vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar rules. Pattern drill exercises help students to acquire the basic skills, especially patterns. Teachers should take time to analyze criticisms associated with various teaching methods before  actually choosing one. Methods should be chosen from the most mechanical to the most communicative.

        "description":"A discussion of second language instruction looks briefly at some shortcomings of traditional method-based approaches and examines what are predicted to be major influences on language teaching in the 1990s. Objections to method-based instruction include the inadequacy of the term \"method,\" its prescriptive approach, lack of distinction between methods in classroom practice, and the fact that it is only one part of instructional design. A broader model of instructional design is proposed, based on four areas of consideration: (1) knowledge considerations, or the content and learner outcomes; (2) instructional consideration, or factors that affect design and delivery of instruction, including methods, media, and materials used; (3) learner considerations, including age,  proficiency level, and developmental stage; and (4) administrative considerations, such as authority, policy, and commitment. Factors identified as likely to shape language instruction in the 1990s include: continuing inquiry into the nature of language and linguistic content of instruction; acknowledgment of the commonalities of many current methods; continued interest in teaching and learning styles; a larger role for technology; recognition of the role of cultural variables in learning success; concern for social organization in learning tasks; sociolinguistic research findings; new knowledge of cognition and motivation; and reexamination of authority structures.

Four basic task types are useful. Experience tasks are those within the realm of the learner's previous experience, allowing him to focus attention on learning goals. Preparation for these tasks may include providing relevant experience. Shared tasks are those that may be difficult for one learner to tackle alone but can be completed successfully by  two or more working cooperatively. Planning should include consideration of how task elements will be distributed. Guided tasks provide support for the learner while he accomplishes them, narrowing the scope of the task and allowing for sequencing of instruction. Such tasks offer a high degree of success. Independent tasks require the learner to work alone without planned help. Such tasks should provide reasonable challenge and be realistic. When teachers use this system of tasks, they have access to a wide range of instructional possibilities that help learners gain mastery. (MSE)",

Throughout, it is argued that language teaching methodology and materials should be based more firmly on empirical evidence about the nature of language, language learning, and language use. It is proposed that there exists much knowledge that can be exploited by materials designers and methodology experts to this end, and that there are areas into which research can be extended to broaden the  knowledge base.

It is of growing interest to teachers of both English as a Second Language and other second languages. It has been used in courses of English for academic and special purposes, vocational English, programs for foreign teaching assistants, partial or total language immersion, academic courses, and two-way bilingual programs, and at all instructional levels. Another approach is for content teachers to adapt instruction to differential language proficiency levels in the class. Attributes of content-based  instruction include: instructional objectives drawn from language, academic content, and cognitive skills; schema knowledge developed in the language of instruction; inclusion of content-obligatory and content-compatible languages; paired and small-group work; wide range of materials; multiple media and presentation techniques; experiential and discovery learning; and use of writing for both cognitive and evaluative purposes. Content-based instruction often begins with collaboration of a language and a content teacher.

Thematic modules are defined as longer than lessons and shorter than a course, and it is suggested that in a content-based approach, the module constitutes the basic unit of study. Content-based modules are seen as useful for: experimenting with minimal changes in existing courses; focusing more intensively on process-methodologies; adapting instruction to communicative performance testing methods; and packaging coursework for specialized vocabulary, as in English for Special Purposes (ESP). Students appear to like content-based language learning modules, and the method allows for considerable instructional flexibility. Modules,  which can be either general or context-specific, are comprised of specific elements, including: starters, motivators, or probes to establish what schema learners bring to the topic and possible directions; a minimum of two inputs; treatment(s); synthesis; output task; and evaluation. Other common elements can be incorporated, including brainstorming, language focus, learner awareness training, independent investigation, and critical analysis. ESP modules contain many of the same design characteristics as general modules, but with input and output phases reflecting the area of specialization. (MSE)",

Instances of vocabulary elaboration in the lectures were analyzed, including all uses of special terminology or expressions that the teachers in some way qualified, explained, questioned, repeated, paraphrased, or expanded on; analogies were included. For each elaboration, occurrence of these features was recorded: type and complexity of elaboration; discourse markers; speed and stress; overt signals of importance; type of explanation; and technicality of terms  used. This information was analyzed for patterns of teacher language use and individual differences between teachers. Some elaborations were very complex, with further elaborations embedded in them. Student notes on one topic were then examined for insight into the lecturer's method of explaining and the way students recorded the information. Results indicate students were unaware of many lecturer cues signaling key base words, and had difficulty extracting them from the ongoing discourse. Notes showed poor organization. Suggestions are made for improving NNS students' listening and note-taking skills. (MSE)",

Students may also have had systematic introduction to personnel management, industrial relations, labor economics, or other relevant areas in previous business courses. The study of industrial relations, particularly from the German viewpoint, can be seen as the study of a system and therefore allows for systematic, cohesive, interdisciplinary examination. Course  content would include specialized terminology and in-depth analysis of such topics as the labor movement, trade unions, employers' associations, plant-level industrial relations, government role, collective bargaining, and co-determination. While there is little instructional material available specifically on West Germany, there is much on labor law, trade unions, employers, crafts, labor history, and economics of collective bargaining. This model could be adapted for other language and area studies combinations. (MSE)",

Critical linguistics argues that different groups, societies, and ideologies have different understandings of reality because they classify and categorize with and through language in different ways. Therefore, meaning is not something contained within the words of discourse (that is, literature) but has to be formed within each user of the language. This concept is illustrated in the analysis of a simple English sentence, analyzed as it would be perceived and classified by the reader/\"critic.\" It is proposed that heretofore, linguistic theory has focused too narrowly on understanding the system of language, resulting in too little attention paid to formation of meaning in  discourse analysis. The apparent subjectivity of this kind of analysis, criticized by some, is seen as an essential element of understanding. It is argued that this new perspective calls for a reconsideration of language teaching methodology, stressing the connections between linguistic structure and social structure and viewing language as ideology applicable to analysis of all forms of discourse.

These three aspects of communicative competence are termed the \"grammar of culture,\" and they are essential to understanding what is appropriate in intercultural communication. In support of this concept, a survey of 70 native speakers of Brunei-Malay that investigated their perceptions of native English-speakers' attitudes and language behaviors is reported. Subjects were first-year university students. The survey focused on perceptions of English-speakers' use of greetings and leave-takings in relation to levels of formality, intimacy, friendship, and abruptness in social encounters.  Results suggest that different types of communicative style can damage the communication process, lead to misinterpretation and breakdown, and ultimately result in such problems as ethnic stereotyping and prejudice. Further study of intercultural communication and integration of cross-cultural training into second language instruction are seen as necessary to equip language learners with the skills for effective, confident communication.

        "description":"It is argued that teaching and learning a second language for communicative competence should not lead to neglect of students' understanding of the way the language works, but rather should include constant development of language awareness. While use of the language in a variety of communicative activities is the central goal of instruction, discussion of how the language works as it does can enhance both comprehension and production. It is also proposed that the communicative approach need not be limited to oral communication, especially the everyday conversation that is commonly the focus of communicative instruction, to the exclusion of written discourse. Language awareness and written text can be productively integrated into a communicative activity. For example, students  might be presented with a text, communicate about its content, and only after exploiting its communicative potential, be invited to observe language features at work in it.

        "description":"Language is a system developed for the purpose of communication. Grammar (structure), which reflects language form, is only one aspect of language; the other two are meaning and function. Failure of form-centered approaches to second language teaching, the audiolingual and cognitive approaches, led to the emergence of the communicative approach in the mid-1970s and neglect of grammar as a valid component of language instruction. Now that the communicative approach has evolved somewhat, another look at the role of grammar in communicative language teaching is appropriate. It is likely that much of what has previously been addressed as sentence-level grammar will in future be reanalyzed and taught in relation to its role in discourse, and therefore as it contributes to  communication. While the discourse-based approach may be perceived to be in conflict with the highly social and interactive exercises characteristic of the communicative approach, its real contribution will be to move learners beyond superficial, everyday communication to the expression of experiences, thoughts, and ideas that can only be adequately expressed through extended discourse. As such, this approach emphasizes the use of texts, oral and written, to extend learner awareness of how grammar functions in discourse. (MSE)",

        "description":"Traditionally, the study of language patterns has been viewed primarily in terms of rules of grammar and discourse and of vocabulary choice. Researchers are now exploring the nature of collocations, or patterns of word sequence or co-occurrence in discourse. Most of the attention has been focused on colorful collocations, not on more ordinary usage. Computer analysis of large corpora now make description of patterns possible. An analysis of the use of four English prepositions (&quot;at, from, between, through&quot;) in collocation in one large corpus of British English illustrates the potential of this area of study. Results of the analysis indicate that the prepositions have distinctive patterns of co-occurrence with different form classes (e.g., nouns vs. verbs), and can not be viewed  or taught as relatively interchangeable grammatical items. Some problems in interpreting and using collocation analyses persist, such as judgments about significance of word sequences as collocations, and the number of words that can occur between elements of the collocation. However, study of collocations may have implications for theories of language learning, theories and models of language processing, content of language instruction, and pedagogical practice. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study investigated the use of drama activities in English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) instruction in Malaysia. Instruction occurred over an extended period of time and involved over 300 teachers, with a wide range of training and experience, in secondary and higher education institutions. Students were low-level, intermediate, or advanced learners in rural, urban, or tertiary schools. Class size ranged from 10 to 51 students. Types of drama activities used were language games (including improvisation), pantomime, role playing, and simulations. They emphasized listening and speaking skills. In general, it was found that drama techniques worked for most teachers and that some techniques worked better in certain circumstances than in others. Activities that do not emphasize  performance were found more universally applicable than those that do. Some variability was found in the success of different activity types with different ability and school groups. It is concluded that drama activities are useful in motivating students, holding their attention, and stimulating their creativity. However, student proficiency, needs, attitudes, experience, abilities, age, and interests must be considered. Some teachers find integrating drama activities to be difficult; convincing and training teachers in their use is essential to success. (MSE)",

Using television news broadcasts, the educational software package can also be used for area or media studies. Prototypes have been developed for English and German instruction. The program is designed to support learner comprehension of authentic news broadcasts by encouraging learners to form hypotheses about the program and by activating situational, cultural knowledge (of format, content, or schemata) that may be otherwise unavailable to the second language learner. It exploits the predictability of the text format of news broadcasts. It provides two interconnected approaches to each news program, linear and structural, through which the user can proceed to gain comprehension of news items. The linear  path gives a chronological view of the program, is topic- and theme-oriented, and allows for annotation and transcription. The structural view allows the user to select and mark the internal structure of the news item from either a schematic or a formatting perspective. Help facilities in the program that can be activated include dictionaries, background information, a databank of previously annotated material, and help specific to the program package. The software can be used for both linguistic and communicative exercises. (MSE)",

The national survey in 1992 covered 82 languages and surveyed approximately 1,000 language course instructors and program directors at national resource centers and universities in the United States receiving graduate fellowships under the Foreign Language and Area Studies program. The questionnaire solicited information on language courses taught at each institution and the instructional materials used for these courses. The results of these queries comprise the bulk of this report. Each language was assigned to one of eight world areas: East Asia (e.g., Chinese, Japanese); Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union (e.g., Albanian, Greek);  Latin America and Caribbean America and the Caribbean (e.g., Haitian Creole, Portuguese); Middle East and North Africa (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew); Northern Europe and Catalonia (e.g., Catalan, Danish); South Asia (e.g., Bengali, Hindi/Urdu); Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands (e.g., Burmese, Tagalog); and Sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., Acholi, Yoruba). Each world area report is introduced by a review briefly describing the status of languages in the world area. Each review is followed by individual reports on each language in that area; the descriptions vary in length from 5-15 pages. Language reports include the materials currently in use (textbooks, audiotapes, videotapes, computer courseware) arranged by level and the materials needed for each level. The four appendixes include a list of  languages by world area, the language course report form, the program director questionnaire and a list of the participating institutions and reviewers of the reports.

The demand for educational excellence in industry is &quot;out there,&quot; and companies in more advanced countries are partnering educational institutes in meeting their own needs. The generic standards and guidelines of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) have identified and described 20 elements of a quality assurance system. When companies comply with these standards through implementing quality procedures, they can be audited to see if they meet ISO quality standards, and obtain ISO 9000 certification. In advancing a case for quality assurance in English for  specific purposes (ESP) programs, this paper discusses basic ESP concepts and describes the systems approach to ESP design and implementation, showing how the ISO 9000 elements of quality have application in ESP. The paper focuses on design specifications to indicate the existence of parallels, then suggests logical extensions of ESP design specifications that allow for closer parallelism. In ESP, design and implementation are concept and practices that fit with ISO 9000 quality assurance requirements, from the central idea of tailor-made courses and specification of objectives in performance terms, to needs analysis of target learning situations, to formative and summative program evaluations and feedback on teaching effectiveness to continuous re-design of curriculum and improvement of  training.

Initial investigation of postgraduate (science and engineering) students' needs at Chulalongkorn University indicates that the skills the students want to improve most are listening, speaking, and writing. These emerging needs are difficult to fulfill due to the fact that the medium of instruction for all subjects (excluding 3 hours of English a week) at all levels is in Thai. In teaching an English course for science graduates at Chulalongkorn, a teacher attempted to close the gap between students' communicative needs and their linguistic competence. This paper addresses three factors that must be considered in the  process of translating students' needs into course design and implementation: linguistic aspects, pedagogical decisions, and administrative concerns.

Interviews also revealed that speech patterns between employer and employee are directive and instructive in nature and reflect the unequal relationship between the two individuals, that domestic workers insist their children learn English in school, and that workers  perceive English as a social indicator and an instrument of change.

However, the phrase was soon adopted as an abbreviation for the nickname &quot;Old Kinderhook&quot; by Democrats campaigning for Martin Van Buren's reelection in 1840. Since then, several other theories have been introduced, including the ideas that it came from a Choctaw Indian word meaning &quot;it is so&quot; or a Middle English word for the last load of a harvest.

        "description":"This paper describes a language-for-specific-purposes test development project designed to assess both general language proficiency and classroom communicative competence for the purpose of accrediting teachers of Italian as a second/foreign language. A rationale for test design is presented that draws in a review of the second language acquisition literature on teacher input and an analysis of teacher language behavior in foreign language classrooms where Italian is both medium and object of instruction. The nature of test tasks on the speaking component of the test is outlined. Eighteen language teacher experts were surveyed after they had viewed and rated 50 videotaped samples of trial test performance. This feedback provided overall support for the teacher-specific  orientation of the test, but some informants expressed concern about the authenticity of particular tasks with respect to real world communication and about the validity of assessing the \"teacherliness\" of performance in the test environment.

        "description":"This paper explores enrollment for foreign language programs (FLPs) in French, Spanish, and German using data collected from students in Grades 7 through 12 in the Grand Blanc Community School District (Michigan) for the 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90, 1990-91, and 1992-93 school years. Research questions address: (1) enrollment figures, (2) loss rates for each year by language and by level, and (3) reasons students cite for dropping out of FLPs. From stratified attrition lists from the 1990-91 school year, randomly selected students from each language and level were surveyed, and their responses were used to develop student attitude surveys geared toward high school and middle school foreign language students. A search of student records enrolled in foreign language at both the  middle and high school level was completed for years 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90, 1990-91, and 1991-92. Students were identified either as having continued or dropped out of the program at one of five stages, were sampled within each stage and asked to complete the student attitude survey. Results show that enrollment in foreign language in Grand Blanc at first declined, but increased over the past 2 years. The increase occurred in both the actual number of students and in the percentage of the student population. The highest attrition rates for all three languages occurred after the third level of high school foreign language study, suggesting that students are fulfilling that language requirement in high school and then dropping it as soon as they have. The lowest attrition level occurs  after the 8th grade level. For middle school students, the top reason for discontinuing foreign language study was that they had to choose between the foreign language and another class they also wanted. For high school students, the top reason high school students gave was that they were no longer interested in taking it. Students attitude surveys are appended. (Contains 20 references.) (JP)",

        "description":"To date, principles of applied linguistics have been practiced little in the Chinese foreign language (CFL) classroom. Most students of Chinese, the majority of whom are in higher education, are not knowledgeable about linguistics. Most teachers of Chinese in the United States are hired for their interest in Chinese culture or native Chinese language skills, regardless of training in linguistic theory. Most instructional materials are market-oriented and not based on linguistic theory, unlike their recent counterparts for English second language instruction. The linguistic and traditional approaches to teaching CFL differ. Traditionally, foreign language instruction is closely linked to literature study, and classroom techniques are more influenced by individual style than by  method. A serious defect of many college CFL curricula is that characters are introduced early in instruction, to the detriment of oral skill development. By contrast, a linguistic approach to teaching CFL recognizes the importance of speaking and emphasizes communicative competence, more appropriate to modern needs. A proposed CFL curriculum focuses on early learning of the system of syllables and tones, use of Romanized Chinese, and the contextual learning of words to reduce confusion about homonyms. Character study comes later. A relatively new communicative textbook is available. (MSE)",

Particular attention is paid to listening and reading assessment. The first part of the discussion looks at specific problems with five existing proficiency tests, including such aspects as inadequacy of the test's scope, the threat to validity posed by a bilingual test format, inherent difficulty in reading characters when the test is in Chinese only, and reliability problems arising from the use of authentic materials or nonstandardized texts. The second part of the discussion offers guidelines for designing a standardized CFL test. Guidelines are that: the test should be in Chinese only so that it can be used by all learners of Chinese  regardless of background or native language; it should be based on the core of the language, that shared by all Chinese speakers; its content and design should be politically neutral; and close attention must be paid to the cultural loading of test content. Specific procedures for selecting phonological content and vocabulary are outlined. It is suggested that such a test will be increasingly useful as the global economy develops. (MSE)",

Shared properties of Chinese and other languages, particularly English, are illustrated through examination of three major language components: phonology, syntax, and semantics. In the realm of phonology, all languages share the same articulatory resources and all sounds can be assigned to 12 categories according to place of articulation. Even in categories traditionally recognized as unique to Chinese, uniqueness is partially exaggerated by spelling conventions. In syntax, Chinese and English share all major syntactic categories such as subject, predicate, object, attributive,  adverbial, and complement, and only the rules of assembling the parts differ. With regard to semantics, most semantic features of most languages are similar; for example, all languages possess only three verb types: state, process, and action. It is further proposed that stressing universality in CFL will require: psychological preparation of students; use of old-new information theory in learning; presenting a fair picture of each language; focusing on oral communication; and de-emphasizing the particularity characteristic of research.

        "description":"A \"dynamic priority\" theory of Chinese second language instruction is outlined and discussed. The theory focuses on five aspects of language instruction: spoken vs. written language; universality vs. particularity; cultural vs. linguistic tasks; performance vs. competence; and proficiency vs. achievement. A dynamic relationship is seen between the two components of each aspect, with instructional priority, in terms of both sequence and amount of time devoted, assigned to one component over the other. \"Dynamic\" suggests that the component receiving priority varies in different stages of learning. In early instruction, priority is given to spoken Chinese, with written language receiving attention later. Universality (common formal features shared by all languages) has priority over  particularity (features unique to Chinese) in all stages of instruction. Linguistic tasks have priority over cultural tasks in early stages of instruction, with cultural tasks taking precedence at the advanced level. Performance (language use) is prominent on the instructional agenda from the first day, with competence (knowledge of language structure) taking a lesser role. Finally, proficiency (communication skills in the context of testing) is to be of higher priority than achievement in testing. Implications of these principles for curriculum design, teaching method, material selection, and testing procedures are examined. (MSE)",

It incorporates or draws on concepts of the socio-historical nature of language, critical analysis of communication, and systemic-functional analysis of language use. Using this framework to analyze the current situation of English use in Hong Kong, it is concluded that many students in working-class schools feel they are being forced to learn English that is not needed for their studies or for their work in lower socioeconomic sectors of the local community. English, perceived as a language traditionally representing authority, is increasingly seen now as an authoritarian imposition, particularly when the ESL teacher is an expatriate.

Subjects were 24 first-year students of AFL at the college level. The students were given computer-assisted reading instruction at four levels of treatment: control (use of text only); access to a glossary; access to conjugations of selected verbs in the text; and access to background information about the text. Treatments were combined in a Greco-Roman square research design. Post-treatment reading comprehension was measured by an immediate recall protocol. Results suggest that of the three-computer-mediated reading supports used, the glossary was the primary contributor to enhancement of  comprehension.

Two of the scenes focus on an account withdrawal; two pertain to the closing of an account. In each pair of scenes, one teller handles the situation tactfully and one experiences pragmatic failure. Failure is used to de-emphasize the transaction aspect of the scene and point up the interpersonal aspect. Communication acts and problems are  analyzed in captions and narrative voice-over.

All text is intended to promote interaction between writer and audience. Authentic texts generally have a central purpose: to change opinion, introduce a new idea, or encourage a specific action. The principle features of a written text that qualifies it as a genre include: (1) a name by which members of the discourse community can readily identify it, such as \"grant\" or \"memo\"; (2) a characteristic form and style that distinguish it from other genres; (3) a specific form and style that serve communicative or community purposes; and (4) conventions of form, style, and purpose within a range of permitted variation. Students of ESP must be  introduced to each of these features. Suggestions for classroom instruction are to: begin with familiar genres; use authentic texts that are also prototypes accepted within the targeted discourse community; use expert readers and writers as resources concerning text purpose, form, and style; contextualize texts; and emphasize features necessary to community purposes.

        "description":"Assessment of second language reading comprehension has evolved from a relatively narrow conceptualization of reading as a process of mastering hierarchically ordered subskills, with the author as primary creator of meaning, to reading as an interaction among reader, author, and text. Reading assessment has several purposes: sorting students; diagnosing individual problems; and evaluating instructional effectiveness. Most measurement methods are based on a psychometric perspective, but a cognitive approach, which sees reading as a constructive process, may give more insight into why a learner is able or unable to master specific objectives. Conventional measures of reading comprehension include multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions, and cloze tests. Currently, text  recall is considered the best method for inferring comprehension. Criticism of the method focuses on its inappropriateness for the English-as-a-Second-Language situation, absence of an objective weighting and analyzing system, time consumed, holistic approach, and lack of differentiation of processes and skills used. However, a constructive activity scale can be used with a recall protocol to identify the cognitive activities involved in text comprehension. Such a scale would analyze activities on four levels: prepropositional/fragmented associations, knowledge/details retelling, assimilation, and problem-solving and integration.

        "description":"The process of revising the second language curriculum in a Japanese postsecondary vocational school is described, focusing on the collaborative approach taken. The school provides second language instruction and vocational training in several occupational areas. A number of research teams or &quot;focus groups&quot; were established, each with a clear statement of purpose and goals. The subsequent curriculum renewal process has three phases. In the first, 16 faculty and administrators in three focus groups developed a mission statement and philosophy for the institution, conducted a needs assessment among students, faculty, employers, and high schools, and developed goals and exit-level objectives for each program level. In the second phase, focus groups collated information on research  and practice in various aspects of the language curriculum. In the third phase, four focus groups will work on development of curriculum evaluation instruments, faculty evaluation and development needs, provision of teacher and student resources, and student assessment. Lessons learned during the first two phases concern the need for effective communication, curriculum renewal as an opportunity for staff professional development, the role of consultants, and the need to establish realistic schedules. Problems occurring in a situation in which language and content instruction are provided in separate programs are discussed. (MSE)",

        "description":"Language role and language policy in education in Papua New Guinea (PNG) are discussed. First, the history of language policy since the turn of the century is chronicled briefly. The present policy of requiring initial literacy education in English is described and its critics cited, and current proposals to provide literacy education in each child's native language are outlined. The failure of literate multilingualism in PNG, problems of widespread semilingualism, evolving language prejudice, and trends in English pidginization are examined as they are perceived in PNG and in the context of linguistic research. A portion of this discussion focuses on pidginization patterns, code-switching, and code-mixing, with examples provided. Recommendations are made for a language syllabus  to replace the current English syllabus, emphasizing, in addition to traditional linguistic and pragmatic aspects of language, the understanding of the interaction between languages. Finally, implications for the teaching of languages for specific purposes are noted. A 107-item bibliography is included. (MSE)",

In the project described, small groups of first-year computer engineering and computer science students design and construct a crane out of paper and cellophane tape only, with limited but specific guidelines. The cranes are then tested for strength in a laboratory, and the students write reports. The crane project is viewed not as an instructional activity but as a \"task,\" defined as a unit of social action in the process of constructing knowledge as  an individual becomes a member of a culture; it is socially determined but individually interpreted. \"Task\" differs from \"activity\" by its long-term aims, social (vs. individual) construction, role in the development of cognitive cultural skills, and purpose in producing competent members of society. It is concluded that such a task encourages construction of knowledge through socialization among students, the discipline's teachers, and the ESP teacher, and is therefore a more effective model for ESP instruction.

Issues studied include: (1) characteristics of this population, nationally and in selected districts, and the challenges faced by school districts in educating them; (2) the ways that districts with linguistically diverse LEP students address the challenges; (3) promising approaches to use when linguistic diversity makes native language instruction difficult; and (4) the extent to which federal programs targeting this population provide the kinds of support districts need to implement programs. The report of the study, presented here, consists of a letter summarizing the  findings and a number of appendixes. Appended materials include brief descriptions of educational strategies for instructing LEP students; a list of language spoken by LEP students in five districts to which site visits were made in 1991-92; comments on the study from the U.S. Department of Education; more detailed information on student numbers and characteristics, program designs, promising non-bilingual instructional approaches, and key federal programs; data on the students and programs in the five districts visited; and notes on the scope and methodology of census data analysis.

In addition the study sought to uncover the extent of theorists' reliance on the Cartesian-Newtonian model. Using a Delphi technique, the project mailed two successive questionnaires to 169 members of the Society for the Professors of Curriculum. The initial mailing asked respondents to identify those curriculum theorists they considered most influential in this century. Responses (n=115) listed from 1 to 80 theorists. The second survey listed the 11 most frequently mentioned names from the first results and requested respondents to select the five theorists they believed to be most influential. Responses to the second survey  numbered 126. The most frequently mentioned theorists in this round were John Dewey (selected 109 times) and Ralph Tyler (108) followed by Hilda Taba (69) and Franklin Bobbitt (62). These four theorists are seen as representing philosophies commensurate with the traditionally dominant scientific, Cartesian-Newtonian curriculum model.

The following principles guided the planning process: (1) all senior administrators participated directly in every aspect; (2) planners focused on substance not form and designed the plan to be simple and flexible; and (3) all levels of staff contributed to the process. The planning committee consisted of the senior administration, two full-time and two part-time faculty members, two students, two members of the Board of Governors, and staff from various departments. Using a modified version of Robert C. Shirley's strategic analysis model, the Committee identified  external forces that would affect the College and distinguished strengths, weaknesses, constraints, and opportunities. Subsequently the Committee developed a list of five factors for each of four key areas and a statement of values and assumptions driving the plan. The Committee then opened the process to the institutional community in general for discussion and input. The final 5-year plan includes a mission statement, planning assumptions, a vision for the 21st century, and goals and objectives. In the final step members developed action plans for each major department. The appendix contains a complete copy of the final strategic plan. (JB)",

        "description":"In view of increasing financial pressures, this paper argues that a new approach to fiscal policy and to the structure of the financial relationship between state government and institutions of higher education is needed. A proposed three-part budget would include the following: (1) a base or core lump-sum budget managed by higher education institutions, subject to accountability through regular assessment of progress toward institutional goals; (2) a capital budget to cover new buildings and other major asset acquisition; (3) a special-purpose component of 5 to 10 percent of the base allocated to further the state's higher education agenda. This special-purpose budget would be connected to state objectives, and an assessment of progress toward objectives would be built into the  process. Such a special-purpose component could take the form of block grants with guidelines; of initiative funding in a competitive peer-reviewed process; of incentive funding as a grant awarded based on demonstrated progress toward a state goal; or of student funding through scholarship and work-study grants. The report reviews strengths and weaknesses of each funding mechanism in relation to the kinds of activities the state seeks in colleges and universities. The paper also describes typical institutional and state-level responses and argues that these are often deleterious to state priorities for higher education. It proposes an alternative approach which would ensure that the state's interests and educational priorities are reflected in the resource allocation process.

A section on multiculturalism identifies it as one of the leading issues facing faculty. This section looks at views on the challenges of racial diversity; racial tension; and increased diversity by gender, cultural background, and disability. A section on organizational factors looks at administrative changes affecting faculty many of which are linked to fiscal considerations. This section covers views on the fiscal crisis, faculty attrition and status, merit pay, and the information explosion. A section on mission raises some broad issues about the mission of U.S. higher education and treats theoretical  versus practical applications and university-industry alliances. A section on professional factors addresses approaches to faculty evaluation, staff development, and scholarly communication. The final section looks at personal factors such as burnout, worklife (culture and morale), and the perceived role of teaching. Closing remarks highlight the variety and speed of change in higher education and the consequent stress for faculty. This section also urges institutions to confront changes and tensions in defining and maintaining their mission. (Contains 104 references.) (JB)",

        "description":"The Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board renegotiated reciprocity agreements with Oregon, Idaho, and British Columbia in light of state legislation curbing and reducing tuition waiver reciprocity. Legislation in 1992 required state institutions to reduce the total amount of operating fee revenue waived by 6.6 percent and allowed institutions to participate in tuition waivers at their discretion. Consequently Central Washington University has withdrawn from the program and the University of Washington plans a phased withdrawal. Students from British Columbia and Oregon who attend Washington four-year institutions will receive full waivers of the nonresident differential of $4,602 to $6,399 depending on institution and level of study. Partial waivers are typical for  students from Idaho. Community colleges include a &quot;surcharge&quot; fee established in 1992 in calculating the tuition waived. Total amount waived by Washington and Oregon under terms of the 1993-94 agreement are relatively balanced. Relative balance also continues between Washington and Idaho in amounts waived. British Columbia participation in numbers of Washington students served is expected to be in balance with numbers of British Columbia students served in Washington. Separate sections discuss in detail the individual agreements with Idaho, British Columbia, and Oregon. An appendix shows participation rates for all reciprocity agreements since 1987-88. (JB)",

        "description":"This study surveyed the attitudes of public policy makers in higher education from Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee to find areas for developing fundamental policies for desegregation. A total of 71 surveys were mailed to state higher education executive officers (SHEEOs), legislative chairs of education or of higher education, and presidents of historically white and historically black universities. Data analysis of the 63 returned surveys consisted of general descriptive statistics to report the percent of the population who agreed or disagreed on each component of the 13 statements on the questionnaire. The data also allowed analysis of four subgroups: SHEEOs, legislative chairs, presidents of historically white universities, and presidents of  historically black universities. A ranking using combined positive responses showed that the higher percent of positive responses revealed those areas of most agreement. A consensus was defined as 50.1 percent or more of each subgroup responding in the positive or negative. Results found broad agreement on eight areas of desegregation, agreement on five types of events with merit in accomplishing desegregation, agreement that all of four proposed types of events significantly advanced desegregation, and consensus that the groups with the most influence on desegregation are the judicial system, the Federal Office of Civil Rights, and governing boards. Appendixes contain instruments, correspondence, and data. (Contains 33 references.) (JB)",

The paper stresses that if the purpose of education is student development, then teachers should also be developing in their chosen field of service. Action research helps bring faculty and students together in the teaching/learning process and lets both the professor and the student evaluate its effectiveness. In fact, in order for action research to be critical or emancipatory, students and professors should co-determine the ends of the research and whether these ends are met. This creates a single entity out of the researchers and those being researched. Action research then can become an explicit aspect of a course,  with the mutual determination of ends/objectives and their successful completion. (GLR)",

The second section proposes hypotheses for using the cognitive-development framework to encourage morality in students; however, these hypotheses indicate the manner in which behavioral-reinforcement theories and value clarification approaches can be in unity with the cognitive-development approach, rather than opposed to, or separate from it. The third section reviews previous studies in the ethical development of  college students, and uses them to illustrate the ideas in sections one and two of this paper. (Contains 60 references.)

Analysis revealed five generalizations concerning high school disciplines: (1) in-class activities and student requirements for courses are tied to the course text which defines the content to be learned; (2) classes tend to be highly participatory, with a great deal of student/instructor exchange and student interaction with course text; (3) high school courses show a high level of integration of language and study skills with course content; (4) cognitive demands of high school courses tend to be knowledge, comprehension, and application (as opposed to the higher demands of analysis, synthesis, and  evaluation); and (5) teachers are accountable for student performance on a number of standardized exams causing these exams to determine much of what teachers do in content classes. Analysis of university reading and writing demands across disciplines revealed that these demands vary, but except for composition, little writing is required, and when it is, its focus is on content and not on form. Cognitive demands of college courses are embedded in the reading and writing requirements. Finally, exams are the focus of a course for many students because exams are the way in which students discern the reading and writing requirements of a course. (GLR)",

        "description":"This study examined academic literacy (the reading, writing, and verbal demands on students) as a foundation for a collaboration between high school and university faculty designed to ease transitions by students from secondary to postsecondary education. The 3-year project was conducted at an urban public university that enrolls approximately 23,000 students, of whom 24 percent are minorities and a nearby city high school. While the basic goal of the project was to create academic literacy descriptions that could be used for collaboration among faculty to create better preparation programs for high school students, it also achieved the development of a model of faculty collaboration. The faculty collaboration experienced in the project provided an environment in which faculty  recognized that their shared work has broad implications which extend beyond their individual classrooms. The use of academic literacy was important in helping generate a broader participation from all faculty levels and allowed for a clearer focus to be maintained for discussion and for instituting change. This model has been distributed to 170 academic alliance contacts in a 15-state area identified by the Southern Regional Education Board, and will be distributed to a national audience at the American Association for Higher Education's 1993 Conference on College/School Partnerships.

This paper discusses the rationale behind collaboration of faculty concerned with academic literacy, examines the cultural differences that exist between high schools and colleges, describes the collaborative process and its participants, and presents the academic literacy data collected. The study found that use of the faculty collaboration model led to a renewed sense of professionalism, increased commitment to teaching, and heightened expectations for  their students. In addition, college faculty were able to develop a clearer understanding of high school academic preparation teaching practices. The paper argues that collaborations of this type--those focusing on academic literacy--widen the perspective that school/college partnerships have begun, to not only include a larger pool of academic program faculty, but also to focus collaborative discussions on questions and issues that are critical for student success.

        "description":"This brief report summarizes a longer document with the same title in the ASHE-ERIC Higher Education Report series. Academic freedom provides the foundation for faculty scholarship and teaching, making it possible for educators to exchange ideas and concepts freely in the classroom, to explore and disseminate new knowledge, and to speak out both as professionals and private citizens. It is important, therefore, that faculty members and administrators fully understand the issues and contexts that surround academic freedom in American higher education. This report briefly addresses the following issues: (1) what the popular notions are concerning academic freedom, (2) whether academic freedom is a legal right; (3) whether faculty at private institutions have the same rights as  faculty in public schools; and (4) the current issues that affect academic freedom. While the basic notion of academic freedom stems from the 1940 &quot;Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure&quot; of the American Association of University Professors and the Association of American Colleges in which the elements are specified, the U.S. Supreme Court has never granted academic freedom full constitutional status. Additionally, while faculty members at public educational institutions may enjoy some constitutional protection, faculty at private schools must rely mainly on contractual safeguards. Current issues significantly affecting academic freedom include artistic expression, political correctness, limitations initiated by church related colleges and universities, and subpoenaed  research information. To adequately address these issues requires organizationally endorsed policies that clearly identify freedoms that are available and the role of faculty.(GLR)",

        "description":"This report synthesizes the literature and applicable case law concerning academic freedom in higher education and addresses the following issues: (1) popular notions concerning academic freedom; (2) whether academic freedom is a legal right; (3) whether faculty at private institutions have the same rights as faculty in public schools; and (4) current issues that affect academic freedom. The report notes that, while the basic notion of academic freedom has existed since 1940, contained within the Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the American Association of University Professors and the Association of American Colleges, in which the elements of academic freedom are specified, academic freedom does not have constitutional status as a legal right.  Additionally, while faculty members at public educational institutions may enjoy some constitutional protection, faculty at private schools must rely mainly on contractual safeguards. Current issues significantly affecting academic freedom include artistic expression, political correctness, limitations initiated by church-related colleges and universities, and subpoenaed research information. To adequately address these issues requires organizationally endorsed policies that clearly identify freedoms that are available and the role of faculty. Conclusions and recommendations conclude the report. (Contains 58 references and an index.) (GLR)",

        "description":"This report contains graphs, tables, and narrative which present data and illustrate trends on the participation and progress of people of color (African Americans, American Indians, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic Americans), women, and people with disabilities in higher education in Washington State. The following areas are covered: (1) fall headcount enrollment at public and private 4-year institutions and community colleges for the years 1982, 1984, and 1986; (2) degrees conferred by community colleges and public and independent 4-year institutions in 1983 and 1985; and (3) enrollment and degree completion and employment data in higher education, and enrollment and completion in the K-12 education system. Included in the analysis are the findings that overall  enrollments of these groups in K-12 has increased by 12 percent between 1987 and the 1991 school year, and that the enrollment of students of color has increased 31 percent. However, the report shows lower participation and achievement by students of color and women as they move to higher levels in the education system. Without adequately prepared high school graduates from the groups addressed, there will be fewer undergraduates to receive bachelors' degrees, and consequently, advanced degrees. Appendices provide statistical data from the study. (GLR)",

Participants emphasized the importance of institutional, sectoral, and regional cooperation in achieving goals of education for all and development in general. Participants also stressed that literacy and development were closely linked and that higher education had a significant role to play in helping to identify the changing needs of basic education. The ultimate contribution, argued by one participant, which higher education can make to education for all and to development is the  production and application of intellectual innovations, knowledge, and ideas. Specific recommendations on higher education's role in promoting education for all include improved teacher training, curriculum content evaluation, the development of learning packages and management manuals, use of awareness-raising activities, and the employment of the open university model to increase access and alternative modes of delivery. Appendices include the conference agenda and a list of the participants. (GLR)",

The study surveyed a representative sample of deans, chairs, and faculty from various disciplines at 453 institutions. The final sample included 142 deans, 392 department chairs, and 1,172 faculty from 9 disciplines. The study then separated music department information from other data which produced data from 29 deans, 41 chairs, and 98 music faculty. Results of analysis of the music department data indicated that: (1) one-third of faculty attend out-of-state professional meetings; (2) 25 percent of faculty had no funds for professional development; (3) funding for  computers and books was seen as good or excellent by most deans but not by faculty; and (4) a much higher percentage of deans and chairs believed that they gave adequate merit salary increases than did the faculty. Results also showed significant differences in attitude among deans, chairs and faculty on weight that should be assigned to teaching, research, publication, committee work, activity in professional organization and community service. With respect to research, department chairs placed greater emphasis on research and publication than did either deans or faculty. (JB)",

Compensation rates and salary structures in all major sectors of the economy that employ doctorate-level members are also described. The sectors include industry, government, national laboratories and universities. Given that a large percentage of society members are in academic positions, special attention is paid to how salaries vary throughout an academic career. In later sections, compensation patterns among master's and bachelor's degree holders are  discussed, focusing primarily on variations by years of experience and employment sector. The final two sections of the report describe differences in doctorate salaries by primary work activity and sex. (JB)",

The study developed a classification system of possible benefit packages including the following: (1) little or no cost benefits might include access to facilities and events and the right to serve on thesis, dissertation, and departmental committees; (2) a benefit package in the middle-cost range might include a campus center for retired faculty, ability to audit courses, and full mailing privileges; and (3) a high-cost benefit package for those continuing to teach or do research might include laboratory and research resources and access  to shared departmental space, telephone, secretarial services, and supplies. The study asked administrators at nine institutions to estimate annual costs for each class of benefit. Results also showed that for the first class of benefits costs would be very little. The middle level of benefits might cost a few hundred dollars per year. The high cost level might mean thousands per year but would in some cases bring substantial return. (Contains 18 references.)

Findings indicate that the Department's standards for approving foreign medical schools to participate in the student loan program address only a portion of the standards for medical education covered in the U.S. accreditation process. In addition, not only does the Department do little to assess the adequacy of foreign schools' clinical training programs, but management problems at the Department have resulted in loans being made to students attending medical  schools that the Department has neither reviewed nor approved. The state medical boards have also found great difficulty in acquiring information on foreign schools' quality, forcing them to attempt a thus far unsuccessful attempt to get this information themselves. The report contains recommendations to improve the Department's standards and processes for assessing foreign medical schools. Appendices include information on the history of examinations given to foreign- and U.S.-trained physicians, and the methodology for calculating estimates of loans guaranteed. (GLR)",

This report examines graduation and time-to-degree rates at 10 Illinois public college and universities; the potential factors affecting graduation and timely completion; and the issue of improving educational quality, and graduation and time-to-degree rates without adversely affecting access to and diversity within public universities. Tables display the proportion of all first-time freshmen who graduate within specific time frames, as well as the proportions by gender within three racial/ethnic groups: Black, Hispanic, and all other students. An appendix provides statistical tables revealing the proportion of  first-time freshmen graduating at each Illinois public university campus. These tables show cumulative graduation rates ranging from a high of 77.8 percent to a low of 16.7 percent. They also reveal that, among the students who do graduate, the proportion who graduate within 4 years ranges from a high of about 66 percent to a low of approximately 14 percent. (GLR)",

        "description":"In 1991, the Illinois Board of Higher Education, working with Illinois colleges and universities, began an initiative to improve productivity, enhance quality, and refine priorities for higher education in Illinois. This initiative, commonly known as PQP, has focused to date on instructional research, public service, and administrative programs and activities. This report presents an overview and analysis of faculty activities and responsibilities. It summarizes information from a variety of studies and national and state reports that is intended to help institutions refine their priorities related to faculty roles and responsibilities. Specific topics discuss faculty responsibility and faculty characteristics at Illinois public institutions and studies concerning faculty  workload. The report examines faculty and PQP in terms of improving productivity and quality, the impact of the curriculum and instructional methodologies, establishing priorities, hiring of faculty, and faculty promotion and compensation. The report concludes that productivity and quality improvements can be realized by modifying the policies and practices that govern the hiring, promotion, and compensation of faculty. Tables provide data for 1982, 1987, and 1992 Illinois public university faculty by tenure status, by rank, by full-time or part-time status, by racial/ethnic and gender characteristics, by institution, by estimated median undergraduate instructional hours, and by difficulty of receiving tenure.

        "description":"The historic development of the cable phenomenon is traced through industry rhetoric that promised a multitude of services and &quot;voices&quot; in exchange for benign regulations. The current rhetoric of the &quot;wired nation's&quot; latest entrant into the broadband information delivery business--the telcos--also is examined in order to assess possible effects on First Amendment issues and journalistic expression. Although the cable systems of today bear little resemblance to the CATV systems of the 1950s, they still do not offer the &quot;wired nation&quot; services that they promised. Currently, the telephone companies are seeking regulatory relief so that they might provide information and entertainment services that cable now offers. In the process, the telephone companies are resurrecting the &quot;wired  nation&quot; promises. It is now the regional telephone operating companies that are promising the communications future through a fiber optic network, and the cable industry that has used the same arguments in the past is crying foul.

A 10-item questionnaire inquired about previous computer courses in both high school and college. About 50 percent of the students had taken a computer course or had worked with computers at home or on the job. The study found that: (1) students had studied all sorts of programs in their previous schooling but had forgotten most of them; (2) students learned programs such as WordPerfect and Microsoft Word out of school and continued to use them; (3) students had little familiarity with DOS or other operating systems; and (4) few students were familiar with multimedia applications. Three conclusions are based on these findings. First, high  school and college students should start with word processing programs such as WordPerfect because inexpensive student versions of these programs are available. Second, Windows-like programs and others with icons and pull down menus are the favorites with students and mask the operating systems. There seems to be little need to teach programs such as DOS or BASIC. Third, students need opportunities to use their computer skills, or they soon lose them. The impact on teacher education of the implementation of a K-12 computer skills curriculum in North Carolina is also addressed. (KRN)",

Participants from a variety of sectors contributed to wide-ranging discussions on issues related to building digital libraries, defining the roles of various players, and promoting the public interest and economic growth. Several members of Congress joined with Vice President Gore in acknowledging the importance of an advanced information infrastructure. The Librarian of Congress emphasized the need to sustain in the digital age the democratic equal access to information that libraries provided in the age of print. Libraries now confront  the task of simultaneously maintaining existing paper-based collections, digitizing selected materials, and providing access to the rapidly growing volume of information originating in digital form. Collaboration between the public and private sectors is essential to promoting an advanced information infrastructure. Government can most effectively support the development of an advanced information infrastructure through a public policy agenda that includes: (1) updating the regulatory structure; (2) ensuring equitable access; (3) protecting intellectual property; (4) enhancing security and privacy; and (5) supporting the creation of digital libraries.

The instructional planner is responsible for deciding what to do at each point during a tutoring session. It integrates opportunistic control with sophisticated instructional planning, combining lesson planning with discourse planning. The lesson planning is organized in three levels: goal generation, determination of planning strategies, and choice of tactics to refine the goal into subgoals. The mixed-initiative  discourse planning is implemented using a two-level approach: pedagogical decision making at the upper level and tactical discourse state-based planning at the lower level in its discourse management network. It generates plans dynamically based on the student model, monitors their execution, repairs plans when necessary, and replans when the student asks a question or makes a comment.

A multi-dimensional staff development program was designed and conducted to integrate computer technology in the classroom. Students and their families were provided access to notebook computers through take-home workshops. A major component was developing collaboration and facilitating shared decision making through the establishment of site councils at each school. Ten solution strategies were developed that focused on empowering school communities to share decisions for computer use, thereby increasing student use of computer technology for the purpose of communication. Analysis revealed  that involving the home, school, and community in the decision-making process for computer learning and providing schools with the tools, training, and support resulted in equitable opportunities for students to use the notebook computer as a tool for communication. Teacher and student surveys, an organizational scheme, agendas, several forms, and examples are appended. (Contains 48 references.) (TMK)",

One of the distinctive features of an effective distance education system is the quality of its learner support services. The development of an efficient infrastructure through which support and face-to-face contacts can be provided is relatively expensive in financial terms and opportunity costs for the learner and the teacher. When cutbacks are needed, face-to-face contacts are usually the first to be reduced. The potential of teleconferencing for delivering this sort of support is apparent, but has not been fully tapped. In this respect, developing countries cannot afford to lag behind  telecommunications advances.

This paper draws in the concepts of hypermedia, intermedia, interactive multimedia, hypertext, imaging, cyberspace, and virtual reality. Examples of these technology developments are given for NASA, private industry, and academia. Examples of concurrent technology developments and implementations are given to show how these technologies, along with multimedia, have put us at the threshold of the 21st century. The  STIP sees multimedia as an opportunity for revolutionizing the way scientific and technical information is managed. There is a vast opportunity for looking at multimedia applications, assessing their relevance to the handling and processing of scientific and technical information in the NASA research and development community, and developing multimedia implementations for doing so.

The essential elements of such a program are: (1) a teacher-negotiated contract for an evaluation; (2) students who sign on by enrolling for credit; (3) background provided by the client; (4) formation of teams of classmates to conduct the work; and (5) reports of evaluation results to the client. The practice of paying the class for evaluation work is advocated as an incentive. Two specific evaluations by graduate students at Utah State University undertaken in this manner, one evaluating an approach to teaching French or Spanish at the elementary level and one evaluating college-level instructional  materials for a distance learning course in French, are described. How this evaluation approach relates to the philosophy of John Dewey is explored, and the operation of the concepts of experiential learning is discussed. (Contains 12 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"One component of a model of creativity, the application of an understanding of elements, was explored through a study of college students applying their understanding of such musical elements as harmony, melody, rhythm, timbre, and dynamics. The 24 subjects were students in a music appreciation class, and the project was implemented using a microcomputer workstation with MIDI capabilities. Students first developed familiarity with the sequencing software and then practiced musical concepts by producing a melody. The Band-in-a-Box software program was used to produce accompaniment for their melodies. All but one subject completed the activities, and most completed them within the expected 2-hour time frame. To determine the effectiveness of this approach in facilitating learning  musical concepts, a follow-up test was given at the end of the project. The mean score of the experimental group was higher than that of the 33-student control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. It is suggested that the creativity-based approach also yielded results not measured by the follow-up test, such as improved student attitude. Attachments present four lessons in the application of the sequencer. One table illustrates the discussion. (Contains 4 references.) (SLD)",

This new approach requires fundamental changes in the classroom, and computer-based technologies are an important part of the change. In the first place, they can serve as composition tools. Word processors support students in many writing tasks, and the more complex multimedia composing tools provide a rich context for writing and other expression. Computer-based resource tools include multimedia databases and online educational services to enhance the writer's reach. Communication tools include electronic mail, real-time  conferencing, discussion forums, and bulletin boards. Technology can be a powerful tool for teachers and schools that are committed to an integrated language approach. Accompanying discussions examine student note-taking from computer-based materials and the use of computers in adult literacy programs. (Contains 4 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"A brief overview is presented of the use of educational media by teachers and students, along with some opinions about use and misuse. Opinions are supported by results of a survey of 55 teachers from the Binghamton City School District (New York) and information from informal interviews of teachers, library media specialists, and students. Most teachers appear to use media to complement delivery of the curriculum. Some use it often, and others, seldom. Most videos in current use are more that 10 minutes in length, and there is interest among teachers in shorter versions for classroom use. Most teachers are interested in expanding their use of technology, and most would like more information about it. The use of videodisks is expanding as the use of conventional films is  decreasing. Most teachers recognize that the nature of the media itself has an impact on the curriculum and that it can affect the intended message. Many teachers give students tasks to complete during media presentations, but most do not use presentation time for grading or planning themselves. Secondary school students seldom use media to fulfill course requirements, but most teachers are willing to accept such work, and some appear to encourage it. An appendix contains 3 tables and 14 bar graphs representing survey findings. (SLD)",

To be effective, technology must be used as an integral part of the school's learning environment, rather than as an isolated laboratory practice or for mindless drill. Six examples are given of the effective use of technology in education. Basic guidelines for technology use begin with checking state resources and community support.

        "description":"Analyses of the deployment of technology in schools usually note its lack of impact on the day-to-day values and practices of teachers, administrators, and students. This is generally construed as an implementation failure, or as resulting from a temperamental shortcoming on the part of teachers or technologists. It is predicated on the tacit assumption that the technology itself is value-free. This paper proposes that technology is never neutral: that its values and practices must always either support or subvert those of the organization into which it is placed; and that the failures of technology to alter the look-and-feel of schools more generally results from a mismatch between the values of school organization and those embedded within the contested technology. The paper is  organized in five major sections addressing: (1) the culture of schools; (2) school workers; (3) the culture of technology; (4) the culture of refusal; and (5) cultural change.

The main purpose of the study was to determine which subject areas are most/least in demand, so that the library can acquire books to optimally meet actual demand. The library did a 12% arithmetic sample of the entire circulating collection. The acquisition year of the books in the collection was recorded, as well as the circulation history. In the sampling, the library recorded each piece of data for each book in the sample. Five graphs present the following data: (1) percent of books used at least once from January 1991 through June 1993, by year of acquisition; (2) average circulations per book from January 1991 through June 1993, by year of acquisition; (3) annual  average circulations per book of 1977 acquisitions that were used in 1977 or 1978 versus those not used those first two years; (4) subsequent total circulations of 1977 acquisitions used versus unused in first years on shelf; and (5) percent of previously unused 1977 and 1978 acquisitions receiving their first ever use, by years on the shelf.

The goals address issues in the areas of: state information policy; public services; library development; archives and records management; collections and preservation; literacy and lifelong  learning; program enhancement; outreach and public information; continuing education; and staffing and funding. The goals and objectives are followed by a detailed action plan--the mechanism by which the plan will be achieved.

Members of the departments of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Management Science in the Sloan School of Management, and Materials Science and Engineering were asked about the information sources they use and their methods of discovering these. The staff assigned to the study were then expected to formulate preliminary recommendations for library and information services based on the findings. This report contains the summary of responses to the questionnaire, themes, recommendations for services,  and suggestions for further research. Included in the appendices are the organization of the study; a list of sources, including annotated bibliographies of sources consulted for instrument development and sources for alternative methodologies; areas for question development; data gathering instruments, including &quot;MIT Community Survey of Information Acquisition and Usage,&quot; the interview guide, and the focus group discussion guide; and a statistical summary of the questionnaire.

Under the Library Education and Human Resource Development Program, 15 institutions of higher education or library organizations nationwide have received funding for institutes that begin as early as fall 1993. Although the institutes are varied in subject matter and approach, all address at least one of two critical national priority areas: support for the National Education Goals or utilization of the latest technology to improve library services. Library personnel will be trained or retrained in: (1) areas of library specialization where there are currently shortages, such as school media, children's services, young  adult services, science reference, and cataloging; and (2) serving the information needs of people who are elderly, illiterate, disadvantaged, or residents of rural America. How well libraries utilize new information technologies will play a key role in determining how well they serve Americans' information needs into the 21st century. For this reason, many of the institutes place heavy emphasis on training and retraining in information technology and management to improve services, especially in K-12 programs. This document provides contact information and summary descriptions for the 15 programs funded for fiscal year 1993. (JLB)",

Critical success factors for management and key policy areas for information resources management were identified. Findings and recommendations are based on a range of data collection techniques including focus group sessions, interviews, literature reviews, and policy analysis. Section 1 provides background and an overview of the study method. Section 2 assesses information technology to support  electronic services delivery. Section 3 suggests changes to redesign information resources management in support of services delivery, and section 4 reviews successful state and local practices in electronic services delivery. The study concluded that the federal government must undertake a concerted, major effort to build a modern information and telecommunications technology infrastructure to serve its own internal information resources needs and to deliver services to its citizens. The federal government must work on a partnership basis with other levels of government, non-profit organizations, and private sector organizations in developing a national information infrastructure. Seven figures and two tables illustrate the discussion. Appendix A lists topics for further research.  (Contains 230 references.) (SLD)",

The change agents and opinion leaders are librarians who advocate and influence the purchase decisions regarding computerized information systems. From a survey of librarians' perceived advantages of CD-ROM, online, and print sources and a comparison of the findings to the literature, it is evident that CD-ROM surpasses both online and print sources in terms of cost, ease of use, speed, convenience, compatibility, and testability. CD-ROM may possibly be the most adopted information system in libraries for the future. (Contains 17 references.) (Author)",

An Intercultural Task Force was first created involving members from all areas of the campus. Task Force members developed the IC mission statement and major goals, conducted a survey of the campus community which indicated strong support for the mission and goals, and planned supporting activities. The IC opened in October 1989 providing assistance for international students on schoolwork, English pronunciation, or other language skills through volunteer peer counselors;  audio tapes for advanced English-as-a-Second-Language instruction; modules and workshops on international education; assistance for faculty and staff working with international students; information on study abroad programs; resource materials on cultural and intercultural issues; and classroom materials for content instruction and writing assignments. Additional projects included the preparation of a manual identifying common misperceptions of a variety of cultures and speakers and workshops on cultural sensitivity in the first year of operation, and the reception of exchange students and the preparation of print and television promotional materials during the second year. A sample brochure and newsletter are appended. (BCY)",

        "description":"A paradigm is a way of understanding that includes rules and regulations that: (1) establish boundaries; (2) provide fixed rules for success within the boundaries; and (3) act as filters for data. While a paradigm may help people to operate in terms of things as they are, it also may blind them to alternative ways of looking at the world around them. The current paradigm for community colleges views them as teaching institutions, as opposed to research institutions, and the most important people in the institution are the providers of instruction. However, mounting evidence indicates the existence of anomalies that this paradigm does not explain, such as the lack of success of minority students, or the perceptions of the business community that students are not being adequately  prepared. A new paradigm must propose that the colleges are learning, not teaching, institutions and that the most important people in the institution are the learners. Under the new paradigm, teachers become designers, managers, promoters, and facilitators of student learning. To institute the new paradigm, colleges must address areas of resistance, focus on learning outcomes, and revise mission statements to clearly state that student learning is the main goal. Learning outcomes will drive curricular reform under the new paradigm. Institutional resources will include student, faculty, and staff composition, while processes will center around curriculum, learning technology, and leadership. (PAA)",

        "description":"After 2 years of study, California's Commission on Innovation produced a series of recommendations to guide California's community colleges in educating a growing number of students with only modest increases in state support. Subsequently, the California Higher Education Policy Center sponsored a day-long symposium to discuss the report's main premises, including the following: (1) the unlikelihood that the state will be able to fund the colleges at their current per-unit cost in the face of an enrollment increase of 500,000 more students by the year 2005; (2) the need for colleges to do a better job of educating an increasingly diverse student population; and (3) the need for instructors and administrators to embrace technology to achieve greater effectiveness and to educate  students for participation in an information-based economy. The 20 symposium attendees, including trustees, administrators, and others in higher education, generally agreed that the fiscal climate would not allow the colleges to recoup their budget shortfall of the past 3 years. Many supported the Commission's view that utilizing such technology as computers and television would enable the colleges to remain cost-efficient while preserving educational quality. Some participants voiced concern over whether the implementation of distance learning would equally serve students who need more extensive interaction with faculty and others who may thrive in a more independent learning environment. The commission's proposal that statewide work force transition centers be established to provide  training and technical assistance to business and industry was received positively. Attendees concurred that the major recommendations would take years to put into place. (ECC)",

Results of the study included the following: (1) the trend of increasing enrollments of community college transfers was confirmed, although the rate of increase was not as dramatic as that found in the original study; (2) student characteristics (i.e., age, test scores, grade point averages) were generally the same as in the first study; (3) the academic performance of community college students in their first semester was found to be lower than that of native university students; (4) transfers persisted at substantially lower rates than native university students, confirming findings from the first study; and (5) from interviews of 33 former community college students, 70% reported difficulties with academic studies,  while 73% felt that they were prepared for the university.

The second section reviews the current state of corrective reading efforts, highlighting programs at Nassau Community College (New York), Rock Valley Community College (Illinois), Moraine  Valley Community College (Illinois), Evergreen Community College (California), and the University of Toledo Community and Technical College (Ohio). This section also reviews a study conducted at Austin Community College (Texas) which found no significant differences between the performance of computer-assisted and text-based remedial reading students but improved scores for increased practice time. The final section presents recommendations for improving remedial reading programs based on evaluations of existing programs, including requiring all curricular students to complete an assessment program, providing program assistants for students experiencing difficulties, teaching sociology or psychology with remedial reading, and utilizing computers in instruction.

Sources of information for the assessment included the AISS advisory committee, surveys of student use and opinions, the academic computing committee, and an external evaluation. In institutional effectiveness efforts at VHCC, non-academic departments are not held accountable for student &quot;failure&quot; or &quot;success,&quot; but only for having a process in place for stating  objectives, measuring accomplishments, and using results to improve programming. To maintain quality services, the AISS division adheres to the following objectives: (1) establish a clearly defined purpose; (2) formulate educational goals consistent with the institution's purpose; (3) develop qualitative and quantitative procedures for evaluating the extent to which these goals are being achieved; and (4) use the results of these evaluations to improve services and operations. The assessment identified several problem areas, including a lack of central planning for academic computing; too many workers reporting directly to one supervisor; an overlap of similar tasks; and instructors uncertain of the services available at different areas of the AISS. A description of the stages in the  development of AISS's new academic computing policy, a flexible design methodology called Educational Information Architecture, is provided. (PAA)",

        "description":"An accountability model for the California community colleges must be based on an extensive discussion of precisely who is being held accountable, to whom are they responsible, what are they responsible for, and how will such responsibility be enforced. In developing its model, the Assembly Bill 1725 Accountability Task Force of the California community colleges defined accountability as a condition rather than a relationship and gave short shrift to the specification of expectations, focusing instead on the enumeration of indicators and the communication of evidence. The California community colleges are accountable not only to state government and to local district authorities, but to students, employers (of graduates), articulated institutions and programs, and to each other.  With respect to the issue of who is being held accountable, a true accountability model would enable voters to hold elected officials responsible for the performance of community colleges in the same way that administrators are responsible to elected leaders. Regarding the question of what institutions are responsible for, outcomes rather than processes must be the primary medium of exchange in an accountability system. Among the five components of the Task Force's accountability system (i.e., student access, student success, student satisfaction, staff composition, and fiscal condition), only student success appears to be a truly first order outcome. With respect to the how of accountability enforcement, a mission-driven system must be created to replace the rule-driven system implicit  in the present Task Force's accountability model. (PAA)",

New Start applicants are admitted to KCC as matriculants in good academic standing. They take regular courses and are expected to meet the same academic standards as other students. The program offers individual and group counseling to help participants overcome previous difficulties and work toward future success. A total of 2,252 students participated in New Start during its first 8 academic years, with over 45% coming from Brooklyn College. New Start participants have tended to be &quot;traditional&quot; college students with respect to age and enrollment patterns. By  March 1993, nearly 36% of all students who ever participated in New Start had succeeded in graduating from KCC and/or transferring to other colleges. More than half of the 508 degrees awareded to these students were either in liberal arts or business administration. As of spring 1993, 599 former New Start students were known to have transferred to other colleges, with the most frequent destinations Baruch, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and John Jay Colleges. By January 1993, 62 New Start students were known to have earned baccalaureate degrees. Profiles of six New Start students whose experiences typify the challenges and achievement of the group are included, along with tables and graphs showing New Start outcomes. (AC)",

        "description":"While historically higher education has utilized many different planning paradigms and elements, two concepts (strategic planning and operational planning) can be presented as the major planning concepts into which the various paradigms can be placed. Starting in fall 1991, Seminole Community College developed a planning model which integrated strategic and operational planning with the production of college-wide measures of institutional effectiveness. The model has the following characteristics: (1) the institutional mission statement is the initiating point; (2) both strategic and operational planning are seen as separate processes linked through the mission statement; (3) organizational units perform both types of planning as they generate strategic as well as operational  activities; (4) strategic planning generates a strategic plan as well as an annual plan which result in activities with effectiveness measures; (5) operational planning is reflected in statements of purpose by institutional areas which lead to day-to-day functions that result in operational activities with effectiveness measures; and (6) both strategic effectiveness measures as well as operational effectiveness measures become incorporated into one college-wide effectiveness/action document. The major effect of this Integrated Planning Effectiveness Model (IPEM) is to link planning and effectiveness together through the college mission statement. This action has the benefit of clarifying the institutional vision, avoiding duplication of effort, and improving utilization of staff time.  (Author/AC)",

On-campus tournaments can supplement the Student Mathematics League national competition, by providing immediate feedback of results and additional opportunities to recognize outstanding scholars and improve the problem-solving skills of competitors. The tournament consists of two parts: in the morning, individual competitors take a 90-minute multiple-choice calculus test, and in the afternoon, a 10-round competition takes place in which competitors solve problems working to beat the clock in teams of four. Individual champions are determined solely by the  morning test, whereas the team champions are determined by both the individual team members' morning scores and the team's overall afternoon performance. This booklet offers guidelines for hosting a mathematics tournament. Following introductory sections, the booklet focuses on: (1) means of obtaining support for the tournament, including human, facility, and financial resources; (2) preparations 6 months, 4 months, 2 months, 1 month, and 1 week before the tournament; (3) things to do the day of the tournament; and (4) follow-up activities for the day and week after the tournament.

A study was conducted in an effort to measure quantitatively the benefits of using linguistic methods in the teaching of basic algebra. A control group of 52 students were taught with the same methods and techniques that the instructor had been using for more than 25 years, while an experimental group of 52 students were taught with a course design that incorporated writing-to-learn and speaking strategies. Students in the experimental group were instructed that for any problem involving more than one step, an order of operations had to  be followed. Students were required to write and talk about this step-by-step precedure. Before each test, students had to submit step-by-step written procedures for each kind of problem they were to encounter on the test. The instructor separated students' pre-test writing into two groups: those steps written perfectly or nearly so, and all others. Test scores showed marked parallels to the clarity of pre-test writing. When students were informed of the correlation between their pre-test writing and test performance, they grew increasingly enthusiastic about writing throughout the remainder of the course. The control group completed the course with a mean average of 74.5%, while the experimental group averaged 77.7%. In written course evaluations, all 52 experimental subjects were  positive about the usefulness of the writing assignments, including the 8 students who did not pass the course. (PAA)",

Efforts to develop the STCLDM began at an August 1991 planning session with the Mathematical Sciences Education Board. Through subsequent funding from Exxon and the National Science Foundation, initial standards were drafted in June 1993. The initial draft of the standards includes a discussion of themes throughout the mathematics curriculum, and examines standards specific to developmental mathematics, to Associate in Applied Science degree programs, and to baccalaureate-intending programs. Among the contents of the standards are the following: (1)  introductory mathematics will illustrate the power of mathematical thinking as a foundation for independent, lifelong learning; (2) the mathematics instructor will foster interactive learning through writing, reading, speaking, and collaborative activities; (3) the mathematics instructor will model the use of multiple numerical, graphical, symbolic, and verbal approaches to solve a variety of problems; (4) students will learn important mathematics knowledge through mathematical modeling applied to real world situations; and (5) as a result of application of the standards, students will be able to choose the appropriate tools and technology to solve mathematical problems and to judge the reasonableness of the results, and will be able to work effectively in groups and communicate about  mathematics orally and in writing.

        "description":"Distance education in the California Community Colleges (CCC) has been limited to courses that are transferable to baccalaureate institutions because of restrictions in funding regulations in Title 5 of the California Education Code. The CCC currently enroll an average of 93,000 students annually in distance education courses, accounting for 7% of their total enrollment, and expanding distance education efforts would increase access and reduce strain on facilities. To give colleges the option of expanding their efforts, the Office of the Chancellor of the CCC developed revisions to the Title 5 regulations to make nontransferrable general education courses, occupational education, precollegiate basic skills, English as a Second Language, worksite instruction, and noncredit adult  education eligible for apportionment. While proposed revisions to regulations will eliminate the barriers to expanding distance education, colleges will still require funding for start-up costs, including equipment purchase and maintenance, licensing fees, staff and faculty training, as well as funds to support additional student-faculty contact when required. In looking to implement these changes, however, the CCC is concerned about maintaining the integrity and transferability of the existing courses. The revisions to the regulations on distance education, findings from a 1992 survey of distance education practices nationwide, 82 references, and a glossary are appended. Contains 82 references.

In response to the bill, the Chancellor's Office (CO) of the California Community Colleges is moving away from its traditional functions of compliance and regulatory activity toward establishing an accountability structure based on student outcomes and district results rather than input measures. An accountability program has been developed which centrally collects information on college outcomes related to student access, student success, student satisfaction, staff composition, and fiscal condition, but also recognizes the importance of locally designed and managed accountability efforts. Obstacles have been identified to  implementing the accountability program, including the variance in local management information system capabilities, uneven local research competence, local skepticism, and a patchwork of existing burdensome statewide reporting requirements. The CO's proposal for overcoming these obstacles includes the following five components: (1) the annual publication of a statewide accountability indicators report; (2) annual in-depth studies of individual accountability areas; (3) periodic statewide surveys to assess student satisfaction; (4) more effective data collection and dissemination; and (5) disseminating exemplary accountability models and providing technical assistance to districts. A work-in-progress version of the accountability indicators report and a table of non-participating  districts are appended. (MAB)",

        "description":"The mission of the California Community Colleges, first articulated in the &quot;Master Plan for Higher Education&quot; (1960) and since reaffirmed in California Assembly Bill 1725, is to provide Californians with quality courses and programs in transfer and career education and in the mastery of basic skills and English as a Second Language (ESL). Due to their open door policy, competing priorities, diminishing resources, and student demand for education, colleges face continuous challenges to prioritize and adapt their curriculum to meet multiple challenges. Three factors shape curriculum policy for community colleges: (1) local needs, including student instructional needs, economic development needs, and community education needs; (2) the delineation of function between the California  Community Colleges, California State University, and the University of California; and (3) course and program standards. To meet their challenges, the colleges have developed a curriculum with four types of courses, each designed to fulfill one aspect of the college's mission. Degree-credit courses are college-level courses designed to prepare students for transfer and employment. Nondegree-credit courses provide non-college-level work designed to prepare students to succeed in college-level work. Noncredit courses provide instruction to ensure students can participate fully as citizens, including ESL. The final classification is Community service courses, designed to provide, without state funding or college credit, avocational and recreational courses, cultural activities, and community  development and recreational activities.

Section I documents the recent growing concerns about the inadequacy of existing approaches to prepare young people for the transition from school to the world of work and identifies some of the most significant attempts to address those concerns, such as the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (VATEA), &quot;Goals 2000: Educate America Act&quot; (mandating that all states ensure that students meet all academic standards by 10th grade), and the School-to-Work Act  (establishing a system for career preparation for all students in all public high schools). Section II elaborates on tech-prep as one model for improving the transition from school to work and details the implementation of that model in California in the past 2 years. Section III describes the provisions of the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1993, its relation to tech-prep, and California's recent application for a planning grant to prepare for implementation of that act during 1994. An inventory of Tech-Prep Programs in California, and performance criteria as prescribed by Title III, Part E, of VATEA are appended. (MAB)",

Students referred to BOCES are those who are unable to complete written tests, do not qualify for financial aid, and/or applied to RCC late. An evaluation of the DSD and BOCES programs indicated the following: (1) while students in the BOCES program generally showed significant improvement, one area of concern was the lack  of a policy on discharging students who do not make progress; (2) all levels of DSD students demonstrated statistically significant growth in reading skills, with students in the highest level course scoring above the RCC proficiency level; (3) writing test results demonstrated that DSD students were in need of basic writing skills instruction and that the instruction did result in improved writing skills; (4) 88% of fall 1990 and 82% of spring 1991 mathematics students had either completed the DSD course with 100% accuracy or made significant progress toward that goal; and (5) in the reading program, students placed at higher levels made significant gains while those who entered at lower levels did not.

        "description":"Due to state revenue shortfalls and mandated Medicaid and welfare expenditures, substantial cuts were made in state aid to higher education institutions in Maryland in 1992. To meet the fiscal crisis, Prince George's Community College (PGCC) implemented several cost containment measures that had been considered, but not acted upon, in the past. These included freezes on hiring and equipment purchases and the elimination of all conference travel, professional development and training events. An employee furlough plan was implemented, with 12-month employees losing 7 days, and 10-month employees losing 5. Additionally, an Instructional Services Fee (IFS) was implemented in spring 1992 to replace 271 separate student fees, raising revenue for the school through a system of three fee  levels based on the expense of offering given courses. In 1993, three additional strategies were implemented to ensure that PGCC would meet its widening deficits. The first strategy was administrative reorganization, in which seven administrative positions were abolished (representing a 17% decrease) through combining divisions or offices within the school. The second strategy was a voluntary resignation incentive program offered to employees with a minimum of 20 years of service. Seventeen (10%) of those eligible applied and were approved. The third strategy involved cost savings through downsizing efforts, including eliminating vacant positions from the operating budget and reducing hours of operation, and resulted in the elimination of 17 full-time and 10 part-time classified staff  positions.

Miami-Dade Community College (M-DCC) has been reporting that approximately 60% of Dade County Public School (DCPS) graduates cannot pass basic skills tests in math, writing, and reading. DCPS has replied, however, that M-DCC mainly enrolls students who never planned to attend college and therefore did not follow the college track in high school. They felt their college-prepared students were attending universities and therefore not part of M-DCC's sample. Recently, however, university and community college data have been combined for each district. Results show that 46% of Dade County graduates scored above the cut in all areas  compared to 63% of graduates statewide. Students had the most difficulty passing the mathematics test and found the reading and writing tests about equally difficult. Of students taking entry-level placement tests at M-DCC, 36% were ready for college in all areas, 10 percentage points below that for the school system as a whole. Statewide, less than half of the Black and Hispanic high school graduates passed the three basic skills tests compared to 70% of White non-Hispanic and Asian graduates. The largest statewide difference for males and females was a four percentage point spread in math, with males passing at a higher rate. (AC)",

For the disciplines of Business/Management, Computer Sciences, and Engineering, which make up over 40% of M-DCC's annual graduations, the failure rate of transfers averaged 15% for the past several years. A study was conducted of 564 AA graduates who were attending 1 of 5 SUS campuses in fall 1988 and who were studying Business/Management, Computer Sciences, or Engineering. The study found that: (1) university GPA was best predicted by a combination of five variables (i.e.,  M-DCC GPA, College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) math scores, SUS credits earned, critical M-DCC major course credits earned, and the quality points of these major credits); (2) the variability of the cumulative university GPA was explained to the greatest extent by M-DCC GPA, and to a lesser extent by CLAST math score; (3) 83% of the failures at the university had overall M-DCC GPA's of less than 3.0; (4) 81% of those with high (3.5+) university GPA's also had high M-DCC GPA's; (5) 63% of the A.A. graduates kept the same major in the upper division; and (6) based on their course-taking behavior, students could be categorized as high requisite, high prerequisite, sampler, or marginal types, with only the first group performing well in the SUS.

During the second pilot-testing of the resulting Performance Review Feedback Survey process, over 1,200 surveys provided information on 283 administrators, professionals, and department chairs. The survey attempted to determine general perceptions of the administrators' performance, dimensions undergirding the ratings, and reactions of respondents and administrators to the survey process. The results indicated that respondents viewed the job of administration as multi-faceted. Respondents gave administrators highest ratings in the areas of recognizing the students as their first  constituency; supporting teaching/learning; accepting responsibility for the unit; performing effectively in a multicultural environment; presenting information clearly; treating others with respect; and maintaining a good knowledge base about the study body, policies and procedures, and work area. They were perceived as weakest in establishing a climate that encourages risk taking, using power appropriately, selecting appropriate leadership strategies, and being receptive to feedback. Respondents used five interrelated factors to rate administrators: general competence, interpersonal skills, support of college mission, knowledge base, and motivation. Respondents were generally pleased with both the survey and the process. Most administrators thought that the survey results could be  useful to them, but that the number of responses was so low that the feedback had little meaning. Survey instruments are included.

        "description":"To determine the cost/benefit relationship between education, incarceration, and welfare, a comparison was undertaken of the actual institutional costs required to produce an associate degree graduate at Miami-Dade Community College (M-DCC), in Florida, and the institutional costs of incarceration and welfare in the state. Costs analyses were conducted for 2,850 students who entered M-DCC in 1986 or later seeking an associate degree and who graduated during 1991-92 having earned at least 60 credits. The actual credits registered were multiplied by the full discipline cost per credit hour to determine the total institutional cost, which was then divided by the number of graduates to give an estimate of the average total institutional cost per graduate. The average time from  admission to graduation for the study sample was found to be 4.01 years for Associate in Arts (AA) and 4.34 for Associate in Science (AS) graduates, resulting in average institutional costs of $10,248 per AA graduate and $13,888 per AS graduate. Average annual institutional costs were then calculated at $2,556 per AA graduate and $3,200 per AS graduate. After considering fees and tuition, the average annual costs to the state were determined to be $1,917 for each AA graduate and $2,400 per each AS graduate. The average annual operating cost for a Florida prison inmate was $13,902 in 1990, while the average cost per welfare recipient during 1990-91 was $4,500. Therefore, the average annual cost to the state for producing an AA graduate at M-DCC was 43% of the cost of welfare and 14% the  cost of incarceration, while an AS graduate represented 53% of the cost of welfare and 17% of the cost of incarceration.

        "description":"An English/reading steering committee was formed in the 1992-93 academic year at Miami-Dade Community College, in Florida, to recommend college-wide procedures and guidelines for including a writing sample on placement tests for entering students. The committee pilot tested a writing sample in two college-preparatory and one college-level English classes in winter 1992 to determine any improvement in student placement; the mechanics (i.e., time, format, etc.) of adding a sample; and the possibility of including reading subtest scores from placement tests in placement decisions. For the 4,250 students who completed writing samples, files were created of their sample and entry-level test scores and final grades received in the courses. Results of the pilot study included the  following: (1) approximately 85% of the students with writing samples were judged to have been properly place using test scores alone; (2) of 19 students who remained in one college-preparatory English course after writing sample scores indicated they needed English-as-a-Second-Language instruction first, 17 received satisfactory or passing grades in the course; (3) difficulties were discovered in including a writing sample and continuing to provide one-stop placement testing; and (4) the contribution of reading subtest scores was found to be significant to placement in English courses, but varied by course and test type. Information on Florida placement criteria and a list of writing topics are appended. (BCY)",

The report provides a framework for viewing K-12 education, community colleges, the University of California, the California State University, other postsecondary institutions, and job training programs as part of a single system that should be closely linked to employment. The first section of the report outlines the educational and economic problems currently facing California, including the lack of a coordinated education and training system, the failure of reform to keep pace with the need for change, and the  insufficient involvement of education in economic restructuring. The next section presents a vision of a seamless system of lifelong education and training that offers every Californian the opportunity to learn basic skills and habits of mind that are the foundation for successful careers and full participation in our society. Next, three goals and related strategies are set forth: (1) create a coherent education and training system by establishing an education and economic development council, a legislative master plan, an infrastructure of certificates and degrees, organized adult basic education, and a system of one-stop services; (2) upgrade education and training to world-class standards by setting standards, shifting to performance-based accountability, accelerating K-12 reform,  innovating at community colleges, and integrating technology for learning; and (3) mobilize higher education and generate resources to support a business shift to high skills and high wages. The final section offers a summary of goals, strategies, and policy options. (AC)",

Participants were assigned to one of the retreats based on their own preferences and an attempt to ensure a cross section of staff at each retreat. As a result of the committee's work with supervisors and reluctant staff, attendance at the retreats reached 88% of all classified staff. The goals of the retreat were to gain better understanding and appreciation of other staff members through sharing job-related issues and concerns, improve communications, make classified staff feel that they make a difference, gain better understanding of the college structure, develop solutions to concerns, and develop a  better sense of community. Participants were asked to submit two short statements describing a positive employment-related experience and a concern. Retreat outcomes included the following: (1) there was consensus that concern for the student, friendly caring people, cooperation, communication, support and trust of the supervisor, tools to do the job, having a voice, access to facts, and freedom to make decisions are important in making things work; (2) space, improper use of student help, inadequate staffing, communication, lack of upward mobility, safety, and recognition were among the unresolved issues identified; (3) participants felt that a central information center, increased written communication, and better procedures for disseminating information might be ways of improving  communication. Suggestions for improving other problem areas and information about planning and implementing the retreats for all three years, 1991, 1992, and 1993, are included. (AC)",

        "description":"This study investigated toddlers' reactions to morally related events to determine whether age was a factor in emotional reaction, whether the middle of the second year was a salient time for the emergence of emotional reactions to such events, and whether heart rate change could be used as a new measure of moral responsivity. While their heart rate was being monitored by an electrocardiograph machine, 51 toddlers aged 14 to 21 months were presented with three kinds of morally related events: (1) a prohibition to touch a certain object; (2) a distress cry from the experimenter who pretended to lose something important; and (3) a request to violate a standard, such as a request to spill juice on the floor. Toddlers' emotional responsivity to these events was measured by their  heart rate changes, facial expressions, and latency to touch an object presented after the prohibited object. Although no clear relationship between heart rate and other measures of emotional responsivity and no clear age trends were found, those toddlers whose heart rates accelerated after the prohibition were less likely than other toddlers to touch the object that was presented after the prohibited object. Negative affect after the prohibition was expressed in the older age groups significantly more frequently than in the younger groups. (MDM)",

Children were asked to complete stories involving a range of affect and conflict themes, parent-child dyads were asked to complete several narratives, and several parent questionnaires were used to assess family relationships and adaptation. Results demonstrated that higher levels of marital satisfaction and lower levels of maternal psychological distress, conflict between parent and child, and child behavior problems were associated with higher levels of boys' narrative coherence and fewer aggressive themes in girls' narratives. Higher levels of parental assistance and child  participation in parent-child dyads were associated with more coherent narratives in boys and fewer aggressive themes in girls. (MDM)",

Observers recorded sibling interactions and parental interventions in sibling disputes, and found that parents were more likely to support the younger than the older sibling in sibling conflicts. It was also discovered, however, that when the seriousness of the transgression was taken into account, there was no difference between parents' support of older and younger children. Parents  favored younger children because they are most often transgressed against. Parents tended to uphold certain &quot;rules,&quot; such as those involving sharing, aggression, and property damage, more than others, such as those involving lies, tattling, disagreement, and bossiness.

In the conflicts that were observed, nearly 4,000 issues were raised by the children involved. Parent interventions addressed 45 percent of these  issues, solving the conflicts according to the parents' positions 72 percent of the time. Thus, in 28 percent of parent interventions, conflict outcomes were discordant with parental positions. Analysis of child reactions to these outcomes found that children were more likely to have reacted emotionally, and to have refused, defied, and argued with their parents more when outcomes were discordant with interventions than when the two were in accord.

Subjects were enrolled in the Minnesota Mother-Child Interaction Project, a longitudinal study of high-risk children and their families. Semi-structured interviews were used to determine each child's ability to understand and use moral orientations in the resolution of moral conflict. The interviews involved presenting a fable dilemma and asking how the subject would resolve it. Results of these interviews were then correlated with teacher rankings of emotional health, peer competence, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, school motivation, and verbal ability. Girls scored significantly higher on ability to use and understand care and used significantly more care  considerations than boys. For boys, justice reasoning was correlated with emotional health and verbal ability, whereas for girls care correlated with verbal ability. (A copy of the fable dilemma is appended.) (MDM)",

Early training followed an apprenticeship model, but as the number of training schools grew the curriculum became more formal and specialized in the late 19th and early 20th century, with many normal schools and colleges offering such training alone or in conjunction with primary education programs. The economic depression of the 1930s and the Second World War both contributed to increasing the number of women in the work force, and Project Head Start, introduced in the 1960s, led to  greater government involvement in and sponsoring of child care and early childhood programs. Education programs for early childhood teachers in recent decades have focused on non-degree certificate programs, two-year associate degrees, or four-year baccalaureate programs for the preparation of teachers and specialists. Certification and credentialling standards vary considerably from state to state, and specific indicators of qualified staff have been hampered by a lack of general agreement on the role of the early childhood teacher, either as custodial care provider or preschool educator.

The self- and social-perceptions of 5 male preschool teachers between the ages of 22 and 50 were determined through ethnographic interviews. It was found that, as a group, the male teachers exhibited high levels of individualism, motivation, social awareness, and non-materialism. Four of the five had previous experience in other professions but decided to enter the preschool teaching profession because they enjoyed teaching. All five said that they were accepted by their female counterparts and rarely clashed with female teachers on non-professional matters. All five reported a period of adjustment to working with  young children, and sensed that many children, especially girls, initially were somewhat shy around a male teacher. Three of the five felt socially inferior to many of the parents of the children they taught due to their low salaries. Being accused of being pedophiles and child abusers was the male teachers' greatest fear. (MDM)",

        "description":"Past attempts to develop an explanatory model for African-American school achievement have focused disproportionately on failure. But if one considers the long and persistent denial and limiting of educational opportunity to African Americans, from slavery to the present, and African Americans' corresponding achievements, the historically and educationally useful question becomes: How have African Americans succeeded in producing a leadership and intellectual class? This paper reviews the research on theories of African-American school achievement, examining the work of black family scholars on racial socialization, recent studies of the social construction of &quot;whiteness,&quot; and ongoing investigations about the relative power of the cultural differences versus social mobility  explanations of school achievement among racial minorities. The cultural differences model is problematized and reformulated to include the concept of whiteness as a social construction with a cultural corollary. It is argued that in order to achieve in school, African-American children have to develop competency in the negotiation of multiple identities, including membership in: (1) mainstream society; (2) the Black community defined as a racially discriminated group; and (3) a cultural group in opposition to which whiteness has been constructed as a social category.

At the end of the project the middle school held a Living History Day, during which students presented historical papers based upon their interviews and library research to  fellow students and the senior citizens. Although the original goal of the project, to have senior citizens participate regularly in the educational process, was not met because many had initially refused to participate due to past negative experiences with senior citizen-student undertakings, the successful Living History Day can be seen as a first phase of a senior citizen volunteer plan. Follow-up surveys of the senior citizens involved showed that they thought the project worthwhile.

        "description":"A practicum was designed to address the discrepancies in educational and behavioral expectations and priorities noted on parent and staff surveys at a rural elementary school. The survey of parents (n=261) indicated parents' need and desire for education and training in helping their children at home. The goal of the project was to implement an outreach program to help these parents become more effectively involved in the education of their children. A priority of the project was to change parental perceptions: parents must abandon the idea that the school, teachers, and other experts are responsible for the education of their children and embrace the idea that parents themselves are the first and most important teachers of their children. Through a series of evening educational  opportunities, training sessions, service fairs, and the establishment of a parent resource center, parental attitudes began to change, as indicated by their increased willingness to attend parenting events at the school. (Seven appendices contain copies of parent and staff survey questionnaires, summaries of survey responses, evaluation of parent activities, and a parent resource center \"wish list\" of desired books and resources.)

        "description":"The mission of the Center of Families, Communities, Schools &amp; Children's Learning is to conduct research, evaluation, and policy analyses aimed at increasing knowledge about how families, schools, and communities influence student motivation, learning, and development, as well as how to strengthen the connections between these three major social institutions. This report examines federal and state efforts to deliver comprehensive family services through interagency cooperation and family empowerment policies. An introductory section defines comprehensiveness, collaboration, and empowerment, provides a typology of family and community involvement activities, and describes the Center's focus on reviewing policies in four promising areas: Service Integration; Easing Transitions from  Early Childhood To School; Parent Involvement in Education; and Migrant and Homeless Families. These are the subjects of the four main sections of the report. They examine: (1) service integration initiatives involving families in collaboration and empowerment, using programs in Florida as examples; (2) selected federal and state efforts to support the transition from preschool to kindergarten through collaboration and empowerment, citing initiatives such as Head Start and New Jersey's GoodStarts; (3) empowering families through comprehensive parent involvement policies, including Chapter 1 programs, special education, Head Start, Even Start, and the Kentucky Education Reform Act; and (4) federal and state efforts to provide comprehensive services to migrant and homeless children in  Texas, Michigan, Florida, Minnesota, and Illinois. A concluding section presents some lessons learned from past programs and proposes solutions to specific difficulties of comprehensive, collaborative, and empowering initiatives. An appendix provides a list of organizations advocating service integration, school transition programs, comprehensive parent involvement, and migrant and homeless programs. (MDM)",

The third- and fourth-grade students were asked to work cooperatively on projects that guided them through a series of strategies that taught them how to develop respect for themselves and others. Observations were made each month during the school year to ascertain if children were responding to the intervention. Pre- and posttest observations and surveys found that the students learned to communicate effectively with one another and respect themselves and others while learning to accept the unique qualities inherent in all individuals.

Illinois ranked 38th out of the 50 states in financial contribution per student for education, but had a high disparity in revenues per pupil at the county level, thus earning a &quot;D+&quot; grade for education. Nearly 1 in 7 Illinois children had no health insurance, and 28 states had lower infant mortality rates, giving the state a &quot;D&quot; in regard to child health. Of the state's special needs children, nearly 1 in 8 had been born to an unwed teenage mother lacking a high school diploma, and the number of children in foster care in 1993 had doubled since 1985, giving the state a &quot;D-&quot; grade for special needs. In Illinois nearly 1 in 10 families lived in  poverty, and the state's Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) payments were way below the national average, giving the state an &quot;F&quot; grade for economic security. Overall, the state received a &quot;D-&quot; grade for how it cared for the children of Illinois. The Kids First Agenda recommends that the state increase its support for education, adopt a comprehensive health care delivery system for children and families, adopt improved family preservation programs, and increase state AFDC payments and job training programs for low-income single-parent households.

The components of the study include a statewide survey of school districts, a case study of 10 schools' prekindergarten programs, and a longitudinal study of 2,000 students enrolled in prekindergarten during the 1989-90 school year. Following guidelines established by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the study seeks to discover: (1) the philosophy of prekindergarten programs; (2) how language development is facilitated in prekindergarten classrooms; (3) how prekindergarten classrooms foster the academic development of limited English proficient students; (4) the nature of the prekindergarten environment; (5) the  nature of the parent-prekindergarten program relationship; and (6) the relationship between educational outcomes and participation, or non-participation, in a prekindergarten program. It was found that students who attended prekindergarten programs were less likely to be retained, closer to being on grade level in their oral reading, and perceived by their teachers as being more ready for the next grade when compared to students who did not attend a prekindergarten program. Findings and preliminary recommendations in each of the study's focus areas are provided. (MDM)",

This assessment focused on 1990 census demographics and the anticipated child care needs of the communities. The findings from the study showed that the: (1) highest density of children is located in the Inner City of Louisville and in Southeast and West Central Jefferson County; (2) highest percentage of female-headed households was found in the Inner City, and in West Central and East Central Jefferson County; (3) highest number of children below poverty is located in  the Inner City; (4) lowest median income was in the Inner City; (5) lowest availability of vehicles was in the Inner City; and (6) range of weekly cost of child care was $12.65 to $124.50. All areas studied showed high numbers of women with children in the work force (over 56%) and households headed by females showed the higher percentage of poverty rates. Among the recommendations made were: the development of additional before and after school slots in areas where none or few exist; an increase in the number of subsidized slots for low income areas; and encouragement of an increase in non-traditional child care with greater flexibility of operation. An extensive appendix provides statistical information by locality. (MDM)",

Results indicated that: (1) at-risk students scored less well on achievement tests as a whole than the control group; (2) American students had higher overall scores than the Russians; (3) Russian control students overtook their American counterparts on academic achievement tests by the end of the  school year; (4) there was a wider variation in achievement scores between the Russian at-risk and control groups than the American at-risk and control group; and (5) boys were more likely than girls to be diagnosed as at-risk, although this gender difference was less pronounced among the Russian students than the Americans.

        "description":"A cross-cultural study examined preschoolers' knowledge of elementary components of the writing system. Subjects were 41 Chinese and 44 American preschool students between the ages of 2 and 4. The students were presented with sets of cards depicting familiar objects, capitalized English letters, and Chinese characters and were asked to turn each of the cards to the correct upright position. The cards were 3 inches square and could be placed in 1 of 4 orientations. It was theorized that the correct upright position for elemental writing units might be one of the first aspects of the writing system that children would learn and be able to demonstrate. It was found that the Chinese children were able to position the Chinese characters correctly with a frequency of 67 percent, while  American children positioned the letters correctly with a frequency of 71 percent. The Chinese students were accurate 43 percent of the time in positioning English letters, suggesting the influence of the Roman alphabet in China, while, more surprisingly, the American students were accurate 34 percent of the time in positioning Chinese characters. The latter result may be due to the small size of the sample or to the fact that there is an internal logic to the correct orientation of Chinese characters apparent even to American preschoolers with no exposure to the language.

This course emphasizes child-centered and cooperative learning by allowing elementary school students to choose individual preservice teachers to work with on a one-to-one basis for an entire semester. The elementary school students learn math, science, and social studies concepts, and the preservice teachers learn by observing how children think and learn. Before enrolling in the course, the preservice teachers indicated high levels of concern about innovative methods such as child-centered and cooperative learning. After the course, however, levels  of concern dropped by an average of 20 percent. (MDM)",

The three main sections of the report examine maternal and child health, family economics, and education, discussing the situation as it existed in the recent past and as it exists today, specific interventions that are working to ameliorate conditions, and specific suggestions for a new public agenda to further improve conditions for black children. The report notes that while significant improvements have been made in regard to infant mortality, economic opportunity, and preschool education in the black community, black Ohio children are more likely today than in 1980 to be poor, to be born out of wedlock, to be born underweight,  to become a teen parent, and not to attend college. Finally, the report advances 10 overall goals for black children: (1) lower infant mortality rates; (2) lower low birthweight rates; (3) lower teen pregnancy rates; (4) fewer families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children funds; (5) improved access to prenatal care; (6) improved legitimacy rates; (7) higher attendance in Head Start programs; (8) improved passing rates on Ohio's Ninth Grade Proficiency Test; (9) improved passing rates on the mathematics section of the Ninth Grade Proficiency Test; and (10) an increased number of students attending college.

The second section examines the effects of television on child health, discussing frequent but minor disorders such as sleep disorders, effects on eyesight, and disturbed attention span and concentration, along with serious but exceptional disorders such as epilepsy, severe anxiety, and suicidal behavior. The third and fourth sections look at the positive and negative impact of  television on intellectual development, language skills, social development, cognitive development, and socialization. The two last sections, respectively, review research on the impact of television on children in Asia and outline a Brazilian initiative to use television to educate young people, many of whom do not attend school regularly.

Two substance abuse prevention and intervention specialists implemented the program, training 88 teachers in 4 schools.

A new measure was designed to be more reliable than the multiple-choice, standardized tests used previously. A checklist of 20 items relating to language arts, reading, and mathematics was culled from various instruments and checklists. The format for each item required teachers to evaluate students' behaviors on a four-point scale. Expanded definitions were drafted for all items to help ensure that teachers would have a common understanding of the behaviors being rated. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the new instrument, using nearly 1,700 first-graders from 14 schools; scores from the standardized  Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT) were available for about 1,400 of the students. A moderate correlation was found between checklist and MAT scores. (An appendix provides a copy of the directions given to teachers for completing the checklist with students.) (MDM)",

Consistent with those of other researchers who found that school performance is related to family configuration, these results suggest that to promote the development of school achievement values and behaviors among children from non-intact homes requires an increased emphasis on parental concern and support for  schoolwork and parental help with that schoolwork.

        "description":"This paper discusses the issues surrounding the transition from home or preschool to elementary school for children from low-income families, and examines the future direction of transition programs to help alleviate many of the difficulties that these families face. Noting that there are two venues for reform action, the curriculum and the family and community, the paper presents different visions for ideal schools. One such vision suggests that schools will become a coordinating agency for many of the services and support agencies needed by families. Another view stresses the need to make schooling more central to family and community while making family and community more central to schooling. The paper recommends that to make the transition to school easier for children and  their families, transition programs need to stress: (1) curriculum continuity; (2) instructional quality; (3) safe and stimulating settings; (4) parent involvement partnerships; (5) medical, dental, and nutritional minimums; and (6) value-added assessment.

It stresses the importance of understanding what intelligence and academic success really are, and suggests ways in which teachers can modify their attitudes and curriculum to help all students achieve academic success. It advocates an inverted pyramid structure of grading, providing as much success as possible for as many students as possible, in as many areas of school as possible. It also criticizes questionable grading practices, such as using varying grade scales, using zeros indiscriminately, failing to match testing to teaching, relying on surprise quizzes,  and penalizing students for taking intellectual risks. It suggests remedies for such practices, including consistent and fair grading, letting students know what is expected of them, giving feedback before grades, and encouraging intellectual risk-taking. It suggests that students be grouped according to previous grades and performance, teacher and counselor recommendations, parent and student choice, demographics, and standardized test results.

It demonstrates that recent actions by the South Dakota legislature to ensure that children are given moral and character instruction are similar to efforts undertaken in the 1890s in North and South Dakota. The paper then notes that the ongoing training of teachers is another issue of recent concern that was also widespread in the Dakotas in the late 19th century. It also explains that the current emphasis on whole-language instruction and a deemphasis on rote spelling lessons and books also hearken back to the 1890s, when &quot;A Teachers Manual and Guide and Course of Study for the Common Schools of South Dakota&quot; (H. L. Bras  and others) emphasized similar ideas. The paper concludes that being aware of past practices and methods can help educators understand that much of the current emphasis on morality education, teacher retraining, and whole language education has its roots in the 19th century.

        "description":"This report notes that two cultures may view similar childhood behaviors differently, and cites results of studies that compared Swedish and Indian parents' attitudes toward children to support this statement. The report describes a study that examined parental attitudes and behaviors among Lappish families in Northern Sweden, in which data was obtained from interviews with parents and children and videotapes of family interactions. Subjects of the study were traditional Lappish villagers who still rely on reindeer herding, fishing, and other traditional occupations to earn a living, and have little contact with the Swedish government or welfare system. Essentially, Lappish parents believe that children should be raised as they have always been, that children should &quot;do the right  thing,&quot; and that children should have the common sense to know what the right thing is. Lappish children are trained to make their own decisions and take responsibility for the consequences, and are expected to follow traditional occupations. They are taught through traditional stories and learn that, through obedience to rules that enable them to function safely in the harsh traditional herder life, they can, ultimately, achieve personal freedom.

        "description":"A study examined the curricular event in Swedish preschools known as &quot;circle time,&quot; a daily event in most schools during which children, teachers, and sometimes parents gather in a circle for 20-30 minutes and share songs, discussion, music, storytelling, and group play. A special theme, such as the environment or a holiday, may also be dealt with during circle time. The practice began in Swedish kindergartens as early as the 1880s and has spread to preschools throughout the country. Through survey questionnaires, ethnographic observations, and interviews at 5 day care centers, the study sought to determine what actually happens during circle time and what the implications are for the participants. The results indicate that the activity is both a ritual, providing security for  participants, and a meeting. To the staff, circle time corresponds to a need for structuring activities and indicating obvious changes during the day. To the children, circles are an asset entailing affirmatory meetings, but also a restraint in which discipline and coercion are prevalent. Contains 16 references. (MDM)",

        "description":"This report summarizes a doctoral thesis defended and published in Swedish in 1991 at the Malmo School of Education, University of Lund. The thesis examined the preconditions necessary for the development of a new profession in Sweden for the education and care of young children in the 19th century. These preconditions led to the creation, in the early 20th century, of kindergartens for working-class Swedish families. The study focused on the period 1904-1944, from the origin of the first privately-funded kindergarten for the working-class, until the beginning of state provision of kindergarten education. The work and lives of Ellen and Maria Moberg, who founded the first kindergarten, and a training school for kindergarten teachers known as the Froebel Institute, are also  chronicled. The thesis concludes that kindergarten teaching developed as a female profession due to its association with child rearing and home life. The kindergarten could also be seen as a well-arranged home for children or, by its critics, as a provocation to the sovereignty of the family. To reform-minded liberals in the early 20th century, kindergarten was viewed as an instrument for changing and improving home life and child-rearing practices among the working class. (MDM)",

This report examines the work of the Deceased Child Review Team during 1992, when 207 child deaths were investigated, 58 of which were of children with prior or continuing contact with FCCS. The report notes that cause of death was determined in 200 cases, with the largest number, 85, being cases of perinatal death due to extreme prematurity. The second leading cause of death was Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which accounted for 31 deaths. Child deaths tended to be clustered in Columbus,  the largest city in the county, and black children had a higher death rate than white children. Of 31 FCCS cases subjected to further investigation, maltreatment was confirmed as the cause of death in 3 cases, while maltreatment was suspected in 5 others. The report includes various tables and charts presenting demographic data about the child deaths in the county. Seven appendixes provide tabular data about child deaths in Franklin County from 1989 through 1992 and information about the FCCS Deceased Child Review System. (MDM)",

Chapters 5 and 6 examine interactions in the classroom and the measurement and prediction of the quality of the classroom experience, while chapter 7 presents the study's conclusions. Among the findings are that: (1)  preschoolers spent over half their time in activities believed to foster cognitive growth; (2) in a substantial number of classrooms, activities that would be expected to be included in the daily curriculum, such as story-time or science and natural world activities, did not occur; and (3) lower child to staff ratios, higher teacher education levels, and higher levels of parent involvement were associated with all global measures of classroom quality.

This report describes a substudy of approximately 750 children in 55 prekindergarten classrooms funded all or in part with money from Chapter 1 of the Hawkins-Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988. The substudy described was designed to examine relationships between Chapter 1-funded prekindergarten classrooms and children's cognitive and social-emotional development, and to describe how the programmatic  experiences of children changed from prekindergarten to kindergarten. The substudy found that Chapter 1-funded programs did not contain a larger number of high-risk students than the programs in the larger study, and that they were comparable in quality to the programs in the larger study. Although global ratings of classroom quality demonstrated that most of the sample classrooms were adequate, they did little to predict child outcomes in these classrooms.

The purpose of the program was to increase students' self-esteem by imparting Native values, culture, and language. The curriculum focused on three legends of the Menominee culture and emphasized culturally relevant values identified by Menominee community members. Program staff received training regarding key elements of Menominee culture. This program came about in response to a lack of Native language and culture programs and to an educational process that lowers the self-esteem of Native students by isolating them from their elders in restrictive, enclosed environments. This paper suggests that tribal school systems must  enhance tribal sovereignty by ensuring that cultural and spiritual needs are being addressed through integration of Native history, language, and culture. The Menominee Pride Program was successful in increasing academic skills, improving student interaction, and improving student attitudes toward school. Appendices include a list of values for Menominee schools, a Menominee value statement stressing the importance of family bonding, and the Menominee Pledge. (LP)",

A summary of 1991-92 data reveals that 2,690 Native American students were enrolled in prekindergarten through grade 12, including 251 in Individualized Education Programs or other certificate programs and 82 in gifted and talented programs. Among high school  students, 56 percent were in the local diploma track and 39 percent were in the Regents-endorsed degree track. Among high school seniors, 42 percent took the SAT, averaging 393 in verbal and 438 in math, and 18 percent took the ACT, averaging about 21 in all subjects. Attendance rates of Native American students were as good or slightly better than those of all students. Only 31 percent were enrolled in a Native language, and 10 percent were enrolled in another language. In high school, 84 percent were promoted, 8 percent were retained, and 8 percent dropped out; 61 percent of all Native American dropouts were concentrated in two districts.

        "description":"Any effort to reform science education in the schools must include input from the nation's science teachers concerning what they need to do in order to improve instruction and student performance. Science teachers in rural schools have many needs that differ from those in more urbanized areas. A survey of science teachers in Arkansas, Illinois, Oklahoma, Kansas, Tennessee, and Texas secured responses from 1,507 teachers, about one third of those surveyed. More than half of teachers in five states were over 40 years old. Over half of teachers in all states had more than 10 years experience, and over 25 percent in five states had more than 20 years experience. In all states except Kansas, the majority held a master's degree or higher. Percentage of respondents teaching in a rural  area or small town was 62-89 percent. The majority of teachers in four states had three or more daily class preparations, and 62 percent of Kansas teachers had over four. In four states, over half of respondents reported that their equipment and supplies were nonexistent or barely adequate, over 40 percent had no computers for student use, and 21-34 percent did not have laboratory classes. In all states, science instructional resources were rated as inadequate or poor by 34-63 percent of respondents. With regard to instructional strategies, a large majority used lecture, demonstration, and cooperative learning; 33-53 percent never used peer teaching. Results indicate a widespread need for equipment, supplies, materials, and planning time. Without these things, little science can be done  in the classroom. Instead, science as product will be read.

        "description":"The &quot;rural school problem&quot; continues to plague current researchers, as it did school reformers of the past. There are basically two academic literatures focusing upon rural communities and their schools where rurality rather than ethnicity is the focus. The historical literature typically features tales of rural economic decline, changing demography, and emerging industrial culture from the Civil War through the Cold War. The second perspective also deals with major social transformations in economy, location, and occupation, but deals with the international scene rather than the domestic. Both perspectives address the role of formal schooling in transforming rural populations into modern citizens. Braxton County, West Virginia, fits the rural community types of &quot;depressed rural&quot;  and &quot;isolated rural.&quot; Sociologists hypothesize about the potential for rural schools to bridge the alleged chasm between rural Appalachia and the national culture. Observations in Braxton County schools suggest that instructional and extracurricular activities are intentionally compensatory, designed to offset some of the perceived cultural disadvantages of regional rurality, isolation, and poverty. However, cultural opposition to mainstream educational goals arises from a strong sense of place, the hunting subculture, the lack of role models seeking career goals, fatalist and fundamentalist beliefs, and the low value placed on high school and higher education.

Data consisted of observations during weekly classroom visits throughout the school year, student writing samples, records of &quot;pretend reading,&quot; responses to environmental print, and teacher checklists concerning literacy experiences in student homes. Each child's stance toward reading (level of engagement) was determined by interest in reading activities, level of print awareness, and stage of reading development. Results showed 7 children with a high stance, 19 with a moderate stance, and 14 with a low stance. Each child's stance toward writing and learning to write was determined by level of interest in writing activities, ability to write own name, stage of writing  development, and degree of risk-taking. Results showed 9 children with a high stance, 25 with a moderate stance, and 6 with a low stance. High levels of engagement in reading and writing were generally associated with high levels of literacy learning experiences at home. Suggestions for promoting literacy include the library corner, repeated read-alouds, the shared book experience, story re-enactments, functional uses of print and writing in the classroom, the writing table, and small-group activities. In addition, teacher and parents should work together as partners in children's literacy development. Extensive appendices include research materials, individual results, and resource materials.

The first issue addresses implementation of an ungraded primary program in eight elementary schools. KERA mandates that grades K-3 be replaced with an ungraded primary program through which students progress at their own rates without the stigma of school failure. Critical attributes required for full implementation are: (1) developmentally appropriate practices; (2) multi-age, multi-ability classrooms; (3) continuous progress; (4) authentic assessment; (5) qualitative reporting methods; (6) professional teamwork; and (7)  positive parent involvement. Observations reveal that six attributes are being implemented to some degree in most primary classrooms. Implementation of &quot;continuous progress&quot; appears most problematic. The second issue updates the progress of school-based decision making in the four school districts. Only one of seven school councils studied practices balanced decision making, where all members (principal, teachers, and parents) participate as equals in discussions and decisions, as KERA envisages. In three councils, teachers and principals dominate decision making. The remaining three councils serve as advisory groups to the principal and do not appear to be moving toward broader participation. (KS)",

The review focuses on equity of educational opportunity; financial, curricular, and staffing issues; research agendas; and educational reform. The literature demonstrates that educational opportunity for rural school populations often is substandard, especially when compared to those in urban settings. The difficulties involved in achieving educational equity in rural areas include eliminating disparity in educational funding, reaching an agreement on what constitutes a rural school district, and finding alternative ways to provide educational services to special student populations. Frequently cited as a major problem is the recruitment, training, and retention of teachers in rural school districts.  This is compounded by geographic isolation for both teachers and administrators in rural areas. Another concern is the need for school personnel to receive additional training to increase awareness of rural school and community relations. In recent years, the U.S. Department of Education has established a commitment to promote educational parity in rural schools. To strengthen this commitment, the federal government must establish research priorities through the development of empirical databases on rural education policy and practice. Current research on rural education reveals that most, if not all, of the solutions provided by educational policymakers fail to recognize the unique differences and needs of rural settings.

        "description":"In 1992, the National Association for Bilingual Education (NABE) published standards that can be used as guidelines for preparation of bilingual multicultural teachers. A survey of 22 beginning bilingual education teachers, graduates of Texas bilingual teacher education programs, examined their preservice preparation in relation to NABE standards. One-third to one-half of respondents: (1) had not had a college teacher who spoke Spanish; (2) had not been taught an education course in Spanish; (3) had not received adequate training in philosophy, theory, history, and legal issues related to bilingual education; (4) had not received training in state requirements and guidelines for bilingual education; (5) did not understand the nature of bilingualism; (6) did not know how to assess  student proficiency in Spanish and English; and (7) had received no training or inadequate training in bilingual teaching methods, Hispanic culture, multicultural issues, or classroom management. As their language-minority population grows, Texas school districts can expect a continued shortage of bilingual teachers. Fewer minorities are passing the entry requirements of teacher education programs, which limits the number of candidates for bilingual education certification. Of those completing bilingual programs, not all possess the competencies needed in the bilingual classroom, increasing the need for inservice staff development.

The goals of the project were to: (1) increase parent involvement in the day-to-day activities of the school; (2) provide parenting classes at the school; (3) decrease discipline problems and office referrals of the students; and (4) increase student attendance. At enrollment, parents signed an agreement to volunteer their time and talents to the school. Documentation of parent visits through sign-in sheets showed that parent involvement increased from 285 visits to 472 during the practicum implementation period. Attendance records from parenting classes revealed  an average of 59 percent of parents attended the sessions. The number of discipline referrals for a 6-month period decreased from 208 the previous year to 106, and suspensions decreased from 82 to 59. There was a 62 percent decrease in absences during the practicum implementation. Additional components of the practicum included a parent support group, a student support group, a peer leader training program, and a designated parent room in the school.

        "description":"Recent provincial educational policy in British Columbia (Canada) supports inclusion of special needs children in the regular classroom and a philosophy of individualized education for every child. These policies have considerable impact on teachers in isolated rural schools. A survey of 32 teachers and 100 student teachers in rural elementary schools solicited ratings of the importance of 46 factors affecting integration of children with special needs into a rural classroom. Respondents rated every factor as important or very important. Experienced teachers were most concerned about the extent of funding for special needs students, availability of teaching assistants and other forms of support, and methods used to identify special needs children. Student teachers were most  concerned about support services and personnel and the adequacy of preservice and inservice training in aspects of special education. A chart compares geographic, climactic, and population features of British Columbia and Vermont. Appendices contain a map and profiles of six small rural schools in British Columbia. (SV)",

        "description":"Large numbers of children in America's rural areas are poor and face growing risks to their success in school. Increases in poverty and other demographic changes will challenge rural schools' ability to help their children meet high educational standards. Changes in poverty among rural children also will affect the amount of Chapter 1 funding that rural areas receive. The number and characteristics of poor rural children were determined from a special tabulation of data from the 1980 and 1990 censuses. During the 1980s, the total number of rural children decreased by 6.7 percent, but the number of poor rural children increased by 2.5 percent. Other risk factors prevalent among poor rural children included a 26 percent increase in the number of single-parent families headed by  women and a continued high percentage of parents with low education levels. Poverty rates among rural children were highest in the Southwest and the South, and were higher among minority groups than among whites. Recently proposed changes in the criteria for county eligibility for Chapter 1 grants would affect more rural counties than urban counties and more rural children than urban children. About 12 percent of all rural poor children live in counties that would lose eligibility for Chapter 1 concentration grants. Appendices contain graphs, figures, and data tables; methodology; and numbers of poor rural children and all poor children by state and ethnic group. (SV)",

        "author":["More, Arthur J."],
        "description":"Learning styles are the mental processes and instructional settings a student uses most effectively while learning. Five dimensions of learning style related to cognitive processes are global-analytic, verbal-imaginal, concrete-abstract, trial and error plus feedback versus reflective, and modality (preferred sense for input). In addition, there are learning style dimensions external to the learner, such as cooperative versus competitive instructional setting, group versus individual learning, and variations in physical setting. Cognitive learning styles are usually learned and used unconsciously, and are related to cultural teaching patterns used by parents and elders. Indian students tend to have strengths in the visual modality and toward the global, imaginal, reflective, and  concrete ends of learning-style continuums. However, there is considerable diversity among Indian cultures and among individuals in the same culture. Teaching style is best defined as providing a teaching situation that emphasizes a certain learning style. Teachers can incorporate learning styles into their classroom strategies by identifying the learning styles of each of their students, matching teaching style to learning style for difficult tasks, strengthening weaker learning styles through easier tasks and drill, and teaching students learning-style selection strategies. Examples are given. Appendices include identification scales for student learning style and teacher's own teaching style, behavioral indicators of learning styles, and observation techniques. (SV)",

        "description":"The United States is now experiencing a new wave of immigrants, which is expected to increase as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Schools, particularly those in five states, are facing great challenges in their efforts to meet the educational needs of immigrant students, most of whom speak different languages and are poor. When school systems are unprepared for this influx, teachers and administrators feel overwhelmed and become defeatist. In order to provide the best instruction for all students, school personnel must have adequate knowledge and resources and must be able to rid themselves of negative stereotypes and expectations. Successful immigrant student programs emphasize student orientation to school and society, bilingual instruction, specialized  instructional techniques, low student/teacher ratio, a wide range of support services, comprehensive staff development, multicultural education, and supportive environments. This article presents a framework for equity and excellence outlining aspects of school effectiveness correlates: (1) instructional leadership; (2) instructional focus; (3) safe and orderly school climate; (4) high student expectations; (5) monitoring and measuring progress; and (6) parent and community support.

        "description":"New Mexico CURRENTS is an ongoing project that provides teams of educators from 11 elementary and secondary schools with culturally relevant humanities content and technical assistance in curriculum development and methodology. After being immersed in a rich knowledge base of New Mexican arts and humanities, the educator teams are expected to generate new curriculum and teaching models that can be adopted by other schools and districts. Most participants are Hispanic and female, and hold a master's degree or higher. Project activities included symposia and workshops for participants, a meeting for school administrators, and site visits to participating schools by project coordinators and an external evaluator. Analysis of pre- and posttraining survey data from participants and  written responses from teachers and students revealed the positive impact of the project on teacher knowledge, teaching strategies, and student outcomes. Teachers reported new knowledge of cultural content, alternative student assessment, and program evaluation; increased access to resources and expert contacts; and improved attitudes toward multicultural issues. Pedagogical changes include increases in collaboration among teachers, parents, and community members; interdisciplinary and thematic approaches to curriculum presentation; and classroom use of multiage grouping, cooperative learning, and peer tutoring. Positive student outcomes include better attitudes toward education and school, increased self-esteem and cultural pride, better attendance, and improved writing and speaking  skills. (SV)",

        "description":"The 16 states of the central migrant stream provide education to a third of U.S. migrant children. In 14 of these states, most central stream students are currently migratory Hispanic elementary school children from Texas. States must identify the instructional needs of migrant children in order to target resources and services, but data on the skill levels and academic achievement of these children are frequently lacking. The Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) tests provide an objective measure that can give reasonable direction to instructional planning by subject and grade level. Administered annually to about 1.2 million students in grades 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, TAAS focuses on higher order thinking and problem-solving skills in reading, writing, and mathematics.  Analysis of migrant student scores by grade and subject in relation to scores of Anglo White students suggests the following instructional planning strategies: (1) concentrating on language arts in grades K-3, as migrant math scores are comparatively strongest at this level; (2) dividing instructional efforts between reading and math in grades 4-6, as the greatest slump in scores occurs at this level; (3) conducting a massive remedial effort in reading and math in grades 7-8 to prevent dropout; and (4) focusing on mastery of basic arithmetic, introduction to algebra and geometry, and content-area reading and writing in grades 9-12.

This paper contends that cognitive maps can enable scholars to see better this shifting landscape. Mapping also is offered as a rationale by which social and intellectual worlds may be uttered and constructed in different ways according to different principles of vision and division. It is contended that failing to map the array of positions within the theoretical landscape prevents scholars from seeing more objectively their own vantage points and how their own perspectives relate to those of others. To illustrate the utility of such mapmaking, the changing ways of seeking comparative and international education through both textual analysis  and the use of four figures or maps are examined. The changing representations of knowledge in the field since the 1950s, paradigms and theories today, and how diverse knowledge constructs may be mapped at micro and macro levels of social reality are reviewed and discussed.

Twenty-six high school and junior high school teachers at five schools in mostly Caucasian communities took part in the 1992 study. Results suggest that most of the teachers have positive attitudes toward multicultural education and its infusion into the curriculum. Most respondents also agree that such education will increase understanding, concern, and  cooperation among people in the years ahead. The majority reported that while they try to incorporate multiculturalism into the curriculum, lack of time, funding, administrative support, and training hamper their efforts. Findings suggest a need for additional, large scale inquiry into issues of multiculuralism in the social studies curriculum. The document contains nine references and three appendices. (SG)",

This issue contains four articles examining problems that athletes and others involved in sports are having following the laws and rules governing sports. The first article, &quot;A Dangerous Game,&quot; discusses the positive and negative aspects of sports. The article suggests that it is difficult to identify at what point sports norms like &quot;a quest for excellence&quot; and &quot;go for it&quot; stop encouraging individual  achievement and self esteem, and begin motivating athletes to act selfishly and take whatever measures are necessary to excel, regardless of the costs. The second article is an interview with Los Angeles Kings hockey player Marty McSorley. In the interview, teamwork, sportsmanship, and the spirit of competition are discussed. The third section is a collection of five photographs taken at the 1993 Sports and the Law Conference. The fourth article, &quot;Coach's Column&quot; (Andy Schwich), discusses Arthur Ashe and his contributions to sports oriented civic participation, the basis of sports and the law. Ashe represented equal opportunity for participation and fair competition, following the rules of the game, and dignity. He exemplified what the positive aspects of sports in life should be.

The first law required public schools to emphasize instruction on the documents of Virginia and United States history and government. The second requested that all public schools be urged to display copies of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the United States in commemoration of the bicentennial anniversary of its ratification. The Board of Education was directed to ensure that students be thoroughly knowledgeable about the significance of documents of history, with an emphasis on instructing students on the inherent rights included in these documents; the most significant of The Federalist Papers; the historical, political and cultural  shaping of such documents, and their application to daily living. Virginia Standards of Learning objectives for social studies provide a focus on instruction of historical documents at grades five, seven, and eleven. This report discusses two documents developed to further assist school divisions in implementing these objectives. The first, &quot;Documents and Symbols of Democracy&quot; is an instructional book for Virginia students on the Virginia Declaration of Rights, the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom, the Declaration of American Independence, the Constitutions of the United States and Virginia, and national and state symbols. The second publication was written to assist teachers as they prepared instructional and assessment activities to help students understand the documents of  Virginia and U.S. history.

The 13 industrialized countries included in the study may be classified according to their basic cultural and economic systems into three major groups: (1) western capitalistic countries: United States of America, (former) Federal Republic of Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Israel; (2) non-Western capitalistic countries: Japan and Taiwan; and (3) western socialistic countries: Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia.

The report describes a multicultural education curriculum that focused on African American and Hispanic history, literature, inventions, ethnographies, and biographies. Research based cooperative learning strategies were combined with multicultural instruction. The students were grouped in a heterogeneous, multiculturally composed, cooperative learning model to facilitate the transformation. This project included a detailed fourth grade curriculum outline for cooperative group research, writing, and art projects relating to black and Hispanic cultures. During the project students developed an appreciation for the power of positive interdependence. Levels  of success were measured by pre and post tests: (1) Cultural Awareness Assessment (CAA); (2) modified Racial Tension Scale (RTS); and (3) a Cultural Interaction Sociogram (CIS). Comparisons of the pre and post tests from the three instruments showed positive results. The CAA showed 50 percent to 70 percent increase in cultural literacy. The RTS exceeded the goal of 25 percent decrease in racial tension. The CIS demonstrated more than a 10 percent decrease in negative interaction in the cooperative groups. Appendices include pre and post CAA and RTS, CIS, CCA, and RTS test data comparative results, a parent letter, an inventions game, classroom rules, and happiness helpers doll patterns. (Author/DK)",

        "description":"This paper examines the issue of gender bias in education. Major components of the thesis include research in Vermont schools and secondary sources including the 1992 American Association of University Women report. The paper includes three main divisions. The first part addresses the paradox of trying to study gender, including some basic theories on what gender is and how it is developed. The second part looks at school and its role in promoting gender differences. The final section offers resources and suggestions for change. The major finding is that the educational system socializes the sexes into specific roles based on tradition, bias, and the widespread desire to maintain the status quo. Due to the contrast between traditional feminine roles and the behaviors necessary  for educational excellence, females often suffer in coeducational settings. Specific areas covered include the following: (1) an explication of research that strongly supports the conclusion that nurture rather than nature produces differences between the sexes; (2) a discussion of the family and peers' roles in gender socialization; (3) a historical overview of the education of women; (4) a case study of Cuba showing how schools are used in the intentional socialization of gender roles; (5) a focus on educators' attention, students' participation, and expectations of both; (6) a look at how the curriculum often discourages females from realizing their potential; and (7) various suggestions to make the educational system a more equitable one.

        "description":"This bulletin discusses some non-traditional teaching vehicles such as plays, computers, and &quot;learning by doing&quot; projects used to heighten student interest in law-related education (LRE) by offering students unique experiences in a variety of settings. Four plays that have been developed or sponsored by local bar associations include: (1) &quot;Vote is a Four Letter Word,&quot; a one woman show tracing the origins of the voting right, from America's first legislative assembly in 1619 to the ratification of the 26th Amendment that reduced the voting age to 18 in 1971; (2) &quot;The Kingdom v. Jack Spriggins,&quot; based on the &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; fairy tale in which students make up the jury at Jack's trial for murder, kidnapping, and theft; (3) &quot;Rumpelstiltskin v. the Queen,&quot; based on the  Rumpelstiltskin fairy tale; and (4) &quot;The Trial of William Penn,&quot; set in England in the last 17th century, and based on the trial of William Penn and William Mead. A law related education program, also described, includes skits, three videotapes, and a program that explores the U.S. election system and gives students an opportunity to see how the electoral process works. Hands-on projects that are discussed include &quot;Project Inside Out, a theater project that allow adolescents to experience what it feels like to be in jail; a constitutional writing camp in which students pretend to be colonists in a space colony; and Project PATCH ideas such as a student bill of rights and an international law project.

The document begins with the article \"Research and Law Related Education: Perceptions, Perspectives, and Possibilities\" (David T. Naylor). The article identifies five categories of questions important to LRE research: (1) What is the nature and status of LRE? (2) What impact does LRE have on the lives of students? (3) What is needed to teach LRE effectively? (4) How should teahers be prepared to teach LRE? and (5) What is required to get and keep LRE in school programs? Five functions of research are identified: (1) to provide scientific underpinnings to the ideas and practices regarded as common sense; (2) to uncover new perspectives and provide fresh ideas; (3)  to uncover ways of proceeding requiring different beliefs or complex actions; (4) to produce findings that simplify practice; and (5) to yield ideas and findings that are counter-intuitive. Ten references are included. The remainder of the bulletin consists of summary reports of seven research studies in progress: (1) \"Exploring the Dimensions of Political Tolerance among Adolescents\"; (2) \"Current Status of LRE in Elementary Classrooms\"; (3) \"Teachers' Conceptions of Justice as Implemented in Social Studies Curriculum\"; (4) \"Judicious Discipline: Teachers and Students Practicing the Language of Citizenship\"; (5) \"Impact of Mediation Experience on Mediators\"; (6) \"Cognitive Development in Young Children: Issues of Literacy Expression and Law\"; and (7) \"An Analysis of Initial Law Related  Education: Case Studies of Elementary School Teacher-Pupil Interactions Related to the Concepts of Law and Order.\" Eight research proposals are summarized.

        "description":"This practicum was designed to help third grade students develop critical thinking skills of application, analysis, and synthesis in social studies activities. Teachers were unhappy with the teaching of social studies as it existed. Among the contributing causes were the lack of a critical thinking program, an over-dependence on commercially prepared worksheets, and the lack of student opportunities to explore their environment. Specific strategies were developed that addressed the integrating of thinking skills into the third grade social studies curriculum. The solution was to stress thinking skills through the teaching of three to five thinking skill strategies, problem solving techniques, the use of cooperative learning, wait time, and high level questioning techniques.  Teachers also wrote and published six social studies units that were shared with other teachers. Although not all objectives were met, significant growth in thinking skills did occur. Most children showed improvement in application, synthesis, and analysis skills. Creative thinking was fostered by participation in an invention fair. Teacher in-service training sessions were another component of this practicum that was well received. (Author/SG)",

This document reports the conclusions of research examining what conceptions of justice are embedded in the taught curriculum and whether male and female teachers hold and express different views of justice. Eighteen teachers submitted to interviews for the study. All felt \"teaching justice\" was important and could cite specific topics and materials in use in their curricula. Two thirds claimed to teach about justice directly and intentionally, and the other third claimed to do so indirectly. Definitions of justice emerged as primary theme clusters: (1) justice as right and wrong; (2) justice as  fairness; and (3) justice as an ideal or standard. All teachers drew on ideas from all three clusters. Two secondary themes emerged: the idea of justice as requiring moral action and a belief in the relativity of justice. Language and examples that teachers offered were consistent across gender lines. The paper concludes that the topic is worthy of further investigation. Contains 30 references. (SG)",

        "description":"This paper discusses Channel One, a 12 minute education television news program broadcast to over 12,000 schools in the United States each school morning. The programming adds over 30 hours of potential information during the school year, most of it related to social studies purposes. Because Channel One is viewed by all students, teachers can count on a common basis for discussion and other class work. Channel One has the potential for putting all students at the same starting point with basic news information. How this opportunity is utilized depends greatly on teachers. The purpose of this research was to study and describe how Channel One is perceived by social studies teachers, their students, and their parents, and how it is used in the classroom. The study compared  questionnaire data from the 1990-91 and 1992-93 school years. The paper summarizes findings from nine previous research reports. A consistent picture emerged showing administrators were most positive about Channel One, followed by teachers, parents, and students. This study resulted in two patterns: (1) in both years teachers were more positive about depth of coverage on Channel One than were students, and the disparity was very large; and (2) while students' attitudes were very stable across the two years, the teachers showed some erosion from 1991 to 1993 in their assessment of depth. The two studies showed a dramatic negative change over the 2 years for teachers in their assessment of the competence of Channel One commentators. Attitudes were positive for quality of programming and  general worth for both students and teachers. (DK)",

        "description":"This document examines the role of education in cultural development. Culture itself is difficult to define, but involves behavior that is shared, transmitted, imitated, adapted, and altered within a society. Each social group has a cultural identity--that core of concepts, ideas, values, behavior, and purposes by which members of the group identify themselves and distinguish themselves from other groups. Education is the process by which a newborn becomes an integrated member of the community and it is the main agent of transfer of culture through the generations. Education guarantees the continuation of culture. In earlier times, where central governments managed schools, the governments dictated curriculum and the curriculum reflected the culture of the center of power. The  norms and values of formal education can strengthen the cultural identity of the learners. Non-formal education may offer an alternative form of teaching and can be used to impart specific skills for employment or social development. Informal education may be even better, as it requires lower expenses while tapping knowledge, skills, and ideas that would otherwise be overlooked. Formal teaching should be supported by informal education, or the official values and skills that the schools teach may come off second best to what pupils learn in informal circuits.

Only through years of education is it possible to begin to perceive how creativity and aesthetic values affect the emotional development of the youth as a whole. Modern educational concepts need to be taught using traditional methods that have in them aesthetic qualities and a message to communicate. The history of formal and nonformal education in India goes back several millennia. Education was totally merged into the cultural roots of the region. Such a mix is necessary today, as an understanding and respect of other cultures is only possible through a full awareness of one's own culture. Since there is an urgent need to link education and culture, there is  a corresponding need to change preservice and inservice teacher education. Culture can be incorporated either through an integrated curriculum or as a separate discipline in teacher training. With little additional training, teachers become very aware of their role in teaching about culture. Schools should assist in such efforts through the use of printed and audiovisual educational materials that enhance teacher output. (SG)",

The myths of the Fulbe, such as the story of herdsman Sile Sajo's encounter with the deity Kumen, provide insight into the culture. The story reflects the society's agricultural base, identifies personal characteristics which the culture prizes, and provides insight into the Fulbe moral code. Fulbe nomads have a culture distinct from that of the larger Nigerian society. As such, there is a need for special approaches to education. Nigeria's New National Policy on Education provides details of the integrative aims and objectives of the government's educational efforts, including its short and long term goals. The policy also sets out curriculum guidelines  on language, mathematics, social studies, science, and creative activities. Education must incorporate the past into the present in order to fashion the future, and thus enable the Fulbe to take their place in the world society in a spirit of solidarity.

        "description":"Education is both an idealistic and a practical endeavor. It is essential to have an image of the educated person to which to direct individual efforts and institutional policies. The present view of the educated person is that of a materialist, specialist, individualist, nationalist, secularist, and opportunist. Looking backward, Plato's image of the educated person was embodied in his concept of the philosopher-king, trained in both the physical and intellectual arts as well as military science, music, and ultimately philosophy. Wanting for nothing, the philosopher-king would be beyond corruption, to the benefit of the community. Later, Erasmus' image of &quot;the good man&quot; was the pinnacle of Renaissance culture, possessing tolerance, wide and cosmopolitan interests, moral  excellence, and sound learning in Latin and Greek. Friedrich Herbart saw moral development as the ultimate goal of education. Herbart's model of the &quot;cultured man&quot; epitomized freedom, goodwill, perfection, righteousness, and ethical responsibility. The educated person of the future should embody such virtues as holism, altruism, and environmentalism, and should be creative, cooperative, circumspect, and egalitarian. Educators must treat culture as a discipline in itself. It will require the descriptive, comparative, non-judgmental study of culture. Such initiatives must be at the forefront of pedagogical change.

What results is a civilized elite which is unsuccessful in bringing knowledge to the vast majority of the population. A project in Cameroon proposes to teach through extensive trilingualism. First, children learn reading, writing, and arithmetic via the local language. At the same time the children begin to learn one of the &quot;official&quot; languages, which may become the primary language of instruction. Later, students learn a third language, which may be either the second official language or the local tongue of a neighboring community. Such an effort was conducted from 1981 to 1987. Students expressed themselves better and performed slightly  better in arithmetic, and about equally well in French, as did a control group. Teaching in the local language is a necessary part of preserving the local culture. Failing to promote the culture would amount to promoting alienation and harming self-esteem. Discrepancies between theory and practice would only be reinforced through setting apart the official language and the vernacular. Despite years of promoting official languages, the local tongue is still the main vehicle of communication. Using local language in education would signal that one can be educated but still retain African culture. (SG)",

Indigenous cultures have as much, if not more, to offer the West, than the West can offer them. For the cultures to survive, they must own all aspects of the education of their people. Language is a central part of culture. The primary responsibility lies with families and communities to foster spontaneous, everyday use of the vernacular. Educational policymakers must allow indigenous groups to reconceptualize schooling within their own cultural parameters. In Australia, aboriginal groups have been developing alternative patterns of education for years. At the same time, educators  must pay attention to the process by which a given culture learns. Solutions must come from within indigenous communities, not from without. In the Catholic schools of Western Australia, that has meant &quot;two way&quot; or &quot;both ways&quot; education, wherein children learn both aboriginal and western ways through an exchange between the two. Non-indigenous people have a role to play in educational process, not by offering solutions but by changing their attitudes and roles. Their challenge is to work beside indigenous peoples in relationships of equality and mutual respect. (SG)",

A number of museum related institutions, known as the Science Centra, have arisen to offer self-directed learning activities in problem solving and understanding the processes related to everyday life. In a modern society, it also necessary to learn to analyze critically information that the media provide. Museums and the Science Centra can be useful in this context as well and can offer students the opportunity to employ the media as learning tools. In recent years the &quot;ecomuseum&quot; also has arisen. An ecomuseum works to document the local heritage, to stimulate popular interest in that heritage, and to collect documentation of history. The ecomuseum model  also provides a means of preserving indigenous languages and promoting their use and instruction. Cooperation among the various kinds of museums could help revitalize the cultural life of a community. At the same time, the cultural organizations can serve as catalysts of cooperation between schools and the broader community. This in turn can foster the view that cultural development is impossible without striking a balance between the natural environment and technical development and exploitation. (SG)",

The Center assists schools to analyze needs, establish goals, and implement those goals. Technical assistance and college and school faculty training are among the Center's tasks. The Center established a restructuring network which includes the 28 approved teacher education programs in South Carolina and more than 100 associate schools throughout the state. These schools, which become partner schools and professional development schools, have pivotal roles in driving educational change in the Center's model for school improvement. In addition, the Center is a partner in the South  Carolina collaborative chosen as one of the eight Goodlad sites engaged in developing model programs that link school restructuring to teacher education reform. Five colleges and universities are partners in the collaborative: Benedict, Furman, Columbia, University of South Carolina, and Winthrop. This paper describes elements of the school/college partnership at each of these institutions, focusing on noteworthy features such as an innovative approach to college faculty load at a professional development school affiliated with the University of South Carolina, partner school criteria, and recruitment of males and persons of color for rural and neighborhood schools. The paper presents 17 guidelines for establishing statewide collaboratives to facilitate school restructuring.  (IAH)",

        "description":"The doctoral thesis summarized in this document investigated which set of teacher education program admissions criteria best predict achievement by examining the relationship between outcomes in the teacher education program and test scores and other indicators of academic achievement. The particular problem was to determine the predictive value of currently utilized admission tests of academic achievement for teacher education programs at the College of Education, University of Akron (Ohio). A sample of students (N=455) who had been admitted to the College of Education during calendar year 1990 was compared to the population in terms of standardized test scores, incoming grade point averages, course grades, major department, and demographics. The six predictor variables  selected by regression analysis were: incoming cumulative grade point average, ACT English, whether a course in educational media had been taken, grades in two education course prerequisites, and whether the ACT had been taken. Data analysis indicated that the best predictor of future performance is past performance, and that standardized tests are preferable to course grades due to outside factors (e.g., grade inflation). In addition, performance in certain specific education courses proved to be predictive of academic achievement. These findings imply the desirability of colleges of education requiring certain prerequisite courses and using those course grades in program admissions decisions. (LL)",

The survey, first conducted in 1987, queries Departments of Education in the 50 states and the District of Columbia regarding kindergarten through grade 12 physical education programs in their states. The publication provides survey findings, recaps 1987 results, and gives NASPE recommendations. The main body  of the document is devoted to brief descriptions of physical education in each state. For each state the following topics are covered: the availability of and mandate for physical education programs, an overview of who is teaching physical education, examples of special state needs and initiatives, and names and addresses of contact persons. Overall findings suggest that while the number of states mandating physical education has increased to 46 from 42 in 1987, physical educators are under intense pressure to defend their programs during these cost-cutting times.

The PASS program helps athletes to see the connections between athletic and academic success, and focuses on eight fundamental keys to success, including concentration, balance, relaxation, power, rhythm, flexibility, instinct, and attitude. The study found that, compared to control students, students who had completed a year of PASS were more likely to improve their grades and were more likely to restore eligibility to participate in sports. The paper concludes that the third-year impact study, as did the first and second year studies, confirms that PASS improves academic performance as measured by overall grade point average. It supports  the premise of PASS that in order to improve academic performance for those students involved in athletics, there needs to be an increased, not a decreased, emphasis on the appropriate study and practice of sports. A statement of the goals of the American Sports Institute related to the PASS program is attached. (JDD)",

This report emanates from a 5-day conference of the Christa McAuliffe Institute for Educational Pioneering (CMI), an organization that nurtures the efforts of innovative and creative teachers around the country. The document emphasizes professional development activities that must accompany change initiatives. Underpinning the report are personal stories that CMI teachers tell of their struggles to make change happen. A unifying theme of the stories is the presence of risk and the capacity to resist discouragement. For the group of CMI teachers who  believe that educational structures and practices must be altered and whose deliberations led to this report, it made sense to look at themselves and their schools in terms of four separate but overlapping challenges: (1) diversity and multiculturalism; (2) teaching and learning; (3) systemic reorganization; and (4) coalition building. As the four challenges indicate, teachers will be the key figures in bringing about change in schools. (LL)",

The brief addresses first five major themes of reform and their implications for teaching. These themes are: reforms in subject matter teaching (standards, curriculum, and pegagogy); reforms centered on problems of equity and the increasing diversity of the student population; reforms in the nature, extent, and uses of student assessment; reforms in the social organization of schooling; and reforms in the professionalization of teaching. It is claimed that policymakers and administrators confront major challenges in matching existing resources for professional development  to such challenges. These challenges are summarized under four headings: surmounting the limitations of packaged knowledge; the spread of innovation; centering learning opportunities in the school workplace; and deciding the locus of responsibility for professional development policy. Alternatives to traditional models of professional development are highlighted. These include teacher collaboratives, subject matter associations, and school/university collaborations. Each of the alternative professional development approaches suggests principles to guide the design of professional development opportunities such as contexts of teaching, experience of teachers, support for informed dissent, and techniques and perspectives of inquiry.

This study examined the thoughts about teaching of two groups of student teachers--45 graduate and 63 undergraduate students. The professional coursework of both groups was very similar, with one exception--graduate students had no practica experiences in elementary classrooms before student teaching. Questionnaires were administered to all student teachers before and after the student teaching placement. Findings support the strength of the undergraduate teacher education program. Prior to student teaching, the two groups were very similar in their thoughts about teaching. Following the experience, undergraduates revealed different kinds of thoughts than graduates. For  example, graduate students continued to reflect concern about their basic teaching skills, lesson planning, and classroom management; undergraduates were more confident and more sophisticated in their thinking about classroom pedagogy and were better able to reflect on whether children learned from their teaching. Based on informants' responses, it was concluded that practica experiences help new teachers move more quickly to mature thoughts about both teaching and children's learning. (LL)",

        "description":"This paper describes an undergraduate teacher education course offered at Urbana University (Ohio). The course introduces preservice teachers to the nature of multiculturalism in terms of economic, social, intellectual, age, and gender differences, leading participants to explore this educational process from sociological and psychological perspectives. The class provides a framework for: exploring influences that bear on students, teachers, and schools in terms of societal pressures and human diversity; recognizing prejudice, scapegoating, and discrimination; gaining the helping skills needed for promoting multicultural sensitivities; and examining the individual's own belief systems. Class activities run the gamut from class discussions to a videotape production. For purposes  of synthesizing course material, a culminating project deals with the development of a visual construct on the role of the teacher in multicultural education. Based on the development of a conceptual model, the members of one class concluded that the desired status of multicultural education would be a continuing process whereby all students would experience educational equality regardless of personal backgrounds. An illustration of the visual construct is included. (LL)",

        "description":"Human relations training is a requirement for all teacher education majors graduating from Iowa colleges and universities. At the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) this course is delivered to preservice teacher education students in conjunction with their full semester student teaching experience. Major goals of the training program are: (1) to confront individuals with experiences designed to create an awareness of biases, attitudes, and beliefs and to create awareness of the degree of congruency between stated beliefs and actual behavior; and (2) to internalize and translate such awareness into actions which result in more positive relationships within the teaching/learning environment. In each of UNI's student teaching centers, the course is administered and delivered by a  combination of UNI professor, clinical supervisor, and a cadre of practitioners. The course content includes: cooperative learning practices, classroom &quot;ice breakers,&quot; removing bias from the classroom, values/self-esteem, children at risk, perceptions we have (e.g., race, homosexuality), and the psychology of winning. Each student teacher is required to do at least one action research project. The course meets requirements for teacher licensure in Iowa, allows professional staff to establish a workable rapport with student teachers, offers a vehicle for demonstrating effective teaching practices, gives student teachers the opportunity to make creative contributions to their cooperating teacher's classroom, and proves that human relations are not just theoretical concepts.

It describes the sporting experiences, and the decisions associated with those experiences, of a group of girls opposing traditional pressures by participating in a &quot;male&quot; sport (soccer). A survey was conducted of 105 female soccer players (ages 13-18) classified into 3 subgroups (continuing, withdrawn, and new), and interviews were conducted with 15 of the girls. The study addressed factors encouraging and discouraging girls to play soccer; parents' involvement in sport; peer reactions to girls playing sport; gender connotations of sport; role of significant others, such as family members and coaches; and the girls' self-image. The study found that support  from young women already playing soccer and from family members was an important factor in the subjects' participation. They chose soccer because it offered fun, friendship, feeling good, and good coaches. They had experienced negative attitudes and verbal intimidation from male peers but had opted to play soccer anyway. The demands of studies was an important factor in discouraging young women from playing soccer. Five recommendations are offered for attracting girls to soccer and retaining their participation.

The program is taught by classroom teachers and involves approximately five sessions on each of six skill units: locomotion, ball control, throwing, tracking and trapping, kicking, and striking. A survey of 208 teachers and 160 students in grades 2-6 in the Sydney (Australia) metropolitan area was conducted to evaluate the 1992 pilot program, and a survey was conducted of 335 teachers and over 1,100 students following national implementation of the program in 1993. The evaluation analyzed teachers' feelings about school sport and factors influencing teachers' participation in SPORT IT!, teachers' feelings about  the aims of SPORT IT!, program length, incentives, the manual, students' feelings about the program, and gender and age comparisons. Evidence suggests that SPORT IT! addressed the sporting skill needs of students, that students valued the program for the fun they experienced and the sportsmanship attitudes fostered by the program, and that the incentives (pizzas) promoted participation.

This study was conducted to determine the impact of the Holmes Group recommendations on preservice preparation of health education teachers. Health education department chairs at nine universities belonging to the Holmes Group were invited to complete questionnaires identifying and ranking predicted and perceived effects of these recommendations on health education majors. The responses indicated a lack of agreement among the subjects. Based on informants' responses, the following general predictions were arrived at: (1) students graduating from Holmes-based extended teacher education programs will be well-prepared to teach; (2) few schools will actually implement  a Holmes-based teacher education program; (3) 4-year programs will continue to prepare health education teachers; and (4) the number of school health education majors will decrease at Holmes universities. Results also suggest that grassroots support for Holmes Group recommendations among health educators is lacking; widespread adoption of Holmes-based curricula in departments of Health Education is not likely; and the Holmes Group will not have much effect on the preparation of health education teachers. The two are like oil and water. (Contains 17 references.) (LL)",

        "description":"This paper suggests that collegiate and professional athletes preparing to retire should be provided with preretirement and postretirement rehabilitation counseling. The counseling should involve a preventative approach centered around self-acceptance, to enhance the athlete's performance before and after retirement. The development of self-acceptance in an athlete helps him or her to experience less competitive cognitive anxiety. A model for performance enhancement links self-acceptance to cognitive anxiety and cognitive anxiety to performance. Questions are presented that athletes can ask themselves to examine their level of self-acceptance and that coaches can ask themselves to determine their enhancement of athletes' self-acceptance. The issue of retirement for professional  athletes is compared to the psychological stages of someone who is dying. These stages include denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Counseling an athlete as he or she goes through these stages involves listening/confrontation, cognitive therapy, and vocational guidance. Counselors are encouraged to provide empathy and support, break the problem into manageable parts and develop a plan to tackle those parts, and determine the athlete's internal and external strengths and resources. An appendix presents a self-concept diagram. (Contains 12 references.) (JDD)",

        "description":"This paper describes several key issues which are shaping the profession of Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE). The issues include tertiary education, teacher education and schooling, and deprofessionalization. Drawing from data at an Australian case site, the paper argues that these key issues shape the profession's knowledge, values, attitudes, and practices. In doing so, PETE courses may constrain the professional development of physical education and physical education teachers. Interviews with 18 faculty and 292 college students found that PETE students often arrive at their institutions of higher education with particular technocratic values venerating science, masculine perspectives, or entrepreneurialism, and may find that these values are reinforced throughout  their courses despite these values being incompatible with those that will benefit them and their students as teachers in schools. In conclusion, the argument is made that the proletarianization of PETE faculty and students needs to be arrested by particular measures which will be of benefit to the intellectual work of physical educators. It is suggested that PETE may need to align itself with the education departments and faculties in tertiary institutions rather than with what are essentially departments of sport sciences, despite claims of their balanced, multidisciplinary structures.

An 8-week exercise program was developed and evaluated to determine its effect on satisfaction and quality of life for 24 older adults (ages 73-96) with mental impairments and to provide a demonstration of a comprehensive exercise program for older adults with Alzheimer's disease or dementia living in long-term care facilities. The exercise program was designed to improve physical flexibility of the shoulders, back, and posterior legs and to improve grip strength. The program was designed to consider symptoms and behaviors of the target population,  such as short attention spans, cognitive processing deficits, and agnosic reactions. Findings indicated that the exercise program resulted in some improvements and retention of flexibility and strength abilities. The Life Satisfaction Scale (LSS) was administered before and after the program, but 16 of the 24 subjects were unable to complete the LSS interview. Of the remaining eight subjects, all but one showed significant improvement in perceived life satisfaction. (Contains approximately 160 references.) (JDD)",

The project also hoped to foster the development of understanding and responsible attitudes and moral values in relation to sexual development and relationships on the part of students and parents. The program was established by gaining parental and community support, developing curriculum and instructional materials, training teachers, and then introducing family life education into 104 secondary schools in Fiji. AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) education and alcohol/drug abuse education were integrated into the family life program. A 45-minute video program, titled&quot;TALANOA,&quot; was produced to stimulate discussion on sex, abortion, family planning, sexually transmitted diseases, and boy-girl relationships. The family life course is optional, with the expectation that it will be made compulsory in the near future.

Surveys, observations, and review of documents in 102 elementary, junior, and senior high school buildings, and focus group discussions in 15 schools, revealed that several elements were in general or full compliance: providing accurate, age-appropriate information and curricula; instruction consistent with community values; advisory representation from required groups/individuals; development and  implementation of instructional programs by boards of education and their HIV/AIDS committees; and condom availability. Areas of noncompliance included: not stressing abstinence, improper exemption from instruction, uncertified or untrained educators, and inadequate involvement of advisory council members. This report describes all aspects of the compliance review, including the design of the review; the methodology used to conduct the review and collect data; the standards developed to determine compliance; the results of data collection; data analysis; and findings and recommendations. Appendices include copies of relevant regulations and the data collection instruments. (JDD)",

        "description":"In this study on schema theory, interviews were conducted with three adults to identify the schema for particular words or phrases (pencil, making a hot drink, talking), which required identifying all those dimensions of meaning involved implicitly and explicitly in how the word/phrase is used. Results revealed that subjects described their ideas predominantly as pictorial images, but also using descriptions and role playing. Most images were recollections of past experiences. Difficulties encountered in obtaining and presenting the data are discussed, such as the involvement of many schemata in the understanding of the meaning of a single word or phrase, the effect of the interaction between verbal-auditory and visuo-spatial systems on understanding, and cultural influences on  memory. A program of Christchurch College of Education (New Zealand) is described in which teacher trainees are introduced to schema theory, investigate the schema children have of common social events, and apply action research theory to the area of culture and ethnicity in preparing classroom resources that address identified needs. The paper concludes that it is essential for teacher training to develop the skills to examine and analyze schema (both the teacher's and the child's) in order to achieve a relevant, equitable classroom curriculum.

Information was collected from student teachers (N=13) through both completion of a questionnaire and through analysis of weekly journals using the Pedagogical Language Acquisition and Conceptual Development Taxonomy of Teacher Reflective Thought. It was hypothesized that: (1) preservice teachers would evidence an increase in levels of reflective thinking throughout the field experience, and (2) that preservice teachers placed with university-trained classroom teachers would be more reflective than those placed with other veteran teachers. Data analysis revealed that length of  time in the teacher education program and teacher certification type were significantly related to reflective thinking, and that preservice teachers seeking secondary certification were more reflective than their elementary colleagues. Empirical findings identified curriculum structures that may maximize changes in reflective thinking in preservice teachers and assist teacher educators in implementing the principles of reflective practice.

Subjects completed the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (Verbal Form A) and The Locus of Control Scale for Teachers. Measures of the dependent variable, reflective thinking, were determined through analyses of weekly journals using the Pedagogical Language Acquisition and Conceptual Development Taxonomy of Teacher Reflective Thought. Results indicated that locus of control was a significant predictor of reflective thinking; however, none of the independent variables, either alone or in combination, were consistent predictors of reflective thinking. Comments from participants suggested a much stronger relationship between the variables of  the study. For these preservice teachers, reflective thinking, creative thinking, and locus of control were definitely related and considered qualities of an effective teacher; and from their perspective, creative thinking and locus of control were both significant predictors of reflective thinking. Empirical and qualitative findings identified curriculum structures and personal characteristics that may maximize reflective thinking in preservice teachers. (Contains 25 references.) (LL)",

The pedagogical content knowledge was examined through an analysis of the transformation of knowledge and beliefs about the content and the learner into instructional practices. It is proposed that the transformation takes place through developing explanations, planning lessons, simulating teaching, and reflecting on teaching. The study documented the subject matter knowledge, the pedagogical content knowledge, and the beliefs about learners and mathematics as this potential transformation was taking place. An assessment of 11 prospective secondary mathematics teachers based on 5 tasks was designed to  present a composite view of their pedagogical content knowledge in the area of functions and graphs. The task discussed in this paper was an audiotaped interview of prospective teachers' responses to vignettes of students solving problems in this content area. This task provided the opportunity for the prospective teachers to construct explanations in response to students' misconceptions. This task is considered important because it serves as the link between those tasks which examine baseline data sources and those tasks which examine the transformation process. Vignettes of teaching functions and graphs are included. (Contains 30 references.) (LL)",

Participants spent 3 to 4 weeks in the classrooms of experienced P.D.L. resident teachers while their classes were covered by adjunct teachers. Participants refined and updated their skills in such areas as classroom management, guided reading, whole language, positive disciplining, and teaching writing to limited-English-proficient/bilingual children. After the lab experience, follow-up visits to the participants' classrooms were arranged by the resident teachers. Participants  shared their experiences with their colleagues by inviting them to observe their classes and by sharing information and materials. A total of 60 surveys were mailed, and about 15 teachers (25 percent) responded to the survey. Ninety-three percent of the responding teachers expressed satisfaction with the program. Participants reported making changes in their classroom management and structure, their teaching methodologies, and their attitudes. As a result, teachers noticed improvement in the learning environment and in their students' motivation, interest, and ability to work independently. Four recommendations for program expansion and improvement are offered. (JDD)",

Creativity training lasting 50 minutes a day for 10 days was presented to the  2 treatment groups. The cooperative learning structure used was Student Team Achievement Divisions. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking were administered immediately after the training sessions and again after 60 days.

This paper reports on the &quot;School Safety Leadership Curriculum,&quot; a model for the development of a school violence prevention curriculum to be used at the Graduate School of Education and Psychology, Pepperdine University (California). The model focuses on knowledge and skills needed to foster and maintain a safe, secure, and welcoming school climate. Designed to be presented in an applied, hands-on,  interactive mode, the model contains lesson plans with lecture notes, bibliographies, and supporting instructional materials. The model curriculum is organized into the following instructional modules: (1) peer aggression and self esteem; (2) gangs and youth violence; (3) preparing for the unexpected; (4) balancing student rights and responsibilities; and (5) making every campus safe. After the completion of field testing at Pepperdine and in selected public schools, the curriculum will be available to colleges and universities through the National School Safety Center at Pepperdine University.

The Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (1989) was used as the criterion for teaching practice. The Teaching Policy Assessment, consisting of 10 vignettes illustrating contrasting teaching models, was administered to 140 practicing and preservice teachers to determine how likely they were to teach in ways consistent with the standards. Pedagogical beliefs were measured by Peterson's Belief Scales (1989), and mathematics understanding was measured by Riedesel and Callahan's (1977) elementary mathematics tests for  teachers. Multiple regression analysis revealed that beliefs made a significant contribution to the model, that mathematics understanding made no direct contribution; and that the beliefs-by-mathematics-understanding interaction contributed significantly. Teachers who report teaching in ways that are consistent with the standards believe that children construct knowledge, that problem-solving is a context for learning computation skills rather than a culminating experience, and that children's natural development should determine the sequence of topics in elementary mathematics instruction. The beliefs-by-mathematics-understanding interaction indicates that greater mathematical understanding may enhance the influence of this type of belief. (LL)",

The program is intentionally small, admitting 40-45 students as a cohort group each January with certification awarded the following December. The year-long program, offering an alternative approach to K-8 certification, is designed for mid-life adults who possess bachelor's or master's degrees, have been in the workforce, and  who wish to work with children as classroom teachers. The Antioch program is alternative due to its philosophic orientation which is reflected in three main areas: (1) total program design, (2) roles, and (3) relationships.

Consequently, rural education has become little more than a second thought as teachers' skills are developed. This paper examines the contribution colleges of education can make to school restructuring by including the unique needs of rural education as a legitimate entity in curricula and pedagogical approaches. Pace and Potterfield (1992) have identified characteristics of rural students in the southeastern section of the United States and have found that: rural learners are likely to be global learners, to have a strong preference for cooperating with others, to see learning as a social  experience, to have an aversion to individual recognition, to have difficulty with arbitrarily set time frames, to prefer oral transmission of information in a social setting, to exhibit a tendency toward subjective conclusions, and to have a sense of powerlessness concerning events and the environment. Certain modifications, commensurate with learning styles of rural students, have been made in teacher education coursework offered at the undergraduate, graduate, and inservice levels, that are matched on a one-to-one correspondence with these rural students. It is suggested that these modifications can be made in any undergraduate or graduate course since the emphasis is on classroom climate, social cooperative skills, and teaching strategies. (LL)",

This paper describes a culturally aware teaching model designed to address the problems and needs of rural at-risk students. The major goal of the model is to empower students through acceptance, understanding, respect, and appreciation of both the self and other cultures. The pedagogically nontraditional model, developmental in nature, stresses a common culture curriculum that includes contributions of Black, Native American, Hispanic, Asian, and religious minorities within the student population. The program integrates social studies and language arts to form a core curriculum and draws heavily from literature as a means of teaching much of the content area. Emphasis is placed  not on the textbook, but on creative experiences developed through the unit approach and the use of appropriate literature. To match the unique learning styles and characteristics of rural students, cooperative learning experiences are introduced. This approach enhances the self-worth of rural at-risk students and strengthens the positive correlations between self-concept and school achievement, thus reducing the at-risk factor.

        "description":"There are major differences between rural and urban education, yet most educational reform efforts have been heavily urban oriented. While reform movements of the 1980s may have benefited urban schools, they have only added to the problems of rural education. Some of the conditions often associated with rural schools are: poverty, reform generated problems stemming from the promotion of national standards and assessments, failure to consider basic inequities among schools, an unwillingness on the part of rural students to seek individual recognition or to engage in individual competition, and the diversity of cultures within rural areas. It is suggested that in order to improve rural education the unique needs of rural schools and the characteristics of rural students must be  understood and addressed. Teacher education programs must include rural education as a legitimate entity in curricular studies and pedagogical approaches; educational textbooks need to distinguish between rural and urban education; multicultural education programs should address the diversity found in rural areas; and rural education must be based on academically demanding rural, not urban standards.

To help ease this conversion for some displaced employees, the Department of Defense is sponsoring a program to help former servicepeople earn certification as teachers and teacher aides. The program, called &quot;Troops to Teachers,&quot; provides financial assistance to both former military workers and qualified school districts, enabling defense personnel to obtain licensure and employment. The purpose of this bulletin is to present teacher educators with details of the alternative teacher education program, as well as acquaint them with the particular requirements of Troops to Teachers'  students. The following aspects of the program are outlined: legislative history; structure (stipends and placement grants); and regulations and operating procedures (enrollment and placement). It is noted that participants are required to work in schools receiving federal grants under the Chapter 1 program. To adequately prepare participants for their prospective employment, schools of education may wish to emphasize concepts of best practice and pedagogy in compensatory education. (LL)",

Data were gathered utilizing a pre/post course attitude survey, a pre/post class true/false test, postclass interviews, and interviews conducted with subjects during their respective student teaching experiences. Participants were elementary education majors (N=53) who were enrolled in one or more of three methods classes. Fourteen class members participated in post class interviews and two members were followed from the methods classes into their respective student teaching experiences. Findings indicate that instruction and experiences with cooperative learning in the three methods classes appeared to have had a positive effect on subjects' attitudes and  knowledge related to cooperative learning; they also showed that, consistent with the literature, subjects recognized the pedagogical value of preservice teacher education experiences that enabled them to learn about cooperative learning as a model of instruction and provided them with the opportunity to experience the model. Tables display statistical data. The attitude survey, true false test, and procedures for analyzing qualitative data are appended. (LL)",

A survey, completed by 178 second- and third-year teachers in Missouri, suggests that the role of parents is for the most part congruent with what is being taught in preservice teacher education; that concerns of beginning teachers change by the second year of teaching; that beginning teachers are not intimidated by parents, but rather look forward to the first parent conference; and that a relationship exists between grade levels taught and perceptions of parental involvement. Based upon research findings it is  recommended that a longitudinal study be conducted to measure differences in perceptions between preservice teachers at graduation and novices upon completion of 2 years of teaching.

In addition, a concern with ethics is a new theme reflected throughout the book. The publication is organized into eight chapters, five of which set out the targets themselves. Chapter 1 identifies the major theme of the European health for all policy. Chapter 2 deals with the changing social, political and economic situation in the Region, and discusses the prerequisites for health. Chapters 3-7 set out the 38 targets  addressing in specific terms improvements in health sought over the 20 years between 1980 and the year 2000; health work that is essential to attain lifestyles conducive to health; contributions the environment makes to health; appropriate services for prevention, treatment, and care; and the provision of an infrastructure for sustained political, managerial, and financial support to the strategies set forth. Each target is presented together with problems that need to be dealt with and suggested means of solving those problems. Appendices provide revision of targets for health for all, indicators for monitoring progress towards health for all in the WHO European Region, and a plan of action. (LL)",

Pre- and post-surveys, written journals, pre- and post-video recordings of individual student compositions, and interviews form the basis for the presentation of eight individual case studies. Data analysis indicates that  cooperative learning structures have a definite and useful place in the dance classroom and studio. The majority of subjects showed marked improvement in either performance or compositional skills or both and demonstrated greater confidence, self-assurance, and clarity. Appendices describe preparation for research, survey questions and student responses, pre- and post- video interviews, analysis of pre- and post- movement studies, and a coding sheet for assessment of movement studies.

        "description":"College students' self-reported test anxiety levels in English, mathematics, physical science, and social science were compared to develop empirical support for the claim that students, in general, are more anxious about tests in rigorous academic subjects than in the humanities and to understand the curriculum-related sources of anxiety. It was hypothesized that students' perceptions of a subject's difficulty are correlated positively with their levels of test anxiety in that subject. It was assumed that students would report greater test anxiety when they believed mastery of a subject demanded precise answers on tests rather than a general understanding of the course content. First-year college students (N=196) (131 males and 65 females) were assigned randomly to groups using a  4 x 3 factorial design (4 levels of subject matter by 3 levels of test demand instruction). A revised version of the Worry-Emotionality Scale and a five-item scale describing their opinions and attitudes of the difficulty of the four academic curricular areas were used. Test anxiety scores and perceptions of subject matter difficulty correlated, independently of the particular subject and the test demands. Analyses of covariance indicate that physical science elicited the highest levels of self-reported evaluative anxiety, after controlling for perceptions of difficulty and test demands. Effects for test demand instructions were not significant. Results are discussed concerning the importance of subject matter as an intervening variable in test anxiety research generally and the  significance of the role of test anxiety in impeding science achievement.

It explores a grounded theory approach to the synthesis of data, and examines, in particular, construction of categories. It focuses on ways of organizing data and attaching meaning, as research problems embedded in cultural context are explored. A qualitative research training task, with 4-7 subjects per group (4 or 5 groups per class), evaluating comic strip culture was used. We wanted to know how different ways of categorizing data lead to different interpretations of comic strip culture. In this regard, we were looking at: (1) consistency within groups, and (2) how groups differ. Implications of this study center around the idiosyncratic nature of qualitative research, issues related to  generalizability, and relationships between training and non-training of researchers to the interpretation of data.

A survey instrument mailed to graduates (Ed.S. and Ph.D) from 1973 to the present contained a variety of item formats, and a better than 84 percent return was obtained. Quantitative data were analyzed using primarily frequencies and percentages. Results indicated a change in program emphasis over the past 20 years including increased emphasis on the use of micro- and mainframe computers and an expansion of statistics and measurement offerings. A majority of the respondents secured a position within the first year of  graduation and have remained in that position. Most of the graduates conduct research studies in their position. Graduates viewed the research program favorably, and many suggestions for improvement have already been implemented. The future outlook of the respondents included the continued lack of adequate funding for research and an increased need for Educational Researchers whose efforts can be directed at providing information to a variety of agencies to aid in decision-making, and assist and inform groups engaged in educational reform efforts.

        "description":"In support of the National Education Goals of 1990, the Goals Panel convened a Technical Planning Group to offer background guidance for the National Council on Education and Standards in its task of establishing world-class academic standards for the United States. Recommendations of the Planning Group consider two types of content standards: national subject-specific content standards and state content standards. The Group recommends that certification of content standards be provisional until associated performance standards are developed. Review criteria for content standards include ensuring that they are: (1) of world-class standards; (2) important and focused; (3) useful; (4) reflective of broad consensus building; (5) balanced; (6) accurate and sound; (7) clear and  usable; (8) assessable; (9) adaptable; and (10) developmentally appropriate. State content standards should be as rigorous as national subject-specific standards, feasible, cumulatively adequate for student needs, encouraging of the ability to integrate and apply knowledge, and reflective of broad consensus. While all that is needed to develop high standards is not yet known, high standards themselves are a critical first step. Five appendices contain supplemental information about the Planning Group, background documents about standard setting in other countries, and initial efforts in the United States. (SLD)",

Data are derived from four survey programs of the National Center for Education Statistics, as well as from other government agencies. On the national level, bachelor's degrees in science and mathematics declined by close to 16 percent between 1985-86 and 1989-90, in contrast to an increase of 6 percent in bachelor's degrees overall. Decreases were found for every state. In contrast, master's degrees in science increased in 37 states and doctoral degrees in science increased in 44 states  in the same period. On the national level, master's degrees in science and mathematics rose by 9 percent and doctor's degrees in these field rose by 25 percent. Increases were noted for computer sciences, engineering, and health sciences, but decreases were seen for the agricultural sciences, life sciences, and physical sciences. Nonresident aliens were awarded over 50 of all doctor's degrees in engineering and mathematics in 1989-90, and master's and doctor's degrees in these field increased at a faster rate for nonresident aliens than for U.S. students.

Indicators are grouped into categories of: (1) background; (2) participation; (3) outcomes; and (4) finance. In addition, results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress study of mathematics achievement of eighth graders have been statistically linked to results from a similar international study. The presentation of each indicator includes an explanation of what it means, why it is important, and key results from a comparison of countries and states. Comparisons  are most often made among &quot;like-size&quot; entities. For each indicator, tables are included for states and countries along with a graph that displays this data together. The indicators are policy-relevant and problem-oriented measures of the state of a system. A commitment to reaching world-class education performance is expressed in the National Education Goals of 1990. These indicators provide information necessary to plan for these goals. Eighteen figures and 32 tables present indicators. An appendix provides technical information about the comparison process and includes standard error tables for indicators.

Information, taken from a variety of sources, including the National Assessment of Educational Progress and a General Accounting Office study, indicates that the multiple-choice test remains dominant. The most prevalent purposes of state programs are accountability, instructional improvement, and program evaluation. Virtually all states test in mathematics and language, and most also test in science, writing, and social studies. Thirty-eight programs include writing samples, and 34 states use norm-referenced tests while 34 use criterion-referenced tests. Seventeen use some form of performance assessment,  and six collect student portfolios. At least 36 percent of all students were tested in state programs in 1992-93. Only one state uses a norm-referenced test for high school graduation purposes, while 20 use criterion-referenced tests. In the classroom, in contrast, non-multiple-choice tests appear to be the predominant mode. It is also concluded that patterns of traditional and alternative testing in the classroom are very similar for students of different races, ethnicity, ability groups, and resource adequacy. Fifteen figures and three tables present study information. Document notes refer readers to information sources. Four appendix tables amplify the information. (SLD)",

The aggregated results are encouraging, with apparent gains in some reading tests over the preceding year, and no evidence of decline in the others. Reading-test results indicate that the majority of students in years 5 and 7 are well able to read and comprehend texts considered suitable to their levels. There is evidence that boys marginally outperformed girls in the measurement strand of mathematics. On all reading tests, girls outperformed boys. Results of the mathematics tests indicate that students find these somewhat more difficult than the reading tests, with the average mark  for both years at approximately 55 percent. Test results of urban self-identified Aboriginal students indicate that, on average, their achievement levels are well below those of non-Aboriginal students. Fourteen tables, 11 figures, and 42 graphs illustrate student achievement results.

Data are broken down by: (1) age; (2) sex; (3) race; (4) Hispanic origin; (5) marital status; (6) family status; (7) family income; (8) education of the householder; (9) labor force status; (10) metropolitan residence; (11) region; and (12) mother's labor force status and education. Enrollment characteristics include level and grade of school, public or private status, full- or part-time attendance, and two-year or four-year college. Vocational  school enrollment is shown separately. In October 1991, approximately 63.9 million persons were enrolled in regular school, with about 61.3 million between the ages of 3 and 34. While nursery school and kindergarten enrollments were approximately equal to those of the preceding year, enrollment in elementary school was up approximately 0.6 million persons, and high school enrollment was nearly 0.3 million higher. Neither the dropout rate nor the dropout pool changed significantly. College enrollment rose by approximately 0.5 million.

Other detailed data in similar categories are shown for 1991 in Tables 2 through 16. Tables 17 and 18 contain time series data from 1940 through 1991 from decennial censuses and current population reports. Summary data are also presented for all states and large metropolitan areas, as well as detailed data for the 25  largest states and 15 largest metropolitan areas. Over three-fourths of adults aged 25 and older have completed high school, and over one-fifth have completed four or more years of college. Educational attainment levels for young adults resemble those of the late 1970s. Among persons aged 25 and over, there is no statistical difference in proportions of women and men who complete high school, but a larger proportion of men have completed college. Whites and persons of races other than white or black have the highest level of high school completion for those aged over 25, and persons of races other than white or black have the highest college completion level. Both high school and college completion levels are higher in metropolitan areas. Four text tables, 1 figure, and 18 detailed tables  present the information.

An additional purpose was to determine the role of students' prior beliefs about intelligence on their goals, sense of efficacy, and values. Subjects were 194 sixth graders who completed 2 instruments, the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Survey (Midgley and Maehr, 1990) and a second survey constructed to measure items regarding perceptions of classroom goal orientation. Results suggest that, while perceptions of classroom goal stresses may not have a strong direct effect  on how much students value their subject, there is a strong indirect effect through personal goals and self-efficacy of classroom goal stresses on subject valuing. Causes of the positive relationships between relative ability goals, self-efficacy, and subject valuing are not clear, but it is clear that it is important to differentiate between extrinsic and relative ability goals in future research, because these two goals relate with other motivational constructs in very different ways. Support is also found for the notion that there are domain differences in motivation. Four tables and one figure present study findings. (Contains 32 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The original &quot;Bayley Scales of Infant Development&quot; (BSID) (Bayley 1969) have been among the most popular measures of performance and aptitude of infants. In the present study the reliability and construct validity of mental and motor scores on the revised Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II (BSID-II) were investigated. A national sample of 100 children aged 2 to 42 months was used to provide data that were analyzed with second-order factor analysis. The distribution of first-order trace suggests that probably too few first-order factors have been extracted in previous research with the Bayley measures. The findings suggest that the BSID-II assesses multiple aspects of infant behavior. At the second-order level, the mental and motor scores might still emerge as discrete  constructs. Results, however, are inconsistent, with discernible mental and motor dimensions in some age groups and not others. It seems that more than two second-order factors must be extracted to fully represent BSID-II score variance. Appendix A presents 16 tables of item difficulty and description data. Appendix B presents 48 tables of reliability analyses. The text contains 34 tables of analysis findings. (Contains 25 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"Because of concerns about the validity of tests used in education and employment, a consultation on June 16, 1989, focused on tests of ability, achievement, and other skills. Invited experts were asked to address a set of issues common to both education and employment testing, primarily related to test construction procedures and how to establish validity. This report contains a background paper identifying key issues, a condensation of the transcript of the consultation, papers written by the panelists, and a summary of their positions with analyses of areas of agreement and disagreement. The papers are: (1) \"A Sociological View of Aptitude Tests\" (James W. Loewen); (2) \"Judging Test Use for Fairness\" (Nancy S. Cole); (3) \"Bias in Educational and Employment Testing: Selected  Issues\" (Lloyd Bond); (4) \"Standardized Testing: Harmful to Civil Rights\" (D. Monty Neill); (5) \"A Legal and Policy Perspective\" (Clint Bolick); and (6) \"Tests Are 'Useful Servants,' Not the 'Masters of Reality'\" (Barry L. Goldstein). A major conclusion of this report is that properly designed tests can be used improperly in ways that are unfair and that bias interpretations made of test scores. Standards for test development and use should be set with some form of public involvement. Appendixes provide background on federal guidelines, legislation, and legal issues of test construction. There are three tables and a glossary of testing terms. (Contains 79 references.) (SLD)",

An evaluation helped the staff prepare to meet the needs of the growing student population.  Systematic equity efforts were framed by the revision of the district's Desegregation Plan and the publication of a formal document defining equity efforts. Strategic planning efforts involved parents, staff, students, and the community. As a result of the evaluation study, plans are underway to improve and expand services. Changes will be made in the Voluntary Transfer Program and efforts will be made to enhance the delivery of instruction for limited-English-proficient students.

The problem-solving instruction model was developed based on problem-based learning in medical education, following similar work by H. S. Barrows and R. M. Tamblyn (1980). Following a two-class pilot study, 80 students in the problem-solving curriculum and 83 in the expository treatment group were taught concepts related to productivity. A knowledge-acquisition instrument and a knowledge-structure instrument were administered. Analysis of covariance and independent t-tests were used to analyze data. No meaningful differences were found between the two instructional treatment groups in either  acquisition or knowledge structuring, but limitations in the instruments and attrition in the sample make it impossible to judge the effects of the problem-solving treatment fully. The major significance of the study is the effort to initiate empirical investigation from a cognitive-psychological perspective. Results also suggest that effective acquisition of history and social studies knowledge and the development of higher cognitive skills are compatible and practically feasible.

The second purpose was to examine enrollment decisions at the second benchmark--the decision to re-enroll in the second fall semester after freshman orientation. The study was conducted at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond with 2,262 new and transfer freshman applicants who attended orientation in 1989. The Supplementary Enrollment Information instrument developed locally by the institution was used to collect data. Chi square analysis and t-tests were used to analyze the data. Family encouragement, the need for writing skills, belief in self, the goal to obtain a degree,  amount of commitment, and living arrangements were important variables in deciding to enroll at the first benchmark. The decision to return to college at the second fall semester seems to be influenced by external factors such as minimal or no employment and the work environment, and by the student's level of involvement and success in academic pursuits. The two factors that were important at both benchmarks were the goal to obtain a degree and the firm or extra commitment to that goal. Sixteen tables and two figures present study findings.

The Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) was administered following presentation of the pictures, a series of colored pictures of simple, medium and complex configuration. Responses given to three graduate student judges were classified as specific (related to something in the picture) or general (related to something not seen). Multiple chi square analyses explored relationships of cognitive style, sex, and picture complexity to the number of general and specific responses. Males made significantly fewer general and more specific responses than expected, while females made more general and fewer specific responses than expected. Males and  females did not differ in response to picture complexity, and field-dependent and field-independent subjects did not differ significantly in the number of general and specific responses. There was a significant interaction between sex and picture complexity for field-dependent subjects, with males giving more general and fewer specific responses than expected for complex pictures, and females giving fewer general and more specific responses. No interaction between sex and picture complexity was found for field independent subjects. Results indicate the complex interactions of sex and cognitive style.

        "description":"Three learning modules are described and investigated as they reflect different students' conceptions of and approaches to learning. The Schoolwork Module (SWM) focuses on task performance and involves a passive, incremental, piecemeal, and rote memory method of learning, parallel to what might be implied by the Information Processing model of memory. The Intentional Learning Module (ILM) is based on the tacit conception of learning as constructive internalization of external knowledge. The learner views the body of external information as privileged expert knowledge to be internalized. The Interest Creating Discovery Module (ICDM) is based on the conception of learning as the reorganization of one's own internal knowledge. An inventory was designed to measure the conceptions of  learning corresponding to these modules, and it was administered to 194 undergraduate students. Factor analysis was used. It is apparent that all three approaches are used by college students. Only 8 of the 84 items show significant use of SWM, while 7 show use of ILM, and 15 show significant use of ICDM. ICDM may reflect an incorporation of learning conceptions from SWM and ILM, or ICDM users have reinterpreted the questions within their own approach. Two tables present study data.

        "description":"The construct validity of the Attitudes of Professional Autonomy (APA) as a proxy measure of professional orientation was studied. The sample consisted of all teachers in 94 schools in 6 districts in Louisiana, closely representing the statewide distribution of all schools by level and socioeconomic status. Usable data were received from 1,921 teachers (APA responses and a demographic questionnaire). A series of factor analyses was completed, and Cronbach Alpha reliability procedures were used to examine the internal consistency reliability of the factor-analyzed, reconstructed versions of the APA. Findings suggest that the construct of professional attitudinal autonomy, as measured by the APA, is a two-dimensional construct. The realignment of items based on these factor  analyses is a better operational definition and a more valid measure of the professional attitudinal autonomy construct than prior item alignments. The reconstructed APA subscales appear to be relatively independent measures, and both the Interpersonal Autonomy and Organizational Autonomy subscales are measures of the more global construct of professional attitudinal autonomy. Findings suggest the need to re-examine and redefine the concept of professional orientation to include current conceptions of professionalism in school organizational contexts.

        "description":"To determine if differing ability levels will affect the acquisition of problem-solving skills and self-esteem as a result of participation in two approaches to teaching problem-solving skills, a study was conducted with sixth graders in a posttest-only control group experimental design. Subjects were 102 sixth graders randomly assigned to 5 classes. Two classes participated in the Creative Problem Solving (CPS) for Kids approach to teaching problem solving. Two classes received computer-assisted instruction in problem-solving designed by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium, and one class was a control group. Both approaches consisted of five 3-minute lessons per week for 6 weeks. Results suggest that thinking-skills instruction does impact the development of creative  and critical thinking and that the acquisition of these skills has a positive effect on self-esteem. The study also provides evidence that the length of training is an important consideration in providing thinking-skills instruction, and that such instruction should be an integral part of the curriculum rather than a supplementary or isolated program. In addition, thinking-skills instruction is appropriate for students at all ability levels. Seven figures and 12 tables present study findings. (Contains 17 references.) (SLD)",

ESTEEM was developed under the aegis of the Center for Research on Educational Accountability and Teacher Evaluation (CREATE) with major goals of defining expert science teaching, developing instruments to assess it, and developing an expert teaching model. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses have been done to develop and validate the first instruments and have involved nearly 200 fourth- through eighth-grade teachers. The studies have indicated that expert teachers are defined by the evaluation criteria and that there is only about a 50% agreement in the top quartile of teachers sorted by two  developed measures, the Classroom Observation Rubric and the Student Outcome Assessment Rubric, suggesting caution in considering what expert means. The theoretical base derives from the constructivist movement, Scriven's Duty Based Evaluation, and the novice through expert literature. Research so far suggests that most science teaching is done from a teacher-centered approach, disseminating content at the lower end of the higher order thinking skills continuum. Two figures and 14 tables present some research findings. (Contains 73 references.) (SLD)",

Portfolios are useful as a support to new instructional approaches that emphasize the student's role in constructing understanding and the teacher's role in promoting understanding. Although there is no single way to develop portfolio programs, in all such programs students are expected to collect, select, and reflect on their work. Research supports the finding that student awareness of work and of evaluation strategies is enhanced through portfolios. The use of portfolios is not  without drawbacks, primarily in the time and effort required, but these are generally seen to be worthwhile burdens. A brief summary of research into portfolios highlights some current projects that investigate their use. Sources of information about portfolios are listed. (SLD)",

Federal support for education, excluding revenues foregone through allowable income tax deductions, was an estimated $87.5 billion in fiscal year (FY) 1993, an increase of $24.1 billion (38%) since FY 1990, representing, after adjustment for inflation, a 25% increase. This publication provides data on federal support and trends in recent years. On-budget federal funds for educational programs in FY 1993 were estimated at $68.4 billion, an increase of 33% since FY 1990 in current dollars (20% after adjustment for inflation). Nonfederal funds generated by federal programs (predominantly postsecondary education loans) were estimated at $19.0 billion, a rise of 62%  in current dollars from 1990 to 1993. The period marked an increase in on-budget program funds for elementary and secondary education of 12%, with a decrease of 13% in funds for postsecondary education, and a 58% increase in other education funds. It is noted that elementary and secondary schools and colleges derive only about 11% of their revenues from the Federal Government.

The program has its roots in two efforts by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians to improve their schools, an English-as-a-Second-Language education effort, and a curriculum implementation program. The Mississippi Band preserves many traditional customs and is aware of the need to retain their own heritage while preparing children for the demands of the future. The Special Alternative Instruction Program continued the prior curriculum reform efforts and promoted cultural awareness among teachers. The evaluation of this program was conducted in six elementary and one middle and secondary school in the reservation area. Program curriculum specialists in the schools stressed  the whole language approach, promoted bilingual education, and implemented the new curriculum. Interviews with at least four teachers and three Choctaw aides from five schools indicate the effectiveness of the program specialists and program management. Achievement gains in language arts demonstrate program effectiveness. Recommendations for program continuation include a renewed emphasis on curriculum implementation and additional help for teachers bridging language and cultural differences. Seven tables present findings about student achievement. A list of recommendations includes continuing curriculum development, developing curriculum training for teachers and aides, and providing Choctaw language instruction for teachers.

Phase 1 of the study examined the literature on PBCA, PBCA use in other states, and PCBA use in Utah. Recommendations from phase 1 supported development of PBCA on a state-wide basis. In phase 2, a catalog of PBCA resources and learning opportunities was compiled to help students become aware of possibilities. A major component of phase 2 was the surveying of 1,296 students, approximately 400 parents, and 114  educators in a small rural district and a large suburban district. Findings demonstrate that students, parents, and educators are aware of and support learning outside the classroom. They are also in favor of granting credit for such learning. From 46 to 64 percent of students expressed an interest in PBCA. Recommendations are made for the Phase 3 development of PBCA assessment. Four exhibits present study findings.

This report details the second and final year's efforts in three high schools. An evaluation team from the Technological Innovations in Educational Research Laboratory has studied Project Homeroom since 1991, using direct classroom observation, written surveys, personal and group interviews, and the examination of records to develop an understanding of the project. Several key issues were identified, the first being that innovation of this sort takes time to accomplish, time for teachers to learn about technology, and time for teachers and students to  accept change. It is apparent that Project Homeroom improved student and parent access to teachers, and that interdisciplinary instruction and cooperative learning are an important part of Project Homeroom's success. Three dominant uses of the technology were recognized: (1) word processing; (2) telecommunications for electronic mail communication and information retrieval; and (3) the preparation and presentation of nontext materials. It also appears that teachers involved in the project interacted with each other more than they had before. Project Homeroom is recognized as a successful combination of technology and people. Twenty-four graphs and five tables present evaluation findings. Four appendices contain the parent surveys. (SLD)",

This presentation combines several viewpoints regarding the most important component, or combination of components, needed for the most successful problem solving behaviors to occur. Quantitative literature is reviewed in the area of problem solving with emphasis in both: (1) the interacting influence of strategies and knowledge, and (2) the influence of strategies independent of knowledge. Findings suggest that knowledge permits an individual to engage in higher levels of reflective thinking or metacognitive strategies. With knowledge, the problems can be represented more completely. A more complete representation allows for more  efficient and effective reflective monitoring of the problem solving process. It appears that the reflective thinking processes, which encourage elaboration on a problem, are instrumental in producing the most efficient problem solving behaviors. Findings suggest that these metacognitive strategies need to be specifically taught to students. Also of interest, is the finding which suggests that use of examples of problem solutions facilitates transfer to analogical problems. (Contains 17 references.) (Author)",

The hypothesis was that scores on the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) following the internship would be more field-independent, and the intent was to document the influence of university coursework and internship experience on cognitive style. The 131 female and 13 male students were tested in their freshman years and after their internships. Initial and post-field-dependent and field-independent scores, course grades from six courses, and gender were determined for all subjects. Results indicate that subjects who were field-dependent, as identified through scores on the GEFT during their first education course, tend  to become more field-independent by the end of their internship experiences. Initial scores appear to be good predictors of posttest scores. Males tend to be more field-independent than females, although females perform better academically across curricula. Grades in all courses indicate that students scoring in the middle category on the GEFT are more likely to make &quot;C&quot; and above than students falling in the high and low GEFT categories.

        "author":["Westers, Paul"],
        "description":"The subject of this dissertation is the examination of differential item functioning (DIF) through the use of loglinear Rasch models with latent classes. DIF refers to the probability that a correct response among equally able test takers is different for various racial, ethnic, and gender groups. Because usual methods of detecting DIF give little information about the reason an item is biased, use of the solution-error response-error (SERE) model of H. Kelderman is proposed. It is demonstrated that the SERE model can show whether DIF is caused by the difficulty of the item, the attractiveness of its alternatives, or both. The large amount of computer memory space required makes this method impractical for a large number of items. A new method is proposed based on the division of  the whole item set into several subsets, which is made possible by the collapsibility of the SERE model. With the use of subsets of items, the parameters of the entire SERE model can be obtained only by simultaneous estimation of the parameters of the collapsed SERE models through use of pseudo-likelihood theory. A simulation study demonstrates that a distinction can be made between the two types of DIF using the new approach. A generalization of the SERE model applicable to polytomously scored latent states, that may be explained with a multidimensional latent space, is discussed. Five appendices illustrate applications of these models with reference to existing tests and the collapsed SERE model. (Contains 167 references.) (SLD)",

This is the second year that the program has been implemented in the six elementary schools and one middle school of the Mississippi Choctaw reservation. In 1990-91, the project was designed to serve an estimated 610 students, although 710 were actually enrolled. The program included five components: (1) tutoring on homework; (2) drug education; (3) recreation; (4) snacks; and (5) cultural activities. The external evaluation included a review of activities, verification of data collection for internal evaluation, a review of the preceding evaluation, a summary of evaluator field  visits, including interviews with teachers, principals, and parents in participating schools, and a report of observed strengths and weaknesses. In five of the seven schools, the program is being implemented with great fidelity to the model described in the funding proposal. Overall, the program is very effective. Although community substance abuse has not lessened, very few cases are found among the children. Parent and student attitudes toward the program are favorable. It is also apparent that a strong principal is the key to effective program functioning. (SLD)",

        "description":"Several recent investigations have suggested that students need help with their notes, as even successful students may fail to record many ideas communicated by the lecturer. Results also suggest that there is value in having students participate in the notetaking process in that they are more likely to remember what they have noted, even if full notes are provided by the instructor. Several studies have indicated that students are able to achieve more on tests when they are provided with partial notes to review. Several formats have been examined for partial notes, and it appears that skeletal notes, with the main ideas supplied and space left for students to fill in the gaps, are the most effective. Ideally, the instructor is advised to provide both skeletal notes before the  lecture and detailed notes afterward to afford maximum benefits to the students. The disadvantages of detailed notes, particularly in terms of instructor time, mean that few will choose this option. It can also be argued that students should improve the quality of their own notes to enhance the learning process. Providing skeletal notes in increasing quantity as a function of the lecturer's increasing information density is a suggested compromise. (Contains 7 references.) (SLD)",

Multi-age, multi-ability grouping, as experienced by these primary students, is a feature of changes under the Kentucky Educational Reform Act. These students were in a transitional phase, being involved in such groups for part of each day. Questionnaires requiring Likert-type responses were administered to these students. Responses suggest that students are accepting changes and seem to be adapting to teaching using the thematic approach, which emphasizes cooperative learning. Students in grade 4 preferred working by themselves  more than the primary-grades group, though both groups accepted cooperative learning.

A second category of information relates to students' attitudes, noncognitive characteristics, and evaluations of their school experiences. Also included are two types of information on educational attainment that are reported in  the national context compared with census figures and in connection with course-selection patterns of high school seniors. Utah students are showing improvement in a number of academic areas, and such improvement presumably reflects the impact of the educational reforms implemented to date.

This summary of the nature, design, and use of performance assessments is based on the review and survey. Performance assessment is a response to the calls for educational change that are sweeping the country, and it reflects society's need to produce creative problem solvers, critical thinkers, and information processors. The literature review and the survey make it clear that performance assessments  are being developed by states and districts across the country. In general, states are taking their time in developing and testing the new assessments because they are mindful of the problems involved in performance assessment and are attaching high stakes to its results.

It is used to gather students' reactions to instructors, personal progress, and courses, as well as students' attitudes, and to obtain an overall rating. Subjects for the factor analysis were 141 upperclass students (56.7 percent male). The factor analysis reveals constructs about which students in science and mathematics have expressed concern.  Of seven identified factors, the first three, interpreted as instructor presentation skills, student perception of personal progress, and student-teacher interaction, are particularly important in distinguishing instructor presentation from the personal aspects of course takers.

Responses of 122 architects to 22 architecture test items developed to assess a range of architectural knowledge were analyzed using Rule Space. Verbal protocol analysis guided the construction of a model of examinee performance, consisting of processes for constructing an initial representation of an item (labeled &quot;understand&quot;), forming goals and performing actions based on those goals (&quot;solve&quot;), and determining whether goals have been attempted and satisfied (&quot;check&quot;). Item attributes derived from these processes formed the basis for diagnosis. Successful diagnostic classifications were obtained for approximately 65 percent, 90  percent, and 40 percent of examinees based, respectively, on attributes associated with the &quot;understand,&quot;&quot;solve,&quot; and &quot;check&quot; processes of the problem-solving model. The findings support the effectiveness of Rule Space in a complex domain and suggest directions for developing new architecture items by using attributes particularly effective at distinguishing among examinees of different ability levels.

        "description":"This paper introduces a modification to the Rule Space diagnostic classification procedure to allow for processing of response vectors that contain missing data. Rule Space is an approach to diagnostic classification that involves characterizing examinees' performances in terms of an underlying cognitive model of generalized problem-solving skills. It has two components: (1) a procedure for determining a comprehensive set of knowledge states, where each state is characterized in terms of a unique subset of mastered skills; and (2) a procedure for classifying examinees into one or another of the specified states. Missing data are expected to be a common problem for this approach because, although the procedure for determining the comprehensive set of knowledge states requires a  large pool of items, the procedure for examinee classification can be performed with smaller (less expensive) item subsets. This approach to diagnostic classification is illustrated with data collection in the Survey of Young Adult Literacy, a nationwide survey of literacy skills conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The study has four figures and seven tables. An appendix contains a proof of an aspect of the model. (Contains 18 references.) (Author/SLD)",

This Digest explains the concept of statistical significance testing and discusses the meaning of probabilities, the concept of statistical significance, arguments against significance testing, misinterpretation, and alternatives. Statistical significance testing requires subjective judgment in setting a predetermined acceptable probability of making an inferential error caused by the sampling error. Sampling error can only be eliminated by gathering data from the entire population. Statistical significance addresses the question of whether, assuming the sample data came from a population in which the null hypothesis is (exactly) true, the  calculated probability of the sample results is less than the acceptable limit imposed regarding a Type I error. Reasons not to use statistical significance testing and questions of misinterpretation are reviewed. Two analyses that should be emphasized over statistical significance testing are effect sizes and the empirical replicability of results. (Contains 6 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"In light of the many changes of the past 20 years, it may be expected that plans of high school seniors for further education may have also changed, along with the kinds of jobs they expect to have and the things they regard as important. These questions are examined through data from the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS) and the National Education Longitudinal Study in 1988 (NELS:88), the 1992 Second Follow-up. The proportion of seniors in academic or college preparatory programs was approximately the same in both years, although enrollment in the general track increased and enrollment in vocational education decreased. In 1992, there was little difference between the sexes in high school program placement. In 1992, only 5.3 of students reported that they would not  attend some kind of school after high school, but in 1972, 18.9% had reported that they would not continue. Eighty-four percent in 1992 planned to go to college, compared with the 63% who planned to attend in 1972. Differences for females were dramatic, with female seniors in 1992 four times more likely to plan on graduate or professional school as in 1972. Nearly 60% in 1992 planned a professional career, compared with approximately 45% in 1972. Changes in values were most marked among women, who in 1992 espoused values closer to those traditionally held by men. One figure and three tables present data about the two populations. (SLD)",

Between 1976 and 1991, blacks were more likely to be threatened, and more likely to be injured, with a weapon in school than whites, with approximately 1 in 10 black high school seniors reporting being injured with a weapon in school. The most frequent type of victimization in high school was having had something stolen (approximately 4 in 10 overall). Nearly one in four reported that their property had been deliberately damaged or that they had been threatened without a weapon.

Taking longer may have a variety of causes and a number of implications, including costs for the individual and the institution. Approximately 31% of college graduates in 1990 completed their baccalaureate degree within 4 years of graduating from high school, while 43% completed it within 4 years of entering college. This percentage was larger for females than males, for students at private colleges than for those at public colleges, and for White students than for Blacks, Hispanic Americans, or American Indians. Between 1977 and 1990, the percentage completing college within 4 years of graduating from high school declined  and the percentage taking more than 6 years to graduate increased.

For an early school-leaver, an estimate of the value of completing high school is the difference between outcomes of those who have either passed the General Education Development (GED) examination or gone back to school and those who have not completed high school. By 1990, young adults with a GED were more likely to have attended either a third or fourth year of high school than other dropouts. For both males and females, those who did not attain a high school  diploma before age 20 did not do as well as a group in the labor market as those who did. Females who took advantage of a second chance to complete high school usually had higher annual earnings than those who did not, and those who received a diploma or GED before age 20 were more likely to be employed.

The basic idea about learning is that the outcomes of learning (e.g., propositional knowledge, procedural skills, and mental models) reflect differences in learning processes (e.g., encoding skills, attention allocation, and hypothesis generation). Additionally, learning outcomes reflect differences in conative processes, knowledge structures, and metacognitive skills, mediated by the learning processes. Against the background of a brief historical introduction, this article presents a research-based overview of the major categories of educationally relevant learning outcomes and of the underlying acquisition processes. In this perspective, different learning environments are  discussed such as learning by direct instruction, drill and practice, and discovery. Finally, implications for the design of computerized instructional environments are indicated. (Contains 9 figures and 83 references.) (Author)",

Case studies of the Science and Engineering Research Semester and the Laboratory Graduate Research Participation programs at the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education illustrate how one can make use of existing comparison groups when the establishment of control groups for each cohort in an educational study is not economically feasible. Data from national surveys are used for comparative purposes. These surveys include: (1) the Survey of Earned Doctorates of the National Science Foundation  (NSF); (2) the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, another NSF survey; (3) the NSF New Entrants Survey; (4) the Survey of Experienced Scientists and Engineers, also an NSF component survey; and (5) the National Survey of College Graduates. Items from these surveys that are clearly relevant are selected for comparisons. In conclusion it is remarked that this approach is not a panacea, and requires thorough understanding and careful evaluation of the national survey, but it can be a useful and cost-effective alternative to traditional control-group designs. Ten figures illustrate survey use. (Contains nine references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"At least four values, or families of values, should be taught in schools and families to respond to the increasingly multiracial and multicultural society of the United States. These are: (1) antiracism or opposition to racism; (2) multiculturalism; (3) a sense of community; and (4) treating persons as individuals. The first three categories are discussed in relation to education, focusing on education at the precollege level. Three components of antiracism include a belief in the equal worth of all persons regardless of race; an understanding of racism; and opposition, including intervention, to racism in others. Multiculturalism encompasses the subvalues of affirming one's own cultural identity, respecting and desiring to learn about and from other cultures, and valuing and  delighting in cultural diversity itself. A sense of community suggests a sense that embraces racial and cultural differences, that involves a bond with others and a shared identity with the community. These values, or sets of values, are distinct from one another, and all are essential to a responsible program of value education in a multicultural society. (SLD)",

The conditions examined include the centrality of first language maintenance and the reconstituting of curriculum, pedagogy, evaluation, and organization at the school level. In addition, the paper discusses the controversy of multiculturalism versus antiracist education and assimilation. The multicultural educational program initiated at the Richmond Road School in Auckland, New Zealand is offered as an example of what can be achieved when multicultural education is combined with a critically conceived approach to whole-school reform. Reasons for its success are examined, focusing on the facts that: (1)  the various school structures necessary to establishing an effective approach to multicultural education have been developed over many years; (2) the change process has involved staff cooperatively and collaboratively; (3) a high degree of theoretical literacy in multiculturalism was developed among teachers; and (4) a conversancy with theory resulted in an approach to multicultural education that was considered workable for staff and served the interests of all concerned. It is concluded that the structural changes implemented at Richmond Road demonstrate that multicultural education can be effectively reconceived in order to make a difference for minority children.

The analyses find that, compared to control students, first-graders in schoolwide projects showed no achievement effects, second-graders showed positive significant effects, third-graders showed negative effects, and fourth- and fifth-graders showed positive but nonsignificant effects. Strong gender, age, and race effects occur throughout the grades; by fifth grade, however, the race effects are no longer significant. Analyses were also conducted of the effects on student reading achievement of various components implemented in schoolwide project sites. The components were examined in three categories: (1)  minimal requirements within the central/district framework, such as funding school-community coordinators and program support teachers; (2) how schools allocated their resources within schoolwide projects, such as for tutors, full-day kindergarten, or classroom assistants; and (3) other existing Chapter 1 funded programs still operating within the schoolwide project framework.

        "description":"To explore the complexities of communication with Asian and Pacific Islander (API) children and their families, this digest describes the overt and covert dimensions of the various API cultures, and discusses API's socioeconomic background and the life experiences that affect their communication behavior. The general ethnic groups in the API community are Pacific Islanders (mainly Hawaiians, Samoans, and Guamanians), Southeast Asians (mostly Indochinese from Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, and including Burmese and Filipinos), and East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans). It is important not to generalize an understanding of one group to another, and educators must identify differences in order to devise appropriate communication strategies. Overt culture includes  belief systems and language, aspects of a culture that can be easily identified and studied. Covert culture is more subtle, and encompasses such aspects as the conception of time and communication. Suggestions are given for practitioners to enhance communication through the following: (1) personal reflection; (2) partnerships with community organizations; (3) information gathering; (4) parent involvement; (5) overcoming stereotypes of APIs; and (6) accurate evaluation of individual children.

        "description":"The Children's Art Carnival (CAC) is an intensive holistic reading and reading-oriented arts program for Chapter 1-eligible students who have scored below the cut-off point on a standardized reading test or have performed poorly in the classroom. This report presents the findings of evaluations of the 1990-91 and 1991-92 programs by the Office of Research, Evaluation, and Assessment. The evaluation study identified a number of factors that are crucial to program success and that were evident in the 2 program years studied. It was discovered that themes continued to be an effective way of coordinating the efforts of classroom teachers and CAC staff, particularly at sites which had been participating in the program for a period of time. In addition, use of multisensory approaches  means that children who are not successful in one modality have the chance for success in another, and that mastering simple, concrete skills motivates and enables lower-achieving students to generalize from these experiences. A need was expressed by all CAC and school staff members for additional training in coordination and reinforcement of theme-based curriculum. Holistically scored writing samples indicated that the students as a whole had made gains in this area, and a substantial number of students also increased their reading scores. Appendices provide various study documents and assessment instruments. (GLR)",

This document presents a 1992-93 evaluation of the SSPP concerning the program's implementation and the perceptions of its success on the part of students and project coordinators. Each school provided a project coordinator who had experience in promoting student involvement in community service. The project provided a course for students to learn what foundations are and how they operate and to develop requisite skills. Students also oversaw the projects funded by a minifoundation and directly participated in at least one such project. Benefits of the project, according to the students, included  learning to make decisions, developing self-esteem, developing confidence about speaking in front of an audience, assuming greater responsibility, setting higher standards, and working with other people in the pursuit of common goals. Project coordinators praised the project for empowering students to make decisions about meaningful issues and helping them develop many important skills. They believed that it combined learning with practical experience in a way that gave students confidence in their ability to have an impact on the world in which they live.

        "description":"This paper reports on a longitudinal study of four urban schools that sought to develop professional community as part of a restructuring process. The study focuses on how restructuring affected teachers' work over a 3-year period. It reports that the absence of structural conditions can impede the growth of professional community; however, their presence cannot ensure such growth. In addition, the creation of professional community is not an automatic consequence of teacher empowerment or school autonomy. Data support the notion that the most central social and human resources supporting the growth of school communities are: (1) teacher expertise related to cognitive and skill outcomes for classroom practice; and (2) leadership supportive of teacher efforts, including their  cognitive and skill acquisition. Such supportive leadership contributes to the development of a base of trust and respect, the creation of an environment open to improvement, and the creation of a sense of efficacy emanating from successful efforts of the staff toward improvement and increased student learning.

The project involves the implementation of nine strategies described in the research literature as being effective in drug/gang prevention. These strategies include drug/gang policy awareness, drug and gang prevention education, racial/cultural sensitivity development, after school alternative programs, tutoring, mentoring, community service opportunities, career awareness, early intervention counseling, and parent education. Results and recommendations are provided based on findings from approximately 3,277 students, 33 parents, and 50 teachers who participated in the various  programs offered. Overall, the participating school staff are satisfied with the project, and there is some evidence that the project is making a difference in the target students' behavior. However, the report notes that delays in both funding and budgetary approvals for subcontracts have contributed to delays and postponements of service provision to all of the schools.

Several states ban Channel One because of concerns about providing advertisers such direct access to students within the walls of tax-supported public school buildings. This paper examines what kinds of schools and what sorts of communities choose to receive Channel One, and where Channel One fits in the pool of educational resources. The study used the data archives of Market Data Retrieval, which involves 17,344 public schools and covers grades 7 through 12, revealing some of the following items: (1) Channel One is most often found in low income area schools, where it is often used instead of traditional educational materials when  resources are scarcest; (2) schools that can afford to spend more on their students are much less likely to utilize Channel One; (3) Channel One is more often shown to the students who are least able to afford to buy all the products advertised, thus increasing a sense of alienation and frustration; and (4) increasing commercialization of the culture and the schools suggests a shutting out of other voices and interests of the educational system. The study suggests that the use of Channel One in low-income, socioeconomically deprived schools presents an illusion of providing more and better educational facilities which only contributes to widening the societal gap.

        "description":"This study shows where school segregation is concentrated and where schools remain highly integrated. It offers the first national comparison of segregation by community size and reveals that segregation remains high in big cities and serious in mid-size central cities. Many African-American and Latino students also attend segregated schools in the suburbs of the largest metropolitan areas, while rural areas and small towns, small metropolitan areas, and the suburbs of the mid-size metro areas are far more integrated. States with more fragmented district structures tend to have higher levels of segregation, particularly in states having relatively small proportions of minority students who are concentrated in a few districts. Based on these and other study findings, the country  and its schools are perceived as going through vast changes without any strategy. It appears that the civil rights impulse from the 1960s is dead and racial segregation is reemerging. This report recommends policies to school districts, state government, and federal civil rights and education officials to foster integrated education and to make interracial schools function more effectively. It calls for: (1) resumption of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department; (2) restoration of federal aid for successful integration strategies; (3) basic research on the consequences of segregation by race, ethnicity and poverty; and (4) an examination of the ways in which multiracial education functions most effectively.

The programs provide students with academic, financial, and personal support. Several specific programs are highlighted. In kindergarten through third grade, the Support for Early Educational Development (SEED) Program, created in 1987, is designed to foster excitement about learning and the value of education. During the middle school years, the Hancock  Endowment for Academics, Recreation, and Teaching (HEART) program provides grants for academics and innovative projects which enhance the academic curriculum, provide student leadership opportunities, and encourage staff development and parent involvement. Project Action enables high school students to become grantmakers in their own communities. Finally, the Access Program helps high school seniors find the money to pay for college as well as last minute scholarship financing that attempts to make up the difference between the actual cost of college and what a student has been able to raise from other sources of financial aid.

This paper addresses the provision of effective services relating to at-risk youth and the prevention of early school dropouts. The paper's first section covers the circumstances and conditions associated with early school dropouts including those conditions found in the academic, school/social, home/school, and personal/social atmospheres. The second section examines a number of personal, social, and academic factors that lead to educational disadvantages as well as school-related practices that researchers have identified as having a high correlation with students who fail to complete their schooling with an adequate level of skills. The third  section examines the issue of early school dropouts and reviews the key criteria related to assessing the extent of the problem, the characteristics of early school dropouts, and the factors contributing to their decision to leave school. The paper's fourth section outlines a range of possibilities for meeting the needs and addressing the problems of at risk youth. (Contains 79 references.) (GLR)",

Additionally, it explores reauthorization issues confronting the Emergency Immigrant Education Act for fiscal year 1994. The report shows that: (1) there has been a steady decrease in funding for immigrant education over the past 6 years; (2) the number of children served by the program in the 1989-90 school year was 464,938, with approximately three-fourths of these children living in the States of California, New York, Texas, Illinois, and Florida; (3) the number of immigrant children entering the United States is increasing; (4) local school districts are using immigrant education funds for supplementary educational  services; and (5) states are granted funds based on their count of eligible immigrant children, which is calculated from schools having at least either 500 students or 3 percent of total public and nonpublic school enrollment. Issues concerning reauthorization involve reducing the duplication of services, simplifying the funding formula through amendments, and improving the targeting of funds. (GLR)",

        "description":"This paper presents a four-fold typology developed as a general theory of student motivation to stay in school and work hard at learning tasks. Each of the four-fold categories is described with an initial statement of the specific source of student motivation, an analysis of how the source fits in more general motivational theories, and how the experiences of poor and minority students make them especially at risk for lacking motivation. The four-fold categories that are discussed involve the opportunities that exist for success in schoolwork, the human climate of caring and support, the relevance of school to a student's community and future, and the help that is given in attaining freedom from personal problems. Analysis of a sample of dropout students is presented that shows  activities designed to prevent them from dropping out are not up to the task. This is because the tasks are not basic or intense enough to reform the primary causes identified by educational theories of low student motivation to remain in high school. Reforms are needed to change the atmosphere from the current emphasis on controlling and sorting students to a new emphasis on supporting and caring for individual learners through major modifications in the roles and responsibilities of teachers and students, including services geared toward assisting students with outside problems.

        "description":"This paper addresses the notion that persons at risk of failure to achieve an adequate education are in that position partly because of their social circumstances, i.e., their ethnicity, culture, language, or economic status. It discusses the impact of culture on what one does and how one does it, addresses the manner in which culture frames as well as enables one's feelings and thoughts concerning what one does, and examines the question of what mechanism of culture serves as the vehicle and context for human activity. Based on this analysis of cultural influences and their relationships regarding academic achievement, several implications for educational reform are examined covering: (1) the limitations of reform in school governance alone; (2) the limitations of the  manipulation of standards and accountability based on educational achievement tests data; (3) the applicability of principles of social justice, i.e., the distribution of equity; (4) the pedagogical principles of adaptability and complementarity; and (5) concern for diversity, pluralism, context, and perspective.

        "description":"Demographic changes are causing leaders in education, business and civic affairs to address new questions about racial and ethnic diversity. What opportunities does diversity provide? What difficulties does it create? What changes are needed in the ways that people look at problems, define solutions and do the everyday business of their lives? The experiences of parents, educators and community people in a school-community partnership in Saint Paul, Minnesota offer valuable insights for people who are trying to answer these questions. The partnership was part of Supporting Diversity in Schools (SDS), a program that works in three arenas: system change in elementary and secondary education, diversity and racial equity, and organizational collaboration. The aim of SDS is to bring  together schools and community organizations to work on issues of racial equity in order to increase the school success of children of color. Sahaka Siksa Kaun Khmer (Cambodian Children's Education Partnership) was created in September 1989 as one of the first SDS partnerships. Sahaka (as it was called for short) was regarded as one of the most promising of SDS's five partnerships. Trust among participants appeared to be high, and creative planning had yielded a schedule of activities that held significant promise for reaching the goals of SDS. But, by June 1992, the participants in Sahaka had dissolved the partnership. While most admit to having feelings of goodwill, positive memories and excitement about personal growth, much can be learned from the events that led to the  disappointment, anger and resentment that dominated people's interaction during the last months of the partnerships. The report describes lessons learned about the interaction of human relationships and organizational structures toward accomplishing tasks, about the importance of learning from mistakes, and about the confusion that results when people bring conflicting world-views to a task. The report contains three major sections. The first chronicles the events in the partnership since 1989, the second reflects on the issues that those events raised, and the third looks at the impact of the Sahaka experience. Except for the SDS program and the Sahaka partnership, all individual and organizational names within the report are pseudonyms. (GLR)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the problems faced by Minnesota's Supporting Diversity in Schools organization in communicating their goal of making schools responsive to students of differing ethnic backgrounds. It was found that using terms such as &quot;multicultural curriculum&quot; and &quot;isolation of schools and communities of color from one another,&quot; brought out different meanings. While some saw it as equal education with less ethnic bias, others saw it as the creation of special units of study, displays of artifacts, multicultural fairs, and shaded faces in textbooks. Also, people's points of view regarding how they see reality created problems in the sense that, while people of color saw a need for greater multicultural efforts in the schools, whites mostly did not. This disagreement caused a  continual barrier to communication and sound problem solving. The dominance of whites in the community power structure limited decision making on issues relevant to racial equity and fostered continued isolation of white people from the issues and realities shared by people of color. To solve the communication dilemma, words that describe were substituted for words that label. Gaps in reality perceptions were narrowed through use of cultural artistic events and the use of incentives to encourage attendance. Finally, competent and informed people of color were used to head meetings and to act as liaisons in district staff discussions which helped to enrich the content and perspectives of these gatherings as well as to lessen the dominating influence of the white majority.

        "description":"This report reviews research that demonstrates how gender inequity is not only learned and accepted in the socialization process that starts at home, but is also present in the school environment from the very early years, consciously or unconsciously, reinforcing sex stereotypes. Findings are examined in three areas: (1) interactions in the classroom that are both teacher-to-student and student-to-student; (2) instruction-related features involving relations between classroom activities and the gender of the students assigned to perform those activities; and (3) the perceptions of gender roles through teachers' modeling of sex stereotypes in the classroom and through teachers' and adults' perceptions of children's gender. Analyzing the findings of the use that students make of  stereotyped gender cues reveals how students distinguish themselves from the other gender, how they see the role of the opposite gender, and how the students' overall perceptions of sex roles affect social interactions and individual performance. The review also reveals that fundamental elements of the school environment still develop and reinforce inequity: teachers are unaware of their gender bias; there is a lack of school textbooks and other instructional materials that are sex-bias free; and children interact according to strongly stereotyped gender schemes. The report concludes by stating that nonsexist curricula have been shown to make a difference in children's gender equity values. (Contains 57 references.) (GLR)",

Information is presented based on interviews with 222 adults and 38 children. Findings include data showing that most (69 percent of this group) of the immigrants came to the United States to find work to support their families, most of which had one or more children. The study also reveals that immigrants pay more taxes than most Minnesotans, yet most of the jobs were low-paying service sector jobs; immigrants worry about being picked up by the immigration police and being deported; and immigrants  have mental stresses stemming from loneliness and separation in addition to marital tension. To avoid detection, immigrant families seek a self-imposed anonymity that ultimately denies them the services available to others in the community, including educational opportunities. Most immigrants want to learn English so they can improve their employment status, become legalized, and share in the American dream. Recommendations for state consideration are provided that are designed to eliminate barriers to employment, education, and community services. An appendix looks at specific concerns expressed by immigrant children. Suggested readings are included. (GLR)",

        "description":"This report profiles the issue of youth violence: the history of its appearance in U.S. culture, the recent escalation of gang activity in U.S. communities, and the strategies put forth in smaller cities to meet this challenge. The report notes that there has been an explosion of gang violence in the United States that has been fostered by a vacuum in economic opportunity and a lack of purpose in life, with both conditions further aggravated by the narcotics business. Centering violence-prevention strategies on penalty and incarceration only causes the community to further estrange itself from its youth. New strategies are needed that are more broad based and community wide that stress education, employment, and the health care needs of youth and their families. Small cities are  in a unique position to meet the challenge because gang violence is a fairly new problem for them, and a timely intervention could potentially eradicate it. Several small city efforts in stemming gang violence are highlighted. Lessons learned in addressing youth violence are that gangs are a symptom of social ills that can best be cured by education, training, and jobs; that interdisciplinary partnerships can help bridge generational gaps and break down traditional barriers in the community; and that youth interventions targeting younger children pay big personal and community dividends.

This paper determines the perceptions of urban teachers and university faculty of the role of an effective urban teacher and compares these perceptions to the natural behavioral styles of candidates for an initial and alternative licensure program in a College of Education. Using two instruments (The Role Behavior Analysis and the Personal Profile System), the study assessed information collected from 20 effective urban teachers, 11 teacher educators from an urban university that places emphasis on the preparation of teachers for urban schools, and 34 candidates for alternative teacher licensure in an urban setting. The study showed  similarities between expectations of urban teachers and urban university professors about the behaviors of effective teachers in the urban setting: effective urban teachers have a primary drive for influencing (or inducement), a secondary drive for dominance, and a drive for steadiness that comes in last. Differences were in the strengths of the tendencies. Comparing these perceptions with predictions for success, as indicated by the Urban Teacher Selection Interview, showed no similarities in the prediction of success using this process with the behavioral patterns that met expectations of teachers and university professors. Four tables and one figure are included. (Contains 40 references.) (GLR)",

Among the findings are the following: (1) communities of color made up 9.2 percent of the total metropolitan area population in 1980; (2) poverty rates for people of color rose dramatically in the metropolitan area between 1979 and 1989, increasing from 26 to 37 percent among African Americans, from 30 to 41 percent among American Indians, from 24 to 32 percent among Asians, and from 17 to 19 percent among Chicanos/Latinos; (3) men from African American and American Indian communities are three times as likely as white men to be officially unemployed, while women from these  communities are four times as likely as white women to be unemployed; (4) the unemployment rates for African American men and women increased sharply from 1980 to 1990 in both the central cities and suburbs; (5) fewer than one of every three African American and American Indian households in the metropolitan region and fewer than half of Asian and Chicano/Latino households own their own homes; and (6) more than one-third of African American and American Indian households in the metropolitan region have no vehicle and must rely on public transportation. Appendices include statistics on population trends for communities of color, the living arrangements of minority children, and data sources. (GLR)",

The institutions that were included in the telephone interviews were chosen to provide geographic, 1862 and 1890 land grant, and nonland grant representation. Major findings included the following: 17 universities identified minority students in at least 1 of their recruitment or retention activities for undergraduates; 12 universities mentioned minority students in at least 1 of their recruitment activities for graduate students; and no university mentioned special retention activities for minority or women graduate students. Thirteen universities indicated they did nothing special to recruit or  retain undergraduate students from diverse populations; 10 universities stated they did not do anything different or special to recruit or retain graduate students. The most common type of diverse population recruitment identified was that of including pictures of minorities and women in recruitment brochures and other related materials. Two universities did not consider women as minority students in agricultural education. Nine universities indicated the major recruitment tool for diverse population graduate students was financial aid packages. No university identified doing anything special or different for diverse population students to help them secure professional positions at graduation or after employment. (YLB)",

        "description":"This booklet examines two frequently used public policy education models and illustrates how they may be used to develop and conduct extension education programs for communities struggling with change in general and for communities dealing with growth management issues in particular. The booklet opens with a brief discussion of key areas of concern in planning/implementing public policy education programs: information providers, decision criteria, objectivity, and program delivery. Following this, the advocacy approach to public resolution is mentioned briefly; however, while this model is widely known and accepted and while it always forces a solution, it is not education. Presented next are the basic components of the alternative/consequences model of public policy education  and important principles public policy educators must follow to be effective. When the public policy education model is applied to conflict resolution, the educator becomes a facilitator in managing a collaborative negotiation process. The benefits and key components of the collaborative model are outlined, and an eight-step issue-to-public policy evolution model is detailed. Also detailed are the 11 identifiable steps in collaborative conflict resolution process. The costs and benefits of community change are weighed, and the role of extension education in resolving community change issues is analyzed. Contains 16 references. (MN)",

Workshops with extension staff members were then held to identify their training needs. On the basis of information gained from observation of supervisory training activities and a training needs assessment questionnaire, a modular comprehensive inservice program was recommended as the most appropriate form of inservice training for the extension staff. The program, which used extensive approaches and methods, included a course on people and organizations in society, and seven agricultural specialist subjects.  A program structure based on on-the-job training and distance learning methods was recommended, and a training development plan was drafted. (Appendixes constituting about half of this document provide information on the current training of existing field-level staff and their training needs, a project itinerary, a consolidated job description, the proposed inservice program, a preliminary list of resource centers, pros and cons of on- versus off-the-job training and distance education, module outlines, and a workshop report.

More than 600 Ohioans discussed their concerns regarding critical aspects of literacy at four regional summits. Nationally recognized leaders in adult literacy, representatives of exemplary local literacy programs, and formerly illiterate adult learners spoke at the summit. According to information gathered through pre- and postsummit questionnaires and small group discussions, the summit participants believe the following: Ohio is at a competitive disadvantage in literacy with other states/nations; adult literacy problems are a major factor in students' success/failure in school; Ohio parents lacking basic skills should be the primary  target of literacy programs; and literacy assessments should be based on performance rather than on standardized measures. The following common themes were identified as a basis for building a statewide strategy for literacy: illiteracy as an intergenerational phenomenon and social/economic imperative for action and the need for improved research, greater collaboration in literacy efforts, and coordinated action by state leadership in Ohio.

        "description":"An economic theory of training holds that training in technical skills and training in employment relations (namely, information reliability or the ability to quickly and reliably disseminate information among the members of the firm) reinforce each other. This theory is an organizing framework for understanding some practices at Japanese firms in Japan and in the United States. The theory stresses the link between school and training. Japanese firms enjoy a favorable environment for training. Technical training is facilitated by the low degree of heterogeneity in, and the high level of, basic skills that new employees bring from schools. Recruitment of new graduates relies heavily on recommendations of selected schools to homogenize the work force in terms of basic skills,  attitude toward working and learning, and personality. Such Japanese practices as team-based production, training of young workers by experienced employees, and training by job rotation expedite the diffusion of knowledge, skills, and information within a Japanese firm. These practices, a reflection of investment in information reliability, result in a compliant and productive work force in Japanese firms. The Japanese training approach has been adapted in some Japanese automobile plants in the United States. In addition to building a homogeneous work force, these plants share another common experience: newly hired employees must be trained from scratch in elementary skills. (Appendixes include 41 references, 58 endnotes, profiles of selected Japanese automobile manufacturers, a  description of the hiring process at Toyota, 4 figures, and 3 tables.) (YLB)",

Other study findings were as follows: (1) union members remain more likely to vote Democratic  than persons from nonunion households; (2) voter turnout is higher among urban union members (but not among their household members) than among the general population; and (3) unions still retain significant political influence over their members (but not over members' households).

        "description":"In the early 1940s the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) created its Committee to Abolish Racial Discrimination (CARD), whose members were pioneers in the attempt within the U.S. labor movement to overcome the divisiveness of racial discrimination. Although the CIO's racial policies were a significant advancement over those of the American Federation of Labor, racial discrimination plagued the CIO during its entire existence. The origins, evolution, and administration of CIO racial policy at the international level, within four major affiliates, and within several smaller CIO unions showed both the successes and failures of those policies. Even if CIO leaders naively accepted the importance of including black workers, they realized by 1942 that the dynamics of physical  integration were quite complex and required a great deal of deliberation. The creation of CARD was the major bureaucratic attempt by CIO leaders to move beyond the rhetoric of racial equality within the organization. However, no matter what the CIO did in regard to racial discrimination, African Americans inside and outside the labor movement consistently considered the merit and necessity of an independent black labor interest group. Despite all its achievements, CARD was unable to remove completely the misgivings many blacks had about the CIO's commitment to challenging the roadblocks to racial equality because of a hesitancy to implement an aggressive and militant policy of redressing racial grievances.

        "description":"Limited research has been conducted on the direct and indirect impact of union-management cooperation (UMC) programs on worker autonomy, work group effectiveness, and worker satisfaction. For this study, a research questionnaire designed to explore these relationships was mailed to four Ohio unions and was returned by 339 members. Workers at facilities with a UMC program were found to experience slightly more worker autonomy. At UMC facilities there were no differences in worker autonomy between participants and nonparticipants of UMC teams. However, program intensity was related to the level of worker autonomy experienced among team members. The presence of a UMC program was not associated with improved work group processes, but the age of the UMC program had a positive  association with work group processes. Satisfaction with work, supervision, and coworkers increased with effective work group processes. Worker autonomy was related to satisfaction with work and supervision, but not satisfaction with coworkers. Support for the UMC process increased the likelihood of supervisors involving employees in workplace decisions. Supervisors were also more likely to encourage participation in workplace decisions when workers were trained in problem solving techniques or held jobs which allowed them to control their work pace. Significant improvement in work group processes occurred when supervisors permitted workers to participate in workplace decisions. (Contains 11 references.) (Author/YLB)",

        "description":"While the building and printing industries flourished in pre-Civil War Columbus, manufacturing languished. The manufacturing base grew and diversified from 1820 to 1850. Few unions emerged, and those that did seldom lasted long. During the Civil War business and manufacturing increased to serve the camps and prisons established in Columbus. When the war ended, Columbus's workers launched the first concerted effort to build a labor movement. In August 1869 the arrival of the first train of the Hocking Valley Railroad introduced a new chapter in the city's industrial history. By World War I, industry had migrated out of the downtown area. Workers were excluded from a major say in city affairs, confined to overcrowded and inadequately served neighborhoods, and trapped in low-paying,  dirty, demanding jobs. The characteristic pattern of the labor movement until the 1930s emerged: workers unionized during prosperity and retreated with recessions. World War I stimulated the economy; peace brought a depression. But because of the city's diverse economic base, it did not feel the depression as severely as other locations; nor did it experience the prosperity of the 1920s to the same degree as other communities; hence, increasingly, the word &quot;moderate&quot; described all national trends as they applied to Columbus. World War II had the greatest impact upon Columbus's labor movement. Public employment doubled, and the manufacturing sector expanded dramatically. Curtiss-Wright's air force factory work force was unionized shortly after it began production in 1941. For the past 2  decades, the challenge for organized labor in central Ohio has been to launch new initiatives in the face of a dramatically changing social and economic environment.

        "description":"A study sought to identify and examine key factors that influence adult basic education (ABE) mathematics instruction in Massachusetts and to develop a detailed picture of the adult basic math learning environment. Phase I involved a survey by questionnaire directed at the entire Massachusetts population of instructors and program directors involved in ABE math instruction. Responses were received from 141 teachers and 78 administrators. Phases II and III used a combination of in-depth interviews with 15 instructors and 13 learners and 2 sets of classroom observations to assess current teaching practices, skills, and attitudes toward mathematics among teachers of mathematics based in a variety of ABE programs. Although over 61 percent of instructors used questioning several times  a session, only 20 percent found this to be one of their most important methods; 28 percent felt that repeated practice and worksheets were most effective; and 22 percent identified group problem solving and cooperative learning as the most effective. Most programs used the Test of Adult Basic Education to record levels and occasionally place learners in class, but few instructors relied on it to diagnose needs or assess learner progress. Roughly three-fourths of instructors had only basic high school math, 11 percent had teacher certification, and 11 percent held a masters in education. Many math classes were taught based on curriculum developed by instructors (41 percent), groups or instructors (21 percent), or programs (18 percent). (The research framework is appended.)  (YLB)",

        "description":"The literature on effective measures of enhancing the participation of organized labor in Total Quality Management (TQM) initiatives was reviewed. The literature was found to be limited in terms of specific discussion of labor union commitment to TQM; instead, authors and experts on the topic focused on the importance of employee involvement, which includes the active participation of organized labor. Employee involvement was seen as synonymous with TQM, and many of the authors of the publications reviewed agreed that TQM cannot be successful if it is a management-only initiative. Included among the other findings of the review were the following: the key to obtaining union and employee acceptance is to involve them immediately and up front; accepting employee involvement and TQM  requires cultural change from the way things have been to the way they can be; the extent to which employee involvement and TQM have real meaning to organizations will be learned by unions and employees via the behaviors of management; neither employee involvement nor TQM will succeed without management's trust of employees and employees' trust of management; and those closest to a given type of work know best how to improve and maintain quality.
