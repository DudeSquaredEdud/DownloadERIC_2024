Five hundred and fifty-seven respondents completed mailed questionnaires, for a response rate of 54 percent. The indicators, selected in cooperation with representatives of student organizations and faculty, included perceived characteristics of faculty members, availability and perceived difficulty of classes, academic advising, contact with faculty members, and resolution of grievances. The students' evaluation of most of these elements was favorable, while their experiences with one, academic advising, was reported as unsatisfactory. The  respondents rated availability of classes and overall satisfaction of expectations at the university positively. Only minimal experience with university grievance procedures was cited. The outstanding finding of the study was the overwhelming report of satisfaction with faculty contact. Ninety-three percent of the respondents attempted to meet with instructors at least once each quarter; of these students, 92 percent reported that their efforts were successful, and their meetings with faculty members resulted in the students obtaining the advice or assistance they sought.

        "description":"The equitability of current New Jersey State programs supporting higher education is the primary focus of this study. Taxpayer equity is defined as the distribution of higher education costs on the basis of ability to pay and commensurate with the distribution of higher education subsidies. The net effect of all state programs on each income group is summarized. The state programs are described in terms of their net impact on families with students in each collegiate sector. The results indicate that income is redistributed from those families with incomes between $5,000 and $15,000 to families earning above $15,000 and below $5,000. The receipt of net state aid benefits is not contingent on a group's ability to pay and is therefore inequitable. Several policy changes are  suggested to produce a more equitable financing system including: increase state student aid to students from families earning between $5,000 and $15,000; change the patterns of distributing state institutional aid; and alter the state tax structure to generate state funds in a more progressive manner.

The proposed deferred cost of education funding plan would establish in advance an option for the U.S. Government to finance, to the extent deemed necessary in future periods, professional health care services in underserved areas. When students are ready to practice, they also would have the option of repaying the borrowed funds either in cash or in the service for which they have committed  themselves. The expectation is that the amount borrowed for education costs will be high enough to make it worthwhile for many students to provide the three years of future service for which they are contracted.

The study sample included 32,673 undergraduate students attending at least half time and was as representative as possible of the distribution of students attending two-year public, four-year public, and private (both two- and four-year.) institutions nationally. The mean age of the full-time independent student was 26.2 years, who generally comes from a family with lower income than dependent students. Financial implications of redefining the independent student were examined. It is concluded that policy changes that restrict the availability of grant assistance to  independent students would not increase the equitable distribution of funds. The participants at present in the &quot;less desirable&quot; loan and employment programs at higher percentage rates have accumulated larger mean long-term debt amounts, work considerably more hours at term-time employment, and presumably use larger amounts of their personal earnings to support their educational programs. Changes that would further increase their reliance on less desirable forms of aid would not further induce greater equity at least in these areas. (LBH)",

A research project was conducted involving students, faculty, professional staff, and administrators at three institutions of varying size, location, and academic program: The University of Massachusetts at Amherst; Southern Methodist University; and Staten Island Community College. The purpose of the study was to determine the subjects' attitudes toward nontraditional academic programs and then compare response across the various constituencies. It was hypothesized that tenured faculty would prove to be the least supportive of nontraditional studies. The data supported this hypothesis. (Author/JMF)",

MLK Program students and students not in the program (non-MLK) were followed up nearly five years after entrance to the College of Liberal Arts (CLA) or General College (GC). MLK students entered with significantly lower test scores, attempted as many credits per quarter, but successfully completed substantially fewer of these credits than their peers. During this period, 15.9 percent of MLK students and 38.6 percent of the non-MLK students in CLA had completed degree requirements. The graduation rates for MLK and non-MLK students in GC were 12.9 percent and 22.6  percent, respectively. In terms of high school performance, precollege test scores, and actual college performance, there were very few differences between MLK and non-MLK students who received degrees. (Author/JMF)",

Instructors were surveyed to assess course characteristics such as mode of instruction, purpose of course, type of exam items, and amount of reading. Class size and course level were also studied. Only one of the 11 items studied, the basis on which grades were determined, showed a  significant difference between the two course performance groups; MLK students were less likely to perform as well as non-MLK students when grades were based solely on exams or quizzes. Possible explanations for the lack of more significant findings are discussed (e.g., broad individual differences within MLK and non-MLK groups). (Author/JMF)",

The study was limited to 240 doctoral degree granting institutions and covered the period from 1872 through 1975. Institutions awarding exclusively professional and theological degrees were not included. Wide diversity was found, although the most prominent academic discipline from which graduate deans have been chosen during the past century has been Chemistry, followed by Education, English, History, Physics, Biology, Engineering, Economics, Psychology, and Mathematics. Chemistry's popularity among graduate deans has also provided a strong base for the physical sciences to emerge as the most prominent field of study among graduate deans over the past century. A surprising 60 percent  of the approximately 1,500 deans of record have served five years or less in the deanship. This may be attributed to the number of individuals who are appointed in an acting capacity for a limited duration. Another explanation may lie in upward mobility of graduate deans who frequently have moved to positions involving higher levels of academic responsibility. The number of appointments to the deanship has varied from year to year, but has remained at 17-19 percent from 1961 to 1975. (LBH)",

Fifty-eight percent of the respondents indicated they were leaving UNC-G to attend college elsewhere. &quot;Dislike for UNC-G&quot; was cited by transfer students more often than students not continuing their education elsewhere. Financial problems, the need for practical experience, and  family crises were factors contributing more heavily to the attrition of nontransfers. Marriage, health problems, and bad grades ranked about equally in both groups as reasons for dropping out. The most enlightening information coming from the questionnaire can be found in the comments students offered, some of which are included in the report.

Four data collective activities were utilized: a learning interest interview field poll of 800 respondents; an inventory of current programs in Iowa for nontraditional students; a 3 to 5 percent sample survey of adult and part-time nontraditional learners currently enrolled in programs; and a series of eight group interviews of nonenrolled adults in separate geographical regions. Data were also gathered first-hand from the institutions themselves. Trends in other states were studied as well. Conclusions and recommendations are outlined regarding policies, balance,  expansion, Iowa Commonwealth College, services, cooperation, and data. Projections of the learning population in the year 2000 were used to emphasize the potential magnitude of the national enrollment, and it was found that in Iowa an even larger percentage of the population will be adults and/or retired. It is suggested that if Iowa is successful in adapting its educational enterprises, the nontraditional learner will not only be well-served but will have become the traditional learner by the year 2000.

The modern management movement has reached American higher education and has created new expectations concerning the faculty's role. An earlier preoccupation with management methods has been replaced by concentration on evaluation. Faculty should share in the preparation of their campus allocation budgets as a whole, not simply their own or departmental concerns. Academic economics are best understood by examining educational costs and pricing, student demand, and the supply and demand of skilled academic personnel. Major income sources must be evaluated: student and service charges, governmental appropriations, philanthropic and donor contributions, and borrowing. Tuition charges, highly sensitive to market  prices, are analyzed in some detail. Consideration is also given to understanding budgets and finance reports. Conflicting organizational pressures in academic institutions must be resolved differently than those arising in organizations based on industrial and hierarchical models. It is concluded that with or without collective bargaining, the faculty's best hope in helping determine its future lies in the principle of shared authority. (LBH)",

A better understanding of the purpose and structure of evaluating mechanisms is a prerequisite for widespread improvement. Teachers must understand what factors play a part in measuring learning. If learning goals and course objectives are properly defined, they will be essential ingredients of success for student and teacher alike. Since multiple-choice and essay tests are most commonly used in college today, a thorough analysis of their structure and purpose is undertaken to clarify underlying principles of evaluation as a learning tool. Letter grading, the most commonly accepted form of evaluation, is particularly  susceptible to the charge of insufficient feedback to the student. A more fundamental grasp of the options for academic measurement is the most direct route to improved grading. Growing external pressures are forcing faculty to reexamine student evaluation. The use of external examiners and the establishment of effective campus grievance arrangements are only two of the ways recommended to improve an increasingly bothersome issue in academic life.

Other items of information include their academic potential and financial need, but little about their interests, attitudes, and expectations. As a result, student volunteers took the College Student Questionnaire (CSQ) and the Omnibus Personality Inventory (OPI) to provide additional data. The 209 questions on the CSQ deal with seven scales: Family Independence, Peer Independence, Liberalism, Social Conscience, Cultural Sophistication, Motivation for Grades, and Family Social Status.

About 80 percent of the students who responded to the questionnaire either plan to teach, or think they might teach, after completing their studies. Of those who might teach, most indicated that they are interested in participating in a course, seminar, or workshop aimed at preparing them to be more effective college and university teachers.

The cost per student can be a misleading figure and that is particularly apparent when used in conjunction with the cost per credit hour. For example, in 1975-76 the cost per honor student was $533, compared to an undergraduate figure of $610. However, the cost per credit hour of honor students was $89 compared to $20 for undergraduate students. The Honor Program's cost per credit hour does appear to be high when compared with the total undergraduate cost per credit hour. However, it must be noted that the average honor program's faculty member has a credit-hour load of approximately 15 hours. A load of this  magnitude is generally considered to be excessive, particularly when faculty may be called on to teach a graduate course. (Author)",

Such a virtual system would be created through a translating computer interface that would provide access to the different retrieval systems and data bases in a uniform and convenient way, even for the inexperienced user. An experimental interface, called CONIT, has been built to test the virtual system concept. Initial evaluation of CONIT, which connects four retrieval systems, suggests that the virtual system approach could be cost effective. Particular attention was focused on the requirements for a common command language, ease of use, and message interpretation and protocols in a networked interface.  (Author/JY)",

Interview questions were designed to discover librarians' positions and backgrounds; the usefulness of courses they took in library schools; their opinions on field work, length of program, and required courses; and their assessment of the overall quality of their library education. Results indicated that librarians felt their education prepared them adequately, that field work was beneficial, and that a core curriculum of basic reference and cataloging was desirable. However, library schools could improve in the areas of effective use of time, teaching techniques, the balance between the practical  and the theoretical, and keeping professors up-to-date. More coursework was wanted in management, automation, and specialized areas such as acquisitions and serials. (LS)",

This definition presumed that the social researcher provided the policy maker with such information. Enough examples of contradition between research findings and policy statements exist to suggest that this definition is a somewhat idealized conception. While a direct linkage between policy research and policy making has been often obscured, it was projected that an indirect linkage will begin to emerge in the future, especially for research focusing on new technology. Since the design of communication systems utilizing new technology has become an integral part of the research, the social researcher  has become involved not only in studying communication behavior, but also in the design of communication systems.

A model which relieves the author of CBI strategy selection was developed for the PLATO IV system and was tested in two instructional situations: training students to use a multimeter to measure resistance and current flow, and assisting Navy mess management specialists in recipe conversion. Student performance using the learner control mode was compared to that of other students using the regular CBI method. Students using the learner control mode experienced a savings in training time, and the use of an  authoring aid was shown to save time over other methods of lesson preparation. (CH)",

In the program control version, quantity of practice was determined by an adaptive branching algorithm based on student performance; the student control version made practice prior to a criterion item optional. Subjects were 84 trainees in basic electricity/electronics at the Naval Training Center in San Diego. Those using the student control program showed a marked time savings over those using program control, and student control of training produced more uniform performance. Large time  savings and increased test scores supported the hypothesis that a knowledgeable student can realistically estimate when he has mastered the practice material. (CH)",

        "description":"In the last four years, University Extension, the University of Wisconsin, has developed two new communications, the Educational Telephone Network (ETN) and Subsidiary Communications Authorization (SCA). ETN is an interacting, party-line type connection which links instructors with remote classrooms in courthouses, hospitals, and universities. SCA is an electronic technique which allows a second signal to be broadcast on an FM channel and received only by individuals with the appropriate multiplexing receiving equipment. Both systems have been used to deliver educational programing with a typical format consisting of lecture sessions followed by question and answer sessions. Each can be used to provide broad dissemination of community service messages. (EMH)",

While utilizing this network, teachers were given the opportunity to develop instructional units from material available from widely diverse sources, and they were encouraged to participate in computer-based programs. The experiment generated information for the design of future large-scale resource sharing arrangements that cut across local and state boundaries. Such a resource network will utilize advanced communication media for the delivery of  various educational services in remote locations. (CH)",

Findings about television's influence have implications for communication policymakers in two areas: (1) the availability of children's programing; and (2) the need for more diversity in television content. To provide more children's television programing, the federal government can effect policy either through regulations of the amount of programing required or through the stimulation of production of series for children. Also, the television industry could cooperate by rotating the broadcast of children's shows during the times that children watch. In addition, diversity of content of  television programs can be achieved by having diversity in values, interests, ideas, and backgrounds among television decisionmakers and production staff. More policy relevant research and increased collaboration between researchers and production staff would also be beneficial. (HAB)",

It was hypothesized that: (1) if a television message is heavily loaded by a particular format, then extraction of knowledge from the message depends on one's initial mastery of the cognitive skill which is hypothesized to be needed; (2) if the same message is coded in a different way, mastery of another mental skill correlates with the extraction of knowledge; and (3) when the message supplants the skill, no such correlation with the corresponding skill occurs.  The experiment supported the first hypothesis and, in part, the second. The third hypothesis received strong support.

        "description":"The Radio Mathematics Project was established to design, implement, and evaluate a prototype system of teaching elementary mathematics using radio as the major medium of instruction. Daily mathematics lessons were presented to first and second graders in rural and urban primary schools in Nicaragua. Lessons had a radio and a postbroadcast portion, each about 30 minutes long. Radio lessons were constructed from segments of instructional material and entertainment activities, both of which required a high level of active response from the children. It was found that first grade children learned new mathematical concepts and skills from radio instruction supplemented by a student worksheet. Children remained attentive and responsive for the radio lesson, provided they had the  opportunity to respond frequently. Children were able to respond at the rate of three to four times a minute. They enjoyed the instructional segments of the lessons, and the entertainment segments were not necessary to maintain the children's attention. Test results indicated that children in radio classrooms performed better than children in traditional classrooms on all topics taught by radio. (Author/CH)",

Extensive results and recommendations were reported. It  was concluded that results show that the post secondary institutions in Iowa are excellent, numerous, and of high quality, but heavily oriented to the traditional, full-time younger person who is embarking upon his or her career.

Pressures to improve medical curriculum led to the educational media movement of the 1950's. By 1970, the Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics (APGO) had established a committee to review audiovisual materials, and instruments to assess programs were developed. As a result, dissemination of teaching aids has been shown to significantly affect teaching style and program effectiveness. A survey of medical school faculty showed increased familiarity with media formats, but a significant decrease in the use of such units and in the value of the units to enhance student  performance. Students also report reductions in use and value of some media types. Efforts continue to ensure that educational media will be used to improve medical education. This report provides a history of APGO involvement in educational media and summarizes APGO's research efforts on the effects of educational media. (EMH)",

At the outset of the investigation the focus of emphasis was on analyzing the possible antisocial effects of television on children, but about midway through the project the research was expanded to include possible prosocial effects of television on children. In the study, roughly 10,000 children in the 8 to 13 year old age range from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds were used as subjects in a variety of experiments. The net conclusion of the antisocial experiments was that under certain conditions and depending on the types of violence portrayed, exposure to televised violence is capable of producing increased inclination toward aggression  in children.

A detailed schedule was developed to tabulate positive and negative factors in four major areas: staff, materials, services, and physical environment. Results indicated that students were more concerned about the actions and attitudes of the staff and the availability of materials than about the library's physical environment, specific services, organization, or the quality of the collection.

The project assessed needs and designed programs to meet those needs by establishing a library in El Centro's community center and some outreach programs. An active acquisitions program for Spanish language materials was developed. In the second year the two organizations expanded their activities to include an education component, a research component, services to seniors and to other community organizations, and publication of a bilingual news bulletin and calendar. As a result of a project evaluation, recommendations were made to establish more libraries in public meeting places, to develop new services for special populations, and to reorganize library  services to serve the public more fully.

Data are compared to the findings of a similar study of the transfer population of fall 1967. The performance of the transfer students was measured by three criteria: persistence of the students at the senior college, academic status, and gradepoint average (GPA). The study shows that the large majority of transfers continued to pursue the baccalaureate degree, and 78% of those whose academic status was known were in clear or  good standing. At the end of the spring 1974 term, the mean GPA of transfer students was 2.65, only .15 lower than the mean pre-transfer GPA. (NHM)",

One questionnaire collected information from faculty on student attrition through the first eight weeks of the fall 1975 semester to find out what kinds of students dropped out, and when. Two questionnaires were administered to systematic samples of students and faculty to determine what student services were valuable in holding students. A Registrar Deficiency Study provided information on how many and what types of students dropped out during the first week of classes, while SRS data gave &quot;time delay&quot; information on dropouts (comparisons for several weeks). The complementary  insights provided by these various sources of information led to the following conclusions: (1) Over 30% of the student population can be identified at the end of registration as likely dropouts. (2) The highest dropout rate occurs in the first week of class. (3) Instructors are providing ingredients critical to helping students succeed. (4) Counselors provide services only on request. (5) SRS data are out of touch with student enrollments from the point of registration until grades are assigned. On the basis of these conclusions the development of an Early Intervention Model is recommended. (MHM)",

The second category (programs) identifies current programs, and programs planned for the future. The overall effectiveness of the system is assessed by presenting figures on degrees and certificates  awarded, and data reflecting the community colleges' accessibility to students from varying income groups. The third category (facilities) assesses the system's current land and building holdings, space utilization, and current space rental. Finally, the fourth category (funding) reports on expenditures in the last fiscal year, and on costs per student per college and per program.

This figure represents a rise of 1,278 from fall 1974, and a 4,372 rise from fall 1971, the first year for which comparative data are provided. This document provides a profile of the student body in terms of age, sex, race, marital status, residence status, country of origin, high school background, credit hours earned, class, status, curriculum, grade point average, employment, graduation, and future plans. Data are provided for fall 1975, and in many sections comparative data are presented for fall 1971-74. Where meaningful differences exist, day students are compared to evening students. With the recent growth in off-campus enrollment and the recent opening of a new campus, there have been some changes in  the composition of the student body. Overall, more students are nonmatriculated (43 percent), female, over 25, and enrolled in one or two courses. While total enrollment has been increasing at about 10 percent per year, the number of students matriculated in transfer programs has declined for four straight years, the number of general education students has returned to 1973 levels after a decline last year, and career students continue to increase in number, though less dramatically than in the past. Nonmatriculated students, however, continue to increase at a rapid rate. (Author/NHM)",

In order to achieve increased accountability, a student services committee has developed a conceptual design for a comprehensive counselor effectiveness evaluation system. As a component of the larger system, a valid and reliable diagnostic instrument was developed for student evaluation of individual counseling services. This instrument was designed with a semantic differential scale to measure the effectiveness of three different counseling processes (acceptance of client, counselor self-acceptance, counselor support), and two counseling outcomes (conference worthwhileness, client independence). A jury of  counselors, counselor educators, and counselor administrators confirmed the content and construct validity of the instrument. Construct validity was also demonstrated by means of a principal components analysis of 281 student evaluations of 11 counselors. Internal consistency reliability coefficients confirmed the multidimensionality of the instrument. A survey of the literature on counselor evaluation is presented, as are complete statistical results of the jury evaluation and preliminary application of the instrument. The instrument itself is appended. (Author/NHM)",

Out of their first meetings emerged a cooperative effort by the involved institutions to improve and expand services and programs to meet the educational needs of Asian American, black, Chicano, and Native American students and their communities. The membership of the Puget Sound Regional Minority Affairs Consortium (PSRMAC) is now composed of 12 college presidents, the campus Minority Affairs Directors, and four educational program specialists for minority education. PSRMAC facilitates six college functions: (1) meaningful career placement for minority  students; (2) the recruitment of minority faculty, administrators, staff, and students; (3) the development of ethnic studies courses; (4) the development of programs to maximize the academic success of minority students; (5) the development of relevant supportive services for minority students; (6) establishment of PSRMAC sponsored programs, including tutorial service, prevocational training, and counseling. Special functions of, and programs sponsored by PSRMAC are described, and directions for the future are recommended. (Author/NHM)",

This reclusive complex stems from three phenomena, one relating to the teacher as human being and academician, another to recent developments in the community college field, and the third to teaching itself. As an academician, the community college instructor prides himself on privacy and teaching self-sufficiency. Because of this, instructors are reluctant to consider ideas posed by anyone outside of their own teaching environments. Furthermore, community college instructors are often divorced from contact with others in their own disciplines,  read few scholarly or professional journals, and are unlikely to join professional associations. Regarding trends in the community college field, community college instructors tend to ignore part-time faculty in their own fields, and, because of the growing average size of institutions, see themselves as isolated from other groups in the college community. Because teaching innovations have gone largely unrewarded in the past, faculty tend to be static in their methods, and to ignore or reassign innovators to instructional coordinator classifications.

They receive no fringe benefits or office space, they are not assigned to faculty committees, and they sign quarter-to-quarter contracts which contain no stipulation of job security, even for the quarter contracted. There are three reasons for hiring part-time instructors: (1) Part-time instructors increase the curricular and scheduling flexibility of an institution, (2) Part-time faculty can be employed to teach at one-third or less the cost of full-time faculty, (3) Factionalization of the faculty discourages faculty collective bargaining efforts. However, there are numerous problems inherent in part-time staffing policies: (1) Lack of formal hiring procedures leads to affirmative action  inequities and arbitrary firing, (2) Part-time faculty do not often display a long-term commitment to the institution, and do not maintain professional ties, (3) Lack of evaluation and provision for student contact leads to unresponsive teaching, (4) There can be an unhealthy administrative/faculty balance in college governance and low faculty morale. Part-time faculty should be issued some kind of binding contract, should be evaluated and participate in staff development efforts, and should receive pro-rata pay and health and welfare benefits.

Among the factors contributing to the drive for college education for workers are: (1) a shift in the composition of the work force; (2) increasing skill requirements in many occupations; (3) rising income levels of unionized workers; (4) new constituencies of union membership; (5) new and increased demands on union leaders. The needs and goals of blue collar and low paid white collar workers are significantly different from the needs of the middle class youths and adults who constitute the usual college student body. They are apt to have less self-confidence as learners than other adults, and tend to opt for courses directly  related to their everyday life and work. Community and junior colleges are natural allies for this new and emerging challenge in higher education. Their tradition of community service and close links to the working world equip them to job-related instruction, and give them a head start in meeting the educational needs of working people.

It also notes that: (1) WSCH data are based entirely on fourth week attendance, rather than on attendance for the entire course; (2) &quot;normative FTE&quot; is a myth; (3) the Study considers all faculty  members to contribute equally to &quot;cost&quot; even though they are not equally expensive; (4) identically coded courses are not in fact identical; (5) the study considers total costs, rather than marginal costs; (6) the data lags by one full year; and (7) the study bases its enrollment projections on past enrollment figures, totally ignoring external events such as demographics, unemployment, and technological patterns. The author suggests possible improvements and illustrates how the ideas of the study, when applied with caution, can be used in an institutional research setting to complement managerial decisions.

        "description":"Lake City Community College began its involvement with the National Direct Student Loan Program in 1965. As of June 30, 1975, the college had loaned $317,625 to 486 students--an average of $653 per student. Of this amount, $93,292 has been repaid or cancelled, leaving $224,333 outstanding and $42,678 past due. Of the past due amount, $15,142 is past due by one year to two years, and $17,190 is past due by two years to over five years. Of th ose students who are two to five years delinquent, 85 percent cannot be located. The author speculates that the number of delinquent payments is largely attributable to (1) borrowers in the vocational and technical areas who have not been successful in obtaining employment and who, consequently, cannot repay, and (2) borrowers in the fields of  forestry, landscaping, and golf course operations, who typically come to the college from other states and leave on completion of their coursework, and now cannot be found. In order to eliminate the high delinquency rate, the author recommends certain improvements in the operations of the college financial aids office, and discusses several methods for solving the problem on a national basis.

During this same period, 2,299 degrees and certificates were awarded: 65 graduates earned multiple degrees (five earned three degrees and/or certificates, 60 earned double degrees or certificates). Analysis by program shows that the 10 programs with the greatest number of graduates were (in descending order) Liberal Arts, Secretarial Science, Clerical, Accounting, Nursing, Sales/Management, Auto Mechanics Tech, Police Science, Food Services, and Electronics. Compared to the previous year, the number of Associate in Arts degrees granted increased by 23%, the number of Associate in Science degrees granted  increased by 10%, and the number of Certificates of Achievement awarded increased by 10%. System-wide, the number of male graduates equalled the number of female graduates. An analysis by campus shows that the number of graduates at Hawaii and Leeward Community Colleges increased by 23% and 33%, respectively.

        "description":"Using 1970-71 data for 263 community colleges throughout the United States, the author conducted a study designed to examine the impact of unionization and collective bargaining on the compensation and workloads of community college faculty members. This paper discusses the methodology used and presents two mathematical models for determining the level of faculty compensation, and for determining faculty workload. Results indicate that unionization has raised total faculty compensation primarily by increasing the level of fringe benefits. Although salaries in unionized colleges were 14.6% higher than those in nonunionized institutions, much of the differential was due to factors other than unionization. On the other hand, fringe benefits in the unionized colleges exceeded those  in nonunionized colleges by over 96%, and, other than unionization, only size of institution significantly affected the level of fringe benefits. While unionization did not have a significant effect on salaries, it did significantly reduce teaching load. These results suggest that in the initial years of bargaining the faculty have been willing to trade off potential salary gains for increased welfare and better working conditions. In the future, it is expected that these results will change as bargaining matures and certain concerns become less paramount. (Author/DC)",

The first details an examination of 83 public two-year college collective bargaining contracts and 41 public and private four-year college agreements for references to classroom visitations. Such references were found in 24 (29%) of the two-year college contracts and in 6 of the 20 (30%) public four-year college contracts. Personal and instructional improvement were the primary reasons given in the contracts for teacher observations. The accompanying charts indicate the prevalence of such clauses in contracts negotiated by various agents, such as the American Federation of Teachers, and in the East, West, and Midwest. The second article examines locations where faculties have voted for &quot;No Agent&quot; in  bargaining elections. Two-year college faculties have voted for a bargaining agent in 9 out of 10 elections while four-year college faculties have voted for bargaining agents only two-thirds of the time. In the 212 two-year college elections conducted through June 15, 1976, 13 of the 15 (87%) private two-year colleges selected agents and 187 (95%) of the public two-year colleges chose agents. Charts are included showing the specifics of the 69 two- and four-year college elections where faculties failed to support a bargaining agent. (Author/MJS)",

This compares with a 2.1% loss in other areas of the college. Even with administrative costs added in, a $13,000 profit was realized over the two semesters.

        "author":["Feldman, Sylvia D."],
        "description":"The American penal system of placing criminal offenders in institutions has evolved from two major goals: (1) to punish offenders as an example to the rest of the community, and (2) to rehabilitate offenders into the community. Since the mid-1960's there has been a trend toward placing offenders in the community and away from isolating them in penal institutions. This paper is concerned with this trend as it relates to training and education programs for offenders. The author reviews the literature pertaining to pretrial intervention and diversion programs and to post-conviction programs. She also presents guidelines to assist interested individuals and groups in planning, designing, and establishing community education programs for offenders, in gaining community support, and in  program finance and evaluation. An extensive bibliography is appended, as are a list of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) grants awarded for programs relating to pretrial release and educational release during fiscal years 1972-74, and a list of the two- and four-year colleges presently conducting higher education programs in State and Federal penal institutions.

        "author":["Yelvington, James Yowell"],
        "description":"Now that the enrollment increases of the 1960's have levelled off, community colleges have the opportunity to develop institutional coherence--to develop harmonious interrelationships among the multiple purposes and programs adopted by the college at various times in response to divergent community needs and pressures, and to communicate an understanding of these interrelationships to all concerned parties. One of the major difficulties involved in developing institutional coherence lies in the nature of the prevailing concepts related to the community college. &quot;Transfer education,&quot;&quot;terminal education,&quot;&quot;general education,&quot;&quot;occupational education,&quot;&quot;adult education,&quot;&quot;developmental education,&quot;&quot;community services,&quot; and &quot;guidance&quot; are all considered as distinct functions and are  too seldom recognized as vague and overlapping terms; as a consequence, those who fail to perceive the interrelatedness of the several functions tend to discount the importance of those activities from which they feel relatively remote and to allow lines of communication to atrophy. An additional source of difficulty lies in the organizational scheme of the college; here, again, the functions are treated as distinct entities with no relationship to each other. Methods of alleviating these problems and of arriving at a strong identity for community colleges are discussed. (Author/DC)",

Under sponsorship of the Fund for the Advancement of Postsecondary Education, the project was opened to postsecondary institutions throughout the country which felt they were doing a commendable job of meeting the needs of disadvantaged students. Of the 225 institutions applying to the Fund under the program, only ten were selected as having developed an exemplary open door program. The selected institutions included four two-year colleges: Bronx Community College (Bronx, N. Y.), Oscar-Rose Community College (Midwest City, Oklahoma), Southeastern Community College (Whiteville, N. C.), and Staten Island Community College (Staten Island, N. Y.).  This report describes the exemplary programs at these four two-year colleges.

        "description":"In the midst of insistent demands for accountability, self-analysis by all educational institutions has become an urgent necessity. Long-range, comprehensive planning is an essential prerequisite for coping effectively with the rapid changes taking place in education, and institutional research is an essential element in such planning. For an institutional research program to be comprehensive, it must embrace assessments within five major areas: (1) allocation of resources (fiscal allocations, personnel resources, and physical facilities); (2) student potential; (3) achievements (student achievements, instructional methodologies, student expectations, and institutional climates); (4) curriculum and program needs and priorities; and (5) college impact upon the community. In order  to be most helpful to college executives and managers, the institutional research staff must work in close contact with the office of the college president and still maintain the detachment necessary to view the institution objectively. This paper reviews the role of the institutional researcher and presents the highlights of an actual long-range planning model used at William Rainey Harper College. (DC)",

The method presented was implemented at Napa College (California) during the fall quarter of the 1975-76 school year and was evaluated soon thereafter. In order to measure the success of the method, the author compared the instructional costs, withdrawal rates, and student outcomes for a group of 30 students who had been exposed to the traditional teacher-directed teaching method and 30 students who had been exposed to the new method. Results indicated that: (1) the individualized typing program was as effective in developing speed and accuracy in beginning collegiate typewriting as was the traditional method, (2) the  withdrawal rate of the students in the traditional group was significantly higher than the withdrawal rate of the students in the individualized instruction group, (3) the individualized instruction approach provided more efficient utilization of staff, classroom space, and business equipment than the traditional approach, and (4) the individualized instruction approach provided a lower cost per student than the traditional teaching method.

In the first individualized instruction class, students used a study guide and a textbook. In the second individualized instruction class, students used a study guide, textbook, and audio-cassette presentations of the material. Achievement gains were measured through pre- and posttests. At the end of the semester, students were asked to respond to an attitude survey and to complete a case problem which required them to apply concepts learned to a new situation.  Results indicated no significant differences in achievement gains, attitudes toward accounting, or problem-solving ability. It was also found that (1) both individualized instruction methods were equally effective, (2) students' high school rank had no effect on achievement gains, attitudes, or problem solving ability, and (3) students of higher high school rank had more positive attitudes toward the course than students of lower rank regardless of the treatment experienced.

All of these students had been exposed to the same curriculum. Of the 23 respondents, nine had failed at least one of the five tests on the examination; of these, all had failed more than one test. When asked to indicate the teaching strategies used in the courses pertaining to the tests they had failed, six of the nine respondents indicated individualized instruction. When all respondents were asked to indicate the teaching strategies used in the courses pertaining to the tests  on which they had performed best, 16 indicated lecture-discussion. Overall, the highest test scores were noted in medicine and psychiatry and the lowest in obstetrics. Other findings indicated that courses in surgery and obstetrics were not covered adequately to meet State Board requirements, and those respondents who read slowly had the greatest difficulty in passing the timed examination.

        "description":"Prior to fall 1974, faculty workload at Black Hawk College (Moline, Illinois) was determined on the basis of total semester hours taught. Now it is based on the equitable teaching load, as agreed upon by the department chairman and the faculty member, subject to administrative approval. This new method of computation is based on departmental goals for production of student credit hours, and recognizes such factors as the number of preparations, the amount of time spent in course development, and the amount of time spent in committee work. In order to determine whether or not this new method had resulted in a reduced faculty workload in the composition, literature, philosophy, and journalism department, the author reviewed the student credit hours produced by each full-time  equivalent teacher in the department from fall 1970 through spring 1976. The review indicated that the productivity of full-time teachers in that department, as measured by student credit hours, has not changed significantly as a result of the new faculty workload system. This suggests that general department satisfaction with the new system does not result from an actual reduction in workload, but from other factors. A brief literature review and bibliography are included, as are a review of the research methodology used and recommendations for further studies. (DC)",

The traditional role of the trustee was not designed to meet these and other current threats to the community college and to local board control. Trustees are urged to become political activists, and initiate defensive action through the legislative and political process. The second speech, \"The Challenge to Presidential Authority,\" urges community college presidents and trustees to team together as a political force to fight the enactment of a federal public employees collective bargaining law, which is presently under consideration by the Congress.  The states should have the right to refrain from or to enact collective bargaining laws, and to experiment, amend, or rewrite such laws to meet their own needs. (BB)",

        "description":"In order to determine the numbers and kinds of prisoner education programs offered by postsecondary institutions nationwide, letters were sent to 347 colleges and universities known or believed to be operating such programs. Of these, 99 reported that they had no such program in operation, 237 described their programs, and 11 did not respond. An analysis of the program descriptions indicated that: 63 consisted of one or more academic or vocational courses offered for credit, but leading to no particular degree; 9 consisted of non-credit courses (human development, arts and crafts) only; 15 consisted of vocational or occupational courses only; 13 consisted of TV, video-tape, or electrowriter courses only; 7 consisted of GED (General Educational Development), ABE (Adult Basic  Education), or high school equivalency courses only; 7 consisted of correspondence, extension, or independent study only; 13 consisted of study-release courses only; and 80 were multi-component programs incorporating at least two of the above elements. Two programs trained inmates as teachers or tutors for their fellow students and four used student interns or volunteers to provide educational opportunities to offenders. This report contains a brief history of prison education programs, a description of the methodology used in previous surveys and in this survey, and the descriptions and a directory of the programs identified.

This study was designed to determine what changes in the student profile have taken place corresponding to the change in student body composition, and to develop a model for modifying the HACC student services program to reflect those changes. Existing data indicated that, compared to the average HACC student of 1969, the average HACC student of l975 is older, more likely to be a part-time student, more likely to be female, and less likely to plan to transfer to a four-year college. Interviews with several representative groups of students showed that negative reaction  to student services was centered on faculty advising, career counseling and job placement, and accessibility of services. The study includes a review of the pertinent literature; an analysis of HACC enrollment trends (1968-1975); a review of the characteristics of full-time, part-time, adult, and non-credit students enrolled during fall 1975; and a comparison of student opinion concerning student services in 1972 and in 1975. Based on this information, a dynamic participatory model for student services is presented. (DC)",

The 121 faculty respondents (69%) indicated which of the 22 services offered by the Library, the Learning Laboratory, and the Audio-Visual Department they had used, how often they had used them, and rated each service on a Likert-type scale. Results showed that only seven of the 22 services had been used by 50% of the faculty in the previous year, of which five related to traditional library services. Only two services (\"checked out book\" and \"read magazines or newspapers in library\") had been  used by 75% of the faculty. Overall, about one third of the faculty were utilizing library facilities. Those services used by less than 25% of the faculty included \"had a bibliography prepared,\"\"used the microfilm/microfiche,\"\"requested A/V materials to be shown in my classroom,\"\"recommended A/V materials to be purchased,\"\"had students take make-up tests,\" and used interlibrary loan services.

After leaving JD, 59% had attended a senior institution and indicated that their grades at JD were lower  than or equal to grades received at the senior institution. An additional 8% had attended another two-year college. All respondents who had entered the world of work immediately after leaving JD indicated satisfaction with their preparation. (DC)",

In answer to the second item, 61% cited a need to plan their work, to develop a list of jobs and put them in priority order, and then get them done in that order. Other responses to this item were: more support personnel, better job descriptions to pinpoint responsibilities, more effective and concise communications, fewer and shorter meetings, better utilization of office space, and longer notice on rush jobs.

The infant behaviors observed were: (1) smiling, (2) head turning, (3) activity level, and (4) vocalizations (i.e., cooing, laughter or gurgle, fussing, crying, or visceral noise). Results showed that infants were more responsive (i.e., smile  more, turned the head more, cooed more, and were more active) to female strangers than to their mothers. Cooing to the female stranger was related to ratings of maternal warmth and maternal vocalization to infants during the first three months of life. (Author/BRT)",

The program described here is the Florida Parent Education program developed by Ira Gordon of the Institute for Development of Human Resources at the University of Florida in Gainesville. The Florida Parent Education Program is a Follow Through model which serves children in grades K-3. The major thrust of the program is to help parents acquire some home teaching competencies that will improve their children's intellectual behavior, self-esteem, and motivation. The Florida program hires and trains community people to work as parent educators who in turn make weekly home visits to teach parents skills to use at home with  their children. Included in the program description are brief outlines of: (1) goals and objectives, (2) content and materials, (3) classroom activities, (4) parent involvement, (5) professional and paraprofessional training, (6) administrative requirements and costs, (7) program development and evaluation, and (8) program history and present (1971) status.

The PEP project is concerned with the development and evaluation of a model of individualized education for young children which is suitable for implementation in American public schools. To date, experimental materials for nursery school and first, second, and third grade have been developed. PEP concentrates on basic skills and concepts that are prerequisites for future academic subject matter. The PEP curriculum outlines carefully sequenced predetermined steps the  child is to progress through at his own rate. If any difficulty is experienced at a step, the instruction is revised until the child has mastered the assignment so that the child never equates difficulty with failure.

        "description":"This paper describes and analyzes different types of inservice training available for early childhood education programs to help directors select the inservice training best suited to their programs. It is suggested that early childhood education programs are at one of three levels of development: initial adjustment stage, operational stage, and established functional stage. The proposed objective is to match the developmental stage of a program to the model of inservice training best suited to its needs and resources. Three models of inservice training are outlined. The Materials Model is a highly cost effective method of training done with self-instructional materials. This model requires much independent effort from the staff and would most likely prove ineffective to programs  at the initial adjustment and operational stages. The Advisor/Consultant Model involves bringing an outside advisor/consultant into the program to provide specific expertise. While this type of training can be used effectively by programs at any stage of development, cost may be an important factor. The Inside Trainer Model consists of training carried out by program staff members themselves, and may be most suitable to a program in the initial adjustment stage of development as it provides for continuous support. However, this model is not recommended for use after the initial adjustment stage as it is costly and time-consuming and may stifle staff members' independent operation of the program. (Author/SB)",

A questionnaire sent to participants raised questions about either an imaginary young man or woman who had recently received a B.A. in early childhood education. Questions were about what quality the new teacher would need most for success with young children, what would be his or her most important problem in teaching, why he or she was going into early childhood education, and how long he or she would continue teaching. Results indicated that women teachers needed to be more concerned than men about earning a living while men, (more than women) needed to have  love for children to be successful, a desire to change the schools, and a less friendly rapport with colleagues. Results are discussed. (SB)",

Also included is an abstract bibliography of recent infant research. &quot;Intervention and Infant Education&quot; traces the evolution of government programs for infants and families through the past ten years. &quot;Competent Infants and Their Caregivers: The Feeling Is Mutual&quot; discusses the development of competence through interaction with self, others, and inanimate objects. Ideas about ways infants learn, and descriptions of real life  behaviors are presented to help caregivers understand the dynamics of developmental changes. &quot;Reciprocal Interactions Between Infants and Mothers&quot; explores the mutual adaptation of mother and child. It is proposed that the quality of feedback from the infant's actions influences the quality of his motivation for subsequent interaction and his competence in getting what he needs or wants. &quot;Discontinuous Mothering - Expanding the Alternatives&quot; reviews statistics associated with discontinuous mothering, describes its effects on children, and presents some alternatives. The need for quality caregiving is identified as a national problem, involving comprehensive economic, political and social factors. &quot;Roots in Infancy for Later Development&quot; points out the importance of self-concept in the  development of a competent, healthy adult.

A 5-year-old girl's dysfunctional speech behavior is presented as an example of social interaction difficulties resulting from a failure in \"social cognition.\" The question-answer format is described as the basis of communication since questions are designed to elicit a response. Observations of the interaction between mothers and infants are described to show that the exaggerated question form (with its raised inflection) results in a raised arousal level for the infant, and that the termination of the arousal in a discharge such as cooing or smiling serves as an answer. It is suggested that these  early interactions form the basis for the more complex answers which the child gives as he develops. Language, social and cognitive knowledge are seen as interrelated and interdependent, and development is viewed as a gradual differentiation between these domains. Because of the importance of social behavior to learning, it is suggested that the student-teacher interpersonal relationship should be a significant consideration in curriculum design. (SB)",

In the first section background information presents the concept behind CFRP, objectives are outlined and program operation and evaluation are discussed. CFRP is a national Head Start demonstration program. It is a child-centered family service program, designed to provide family support services that are crucial for, and directly related to, the sustained healthy growth and development of children from the prenatal period through age eight. The staff of the Head Start program is the core of CFRP, to which other professionals are added. Each CRFP must have available the full  range of services normally provided to Head Start children and their families in addition to the minimum services indicated in the national CFRP guidelines. Part II contains specific project descriptions. Projects in New Haven, Connecticut; Poughkeepsie, New York; Pottsville, Pennsylvania; St. Petersburg, Florida; Jackson, Michigan; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Gering, Nebraska; Bismarck, North Dakota; Las Vegas, Nevada; Salem, Oregon; and Modesto, California are described.

The 1974 volumes of 24 research journals were examined, and all articles in these volumes were included in the survey if they met two criteria: (1) having a research sample, and (2) dealing with children and youth between the prenatal period and 24 years of age. Each of the articles was classified by age category (childhood or adolescence), and by selected areas of research. The content area categories, which were not mutually exclusive, included: physical development (disorders and disease), physical development (other), cognitive development, socioemotional development, the family, the broader environment, intervention programs and services, education, and health.  In addition, each article was scrutinized for information pertaining to 35 sample characteristics. A 4-point nominal scale was used to indicate whether information about each of the 35 characteristics was specified, inferred, not specified, or not applicable. Tables of results present the number and percentage of articles in which each sample characteristic appears, for the entire survey and for each content category. Results for each of the 35 characteristics are discussed and an overview of reporting practices within general areas is presented. Findings are summarized in a conclusion and in an executive summary of the study that is included. (SB)",

        "description":"Two experiments compared the cognitive maps (mental representations of the spatial environment) of first graders, fifth graders and college students, and investigated developmental changes in the ability to manipulate cognitive maps mentally. In the first experiment, subjects were asked to move from stationpoint to stationpoint and at each, to align a sighting tube in the direction of three targets. Half the subjects in each age group performed this task while in direct visual contact with the room, half while enclosed by an opaque screen. The three age groups differed only in the obstructed viewing condition. First graders were less accurate than either fifth graders or college students, suggesting that the spatial memory underlying cognitive maps does not reach its adult-like  status until sometime between first and fifth grade. In the second experiment, subjects performed two tasks which tested mental mainpulation. Subjects imagined walking to new stationpoints, making three sighting tube responses based on each imagined location. Then subjects imagined that the room had rotated, making sighting tube responses in terms of the mentally transformed spatial array. Again, half the subjects in each age group were assigned to an obstructed viewing condition. Results showed definite age differences and indicated that complete mental manipulation is a two-stage process. In the first stage a strategy of manipulation is applied to the general spatial relationships contained in the cognitive map. In the second stage more specific relationships between self and spatial  layout are reconstructed. (Author/SB)",

Data sources included responses from personal interviews with 11 prominent early childhood theorists (each of the interviews was structured according to a list of 19 questions in five areas), results from reviews of the literature in early childhood education, recommendations made by 13 participants representing regional and state agencies, school districts, etc., at a regional conference in Austin, Texas, and responses from brief telephone interviews with 10 people  currently working in the area of research and development for carepersons. Identified needs and recommendations from each data source are reviewed. In general, the results indicate a need in five major areas: (1) more effective education of parents, paraprofessionals, and other adults involved in caring for children; (2) more research directed toward the development of effective training materials for parents and paraprofessionals--research which utilizes an exportable, modular design, flexible training strategies, and multimedia materials; (3) more accessibility to parenting materials already developed, (4) more research concerning what effective parenting is; and (5) more effective strategies for utilizing information obtained from screening instruments used with young children in  program development.

A total of 40 boys and 40 girls from kindergarten and second grade were given one or three opportunities to explore a maze-like construction approximately 22 square meters in area. Each child was then required to verbally describe the correct path through this maze to another child of the same grade and sex. Children with three exploration opportunities communicated significantly more information to their partners than did children with one exploration opportunity, regardless of sex or grade. The evidence that increased referent familiarity resulted in increased communication effectiveness was seen as a constraint on childhood egocentrism. (Author/SB)",

A novel toy designed for this experiment required cooperative behavior to activate a buzzer. Subjects were 48 2- to 5-year-old nursery school children randomly assigned to subject pairs, then to the following three treatment conditions: no training, partial training, and full training in the use of the toy. Each treatment period was followed by a rest period, then a testing period with the criterion apparatus. Children were again tested  after two weeks. Results were analyzed using a 2-way analysis of variance with one repeated measure. Only the training variable was significant. A Duncan's Multiple Range Test revealed that the full training group had a significantly higher response rate that the other two treatment groups. These results were discussed in terms of the complexity of the toy for young children and the possible modeling effect of the full training procedure. (Author/SB)",

Each writing sample was derived from response to a picture depicting a typical culturally oriented scene and was analyzed for: (1) attack (whole/mature, large and small detail; people, animals, story, description, listening); (2) social response (family, racial labeling, antagonism, social responsibility); (3) economic response (barter, buy-sell,  economic independence and dependence); (4) worries (food, sickness, death, intra-personal social); (5) feelings (pleasure, anger, fear, and other intra-personal). Results indicated: significant differences between all tribes and age levels, with tribal differences being four times as great as age level; the least differences in the whole/mature response, suggesting an innate ability to respond at this level regardless of cultural, tribal, and age differences; significant differences between the broken and maintained cultures; integration conflicts among tribes of widened horizons; differences in the areas of tension among tribes.

During the 1973 fiscal year, 2,567 migrant students were enrolled in the program. An evaluation team evaluated the program from July 1972 through June 1973 and the 1973 summer program. Data were obtained from the staff, records, reports, test results, and on-site interviews with administrators, tutors, and students. Using the Wide  Range Achievement Test, pre- and posttests were given to evaluate results in reading, spelling, and arithmetic. Student attitudes were assessed at the beginning and end of the year using a scale of Student Attitudes. Findings showed the program was meeting its objectives. This report includes information on the: children served, exemplary programs, staff utilization, inservice training, special and supportive services, resource center library, program effectiveness and integration, relationship with the regular Title I program and with other programs, community involvement, nonpublic school participation, dissemination, and summer school program.

This study examined fertility patterns among the Spanish speaking population through a comparative demographic analysis of the 1950-1970 censuses. The Spanish surnamed population was compared state by state throughout the Southwest with the total population. Age and sex composition, dependency and fertility rates, and family size patterns were analyzed, as well as overall rates of growth. Data were obtained primarily from the 1950, 1960, and 1970 Special Reports on Persons of Spanish Surname and the individual State Reports of the 1970 Census of Population for the five  Southwestern states. Only comparable tables of these census reports were used for continuity. It was found that while the fertility rate of the total population of the Southwest did in fact increase in 1960, by 1970 the current fertility rate had decreased to levels below that in 1950 in every state throughout the Southwest. The Mexican American decreasing fertility was evidenced in the population pyramids, age composition tables, dependency ratios, child-woman ratios, children ever born per 1,000 women ever married tables, and the average persons per family data analyzed from census data.

        "description":"In its report accompanying the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the Senate Labor Committee concluded that in general child labor in agriculture was physically and mentally detrimental to the health and well-being of participating children, acting as a social depressant, stunting their intellectual growth and capacity, and resulting in economic exploitation negatively affecting the local adult wage rate. Congress, therefore, adopted legislation prohibiting the employment in agriculture of all children under the age of 12 except those working on farms owned or operated by their parents or guardians, or with the consent of their parents or guardians on farms exempt from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the act by virtue of the 500 man-day test. In  both exceptions, the children must be employed outside school hours in the school district where they reside. Opponents of the legislation suggested that the amendments have created isolated situations of severe economic hardship which could be legislatively remedied without any negative side effects on those children being protected. This hearing examined the arguments both pro and con for this position within the framework of the 3 premises on which the decision was made to prohibit the agricultural employment of children under 12--the physical effects on the children, the social effects on the community, and the economic impact on the area's wage structure.

        "description":"A provision of the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) prohibited children under the age of 12 from working in agriculture, except on their parents' farms. Purpose of this provision was to codify as a matter of national social policy that children under 12 should not work for hire in agriculture or any other industry, where they may be exploited or abused. The provision was designed to improve Federal law banning sweatshop practices and abuses in migrant labor situations. Opponents of the provision suggested that there may be situations where the very valid reasons behind this new law simply did not apply. For instance, Aroostook County (Maine) relies heavily on the potato industry which relies heavily on the labor of schoolchildren. Yet, there is no  exploitation or abuse since the children are considered an important and willing part of the labor force. Focusing on children under 12 picking potatoes in Maine, this hearing examined the intention and practical effect of the provision. Testimony was heard from educators, students, parents, and representatives from the Maine Department of Manpower Affairs, Maine Employment Security Office, Maine Potato Council, Agricultural Bargaining Council, Aroostook County Farm Bureau, Aroostook Farm Labor Association, National Committee on the Education of Migrant Children, and North American Blueberry Council.

Data were utilized to examine: student characteristics; teacher-pupil ratios; operating costs for 1972-75; per pupil costs for each school (1975); operating costs for elementary, secondary, and post secondary schools (1975); dorm facilities; distribution of 1975 boarding school expenditures; annual operating costs vs consumer price index; major costs (total, education, facilities, and title programs); and construction costs. Major conclusions were: per pupil costs were not inordinate; post secondary admissions policies  were based upon local rather than formal BIA policy; personnel costs were substantially fixed via Civil Service salaries; attempts to evaluate educational programs appeared minimal; uniformity of fiscal categories and program definition categories was minimal; development of long range career plans was not often accomplished; there was little cooperation between local colleges and boarding schools; teaching personnel were not always qualified; there was no systematic method of allocating funds; major recommendations from the 1969 Kennedy Report have yet to be implemented.

It was concluded that: the  three models should be understood as representations of the different dimensions of social existence; the human interest dimensions of mutual understanding, technical control, and emancipation should provide a framework for perceiving cultural adaptation, technical development, and redistribution of power as potentially complimentary aspects of social development; institutions should be analyzed in the context of the competitive, monopolistic, and state sectors of the national economy; class structure should be viewed in its full complexity.

        "author":["Pierce, James M."],
        "description":"Due to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's definition of a farm as an \"economic unit which produces at least $1,000 worth of agricultural products a year\", more than 570,000 farms were eliminated from the 1975 agricultural census. In addition, over 12,000 farms went out of business, continuing a trend begun in 1940. Although American food prices increased 40%, the farmer received only 43 cents for every dollar spent at the supermarket. In 1975, American consumers spent an estimated $177 billion on food and an increasing portion of this expenditure went to corporate coffers through vertical integration of the production and marketing process. The essence of these latest government figures is that little has changed over the years in the lives of farmworkers. Most continued to be  exempt from federally guaranteed minimum wages; few are covered by unemployment insurance, social security, and workers' compensation. All are specifically excluded from the National Labor Relations Act statutes which protect the collective bargaining rights of most American workers. Farmworkers also suffer from poor education, squalid housing, inadequate diets, and critical health needs. However, organizations such as the National Sharecroppers Fund, land reform groups, and agricultural cooperatives are working on solving these problems. (NQ)",

        "description":"The linguistic varieties in use in the Chicano speech community of East Austin (Texas) and the attitudes toward them were studied. Data were collected from field work done in a section of Austin that comprised over half of the Chicano population. The section was a practically segregated urban neighborhood and somewhat isolated from other ethnic influences; the only Anglos were those who owned shops in the area, but lived elsewhere. From the 92 residents who were interviewed, it was found that East Austin speakers had access to a language repertoire that included English and 4 varieties of Spanish--Northern Mexican Spanish, Popular Spanish, Espanol Mixtureado or code-switching, and Calo. Therefore, the study took into account the community's language repertoire and the varieties  that this repertoire encompassed as well as some of the different social functions served by these varieties. English was felt to be superior to the vernacular, especially for second- and third-generation speakers. Those experiencing upward mobility preferred to speak English and looked down on the local varieties, declaring they did not use them. A feeling of linguistic inferiority was particularly strong among older informants; the younger speakers seemed to express ethnic pride in their ways of speaking. (NQ)",

        "description":"Most small, rural schools are not equipped to provide each and every student with an education which provides students with learning experiences that are necessary for the development of basic academic and non-academic skills. Therefore, small, rural schools need to identify and utilize the various human, natural, and social resources which comprise the community. Great potential exists within the community for student learning and basic skills development. The New Hampshire Supervisory School Union 58's Experimental Schools (ES) project has developed a diverse strategy for incorporating out-of-school, community oriented student activities into the total learning process. The instructional strategy includes field trips, guest speakers, an environmental education nature study  site, and student placement at training sites. By using community resource sites and employing the talents of skilled community members in the education process, the small, rural school that has limited instructional resources can supplement student learning and basic skills development. Thus, the individual student, upon leaving the formal K-12 instructional process, will have marketable skills, can successfully compete for work, and/or further his formal education. (NQ)",

During the first year, the bulk of resources and staff time were directed toward the development and implementation of a more effective Choctaw tribal government system and the acquisition of Federal program resources to deal with the more critical human problems of the Choctaw people. The Strategic Planning Center for Choctaw Self-Determination sought to provide technical support to the Choctaw tribal government, emphasizing the development of plans and projects designed to: increase the efficiency and effectiveness of all tribal programs; reorganize the tribal government system; meet the manpower, economic, community development,  educational, and health needs of the tribe; approximate as nearly as possible the optimal utilization of tribal resources; and enable the tribal council to position itself to administer and operate, on a contractual basis, all Federal programs presently conducted by other agencies for the tribe's benefit. This report describes the: premises upon which the project was developed and implemented, progressive steps taken during fiscal year (FY) 1972, tribal reorganization plan, tribal programs structure, economic development, Choctaw Self-Determination and tribal-Federal-State relations, and project priorities for FY 1973.

Developed under the auspices of Title I of the Elementary Secondary Education Act (ESEA), CITE is highly structured and prescriptive in its attempts to promote English oral and written expression. Presenting grammatical structures based on a sequence suitable to Navajo students, NALAP allows students to internalize English language structures and  promotes small group and individualized instruction. Emphasizing developmental programs at the primary levels and remedial programs at the middle and upper levels, the 1973-74 Title I project expenditures totaled more than $7.9 million with language arts/reading receiving 80%, mathematics 3.5%, special education 9.9%, and general academics .1%. During 1973-74, student growth in language arts and math was equivalent to 7 months and 1.1 years respectively.

        "description":"Change and persistent problems in the quality of life of open-country families (n=317) in four eastern Kentucky counties (Harlan, Perry, Whitley, and Wolfe) were examined via comparison of data derived from surveys of household heads in 1961 and 1973. The 1961 survey provided data on occupations, income, level of living, and opinions re: the nature of society and other conditions. The 1973 survey provided additional data re: the nature of change in a family situation (improvement vs deterioration) and the perceived direction of change re: wages/salaries; welfare programs; politics and political parties; job opportunities; medical services; education; and other aspects of life. Results indicated: families at all stages of the life cycle had advanced in material wealth; aspects of  the family life cycle seemed to have affected opinions re: direction of change and current situation only in terms of job opportunities, real income, and the public schools; considerable dissatisfaction was expressed by the majority re: most aspects of the political/economic situation and man's condition in society. Since dissatisfaction was more prevalent in 1973, correlations were made between the rapid expansion of aspirations/desires and the rising levels of income among the moderately comfortable and between dissatisfaction with government/politics among lower level families and income.

About 40% of the respondents were retired or disabled, and the majority were: female; over 50 years old; lacking a completed high school education; and low skilled workers. Results indicated that of those who responded to the question about fears/worries, 37.5% said they had none; blacks averaged 1.28 (fears/worries) per person; and whites averaged 1 each. Although the rank order was different for blacks and whites, the fears/worries cited most frequently were in the economics, health, and children categories. Of those responding to the  wishes/hopes question, 17.9% stated that they had none; blacks averaged 1.66 wishes/hopes per person; and whites averaged 1.15 each. The wishes/hopes most frequently cited were in the areas of economics, health, housing, and children. Comparison of the fears/worries category with the wishes/hopes category revealed a significant similarity. Although the Mississippi quality of life as measured by socioeconomic indicators had improved between 1960 and 1970, the responses of both groups indicated preoccupation with the lower level needs on a need hierarchy.

Applying the Gamma measure of association, the completed interview schedules of 110 Mississippi (Kemper County) household heads (36 white and 74 black) and their adult children (218 black and 139 white) were analyzed. In the first part of the analysis, the high, moderate, and low participation scores of household heads were treated as dependent variables and age, income, education, geographic mobility  potential, home tenure status, and sex as independent variables. In the second part of the analysis, the years of education of adult children and the geographic distance they had moved were treated as dependent variables, while the community participation scores of their parents constituted the independent variable. Results indicated household heads who participated most beyond the nuclear family had children who: showed greater mobility potential; were better educated; and moved greater geographic distances away from home.

People and the opportunity for vocationally, economically, physically, and socially acceptable levels of living constitute the dependent variables in rural development, while the independent variables include job opportunities, housing, schools, health services, etc. The two processes are neither mutually exclusive nor identical; consequently, strategies for promoting either have implications for both. It is the singular role of the modern land grant institution to expand, accumulate, synthesize, organize, and  extend its wealth of knowledge as widely as its resources will permit; therefore, these institutions should address the business of rural development. To remain effective forces in the instrumentation of positive change, the land grant institutions must virtually maintain a constant state of innovativeness and must embrace the concepts of accountability and public mission.

        "description":"When undertaking the tasks of change and planning in a rural area, educational management must consider the interrelated variables of what, why, when, how, where, who, and how well re: any given change. The goals and objectives (what and why) in a rural system are greatly influenced by the community's climate of opinion, economic condition, ethnic/cultural character, and political orientation. When determining the specificity of the \"when\" to \"how well\" process (planning/timing; process strategies; organization/structure; roles/tasks; and evaluation/feedback), every consideration must be given to the human and natural resources available. The questions of how and where are extremely difficult, for the change agent in a rural school system often has little control over the  problems of size, space, physical plant, time, personnel, and resources. The most important change process commodity is time, for if the change agent does not provide sufficient time to organize, plan, develop, implement, evaluate, and revise a program, it cannot gain a broad based support and without support will lack stability and fail. Given the closeness of a small rural community, a successful change agent must engage in the kind of direct involvement that leads to adoption, vested interest, commitment, internalization, and ultimately intrinsic motivation.

Among the major points made are: (1) the tax structure is such that corporations can derive investment subsidies without benefiting the community, for they can locate in an area without hiring local people, circumvent local tax laws, and delay tax payments; (2) property taxes are hardest on the local home owner, because the property tax is regressive and does not cover intangibles; (3) programs for rural expansion,  recreation developments, and second home takeover result in loss of agricultural lands, inflated prices, and adverse environmental effects; (4) the capital gains tax encourages reckless land use planning by putting a premium upon assets held for a minimum time; (5) agricultural subsidies perpetuate income inequities, for non-farmers in large income brackets find it profitable to farm at a loss so as to gain a tax shelter, thereby presenting unfair competition to farmers farming for a living; (6) research has been technologically, rather than people, oriented and has contributed to the displacement of human beings.

Basic aspects of the social marketing process include: (1) product policy; (2) channels of distribution; (3) pricing (perceived price vs quality and quantity of services); and (4) communications (between city managers and citizen consumers). Social marketing research can provide the community with: survey results and guidelines for resource allocations; citizen feedback in the form of educational materials which affect attitudinal and/or use changes; and population identification and characterization. Among the techniques which can be adapted to the social marketing research process are: (1)  community inventory (citizen assessment of local conditions via a checklist); (2) reconnaisance approach (overview information derived from key citizens/groups via small samples); (3) delphi or group diagnosis (interviews with a small but select group of individuals); (4) macrostructural models (analysis of large amounts of data on social, political, and economic institutions); (5) opinion or attitude surveys (community needs determined via public opinion surveys). An exemplary marketing approach is now operative in Yuba City, California where traditional approaches to community development have been recast into a total system. (JC)",

Specifically, the following are presented via tabular and narrative analysis: (1) general population trends in Alaska from 1740-1960 (Native and non-Native); (2) significant Native population movement within regions (Southeast, Southcentral, Southwest, Interior, and Northwest Alaska) for 1950, 1960, and 1970 and by average annual rate of change between 1950-60 and 1960-70; (3) comparison of 1950 census of Native population with 1960 and a vital statistics projection based upon the 1950 and 1960 censuses; (4) comparison of 1960 census  of Native population and other estimates; (5) estimated total Native population and vital statistics (1950-70) for each of Alaska's five regions; and (6) Native population projections by regions for 1970-85. Emphasizing the discrepancy between past official census counts and major demographic changes such as migration, this report indicates: a Native population decline in all but the Southcentral region, though an overall population growth; differing growth rates in the different regions; greater geographic mobility; increased Native urbanization; and a high probability of error and undercounting in the official reports.

Numerous topics discussed at the conference include: noise-induced hearing loss; community response; and sleep disturbance due to noise. The paper presented here concerns noise and its effect on the hearing of speech. In this research, the author reports that the speech interference level  depends upon a number of varying factors.

An engineering Task Force on Energy was appointed to provide an informed assessment of the realistic strategies that could be initiated if the United States chose to become as independent as possible of foreign sources by 1985, based on technology now known or applicable by that date. This publication presents the analysis, findings, and conclusions of that task force. The task force concludes that the achievement of energy self-sufficiency in one decade would require enormous efforts including voluntary reduction of energy consumption and development of available fuel  resources. Central to this report are the roles of government, industry, and the public in advancing a comprehensive energy program in the next decade. Specific considerations discussed in the report include supply and demand, conservation potentials, oil and gas, shale oil, coal supply, and electricity prospects, program constraints and responsibilities beyond 1985.

The teacher's role in this activity is to help the students express what they observe, experience, and question. Methods of study and concepts for emphasis are included in this publication. A major portion of the booklet is devoted to the student task forms. Each task is based on one of the Strands concepts of the National Park Service's Environmental Education Program: variety and similarity; patterns; interaction and interdependence; continuity and change; and evolution and adaptation. Three additional tasks concern problem focus. In a final section to the teacher, there are behavior objectives associated with the activity and an illustration of the  data-theory cycle. (MA)",

The objectives of the evaluation program were twofold. First, to develop and validate evaluative instruments which would measure the impact of the environmental curriculum materials on students. Both cognitive and affective instruments were developed corresponding to the levels of the curriculum design. Second, to measure the degree of impact the environmental curriculum materials had on students from the twelve school districts involved in the program. This report discusses the degree to which these objectives were successfully attained. The evaluative instruments, data, and data analysis are presented for each level. The evaluation  results indicate that the total curriculum package for grades K-12 does provide the educator with a program with the potential of having a significant impact. (BT)",

Open-ended (5 step), traditional (10 step), and systematic (15 step) strategies were developed based on a national survey of design methodologists. Each strategy was applied by three subjects working independently in three 8-hour test sessions to provide designs for a faculty office, campus snack bar, and departmental conference room. Analysis of variance indicated significant differences existed for problems and for subjects within strategy groups. Some significant strategy effects were found over all three problems (8 measures), on individual problems (16 measures), and in strategy-problem interactions (24 measures). The 5-step  strategy required a large amount of time, using large quantities of information minimally applied; the 10-step strategy concentrated on a detailed problem development with a low use of conceptual information; and the 15-step strategy operated more efficiently overall, producing nonsignificantly, but apparently, better solutions. Interaction results suggested that the 5-step strategy reacted similarly to all three problems; the 10-step strategy became more efficient over the three sessions and the 15-step strategy demonstrated sensitivity to problem differences. Implications for design methods and research are discussed. (Author/BT)",

The idea of trade studies is emphasized as part of the Design Process. The skills and capabilities necessary for such are enumerated and described. A survey summarizes the engineering curriculum requirements of 70 programs at 20 universities. It was shown that trade studies are consciously or intuitively used at all levels and in all fields of engineering. The uniqueness of Systems Engineering is  stated to be based on methodology rather than science, industrial need, or devices. A proposed non-credit course is briefly described. (EB)",

Three aspects of the study are reviewed, and one of them is analyzed in depth. The latter compares the perceptions of 2,600 freshmen while still in engineering to their status as sophomores. The categories of academic status are: (1) remained in engineering, (2) transferred into another major, (3) voluntary withdrew from school, and (4) involuntarily withdrew (dropped). The responses to an 88-item questionnaire supplied the data. T-tests, comparison of item means within categories by correlation coefficients, and discriminant function analysis used to see which items best separated students into academic status categories were used for analysis.  Motivation, commitment to engineering, and strong high school records were shown to be indices of persistors in engineering. The self-image of persistors is shown to be stronger than those who leave. Differences in college entrance examination scores were not significant factors. (Author/EB)",

Changes in demographic and population data in both countries during this century are examined and compared. Differences in policies and organization of scientific enterprises are also examined and used in comparing the participation of women in scientific and professional occupations in the two countries. Results of the analysis indicate that over the last 30 years, Russian women have been educated and have achieved all but the highest offices equally with men. The authors observe that use of women's capacities is essential to the Soviet economy, and that if any change in women's status should be expected in the USSR, it will be one of declining need for  women in the work force. By contrast, the status of women in the United States is changing from one in which their talents have been untapped or underdeveloped. It is conjectured that societal changes in the United States will cause an increase in the proportion of women in the professions. (SD)",

        "description":"Nine predictor measures available from student files were used in classifying seventh- and eighth-grade students in mathematics classes into one of three or four levels of instruction in the following year. These measures were scores on tests of language intelligence, nonlanguage intelligence, general intelligence, reading vocabulary, reading comprehension, arithmetic concepts, arithmetic applications, and teacher recommendation. At the end of the year, teachers were asked to judge the appropriateness of students placement. The sample consisted of 505 students from a large suburban junior high school in the southeast. A quadratic multivariate classification rule was used for both internal and external analyses. Internal discriminatory power was high; external power dropped for  across-groups classification but not appreciably for separate large groups. One predictor measure, based on teacher recommendation, proved to be about as accurate as all nine, in an external sense. (Author/SD)",

A ten-item questionnaire was prepared with three alternatives for each item; one alternative presented the ESS philosophy; another, the SCIS philosophy; the third described a more structured but commonly used approach. Teachers and curriculum consultants in three institutes completed this questionnaire, both at the beginning and at the end of each institute. Results showed that participants tended to  select the ESS philosophy at the end of the institutes. (MH)",

The study involved three teachers and 138 eighth-grade Regents students from six intact classes. Each teacher taught one section using specific behavioral objectives and one using nonspecific objectives. In both treatments, objective statements were presented prior to the instruction of the given unit. A nonrandomized control group, preposttest design was used. Pretest scores showed no significant differences between classes. Two-way analyses of variance of the posttest generated F-values that were not significant for the teacher and interaction source of variance. The treatment  effects were significant (p<.05). Higher means were obtained by the groups provided with the specific behavior objectives. A post-hoc questionnaire indicated student perception of the use of behavioral objectives as being helpful generally, helpful in achieving higher grades, and helpful in providing guidance through the unit.

Four spatial tests (embedded figures, serial integration, coordination of viewpoints, and rotation and development of surfaces) were used to measure spatial ability; sex and mathematics achievement, as measured by the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, were determined from school records. Data for the 90 subjects were submitted to four three factor (grade x sex x mathematics achievement) analyses of variance. All analyses yielded results indicating a relationship between spatial and mathematical ability. For two of the tests, sex differences favoring males were revealed. (SD)",

This activity investigates the proposed construction of a dam. It employs a simulation technique in which students debate the conflicts that may evolve between groups with differing goals. To provide background information and to set the scene for the simulation, two short newspaper articles discuss crop yield increase due to irrigation and land value increases. A letter to the editor and an article opposing the building of the dam are also included. Eleven roles are presented for various special and nonspecial interest group members of the community who will be affected favorably or adversely by the building of the dam. These  include farmers, representatives from a coal burning electric plant and land speculators, and a fisherman. Each role discusses the position of one person toward building a dam and offers reasons for holding those positions. The issues are debated among the various interest groups and culminate in a special hearing. An environmental impact statement and a fact sheet, describing such things as the cost and advantages of the dam, are presented. A map shows dam construction. (Author/DB)",

The simulation investigates land-use conflict between the government and the Seneca Indian nation. Given data about a proposed dam project which would destroy an Indian reservation but protect recreation areas, railroad lines, and roads from flooding, students play roles of Indian leaders, senators, journalists, and concerned citizens. The objectives of the exercise are to help students become aware of the complexities involved in land-use conflicts and to comprehend that the solutions are not always acceptable to all. In an inductive learning process, students read newspapers, listen to broadcasts, study maps, discuss their  positions with other groups, and role-play. A debriefing, the key to the success in the simulation, follows the activity. The debriefing is designed to clarify for students the fact that the game's value is not in the resulting decision about construction of the dam but rather is in the various skills developed, attitudes involved, learning processes used, and content learned from the game. Detailed descriptions are given for each of the four to six class periods that are needed to complete the activity. Included are instructions, roles, and quotes from Indian leaders, senators, journalists, and concerned citizens. (DB)",

Specifically, students are involved in the process of deciding on plant location for industrial development. A steel company has decided to build a new integrated steel mill at one of five port cities on the Arkansas River. It contacts five industrial location-analyst companies. Each industrial location analyst prepares a written and oral report containing a discussion of reasons for locating the new steel plant in each of the five port  cities. Additionally, the report specifies one of these cities as its locational choice and gives reasons for choosing the particular city. The report is submitted to the executive board of the steel company which studies the report and awards a contract to one of the five industrial location companies. Game roles consist of the executive board of the steel company, industrial location-analyst company, and planners. Students organize groups, do research, prepare and deliver reports, role-play awarding contracts, and discuss their decisions. A map of the Arkansas River Basin Project is provided. (DB)",

The activity is a simulation which involves 15 to 25 students in making decisions about the best use of an inner city tract of land. The developers recommend that the game extend over at least three class periods, including a preparation phase, a role-playing phase, and a discussion phase. On the first day students read newspaper clippings, a scenario description, and a City Planning Commission Hearing Worksheet and study a map of the area. Role cards, favor cards, and bias cards are then distributed. There are three major sets of roles: planning commissioners, city-wide roles, and local community roles. On the second day the  simulation begins with a hearing before the planning commission. Three city agencies proposing development plans--the public housing authority, the parks and recreation department, and a private land developer--present arguments to support their choices. When each has finished his presentation, the commission members may ask questions about the proposal. Local citizens from diverse social strata then testify, arguing for or against the various proposals. On the last day the planning commission announces its decision and the teacher leads a debriefing discussion. All materials needed for the simulation are provided. (Author/DB)",

In the activities students develop map skills by learning about and using nautical charts. The first activity involves students in using parallel rulers and a compass rose to find their bearings. Their ship, Prince Edward, lies in an anchorage. They must take a bearing of eight other ships and record these bearings in the deck log. In the second activity students use dividers and the latitude scale to measure distance. During the class project they lay out courses to steer and distances to run to bring their ship from one designated position to another. In the third activity students learn to interpret the common symbols found  on a nautical chart by responding to discussion questions. Activity four is a simulation exercise in which students apply the skills learned and the knowledge gained in the first three exercises by using a nautical chart to move their ship from Passage Island to Thunder Bay. Brief explanations, diagrams, maps, symbol definitions, and a glossary of terms are provided. (Author/DB)",

The activity investigates resource management and economics. It employs the student-activity approach to inquiry learning by using group work, simulations, and team research reports. Given data about the cultural and natural resources of the Netherlands, students make observations, generalizations, and intelligent decisions about foreign ownership, pollution, resource management, and land use allocations for the future. The unit is arranged into four activities. Activity one, introducing the unit, offers a &quot;word association&quot; technique to the regional study. Students are given a list of words, such as Europort and Polder, to identify  and explain. Then they refer to a map to identify the places and relationships to the Netherlands. In activity two, students view slides and then write a script to explain ideas which illustrate factors of resource management in the Netherlands. Activity three engages students in a research project investigating natural and cultural resources. For example, students might gather data to support a hypothesis that the Netherlands has made a vast contribution to the cultural heritage of Europe. The last activity centers around map analysis. Students identify the conflicts between urbanization and land use and examine resource management techniques as practiced by the Dutch. Maps, statistics, vocabulary, and detailed data sheets are provided. (Author/DB)",

The activity investigates the role of story telling as illustrative of human values and as an appropriate medium for environmental education. The author identifies a need for individuals to know who they are in relation to their environment, and he recommends reflective inquiry on the many answers discovered by societies and individuals. Thus, myth, biography, autobiography, and religious-philosophical literature are seen to be useful in communicating a world view and sets of values and in developing personal awareness and empathy in the reader. Eighteen \"self-revealing and clarifying activities\" are suggested for students to put  themselves in touch with their environment. Among them are fantasies about the life of inanimate objects and memories of past events in one's own life. A final exercise involves evaluating eight life-styles and rank-ordering them by preference. (Author/DB)",

Discussion focuses on the definition of the social studies and the role of knowledge and ways of knowing in the social studies. In contrast to the social sciences, the social studies are designed primarily for instructional purposes. They include the substantive portions of human behavior and procedural modes that have been selected and adapted for use in schools and other instructional situations. Also, the process by which a social studies class deals with subject matter is part of the social studies. The internationalization of social studies is due to a common knowledge base accepted globally by all social scientists. Because the social studies are in the center of a constant quest for  verifiable knowledge as their content, it is noted that verification requires meeting certain condition of evidence and truth. This process of verification has been brought into the classroom through the use of an inductive method of inquiry. These epistemological considerations are relevant beyond the classroom, though, because they illustrate the development of a common cultural element in the emerging global society. The paper concludes that students should become aware of the common intellectual and affective bonds that unite them to their academic and social brothers throughout the world. (Author/ND)",

Three questions are discussed: how should international education be defined, what contributions should and can social studies make to international education, and what types of curriculum are needed to enhance the contribution. According to Unesco's 1974 recommendation on International Education, international education should be viewed as education for responsible citizen involvement and effective participation in global society. It is believed that social studies should contribute to students' international education in developing  students' capacities to perceive and understand their involvement in global society, make judgments and decisions about world affairs, and exert influence in world affairs. Some specific ways in which social studies can develop these three capacities are indicated. Approaches and instructional materials are noted for several areas of instruction: history, geography and environmental studies, the social and behavioral sciences, and civics. Examples of curriculum materials and programs that illustrate the desired approaches are provided for each area. (Author/ND)",

The curriculum model contains 10 parts which relate man to his self-image, family, community, physical environment, work, play, art, conflicts, aspirations and fears, and gods. The report contains eight sections. Part one briefly describes the project. Part two outlines the curriculum model. Part three, the major section, lists the various components of the curriculum. Part four theoretically describes how the concepts in the curriculum flow from grade to grade. Part five describes several aids used in the curriculum development  process. Part six describes the procedures for developing the study units in each component. Part seven describes the study units developed for the component dealing with man and the physical environment. Finally, part eight is a series of recommendations for implementing the curriculum. (DE)",

Fifty-one geography departments were examined for the period 1960-1974 when 326 hiring transactions occurred. A study of caste ranking in a north Indian village by McKim Marriott and existing surveys of the academic standings of geography departments are used to demonstrate the relationship. Measures of department status, based on the production of Ph.D. graduates and journal articles written by department members, are reviewed and compared. An algorithm is described which ranks Ph.D. graduates according to their job placement in geography departments, and its results are compared with the other measures. Findings indicate  that, as in the case of Indian castes where ranking is determined by food transactions, geography departments belong to a hierarchy based on personnel transactions. (ND)",

The author defines the three forms of education as the scientific, the entropic, and the metaphysical. The scientific form pursues knowledge through rigorous empirical verification, while the metaphysical form pursues increased awareness of self-other-universe relationships by rationality that is modified by intuition or faith. In the entropic form, the most common in American mass education, knowledge is acquired through passive acceptance. Of the three paths toward greater knowledge, only the scientific and metaphysical have an integrative vision of knowledge that is capable of utopian thought. In an age of global crisis, the solving of  worldwide problems requires a more integrated knowledge in which utopian thought provides a valuable moral perspective. A model is included which shows the relationships among the three forms of education and the use of current knowledge, development of new knowledge, and goal orientations toward or away from utopian thought.

A major objective is to emphasize that informal learning can help lay the base for multiculturalism in elementary education. It enables children from different cultural backgrounds to relate to and understand each other through play activities which are comfortable to them. The author presents a brief overview of recent studies in informal and formal systems of learning, a listing of differences between informal learning and formal instruction, illustrations of how informal learning occurs, and a discussion of the four kinds of informal learning that occur during play. He concludes that children's formal and informal education can be improved if parents and educators understand  more about the effects of different kinds of play and the conditions under which such effects occur.

Each of these areas is mixed in population but has a dominant group that provides an ethos within which a stable, supportive social structure exists. This social structure emphasizes communal values above those of narrow hypercompetitive self-interest. The economic organization of the community reinforces this so that the community tends to occupy a sharply defined home turf set off from neighboring areas. However, the very ambience engendered by the community prods outside economic activity to tap and directly siphon off the resources developed by the communal activity, as  in the commercialization of the old Italian neighborhood of Greenwich Village. Similarly, government intervention in the social functions of the community hinders the communal values of the community and develops a sense of narrow-minded individualism within its residents. Theoretical questions on how this situation can be prevented are stressed. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The objective of this research paper is to present evidence showing that sex differences in aggression are universal, but that within limits the differences are also highly susceptible to experiential modification. Aggression is defined as any behavior that intends to hurt a person or a thing, physically or verbally. Investigation was conducted within the framework of three independent methodologies: (1) holocultural research of enculturation, (2) cross-cultural community research of sexual division of labor, and (3) psychological research of phylogenetics within the United States. Children were examined in each component of the research to show aggression-level differences between males and females. The first methodology shows that sex differences in aggression result from  enculturative pressures that differentially encourage greater aggressive behavior in boys than girls. The second research component finds that sex differences in the division of labor produce sex differences in aggression. The third method shows that sex differences in aggression result from a phylogenetically acquired species predisposition for males to behave more aggressively than females, subject to modification by experience and culture learning. Generally, the three theoretically competing methodologies show that males are more aggressive than females on a panspecies level. Research notes and data tables are included in the document.

It specifically identifies individual cognitive and motivational characteristics, preferences, and orientations of children which help to determine their relative benefit from different kinds of educational environments. The procedures and results of the main study are described. Fourth-grade children in 50 classrooms in Montgomery County, Maryland, were administered measures of various outcomes during 1973-74 school year. The impact of various classroom dimensions was investigated as well as the possibility that certain cognitive and motivational characteristics of individual children may interact with classroom dimensions to effect a combined influence on educational outcomes. Specific educational outcomes  including attitudes, values, and self-assessments were selected and measured, and types of classrooms and children were identified. Models from Solomon's framework for \"aptitude-treatment interactions\" were used in the analysis. Conclusions show that children benefit from a setting which requires them to experience a mode of activity that they would otherwise avoid, thus providing them with something which they lack. Implications, data tables, and research instruments are included in the report. (Author/ND)",

        "description":"This study presents quantitative evidence that the inability of blacks to pay for housing in white residential areas in Flint, Michigan is not the major cause of black residential segregation. The following questions are asked: (1) Has black residential segregation in Flint remained at a high level from 1950 to 1970? (2) Has the trend in black residential segregation in Flint been one of continuous increase through time? (3) What census tracts have been the most segregated? (4) What types of racial change have occurred? and (5) How much black residential segregation can be explained by housing costs inequality? In this study a high level of segregation is arbitrarily defined as a racial population change index above 50 percent. That is, Flint has a high level of segregation if  more than half of its population of either race would have to change residence to make it zero percent segregated, or non-segregated. Comparison of spatial distributions of blacks and whites show that a high level of black residential segregation existed in Flint from 1950 to 1970--above 50 percent; there were actual decreases in the level of black residential segregation over the 20 year period; and there have been decreases in certain areas of Flint and increases in others. Correlation and regression analysis demonstrated that 26 percent of the black residential segregation that existed could be explained by housing cost inequality between blacks and whites in 1950; 7 percent in 1960; and 3 percent in 1970.

        "description":"Designed to improve inservice teacher training, this report surveys the kinds of inservice activities needed by social studies teachers in Indiana during 1975. Nearly 40 percent of the state's social studies teachers responded to the questionnaire which focused on how inservice activities should be designed, when they should be held, and what the content or substance should be. The results indicate that regional meetings and self-initiated teacher training kits were the most popular form of inservice training. Release time during the school day was the most popular time period. Classroom techniques, content/materials/current curriculum, and alternative classroom approaches were the most popular subjects for training. Within the category of classroom techniques, student reading  problems, exploring controversial issues, and inquiry techniques were deemed most necessary by the social studies teachers. Current problems and issues were the most popular areas in the subject-content category while phase elective minicourses, independent study, and individualized learning packets were three alternative approaches about which most teachers wanted to know more. Regional differences and grade-level differences in the needs assessment results are also included. (Author/DE)",

Four needs in citizenship education were expressed: philosophies of citizenship and citizenship education, reconceptualizing citizenship education, operation and pedagogy, and information. Several strategies for meeting the expressed needs were discussed, such as publishing and disseminating documents, involving and training teachers, and influencing policy. Recommendations resulting from the conference include convening a national commission on citizenship education; preparing a paper on \"Reconceptualizing Citizenship  Education;\" developing an NCSS position statement on citizenship education; developing curriculum guidelines; developing a national communications network; maintaining a bibliography of resource centers, materials, and people; initiating state and local conferences; funding school-by-school evaluations of citizenship curriculum; and developing inservice training by state departments of education.

Some of the papers were prepared for the Habitat Conference convened in Vancouver by world governments in June 1976. The first paper discusses world action plans for dealing with population and the need for rural development. The second paper, focusing on the U.S. concern for human settlements, points out the need for a high level of citizen participation in meeting population problems. The third paper stresses the difference between the growth of cities in the developed world in the last century, caused primarily by the presence of industrial jobs, and the growth of cities in developing countries  today, caused primarily by the population explosion. In other papers authors discuss the need to help people help themselves; the inability of the local government of Lagos, Nigeria, to keep up with the needs of its increasing population; the active role that cities can play in their own development; community-based services; new government policies in Mexico regarding urban housing, rural development, and responsible parenthood; and the U.S. experience with urbanization and community development following World War II.

The data were obtained as part of a Health Examination Survey conducted from March 1966 to March 1970. Two questionnaires were completed by the youths, one by parents, and one by teachers or school personnel. Each questionnaire investigated different content. The aim of the study was to identify the relationship of selected response distributions to demographic and socioeconomic variables. Five broad content categories comprise the selected items: general health status, health-related items, physical appearance and social patterns, school- and work-related behavior, and use of leisure time. The selected demographic and socioeconomic factors include parents' income, geographic region, urban  or rural community, parents' education, and race. Findings show that there are definite relationships between the background variables and the attitudes and habits of the youths. Most items varied according to the socioeconomic status of the family. Detailed tables, technical notes on methods, definitions of terms, and selected portions from the questionnaires are included in the report. (Author/ND)",

The efficacy of oral urging with praise by the proctor and a point reward for the early completion of units in reducing student procrastination behavior in two PSI psychology courses are examined. In the first experiment 48 students in an introductory PSI psychology course were divided into four groups. Two served as experimental groups which received periodic urging with praise and two as control groups which received no urging. In a second course, 55 students were allowed to earn 10 extra points if they finished a unit on time. However, the practice was stopped in the sixth week and reinstated in the ninth week in order to check  its effect on students' behavior. The results of both experiments indicated that procrastinating behavior can be modified by either of the two behavior-modification techniques. In both experiments the percentage of procrastination was reduced from over 90 percent to between 17 and 30 percent. (Author/DE)",

Following a general discussion of the problems in chapters 1 and 2, chapter 3 investigates the food crisis of 1973 and 1974 and determines that it was the result of many factors occurring in a relatively short time. Affluence, discussed in chapter 4, or the increasing per capita income in the industrial countries, has been blamed for food shortages in the developing countries. Chapter 5 expresses a concern that the world has entered a period of permanently increased food prices due to energy shortages, crop production needs, increased population growth, and rising per capita income. Chapter 6 notes that grain reserves which were accumulated in North America as a result of farm price policies during the 1950s and 1960s  provided stability for world grain prices. The potential for increasing food production in the developing countries is discussed in chapter 7. Chapter 8 presents the possibility of the world population being more adequately fed in a decade, based on its potential to (1) reduce birth rates in the developing countries to improve per capita food supplies, (2) have the political will to give food problems the continuing priority required to increase food production, and (3) recognize that long-term efforts to solve world food problems must be made.

Observations are reported which are pertinent as evidence of the value of such exchanges and for suggesting how China might relate to world affairs in the near future. Specifically examined are Chinese foreign views encountered during the visit and the relevance of the &quot;Chinese model.&quot; The Chinese views of the world that were noted by the group were the world being in turmoil, the possibility for avoiding another world war being excellent, and an inevitable struggle existing among the superpowers for dominance. Expressed  Chinese concerns included nuclear weapons, PRC security, territorial integrity and national unification, and Taiwan. Attitudes about Sino-American relations were negative. The &quot;Chinese model&quot; represents current Chinese society. It covers the liberation of women, utilization of children and elderly in work force, treatment of schistosomiasis, self-reliance of local communities, preventive medicine, and emphasis on Maoist ideology. In general, the group believed that China's model appeared successful and will continue through the near future. (ND)",

At the heart of the Foxfire idea is the conviction that students can learn about their community and humanity only outside the classroom. The magazine is an example of what students can do when they go into their own communities and search for stories. The major portion of the magazine, which is richly illustrated with photographs and sketches, contains summaries of interviews with senior citizens. Mrs. Lucy Marshall, an energetic 70-year old rancher in Yampa, Colorado, talks about raising fish and making quilts; cowboy Lawrence &quot;Doc&quot; Marshall, who came to Colorado in 1898, talks about catching wild  horses and bronc bustin'; 82-year old &quot;mighty-mini-Minnie&quot; recalls fascinating stories about teaching school a long time ago; and Lewis Phillips demonstrates the process of making sauerkraut. Other contents include poems, a recipe for making homemade soap, procedures for sculpturing in bronze, and the history of a small Colorado coal mining community.

        "description":"The author reports on the design and use of an assessment measure to determine the effect of black studies programs on student knowledge of Afro-Americans and their contributions to the American cultural and social system. A review of the literature shows that educators agree on the rationale and general objective of black studies, but that methods of implementation are controversial and that little data is available on student knowledge of black culture and attitudes toward black studies. A two-part cognitive evaluation instrument, The Afro-American Knowledge Inventory (AAKI), was designed and administered to two racially mixed groups of undergraduates, one in black studies and one in a traditional curriculum. Two attitude measures were also given. In terms of mean scores on the  AAKI, it was found that black studies students score higher than students in the traditional curriculum. On the attitude measures, black studies students appear to have more positive attitudes toward studies of black Americans. The author encourages continued assessment of black studies programs in view of the possibility that attitudes toward black Americans may be modified through exposure to the black studies curriculum.

        "description":"This report examines the effect of education on occupation, income, social mobility, and teaching as a profession in Iowa from 1870 to 1930. Particular attention is given to the impact of socioeconomic background upon scholastic achievement, length of schooling, and dropout rates. The Iowa state census manuscripts and the federal census provide the data for the study. Findings indicate that during the early 20th century Iowa lost ground, with respect to high educational attainment, to the more industrial states because rural education showed little improvement from the 19th century. Old-stock population with a Protestant religious background showed more interest in education than new immigrants with a Catholic or Lutheran religious background. Overall, household heads were less  educated than their spouses due to a demand for women teachers. Family background was an important determinant of staying in school, while the children of farmers continued to drop out like their parents had done. For farmers, education made a minor contribution to intergenerational social and economic mobility, since increasing inheritance of wealth was the key determinant of economic status. In urban Iowa, education had a more positive effect on economic achievement. In conclusion, although modern channels of mobility through education existed throughout this period of transition, the traditional opportunities for mobility through property accumulation remained more attractive to the average Iowan.

        "description":"This occasional paper, the first in a \"new\" series, describes the background, activities, and experiences of the Long Island Consortium, a cooperative effort of two-year and four-year colleges committed to organizing a model program of faculty development. The consortium was organized under an initial grant from the Lilly Endowment. In May and June 1974, 20 faculty from the cooperating colleges participated in a workshop which analyzed major problem areas in the teaching of history curricula, composition of the student body, teaching objectives, and teaching approaches. Each participant, working alone or in a team, undertook a specific project during the workshop--curriculum revision, the development of a simulation game, or the preparation of oral history and videotapes.  Follow-up conferences were held throughout the 1974-75 academic year. As a result of participating in the program, many instructors began using new approaches and materials. Far fewer of their students dropped out of the fall semester course than had been the case in the past, and the usually large decline in enrollment in the spring semester did not occur. Moreover, the instructors reported consistently higher class attendance. \"Lessons\" learned from the model program experience are summarized and future plans are described. (Author/RM)",

A major area of concern is why, in our contemporary world, young people are so narrowly and strongly identified with small groups on territory (street gangs for example), social and economic class, and ethnic or racial origin. How these groups can be induced to extend their horizons of identification to the larger power systems of nation-states is discussed.  To help social groups accept each other's differences without hostility, educators must teach tolerance without destroying self-justifying group identifications.

This conversation provides an analysis of the challenge and opportunity facing schools as they provide moral education for society. The task of moral education cannot be defined simply as a task of teaching old values or as one of clarifying existing values. If moral choice suggests that there is a potential for shaping the future or  determining one's own future, then moral education must somehow grapple with both ends and means and with the realities of life in the present. Moral education is meaningful only when it is pursued in a dialectic with science, politics, art, religion, and the other human pursuits. The wide ranging discussion touches on curricula, the role of the teacher as moral agent, and the structure of educational institutions.

The major theme of this booklet is the question of dance as an educational device, with particular emphasis on its potential for knowledge. The principal concern expressed in the dialogue is that educators should talk about, and at least begin to understand, the importance of dance in the schools. Educators should recognize movement as an alternative mode of perception and as an  additional means of gaining knowledge about themselves and the world around them. Dance can sharpen the natural process of muscular awareness, and it is for this reason that dance should be recommended to teachers and to those responsible for education in general.

How do people determine what is valuable? Is it fair to make value judgments? Second, the interview is concerned with an approach to teaching and  the teacher as a learner. How does the teacher encourage creativity? A third significant matter is the thread that ties all men together--humanness. Fourth, the significance of creativity is reiterated throughout the conversation. The need for music educators to make themselves open to new ways of learning and teaching music is stressed.

The self-contained activities were developed so that students can learn on their own with the teacher acting as coordinator and facilitator. Students answer questionnaires on the importance of ethnicity and on attitudes toward ethnic groups, interview their parents, compare what they call  themselves ethnically and religiously with what others call them, and participate in a forced-choice activity that deals with individual and class feelings about ethnically related problems. Students gather data from a social-distance survey to derive hypotheses about relative social distance among the groups and themselves, and they are involved in an activity to check out &quot;subconscious&quot; racism.

Objectives are to help students understand ethnic conflict within a nation in a political context and become aware of the common problems faced by ethnic groups of other nations. Each unit is a tightly sequenced series of activities that require teacher direction. In unit one, students first form two groups and create symbols and ways to maintain their group identity. Then, they play competitive games--tug-of-war and a fast recall quiz game--designed to further accentuate differences and create group conflict. In the third activity the two groups are equally threatened by &quot;outsiders&quot; and given  an opportunity to temporarily transcend their unique group interests. Through a case study students compare their experiences from the first three activities with an experiment conducted in Oklahoma. The culminating activity in unit one is a game which involves students in playing the roles of members of ethnic groups and members of a national legislative body. In the second unit, students consider the implications of population growth for future immigration policy in the United States and sort out and rank, in order of importance, key characteristics of national minorities in the world today.

Rejected are the alternatives of reinforcing the values of American society or permitting free reign to individual development. Educators are reminded that, since their role is to develop as many different human potentials as students manifest, no one dimension of achievement should be canonized. The need for reciprocity in order for individuals to function autonomously is identified as an educational message that must be communicated through teachers' behaviors as well as verbally. The author urges teachers to expose themselves to peer criticism to insure adequate modeling for students. A view of education as an  ongoing experiment is advocated to guard against authoritarian rigidity. However, teachers are cautioned to take student evaluations of relevancy primarily as statements of the students' stage of development rather than of the validity of the course content. Achievement of the above goals is seen to require revision of the roles currently adopted in educational institutions. (GW)",

Emerging from these landmark decisions were policies that had impact on the curricula, the faculty, the staff, and the students of the public school system. Recognizing that 21 years of trial and error in implementing school desegregation has produced limited results, two public school superintendents attempt to dramatize in essay form the need for a continuous concern relative to  curricular and personnel policies that facilitate school desegregation. The emergence of plural diversity enlarged the concerns of educators and brought into focus such assumptions as presented in the essay here on \"Multi-Ethnic Understanding.\" Comments on the AACTE's multicultural education statement are expressed in \"Is the Glass Half-Empty or Half-Filled?\" Finally, the totality of freeing individuals to realize their potential is broached in \"Humanism and the Classroom Teacher.\" (MM)",

        "description":"Practical implications for physical education teachers are drawn after a review of research on perceptual motor training programs for elementary school children. Three categories of theorists are identified: those who emphasize the intellectual involvement of the child in motoric functioning; those who stress development of perceptual motor bases underlying academic achievement; and those who focus on the neurological underpinnings of perceptual motor abilities. Research on the correlation between learning difficulties and motoric dysfunctions is discussed in relation to the types and validity of measuring instruments and the characteristics of subjects. The author examines variables affecting the findings of experimental programs, including theories, characteristics of subjects,  objectives, length and intensity of training, degree of individualization, and incubation effects. Data lead the author to conclude that perceptual motor activities should not replace usual components of physical education programs unless the activities foster traditional objectives of physical fitness and skill development.

Subjects taught at inner-city or middle-class schools in the Dallas metropolitan area. Data were analyzed to show the relationship of teaching success and the following factors within the college and teaching milieu: training mode (field- or campus-based); student teaching and teaching locales; school staff organization; grade level; and the  general impact of the first year of teaching. Findings supported the following generalizations, among others: that teachers trained in the field fared better than those trained on campus; that successful student-teaching experience in the inner city helped first-year teachers; and that experience at primary grade levels elicited more positive effects than teaching of intermediate grades.

However, several activities are assumed to improve the fitness of various areas of the body while concurrently improving cardiovascular endurance by increasing the heart rate for a definite period of time. Probably the best single activity for cardiovascular endurance is jogging at progressively longer distances and time periods. Muscular endurance is obtained through repetitive exercise of selected muscle groups. Arm and shoulder girdle strength and endurance seems to be a traditionally weak area. To increase strength in this area, exercises are needed that will get the children down on the floor  supporting their bodies with their arms. The crab walk and sprinting are good activities for leg development. Another area of particular weakness in young children is the abdomen. Kindergarten children have a difficult time finding their stomach muscles and consequently have trouble doing situps. The easiest thing is to start with leg raises while hanging from a bar, or the V-sit and curl-ups. These are just a few activities that increase overall as well as cardiovascular fitness, but they give a general idea of exercise patterns that effectively increase physical fitness in children. The overall progression in children of any age can be aided through the presentation of challenge questions. (DMT)",

        "description":"A recent survey of physical educators reveals that physical development--especially its more specific parts dealing with physical fitness--is thought to be the least important physical education objectives for grades K-2. Research is available on physical fitness as it relates to (1) incidence of childhood obesity, (2) cardiovascular endurance, (3) differential treatment of the sexes, and (4) participation in contact sports by children. There are strong correlations between weight and activity level and between triceps skinfold thickness and activity. Dieting alone has proved an ineffective approach for the obese, and it results in significant loss of lean body mass in addition to fat. Physical education then should place more emphasis on cardiovascular endurance fitness than on  conventional athletic games. Until recently it was felt that the preadolescent was constitutionally unsuited for activities that put a heavy demand on the cardiovascular system, but pediatric exercise physiologists and coaches have discovered an unusually high potential for performance and training in youngsters. Physical educators have been slow to accept this. Boys tend to be stronger than girls when matched for height at any age, but only minor functional differences exist prior to puberty. It is nearly impossible to determine how much of the advantage boys enjoy is a result of social conditioning. Finally, contact sports for children should not be feared but can offer much to their overall development under proper conditions. (DMT)",

Three themes, or consortium-wide objectives for all consortium activities were then developed: (1) to provide support to institutions in areas of expertise in competency based teacher education; (2) to develop alternative learning experiences for students, teachers, school supervisors, and faculty which follow the competency based teacher education format; and (3) to improve communication and decision-making processes so that useful competency based teacher education practices can be replicated elsewhere. Discussion of program themes led the board to specify activities that could be undertaken to accomplish each program theme.

This approach is illustrated in the Ford Teaching Project, sponsored by the Ford Foundation and based at the Centre for Applied Research in Education at the University of East Anglia, United Kingdom, from 1973-75. The project involved 40 teachers from 12 schools in a program of action research on the problems of implementing inquiry/discovery approaches in the classroom. They were supported by a central team of three: two full-time researchers and a secretary. In addition, two district supervisors were designated  to help support the work of the teachers in their area on a part-time basis. The teachers were grouped in interdisciplinary school teams that were to meet frequently to discuss teaching problems and share ideas about methods of collecting data. Twice a term, arrangements were made for interschool meetings of two - four teams. During the four terms that the project lasted all the teachers were brought together for three, four-day residential conferences. The original research plan presented action-research tasks, roles, methods of data collection, and reporting procedures. A number of problems arose because a majority of the teachers felt they were already using inquiry/discovery methods proficiently. This necessitated the introduction of a self-monitoring concept, which was initiated by a  triangulation method--gathering viewpoints of three groups, students, teachers, and participant-observers. The data was then used by the teachers to clarify, test, and generate theories. (DMT)",

These teachers, along with preservice education students, school building administrators, inservice personnel, and university faculty, helped shape a program that treats preservice and inservice education as distinct but related stages in professional development. The broad concept of a preservice-inservice, school-based program was presented to selected principals in the school region who were in turn asked to invite the participation of interested teachers. A major emphasis in this project has been  for teachers to examine their curriculum and instructional programs and identify specific features they would like to improve or change. After this examination they work with inservice consultants on designing and organizing curriculum and instructional modifications for their classrooms. The goal is to develop small modules or units. The extent to which teachers have been successful in changing their curriculum varies from school to school and from teacher to teacher. Some have planned, organized, and used curriculum modules; some have incorporated different activities and materials into their instruction; others have simply tried out certain ideas and methods, such as questioning strategies and brainstorming techniques. There has been little effort so far to examine the impact of  curriculum changes on children. (DMT)",

From the experience of Illinois State University's competency based teacher education program, various advantages and problems of  this model in instruction have been uncovered in the following areas: (1) Competency based programs are built around meaningful instructional objectives that are behaviorally stated so that they can be observed or measured in terms of student learning rather than teacher activity; (2) Competency based instruction is criterion referenced rather than norm referenced so there is no need for grades; (3) Students can receive immediate feedback concerning their progress in reaching the desired proficiency in each teaching skill; (4) Competency based instruction is multi-media oriented and is one of the most flexible models of teacher education; (5) Students are actively involved in the learning activities.

The Study Team interpreted this mandate to mean demonstrate the salient features in an evolving, interactive, teacher training event so that the features could be adapted for use in other teacher training situations. By identifying procedures that captured the patterns of interactions, the reality of the event being examined was reflected. The team rejected standard methodologies as not useful because they fail to  provide adequate information about the dynamics of the event and because too little useful information is uncovered that could be used in replicating features of the event.

Both at the federal and state levels, lawmakers have enacted legislation that has had direct effects upon students and instructional curricula. Federally sponsored programs have had great impact upon curriculum content, instructional materials, and student evaluation. There is also no discounting or minimizing the effect(s) of the courts--federal, state, and local--regarding the present-day character of schools and their curricula. In most states, the departments of education hold sway over teacher training and certification, content of instruction, and pupil attendance, among other things. School boards are empowered with certain  legal authority and are charged with overseeing the operation of local level schools. Community pressure groups also affect curriculum decision-making as do special interest groups both within and without the community setting. Finally, since education is a multi-million dollar business, the private enterprise sector of our society determines the content and quality of instruction received by children. (RC)",

        "description":"The Demonstration and Research Center for Early Education (DARCEE) grew out of the Early Training Project (EPT) a pioneer early childhood intervention study designed to prevent the progressive educational retardation that is often characteristic of &quot;disadvantaged&quot; children. The ETP began its work in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in 1962. The initial focus and continuing theme of DARCEE is to work with young children, especially those from low income homes, in an effort to foster and develop attitudes and skills that will support future learning. DARCEE assumes the child learns from the total impact of his environment, that from the beginning of his life he is sensitive and reactive to the external world. Based upon information the child gains from investigations of his environment and  from interaction with others, the child develops attitudes, skills, and knowledge that could assist him in further learning. DARCEE feels that when there is careful planning so that children have predictable environments in which they feel secure, where events are planned so that they are interrelated and experience builds upon experience, and where teachers react positively to demonstrations of new skills, optimal learning occurs. DARCEE has developed a description of its program characteristics which lead to the accomplishment of DARCEE's skill and attitude objectives. Program areas include: grouping; organization and use of time; physical setting; teacher role; teacher preparation; reinforcement techniques; skill development; materials use and selection; attitude development; and  parent involvement. Three kinds of skills necessary for a DARCEE teacher are: (1) skills to teach effectively towards DARCEE skill and attitude objectives; (2) skills to teach effectively as part of a team; and (3) communicative skills to explain the purpose of the DARCEE program to parents, community leaders, and school policy makers.

        "description":"This paper schematizes large-scale educational research and development (R&D) as a progression of operations and presents a perspective for evaluating those operations and their outputs. Most perspectives thus far presented for evaluation of educational R&D are oriented to small-scale operations and modest products. Prevailing views of formative and summative evaluation, as developed by Scriven, are analyzed in terms of the state of the art for use of social indicators in isolating first-order and higher-order program effects. Implications of the perspective for educational policy, R&D, and the full-service school are presented. Major dimensions of an evaluation perspective are examined along with organizational and individual roles in improving productivity. Some of the chapters  characterize the complex educational product and cause-effect progressions pertinent to complex evaluations. It is concluded that independent evaluation seems required for all evaluations conducted for a sponsor. The best interest of a development organization will be served by independent evaluators working under contract. There will not be any other kind of evaluation of higher-order effects until a system of social indicators is developed, evaluated, and appropriately institutionalized. (SK)",

        "description":"The Southwest Regional Laboratory for Educational Research and Development (SWRL) is dedicated to the belief that individual differences among students do not stand in the way of universal quality instructional achievement in the nation's schools. Important steps towards the condition of universal instructionalized achievement are: (1) the explication of instructional proficiencies; (2) the frequent assessment of instructional proficiencies; and (3) the widespread sharing of the findings of proficiency assessment. SWRL believes that the development of the means to provide the availability of proficency assessment information is currently possible although as of yet a base of such information does not exist. Through research and development, formulated here as Achievement  Monitoring in Schools (AIMS), SWRL has designed a program of instructionalized achievement monitoring that is cost-beneficial and time-and-resource feasible. AIMS can be justified through study of the following issues: (1) the issue of educational equity and the bases for insuring equitable education; (2) the issue concerning conservation of a teacher's instructional resources when sufficiently frequent proficiency occurs in a classroom equipped to accommodate AIMS; and (3) the issue of cost-attractive hardware and hardware-referenced inputs and outputs that are consonant with the objectives of achievement monitoring. The greatest obstacle to effective and equitable education are the absence of a comprehensive proficiency framework against which instructional status and progress can be  assessed, and the absence of a system insuring that pertinent data be collected, retained, and shared. The AIMS program was conceived to provide this framework and data bank. (MM)",

Considerations included in a complete instructional system are: (1) outcomes; (2) assessment; (3) user experience data; (4) materials; (5) training; (6) reporting; (7) time and costs. The program must specify outcomes stating what the learners will be able to do as a result of instruction. When the outcomes are clearly stated, educators can validly assess whether a program is potentially worthwhile and appropriate for a particular population of students. Measures should be included that frequently assess pupil progress, and assessment materials should be directly keyed to a  clearly defined set of outcomes. Empirical data regarding the development of an instructional program must not be overlooked. Data must be presented to indicate that outcomes have been consistently attained during previous use of the program in a wide range of situations and that learners and teachers have expressed satisfaction with the system. Included must be instructional and supplemental materials and activities that are keyed directly to the expected program outcomes and assessment materials. Materials for training teachers and other school personnel and for monitoring program performance are necessary. Time and cost effectiveness are the final considerations. (DMT)",

        "description":"In 1970, the U.S. Office of Education, through the Bureau of Educational Personnel Development, initiated a program promoting community-school collaboration, which was called the Urban/Rural School Development Program. Designed to train educational personnel at a small number of schools in low-income communities characterized by student underachievement, it is now active at 26 sites. The purpose of this effort was to demonstrate that federal funds could strengthen the educational resources of the total school community through a joint effort between the school staff and the community. This paper is a descriptive and evaluative report of the first three years of the program. It describes the factors involved in developing the organizational structures needed for community-school  collaboration, the variety of patterns that emerged at the sites, and the degree of effectiveness achieved. Chapter two gives a design for the survey and presents a general overview of the sites. The next chapter deals with representation and parity in the school/community councils, while chapter four discusses community involvement. Teacher training activities related to the program are discussed in chapter five. It was concluded that parity in community involvement between the school and its community is a viable and effective possibility. The installation of urban/rural programs did restructure the relationship between the community and the school. The participation of community members had a definite effect on the nature of the training programs developed locally. The School/Community  Council has become a workable administrative unit. This program seems to allow community members to have a channel to develop community education and participation. Appendices give data on participating schools, present the survey questionnaires, and give personal profiles on the council chairpersons and school development team managers. (SK)",

        "description":"Educational research and development (educational R&D), more recently called educational knowledge production and utilization, has become a prominent feature of the educational scene with many of its salient characteristics having taken shape during the last ten years. The federal role in educational R&D began in 1867 with the formation of the National Department of Education. The passage of the Cooperative Research Act of 1954, the National Defense Education Act of 1958, and the creation of the National Institute of Education in 1972 expressed federal concern for stepping up efforts to improve the educational system. Although funds have decreased during the last decade, educational R&D laboratories and centers have prospered. One benefit gained recently from educational R&D is  that the monolithic structure of the school system is giving way to a greater recognintion of differences among individuals. In general, the effects of educational R&D upon educational practice have been disappointing because the effort has been too small, the trained researchers too few, and the resources too limited. An 11-point agenda for educational R&D during the next decade includes: (1) building a constituency; (2) broadening the collegial base; (3) strengthening all parts of the educational R&D enterprise; (4) recognizing that education is a total system; (5) shifting emphasis from correlational studies and single-variable experimental studies to more complex experimental studies, interventions, and clinical analyses; (6) making more modest claims; (7) building a better national  educational R&D agenda; (8) effectively advancing the interdisciplinary claims of educational R&D; (9) strengthening university participation in educational R&D; (10) increasing attention to cost/benefit consideration; (11) reestablishing the upward trend of expenditures for educational R&D.

Two-hundred and ninety-three of the students had either participated or planned to participate in the cooperative education program. The remaining 163 students had neither participated nor planned to participate in the program. These students served as a control group. The output data indicates: (1) that cooperative education students in contrast to others perceive greater personal change since entering college, particularly in the area of career development; (2) there is a consistent and clear trend within  the cooperative education group to perceive greater personal change as they progress; (3) the most important agent of change for both groups was perceived to be general maturity, with work experience becoming increasingly important for the upperclass cooperative education student; (4) as freshmen, more cooperative students were unsure of their career goals; (5) cooperative students put a high priority on career establishment and, by contrast, the noncooperative students put a high priority on personal well-being; (6) the attitudes of both samples of students towards people is generally positive; and (7) although the social and humanistic attitudes of the cooperative students are similar to their noncooperative peers they evidence more conservative, cautious, and prudent judgment. The  overall evidence is that the cooperative work experience has a considerable impact upon student development during the college years, particularly in the area of career development.

An examination of 50 institutional codes and bylaws reveals rather general statements with respect to specific duties of management professionals. Only five of 24 institutions surveyed had developed detailed position guides internally. The dean of a college of education must provide leadership pertaining to administration of organizational detail and leadership that is concerned with the more abstract phases of human engineering. Departments are the basic units of the administrative structure, and have the power to initiate most actions affecting the operations of the institution. Department chairmen are middle-management personnel and should be appointed with  some form of faculty consultation. Often they are chosen in one or more of the following ways: direct appointment by the president, vice president, or dean upon consultation with the faculty; faculty nomination; or election. The relationship between the dean and his department chairmen depends upon personal and operational factors. Both positions are basically responsible for the same things at different levels of decision-making. Certain basic competencies are necessary for successful higher education administrators: (1) understanding the nature and setting for administration in higher education; (2) decision-making and communication; (3) understanding the practice of administration.

        "author":["Masters, James S."],
        "description":"This paper suggests and examines four ways in which the &quot;Taxonomy of Educational Objectives&quot; needs reforming. When a teacher assumes that all educational objectives belong to one of this taxonomy's three categories--cognitive, affective, or psychomotor--then trying to fit certain important kinds of objectives into the taxonomy becomes very puzzling; for example, social and problem-solving skills. These skills are of major importance in school learning situations but are not included in the taxonomy in any systematic way. They should be arranged so that the basic social awarenesses and kinds of responses are made clear. Suggestions should be presented for developing and evaluating these skills so that teachers can have a guide for organizing classroom activities aimed at  developing these skills. If the taxonomy included a separate domain of problem-solving skills, clearly indicating their interrelationships in the overall process of problem-solving, then their importance in the eyes of curriculum workers and teachers would be greatly heightened. The psychomotor domain of the taxonomy needs to be completed. This domain should include motor and manipulatory skills building upon the basic awareness and responses essential to human learning. There is also a need for an adequate underpinning of basic awareness in all domains of educational objectives. This should be corrected by definitely including awareness as the first level of the cognitive domain. The fourth area of difficulty in dealing with the taxonomy is the lack of precision and thoroughness in  analyzing the affective domain. The usefulness of the taxonomy could be enhanced by the inclusion of subtaxonomies both of emotional and imaginal skills. (DMT)",

The methodology took the form of a mail questionnaire to subjects who were practicing teachers in primary and secondary schools throughout New South Wales. The format included six main sections: (1) the role of the teacher's self-image; (2) a list of problems raised by teachers to be graded on a scale ranging from &quot;highly important&quot; to &quot;little or no importance&quot;; (3) social background of the teacher and his family; (4) retrospective assessment of teacher training; (5) recommendations by the  teachers for improving the profession; and (6) some personal details of the respondent. A working hypothesis for this study might have been stated as &quot;an attempt to reveal discernible factors which are responsible for the low morale of the teaching profession as evidenced by (a) the high level of political activity, and (b) a general dissatisfaction with present conditions.&quot; In this context, morale concerns mental or emotional attitudes of teachers towards components of their job. It takes into account the atmosphere in which they work and their individual orientation towards their tasks. It is essentially a reflection of how one feels about things and therefore is a matter of subjective perception. It can usually be increased by favorably modifying any condition that will increase job  satisfaction. (MM)",

Educationally healthy individuals cannot live in isolation from some subgroup and the larger society, nor can a healthy larger society be isolated from different subgroups which accept some basic value orientations and challenge others. These basic assumptions about communal human needs can be related to educational goals. Three levels of learning are required for the individual to fit into society: (a) values allowing participation in some subgroup, (b) values allowing participation in the larger society, and (c) individual development which enhances the total range of human potentialities. These learning levels are evaluated in terms of  the following criteria: (a) indications of what transpired during the acts of teaching and learning, (b) examination of outcomes, (c) actual applications of knowledge, and (d) indirect measures when it can be inferred that learning did or will transpire. To assess indicators and norms of individual educational health, a manageable survey instrument could measure the following factors: (a) student sense of control over the environment, (b) relevance of the school system to a particular subgroup, and (c) growth that does not make any direct or clear contribution to the social order.

        "description":"What little we know about relationships between specific classroom behavior of teachers and relevant pupil outcomes has been obtained almost entirely from coreelational studies. Yet if we are ever to apply knowledge in this area to teacher education, we must carry out experimental studies in which teachers are trained to emit specific behaviors that are found to be related to pupil outcomes. In order to evaluate how specific changes in teacher behavior can bring about changes in related pupil outcomes, Utah State University created three sets of protocol modules employed as experimental treatments. Through these studies, it was determined that relationships between specific teacher behaviors and pupil outcomes tend to be higher in correlational studies than in experimental  studies. Four variables seem to be the cause of this difference. First, general teaching competence operates more strongly in correlational studies and probably leads to spuriously high correlations between specific teacher behaviors and pupil outcomes. Second, the length of pupil exposure to teaching behaviors studied may be longer in correlational studies than in experimental studies. Third, when teachers adopt new behaviors, there is a lag in the development by pupils of appropriate responses to these behaviors. Fourth, when teachers are trained in new behaviors, time is not often allowed to incorporate the skill into teacher performance. (Author/JS)",

The most common and simplest recording procedure advocated is frequency count. Difficulties can arise, however, when attempts are made to compare frequencies from day-to-day. Basically, there are three means of interpreting frequency measures--which method is used depends on what the researcher is interested in. In some cases the data can be left in raw form and communicated to others as frequencies. This can take place only when assignment length, available work time, and assignment difficulty are held constant. Two other methods are percentages and rates. These are used when  assignment length and/or time vary. Percentages provide information on accuracy, and rates can be used when there is an interest in assessing speed of performance.

        "description":"This document reports on a series of studies carried out concerning nonverbal behavior in peer tutoring interactions. The first study examined the encoding (enactment) of nonverbal behavior in a tutoring situation. Results clearly indicated that the tutor's nonverbal behavior was affected by the performance of the tutee. The question of whether or not nonverbal \"leakage\" (failure to hide undesired displays of negative affect) occurs was raised in this study and tested in another. Findings from the second study indicated that tutors encode differentially according to whether or not they are being truthful, and moreover, that other untrained students were capable of decoding such behavior. Because the difference in the tutor's nonverbal behavior in the above situation could have  been caused by the lying itself, or by his/her negative feelings regarding the failing tutee, a third study was performed to determine causality. Results from this study indicated that both factors--deception and a dislike for the tutee--cause negative verbal behavior in the tutor. A fourth study was carried out to determine the tutor's ability to understand the meaning of the nonverbal behavior of a tutee in regard to his/her degree of comprehension. Results revealed that (a) children encode nonverbally the degree of comprehension of material being presented to them, and (b) their nonverbal behavior can be decoded by other children. These studies indicate that nonverbal behavior is, in fact, an important factor in the tutoring situation and must be considered when examining tutoring  interactions. (PB)",

The data were obtained through mailings to project managers, parent organization representatives, and government project monitors of 218 terminated projects funded by the U.S. Office of  Education. Sixty-five percent responded to the mailing by completing the data collection instruments. It was found that different persons associated with educational projects viewed the importance of the criteria of project success in much the same way, in the following order of importance: (a) quality/performance; (b) customer/client satisfaction; (c) spin-off benefits; (d) follow-on work; (e) cost; and (f) schedule.

Attention should be given to the aggregation that scores undergo prior to statistical tests. Two familiar research designs where this is important are a) in two groups/one measure cases, and b) in two groups/pre-post measurement cases. Another problem for researchers develops when incomplete and missing data are encountered for identification codes, as well as for score values. Unless each data record contains all identifying codes, it will be excluded from one or more aggregates and results at different levels will change depending on the data values for those records which are missing identification codes. Observations recorded  on the Individual Cognitive Demand Schedule can be examined as an illustration of the problems with aggregation. Although aggregating the data is generally beneficial in this case, it leaves out considerable evidence about the classrooms. Thus, the value of these data is greatly enhanced by leaving the observations unaggregated. (PB)",

To construct behavioral objectives, the following factors should be considered: (a) outcome; (b) level of achievement, and (c) evaluation conditions. When behavioral objectives are applied at the organizational level, they can be used to predict the accomplishments of a large instructional division. Behavioral objectives at the program level can predict the outcomes of specific mathematics programs within curricular parameters. At the learner or classroom level, objectives usually represent small accomplishments within long-term unit or course goals. The more precise the behavioral objective, the easier it is to evaluate.  Once evaluated, the objective should be modified and restated, if needed, to ensure maximum validity in its reflection of competence attainment. (Author/JC)",

In the United States, there are at least 4,500 programs listed as competency based, yet the procedures now used to accredit teacher education programs do not provide data on program quality, especially as it relates to the capabilities of students completing the program. The move towards Competency Based Teacher Education (CBTE) in New York has been in response to criticism of the area's master's programs and teacher education courses. As accreditation procedures are improved, the focus  for determining a program's potential will center on (a) competencies and attitudes that the student should demonstrate at the completion of the program, (b) evidence that they have been achieved, and (c) contributions made to the teacher education program by the university, school district and the teachers. Serious study has been given in New York State to CBTE, especially through twelve trial projects which were initiated in 1971. These projects deemphasized education courses and concentrated attention on the prospective teacher's ability to bring about predictable accomplishment on the part of students. (JS)",

        "description":"The psychological effects of exercise training are difficult to study in humans, but analogous emotionality changes in animals can be studied using simple measurements employed in emergence and open-field tests. The basis of these tests is that animals that are more emotional are more fearful when placed in a novel situation and will exhibit less exploratory activity. Conversely, less emotional animals will explore a new situation more readily. The emotionality of the following five groups of rats were tested after an eight-week training period: (a) controls or sedentary; (b) runners or treadmill trained; (c) walkers with treadmill exposure; (d) swimmers; and (e) waders. The control rats were judged to be more emotional as indicated by their longer emergence times in the tunnel  test; and their longer latency times, greater number of boluses, and lower total squares in the open-field test. Evidence that chronic physical exertion is able to lower emotionality is shown by the greater number of total squares entered in the open-field by the runners and swimmers as compared to other groups. Animal studies such as these may prove useful for studying changes with exercise, just as they have proven useful in psychological research. (Author/JS)",

Research procedures included television observation, personal observation teams, interviews, and written questionnaires. Analysis of the interview material and written questionnaires showed commitment to the goals of amateur sport--participation, play, and service in a democratic, mutual-benefit organization  for the benefit of players. Observation of actual behavior, however, did not support these beliefs. Aggression, hostility, and other negative behavior was observed on the part of all groups involved. Because of these observations, recommendations were made for changing behavior by modifying the structure of the league. The recommendations included: (a) employing mass media to focus on goals of amateur sports as opposed to goals of professional athletics; (b) dividing players on the basis of age and ability; (c) discontinuing scoring and standing, at least at beginning levels; and (d) evaluating Little League in terms of individual player improvement and number of participants rather than standings, competitive caliber, or success in championships.

It was felt that further studies comparing attitudes and beliefs with behavior would be beneficial. Of particular interest were: (a) whether or not attitudes and beliefs changed due to adjusted organization and administration; (b) what the effect was on technical skill, physical development, and motor learning of children and youth involved in WMH--particularly those in no scoring, no standing leagues; and (c) what the attitudes, beliefs, and behavior were of coaches and parents involved in leagues with standing and playoffs. Evaluation consisted of interviews, written questionnaires, and category sorting of slogans by managers and coaches.  Variables observed in the study included performance on a skills test and a cardiovascular test, maximum ice utilization, and behavior. A generalized summary indicated that there was overwhelming support for emphasis, within the hockey program, on socialization, fun, equal treatment on ice, and other variables generally associated with amateur sport and recreational play. It was also noted that no scoring, no standing leagues did result in reduced aggression and violence. Differences in behavior between participants in WMH and other amateur hockey associations were attributed to changes in organizational structure. Recommendations were provided to WMH, including the expansion of no scoring and no standing leagues to all levels. (PB)",

In phase two observations, available techniques, and management and organizational alternatives were discussed with policy makers. Phase three consisted of a reaudit of the organization in order to evaluate the effects of policy decisions in phase two.

It was also found that the development of perception in these sensory modalities was sometimes deficient. Educators immediately began to devise programs for perceptual-motor training, but ignored the role of the brain and nerviou system in perception. There are many reasons why neurological concepts are not employed in perceptual-motor training. Some of the reasons are that a) great effort is required to acquire concepts from the literature and organize them into a useful theoretical structure; b) it is impossible to assimilate all that is known of brain function, so that any theory cannot be completely correct; c) brain researchers usually deal  with one aspect of the brain, but educators need to know about how the brain functions as a whole; d) brain research is incomplete; e) some of the research is inevitably inaccurate; and f) resultant procedures are not obviously related to the objective. There are two ways to deal with the challenge that brain research offers. The challenge can be ignored, or research can be directed to relating sensation, integration, perception, and motor activity to those neural structures which govern them. (PB)",

The author continues that responsibility for therapy in the area of movement for remediation, and the development of corresponding motor activities, should lie with physical educators. He contends that once physical educators realize what role physical education should play in perceptual-motor development, they need to more fully explain it to parents and other professionals.

Later, she gave preschool children the same types of movement experiences she had given the older children she had tutored. Interest centers, tables, sinks, etc. in her classroom were not arranged for ease of movement and convenience of use, but rather for maximum challenge of body and mind.

The second essay strongly advocates staff development activities and proposes a professional growth model involving three components: attitudes, pedagogical skills, and substantive knowledge. The third paper examines the advisory system, which differs from other supervision theories in that it is predicated upon  the assumption that teachers are concerned about improving their teaching and will do so given the proper support conditions.

In order to determine the self-reported attitudes of teacher education students toward teachers, a pilot-study sample of graduate students reacted to four teacher-types within the context of 36 adjectives. For each adjective, respondents were asked to mark the point on an agree-disagree continuum which best represented their feelings toward statements concerning teachers. This Multiple Teacher Factors Survey (MTFS) indicated that student attitudes toward four teacher-types might be arrayed along dimensions of a) personal warmth, b) intellectual skill, c) academic rigor, and d) instructional submissiveness.  Respondents' attitudes toward the teacher-types were also compared. Findings have implications for teacher educators regarding presentation and sequencing of instructional material, specification of program goals, and validation of program competencies using the parameters of the attitudes which the MTFS measures.

A student completing this program has 66 quarter hours of pass-fail credit and a letter written by a faculty member who has worked with her or him for two years. The purpose of this study was to determine the possible effects of 66 quarter hours of pass-fail credit on UF student acceptance into graduate school. Letters requesting information on acceptance policies were sent to every graduate school of education in the southeastern United States. Fifty-five additional letters were sent to selected graduate schools outside this regional area. Replies were classified into the following categories: a) acceptance likely; b)  acceptance likely (problems expected); c) possible entry; d) possible entry (conditional status); and e) acceptance unlikely. Survey results indicated that most graduate schools would consider the candidate for admission. However, a student who plans to attend a specific graduate school should check the entrance requirements with that institution. (Author/JS)",

Considerations for the cooperating teacher to keep in mind while working toward the development of competent teachers are presented. Chapter two discusses the cooperating teacher's responsibilities, including a) preparing for the student teacher; b) familiarizing the student teacher with the school, procedures, resources, etc.; c) answering commonly asked questions; and d) maintaining student teacher morale. Chapter three discusses various aspects of observation and planning techniques and how the cooperating teacher and student teacher can collaborate on these techniques. Chapter four examines competency-based teacher education  and lists competencies for student teachers. Cahpter five discusses evaluation of the student teacher and lists important items to consider. Chapter six deals with encouraging professional ideals in the student teacher and includes the text of the &quot;Code of Ethics of the Education Profession,&quot; adopted in 1963 by the National Education Association.

A comparison of social and career characteristics of male and female professors of education was carried out to examine whether a basis existed for discrimination by sex. Data for the study were obtained from the National Survey of Higher Education conducted by the Carnegie Commission on the Future of Higher Education and the American Council on Education. Findings pointed to the following: a) discrimination against women in the areas of rank and salary seems more pervasive in universities than in four-year colleges; b) women education professors earn less than their male counterparts at all ranks in both universities and four-year colleges; c) when  highest degree is held constant, men in both universities and four-year colleges are more likely to hold the rank of professor than are women; and d) men generally receive a higher salary than women in cases where salary was examined as a reward for productivity. This study confirmed that rank and salary differentials favored men even when highest degree and productivity were controlled. (Tables of data are included.) (PB)",

This concern is based in part on the Extension's commitment to a &quot;balanced programming&quot; where services are delivered independent of income, race, creed, sex, or location of residence. Subjects were 351 professional and volunteer leaders attending 4-H workshops. Approximately 40 percent of the subjects were male and 60 percent female, with a majority of subjects in the 30-50 age group. Subjects were administered either Form A or Form B of Sedlacek and Brooks' SAS which presents 10 personal and social  situations in which race might be a variable in a reaction to a situation. Form A and B differed only in the insertion of the word &quot;black&quot; in Form B situations. Results indicate that the insertion of &quot;black&quot; significantly influenced negative responses in situations requiring close social contact. Positive responses occurred in situations where blacks performed in a service role. Instructions and situations from the SAS and principal components factor loadings of both forms of the SAS are included. (BJG)",

In addition, the study provides new estimates of alternate form reliability for each of the seven tests, provides estimates of the intercorrelations among the tests, and explores empirically, some methodological questions in test-equating. The tests used are: California Achievement Tests (1970); Comparative Tests of Basic Skills (1968); Iowa Test of Basic Skills (1970); Metropolitan Reading Tests (1970); Sequential Tests of Educational Progress, STEP Series II (1969); SRA Achievement Series (1970); and Stanford Reading Tests (1964).

In the second, the thirty-year history of discussion on the need for a test-equating study and the technical problems inherent in the equating of non-parallel tests are considered. The third section describes the planning of the Anchor Test Study and the results of a feasibility study conducted in 1969. The fourth section is a description of the design of the study and some aspects of its implementation. (Author/RC)",

Information on each of the district measures used in the 1972-73 Michigan Educational Assessment Program is presented in two ways. First, a figure is shown that represents the district's &quot;score&quot; on each measure. For example, the average years of teaching experience, the average instructional expense (in dollars) per pupil, and the average reading score of each district are shown. Then a percentile rank is shown for each measure except the basic skills achievement measures. This percentile rank indicates how each district fared in relation to other districts in the state. Secondly, information about each district's composite basic skills achievement is presented in a  decile distribution which shows the percentage of each district's fourth and seventh grade pupils earning composite achievement scores in each tenth of a statewide ranking of pupil scores. These decile distributions show what percent of each district's pupils fell into each of ten general achievement levels. Statistical terms used in this report are defined in Appendix A; Appendix B contains definitions of the educational assessment measures; Appendix C contains the definitions of the community types used in this report; Appendix D contains a list of the county code numbers used as a part of the identifications of local school districts; and Appendix E contains alternative procedures for interpreting district achievement scores through the use of statewide pupil norms.

A number of programs or components constituted the framework through which this project was to be implemented. Success was to be assessed on the basis of reading and math skills improvement as measured by standardized tests administered at the beginning and the end of the school year. However, inasmuch as the AAP itself required the implementation in the schools of the various components which comprise its structure, an examination of the implementation of these components became a basic aspect of the assessment plan. Two mechanisms  were used to collect data for the assessment of the implementation of the AAP components: (1) the AAP School Inventory, and (2) the On-Site Study. The AAP School Inventory sought information about the status of implementation of the AAP components at various points throughout the school year from principals and teachers. The On-Site Study was conceived as an in-depth examination of the functioning of selected AAP Components in a representative sample of 20 D. C. elementary and junior high schools. Results of these two mechanisms are presented in detail. (Author/RC)",

Although the inadequacies of such linear models of educational research and development have been pointed out previously, these models have been so much a part of R&amp;D thinking that it is useful to point them out again. In addition, the attributes of an interactive model are shown to surpass the linear model and to enhance the description of the R&amp;D process. This model is discussed in the context of the Learning Research and Development Center (LRDC) where interactions take place among basic and applied research, development, evaluation, and dissemination. It is also discussed in conjunction  with the theoretical requirement of John Dewey's theory of valuation which states that the value which people will attribute to a new product or procedure will be a function of how well they think it will satisfy some recognized needs. The interplay of this interaction model and valuation theory is presented. (Author/BJG)",

Number of prior convictions was found to be related to MMPI diagnostic category; significantly more individuals with psychotic profiles had no prior convictions. MMPI category was also related to Interpersonal Maturity Level; those rated lowest in maturity were most likely to show psychotic profiles. In a second study, the MMPI profiles of 571 inmates were classified into seven diagnostic categories.  Group profiles for each of the seven categories are presented.

Results indicate that all estimates involving pretest-posttest differences measure school impact with reasonable accuracy. It is important to measure change over the entire course of learning, however, and not just over the later stages of learning. The correlations between change scores and other school characteristics reflect with reasonable accuracy the relationships between those characteristics and impact, but will be large only when the underlying relationships are substantial. Simple gain scores measure the true situation about as accurately as other change estimates, are easier to compute, and probably are more  meaningful to nonresearchers. (Author)",

        "description":"This report covers part of a project designed to develop and to make available to research workers markers for some of the temperament factors that have been established in the factor-analytic literature. An earlier report describes 28 such factors and defines several divisions of each factor, called subfactors, that appear in the literature to be associated with the factors. Each subfactor is described as a positive pole versus a negative pole. It was hypothesized that scales for these subfactors, when placed in a factor analysis, would have salient loadings on those factors for which they were intended to define one of the divisions. Scales comprised of newly constructed items were developed for each subfactor, half of the items representing each pole, and an equal number of  those for each pole keyed \"yes\" and \"no\", in order to balance out the tendency to acquiesce. This report covers two factor analyses in which some of the subfactors were divided such that each pole was represented by a separate variable. By more fully determining some of the factors and by utilizing the extraction and rotation of several different numbers of factors, it is now possible to suggest markers in the form of unipolar scales for ten additional factors. The evidence used in making these suggestions is presented. (Author/RC)",

From 1 to 5 distinct bipolar subscales were suggested to mark each factor; 12 or 16 item subscales were written, each balanced in terms of the two defined poles and in terms of numbers of positively and negatively stated items. This yielded a total of 1,332 items for 87 subscales as intended markers for the 28 factors. This study determines, by means of factor analyses using the newly constructed subscales, how well the 28 putative factors stand up. A total of 4,000 naval recruits were tested with a complex design that permitted determination of the correlations among all 87 subscales but that required no individual to  respond to more than 320 items. A second sample of 153 female and 92 male students at the University of Oregon were given the entire battery of items. After item analyses and reliability determinations were made, 77 subscales survived. Correlation matrices were computed separately for the two samples and factor analyses performed; 22 minres factors were retrained in each sample and rotated to maximum obliqueness using the direct oblimin method. Results are discussed separately for the two samples and compared across the two. (Author/RC)",

In some cases, this might be the school and industry or business. In this process, evaluation is defined as the improvement of learner success through measurement of program components. Stress is placed on translating evaluational programs into documentation of individual learner success. This program approach tries to cut across courses in order to stress growth that is both upward and cumulative. This growth process is contrasted with growth that is horizontal and additive in the sense of more of the same rather than more complexity and depth. Twelve learning environments are also provided which give short and simple  approaches to a humanistic evaluation of cooperative education programs. (Author/DEP)",

Since consideration was not given to repeaters in test equating, such as in the derivation of equations by Angoff (1971), the hypothetical effect needed to be established. A case study was examined which showed results on a test as expected; overall mean was lower for repeaters. Applying these data to the available equating equations, it was shown that an additional 3 percent of the examinees was categorized as having &quot;passed&quot; than should if repeaters were taken into account. The practical solution offered is to hold separate the score of repeaters, execute the equating on the others, and then apply the conversion to all the examinees. (Author)",

It might be viewed as a model in which guides are set down in advance which direct what follows. Four essential strategies of this model, which are clarified by illustrations, are to select the objective, to define the objective, to use the defined objective to prescribe materials and procedures for instruction or development, and to use the defined objective to prescribe evaluation. Assumptions surrounding the prescriptive model include: (1) Defining objectives in advance will effectively prescribe development and evaluation procedures. (2) High quality definitions of objectives can be obtained quite independent of the development or evaluation of those objectives. (3) People tend to be  both consistent and final in selecting objectives, in deciding on their relative worth, and in defining them. (4) Objectives ought to be defined as specifically as possible if they are to be maximally prescriptive. (5) Defined objectives which are mostly measurable are preferred to those which are mostly nonmeasurable. (6) Measurement should be mostly limited to those objectives which have been defined in advance. Suggestions are made for a more realistic improvement of the prescriptive model by replacing it with a suggestive model. (Author/BJG)",

This questionnaire provides information about how the students feel about themselves, and their relationships with their teachers, administrators, and classmates. Since the 1969-70 school year, QUESTA II has been administered biannually to all 11th grade students and to all faculty members in order to: (1) learn more about the students and staff and also the characteristics of the school environment; (2) discover more about how the school functions; (3) identify those factors in the affective domain which are influencing learning; and (4) identify the school's strengths and weaknesses. The paper describes how one  school district has utilized QUESTA II findings to provide relevant data for both information and discussion sessions at school-community self evaluation conferences and to provide information that focuses on action needed to improve the school's environment. QUESTA II may also be used as a supplement to Pennsylvania's program of Educational Quality Assessment or to construct the needs assessment for a Title III program. The paper includes the procedures used in administering QUESTA II, the plan used to translate the results into a meaningful qualitative report, and a sample of the developed form from the April 1974 administration.

As such, its coverage is not restricted to &quot;good&quot; designs. It encompasses all of the commonly employed evaluation models. The report is concerned with deficiencies and hazards of various designs with emphasis on the weaker ones which, as it happens, are also the most feasible in real-world settings, the least costly, and the most commonly used. The  appendixes contain project selection criteria worksheets, information regarding norm-referenced versus criterion-referenced tests, estimation of treatment effect from the performance of an initially superior comparison group, effects of noncomparable testing dates on experimental group versus norm group comparisons, and problems using grade-equivalent scores in evaluating educational gains.

The assertion will be made that behavioral objectives as used in program evaluations are essentially research hypotheses and that data analysis and interpretations should recognize this through the employment of statistically derived confidence intervals. Another assertion that will be made is that three criteria should be used in judging program evaluation: (1) standards of behavioral science research; (2) utility; and (3) cost-benefit considerations. Finally, two program evaluation models will be compared to the one that has evolved in the County Office. (Author)",

For example, how norm tables that yield IQ's are developed will be considered, but not the concept of the IQ itself. Some attention is given to the actual development of percentile norms, but the various characteristics and facets of percentiles are not discussed. Attention is centered around norms for widely used, nationally standardized tests, as distinct from teacher-made classroom tests.

This usually requires that he derive formulas for one or more asymptotic sampling variances (and covariances) for one or more statistics. He must then compute the numerical value of an estimate of some function of these variances and covariances. If a statistic is a nonlinear function of more than two or three sample statistics, the mathematical derivation of the necessary variance (and covariance) formulas may be burdensome, or even prohibitive. The purpose of the present paper is to call attention to computer program LASAHT that computes  estimated asymptotic sampling variances and covariances numerically and carries out hypothesis tests without need for the statistician to derive formulas for them.

At a convention program, speakers were asked to summarize their presentations in three or four participant-centered objectives. Participants were given a brief, easy to fill in and easy to tabulate form to evaluate the speaker by objectives. Results of participant evaluation were tabulated and sent immediately to the speaker. Speaker success in accomplishing identified speech objectives was evaluated. This evaluation included a simplified statistical analysis. Uses of this evaluation method, as described in this sample kit of forms, procedures, tabulation guidelines and examples, and data interpretation sample, include pinpointing: (1) effective  sepakers, (2) effective presentations, (3) the most effective portion of any presentation, (4) benefits to participants, and (5) possible benefits to learners in institutions sending participants to conventions.

In Birmingham, interest in the SWRL program was stimulated and developed during the Fall of 1971. It was felt that this program would provide the children with an opportunity to be exposed to an early reading program. The components of the SWRL Program consisted of the Instructional Concepts Program (ICP) which was intended to introduce the children to concepts of shape, size, color, amounts, poisitions, and comparisons. Upon completion of the ICP, the Beginning Reading Program (BRP) was initiated. The goals of this program were to teach the children word recognition and the vocabulary of  the program design. Some support systems were also developed to aid the children in maintaining or improving their acquired skills. (Author/DEP)",

Ways of generating evidence regarding the value of an outcome are discussed, particularly longitudinal research that clarifies the causal relations that exist between an educational outcome and subsequent events. As far as attributing outcomes to practices is concerned, it is recommended that the instructional practices under investigation be considered as domains of observable dimensions that can explain variation in student outcomes, rather than as a set of discrete, unique practices. A model is called for that can guide the further development of such dimensions.  (Author)",

Part 1 deals with the technical issues of suitability, feasibility, and cost implications of the use of performance criteria. Part 2 presents the fiscal issue of resource redistribution consequences of the use of performance criteria. Included in the findings are: (1) Variations in curriculum across states and to a lesser extent, among school districts within a state, raise complex questions regarding the practicality and meaning of any national measure of educational disadvantage at a given grade level. (2) Within  states, the districts with currently low concentrations of Title I eligible students would gain funds, and those with high concentrations would lose funds. (3) A formula that would allow a school district to choose either the current Title I criterion or a performance criterion to calculate its Title I entitlement would aid educationally disadvantaged children of working and middle income families while not reducing funds to the children of poverty families, calculated at a national average cost increase of 25 percent.

Reality is described as a student's perception of teacher performance and notion of an ideal teacher performance. The questionnaire deals with both the intensity and direction of a student's dissatisfaction with his/her teacher. An experiment, utilizing 1,059 students from 52 classes in seven different French colleges, was designed to measure the construct validity of this questionnaire. Results are presented in tables entitled: (1) Content descriptions, means and standard deviations of five constructs for each of 15 items, as well as the percentage of excess discrepancies; (2) Precision coefficients for a direct measure  of dissatisfaction and for four constructs associated with a derived measure of dissatisfaction; (3) Observed correlations between five constructs used in the derived approach and direct measure of the satisfaction-dissatisfaction continuum; (4) Corelations for reliability attenuation; and (5) Observed mean within groups correlations between four constructs used in the derivation procedure and a direct measure of the satisfaction-dissatisfaction continuum.

Children younger than 3 years, 6 months can be given the Originality Test if their ability to communicate verbally is satisfactorily demonstrated during the pretest. The test is individually administered to each child by an adult. Both may sit at a table or on the floor, whatever makes the child feel most comfortable and happy. The test consists of 40 plastic foam pieces, four each of different shapes which are red, blue, green, and yellow. The child is asked to speculate on what a form could represent, and the child must know that any answer is acceptable. Since the Originality Test provides four opportunities for a child to  respond to each shape, making a total of 40 responses, his/her score is calculated on the number of different responses given. Credit is given for each response that differs from all previous responses. Test validity is demonstrated through comparison with freedom of expression scores. (Author/BJG)",

Each strategy consists of a different set of rules for selecting the sequence of test items to be administered to a given testee. Advantages and disadvantages of each strategy are discussed, and research issues unique to the strategy are described. Strategies reviewed are differentiated into two-stage approaches and multi-stage approaches. Several variations of the two-stage approach are described. Multi-stage strategies include fixed branching and variable branching strategies. Fixed branching strategies reviewed include a number of variations of the pyramidal approach (e.g., constant step size pyramids, decreasing step size pyramids, truncated pyramids,  multiple-item pyramids), the flexilevel test, and the stradaptive test. Variable branching approaches include two Bayesian strategies and two maximum likelihood strategies. The various strategies are compared with each other on important characteristics and on practical considerations, and ranked on their apparent potential for providing measurement of equal precision at all levels of ability.

        "description":"The effect of stratified sampling of items on the estimation of test score distribution parameters by multiple matrix sampling was studied. Item difficulty and/or interitem correlations were the bases of stratification. Various item iniverses were created by computer simulation and sampled according to several plans. The results indicate that stratification of items does not consistently improve the stability of parameter estimation. The results also show that the variance estimate used in many studies is biased for some item universes when difficulty stratification is used. A variance estimate developed in the current study removes this bias. (Author)",

How much of the educational system's performance relative to its own goals is measured by a standardized test is unknown. Yet this is the kind of information which must be available to a school system if it is to make sound decisions on the effectiveness of its programs. The longitudinal evaluation study using criterion-referenced measures of important reading-related skills which is briefly described in the report is seen as offering a new model for tests development which allows for some user involvement in the construction process,  as well as contributing significantly to the solution of problems raised in the context of this report.

Materials received were checked against two nationwide descriptions of state assessment and or testing programs issued  by Educational Testing Service in 1973. Some recommendations for future research include: the need for immediate research on the question of the most effective roles for statewide assessment programs in influencing state or local decision making, research needed on the procedures and techniques to widen availability of criterion referenced instruments, and research studies that will solve some of the methodological problems facing state assessment programs.

The study revealed that scoring variance across scoring levels is not constant. As scoring ability increases scoring variance decreases. The assertion that low and high scoring subjects will correctly guess the same number of unknown questions is incorrect. Low and high scoring subjects correctly guess the same percentage of unknown questions. Clearly, low scoring subjects are guessing at a greater number of unknown questions and, therefore, will have a larger amount of scoring variance. Post hoc analysis of response option frequencies and changes of option choice was undertaken. Low scoring subjects apparently employ random  guessing when answering questions where they do not know the correct answer. High scoring subjects seem to employ eeucated guessing when answering questions where they do not know the correct answer. Item difficulty appeared to be unrelated to the change from random guessing to educated guessing; however, the large number of omissions by low scoring subjects made the item difficulty effect difficult to interpret.

        "description":"A central problem for the user of domain-referenced tests in instruction is deciding who has passed and who has failed. Two procedures were presented and discussed. The first, employing classical test theory, was found to be more useful for larger domains and where the passing standard is 70 percent or less. The sampling procedure suggested by Millman (1974) was found to be more applicable when the test size approximates the size of the domain. Neither procedure appears useful when the passing standard is high. In light of the large numbers of examinees classified as uncertain when real test data is used, it was concluded that neither procedure offers much to decisionmaking in systematic individualized instruction.

Several other potential applications, as well as details for its use, are described. The program accepts as input raw dichotomous data, reduced joint frequency data, or joint and marginal proportions, for up to 75 items. Output options include the tetrachoric correlation matrix, the matrix of phi coefficients, fourfold frequency tables for every item pair, a joint frequency matrix (which reduces all the information in the fourfold tables to a square matrix with order equal  to the number of items), and a pair-by-pair listing of input proportions and output correlations which permits testing the program against published tables of the tetrachoric correlation. Variable input and output formatting makes the program convenient to use in conjunctions with other analyses by packaged statistical programs. Examples of input and output are presented.

A program, Early School Admissions Program (ESAP) was based on nine objectives established to prepare pre-schoolers for &quot;reading readiness&quot; when they entered the kindergarten. To assess the success of the children and the program, a criterion-measure, based on Piagetian concepts, was constructed in cooperation with OPPMA and the Project Manager of ESAP. Reliability and validity of the Program Evaluation Measure (PEM) were established and found to be satisfactory, thereby, giving more credence to the growth indicators of the pupils. The profiles of the children (they were tested in October,  November, December, January and May) demonstrated a significant pattern of achievement similarity as reflected by Dumas Model for measuring profile configurations. The Dumas Model for determining the similarity of profile configurations enables one to quantify the degree to which several profiles are shaped alike. (Author)",

A pilot project in reading assessment was developed and implemented. It consisted of an integrated package, all components being interrelated through behavioral objectives. The system included a set of behavioral objectives, instructional programs designed to lead to their achievement, a means of measuring the extent to which objectives are achieved, and provision for feedback to decision makers. Representatives of the test publisher discussed the design and  production of the assessment system. Representatives of the local educational agencies discussed implementation and function of the pilot project in the actual school situations. The educational importance of the symposium lies in the fact that although the issues faced and solutions derived are discussed with reference to a particular pilot project in reading, they are applicable to other instructional situations.

At least two conceptually discernable types of creativity are identifiable in research on the topic. The first type conceives creativity to be a trait which is distributed across the population in a fashion analogous to intelligence. The second type might be called the \"state\" concept of creativity. Its primary analytic tool is the examination of criterion creative groups compared to less creative ones. An eclectic approach to the practical application of predicting creativity permitted the use of several different methods of predicting creativity while making comparisons among them; this approach was utilized in the present study. Subjects were junior  high school students who were the top scorers in two mathematics competitions held one year apart. They were administered a variety of paper and pencil measures. Test results indicated the creative potential of this group was quite high. (Author/BJG)",

Approximately 250 students in grades 1 through 6 of two elementary schools, one utilizing an open classroom instructional program and the other a traditional instructional program, comprised the sample in the two-year study which focused on the assessment of the comparative effects of the two instructional programs upon three student variables: (1) self-concept, (2) attitude toward school, and (3) achievement of basic skills. Measurement of these variables were accomplished by the use of the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale and the Pictorial Self-Concept Scale, the &quot;Faces&quot; Inventory, and the Stanford Achievement Test.  Pretests on the three variables were administered in May and June of 1972; posttests were administered in May and June of 1974. Analysis of covariance was used to analyze this data. In addition, data related to teacher attitudes and classroom environment and practices was collected and analyzed. Results do not provide support for any conclusive comprehensive statements concerning the relative effectiveness of the open or traditional instructional program. However, there was evidence to suggest that the open classroom instructional program effected positive changes in the affective areas of self-concept and attitude toward school. Students in both instructional programs performed equally well in the achievement of basic skills. (Author/RC)",

It is a study of the effects of training classroom personnel to use specific procedures in the classroom. The procedural specifications of the sponsors include the physical arrangement of the classroom, utilization of prescribed curricula, and interactions with children. A secondary analysis examines the relationships between educational processes and child outcomes. Substantial data and detailed descriptions of the procedures implemented explain and support the results. Most first and  third grade teachers conformed to instructional procedures as specified by the sponsors. Time spent in reading and math and a high rate of drill, practice, and praise contributed to higher reading and math scores. Lower absence rates, higher scores on a nonverbal problem-solving test of reasoning is attributed in part to more open and flexible instructional approaches. The seven Follow Through models considered are seen as bringing different strengths to their pupils, and each is bringing advantages not usually found in traditional classrooms. (RC)",

Of the student participants in the program, some 78 percent are black and nearly half come from families where the total family annual income is less than $6,000. The project has seen some 1,600  students in four successive groups graduate from high school and over three-quarters of them have continued with some form of post-secondary education. The second report presents data showing that the median proportion of black students among the freshman classes at predominantly white institutions in the South in 1972-73 was 6 percnt, that the proportion of black freshmen at public institutions is double that found in private institutions, and that 60 percent of the black students at all types of predominantly white institutions complete their freshman year with over a C average.

        "description":"Assuming that a period of racial disharmony is potentially indicative of increasing salience of racial categories for social life, the issue of whether a period of racial discord is indicative of (1) a point of rapid transition in an overall trend of decreasing salience of racial categories, or (2) preliminary evidence of a general trend of the increasing importance of racial distinctiveness in social decision-making, remains to be resolved. The intent of this paper is first to ground the over-arching question of salience of racial categories in more specific traditional theory of race relations. Subsequently an example of how one can proceed to deal with the question of salience will be outlined. Generally that which is to be presented is an application of techniques to describe  the form of the processes of social change. The theory that will be tested will essentially be an integration model of racial relations. The basis for application of the technique of analysis presented herein is that heretofore there has not really been a direct test of the trends predicted for and attributed to interracial relations by integration models of social change. The data looked at here are part of a two wave panel survey of the Puerto Rican labor force. The analysis is a secondary analysis of data, the first wave of which was collected in 1953-1954 and the second wave in 1967-1968. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The failure of the Rochester School Board in March 1967 to adopt a comprehensive program of school desegregation surprised many observers. On February 1, 1967, Superintendent Goldberg broadcast four desegregation plans to the public, and on March 16, 1967 the school board voted three to two against all four desegregation plans and adopted instead a plan of increased open enrollment coupled with compensatory education in the inner-city schools. A few weeks after the plans had been made public, the center research team sent a mail questionnaire to all parents previously interviewed. Of 421 parents, 106 answered the mail questionnaire. Parents were asked about (1) their exposure to the public presentations of the four plans; (2) the degree of their participation in the discussion  that followed; (3) how informed they were about the plans; and (4) their attitudes toward school desegregation per se and toward the four plans. In what follows, we first include summaries of four plans presented to the school board, then present the relevant findings from an intensive interview study of 421 Rochester parents undertaken in the fall of 1966 and a followup mail questionnaire meant to tap responses of these parents to the plans presented to the board at the beginning of that month, pointing out, wherever possible, the implications of what we have found.

        "description":"This chart book summarizes two volumes in the subcommittee's series, \"Studies in Public Welfare.\" Paper No. 4 (Dec. 22, 1972) explored work incentive and disincentive features in existing and proposed public welfare programs (cash welfare, unemployment insurance, social security, veterans' benefits, food stamps, public housing, and medicaid). Paper No. 13 (Feb. 18, 1974) reviewed research about the work responses of beneficiaries to income support from the Government. In fiscal 1975 the Federal Government is expected to spend about $130 billion on \"income security\" of Americans, more than double the comparable sum in 1969. Almost four-fifths of these funds pay retirement checks and other social insurance benefits; the rest finances cash welfare, food, housing, and health benefits  for the needy. The primary purpose of income maintenance programs is to improve the living standards of low-income persons and families. But this is a complex and dynamic matter. This chart book explores how public welfare benefits can affect fairness and work incentives, reviews available evidence on whether benefits do in fact affect recipients' work efforts, and considers the trade offs in designing programs to strike a balance between reasonable costs and case loads, work incentives, and fair treatment. This book documents the necessity to make choices among competing goals valued by society. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This short paper asks three related questions: What factors erode ethnic ties? What factors support ethnic identification? What roles does ethnicity play in the process of assimilation? Data were obtained through a sample survey of registered voters in three wards of Providence and the entire suburb of Warwick, Rhode Island. After a field test, 250 interviews were conducted over a three-month period with respondents whose surnames could be readily identified as being of Italian or Irish extraction. The conclusion which emerges from this study is that psychological attachments to one's ethnic group are very hard. Certain attributes--income, education, occupation, age, perceived ethnic discrimination, and ethnic parental background appear to have little or no direct effect on  reducing these attachments, suggesting that certain ecological structures need not accompany an ethnic attitudinal disposition. The factors which appear to exercise the most direct impact on reducing ethnic attachments are generational love, area of residence, suburban environment, and intermarriage. Yet, while respondents who manifest these characteristics have a significantly less intense attachment to their ethnic group, they are still not assimilated. Among these respondents, ethnic attitudes continue to exist at levels above those of assimilation. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The essay addresses both the question of poverty and the scope of political science. The study of poverty demands a transeconomic approach because the act of making an economic choice is fundamentally political, but the act is likely to be ambiguous and that ambiguity is peculiarly revealed in the politics of poor relief. While the idea of \"welfare\" implies an underlying concept of \"rights,\"\"poor relief\" actually reflects policymakers' judgments about which parts of the population can be left over when the most important economic choices (macroeconomic policy) are being made. In the U.S. public relief is a form of aid accruing to those who are jobless and whose joblessness is not their own \"fault,\" using the social estimation of fault. Its chief form is public assistance. Public  assistance is ambiguous, both as to loci of decision and to policy content. The ambiguity as to loci of decision is an expression of (1) federalism and (2) the changing administrative legislature relationship as policy once more becomes open to debate, hence \"legislativized.\" The ambiguity as to policy is expressed (1) in the variety of \"welfare reform\" proposals and the inability to secure approval for any, and (2) the inversion of reform symbolism since the 1960's, so that it now has a restrictive tone, but (3) the fact that the conservatizing trend has also been exaggerated.

It is published in the expectation that the school it describes can and will be built and operated, in the near future. The New School is designed to be a replicatable model for the reform of urban education. The design has its origins in the conviction that such reform is desperately needed, and the linking of that convinction to the opportunity for planning that has become possible as a result of growing state and federal interest in the support of large-scale innovative efforts. The New School has the goal of teaching self-reliance and personal adaptability. Basic skills, intellectual growth, and self-reliance are considered parts of one educational fabric, and the school's programs are  intended to be interdimensionally reinforcing in each of these areas. The design of our school is &quot;slanted&quot; toward the education of the urban poor. A fairly sizable school is contemplated--one designed for 2,600 students. Essentially, it was felt highly desirable to combine many educational innovations under one roof, so that maximum benefits could be gained from the process of mutual reinforcement. For the most part, design features are based on an extension of available education research result or successful programs whose principal features are well understood. (Author/JM)",

The first chapter of this report summarizes these indicators for the State and provides data which indicate trends in these variables. Each is then separately considered in a chapter where data are provided at the planning district level. Individual chapters are devoted to mobility, education, employment and labor force, occupation, and income. These are followed by chapters analyzing white-nonwhite and urban-rural differentials. The final chapter explores the interrelationships between mobility, education, employment, and income and the impact which changes in some of these variables might have on the others. The two measures of mobility which are used in this analysis are  place of birth and place of residence in 1965. The effects on mobility of the high concentration of military personnel and the presence of colleges and universities in certain areas of the state are considered. Data are provided on the educational achievement of Virginia's population. Data on the labor force include the occupational composition of workers, the industrial composition of the labor force, and the rate of labor force participation of various age-race-sex groups of the population.

Conducted for the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the panel, relying on scientific sampling procedures, gauges the extent to which individuals age 12 and over, households, and commercial establishments have been victimized by certain types of crimes. It examines the characteristics of victims and, where possible, explores such facets of victimization as the relationship between victim and offender, the time and place of occurrence, the injury or loss suffered, and whether or not the event  was reported to the police. Carried out in the first quarter of 1973, the surveys covered victimizations that occurred during the previous 12 months. In each city, about 10,000 households (some 22,000 persons) and approximately 2,000 commercial establishments comprised the sample. The information presented in this report reflects only those victimizations incurred by the residents and commercial firms of each city, even though certain incidents may have taken place outside the city. Victimizations of nonresidents, such as suburban commuters and visitors, did not fall within the scope of the surveys. All data from the survey are estimates. (Author/JM)",

Elementary school textbooks are tracking children into narrowly defined sex roles which are demeaning to girls and detrimental to both girls and boys. The first step is to research the material currently in use in order to collect specific illustrations with which to arm oneself. The next step is to publicize these findings. The media is a useful tool for communicating the problem and for recruiting support. Contact businesses, urging them to sponsor a program on the subject. From here a simultaneous, multistrategic approach is suggested. Concerned individuals and organizations must pressure legislatures and boards of education to prohibit the use of sex-role stereotypical material in the public schools. You should also  meet with the textbook selection officials. School systems can refuse to buy material which does not meet guidelines. Work closely with textbook publishing companies. The current trend away from the use of textbooks is a significant development. For several years feminists have been writing children's books which can be used in individualized reading programs. These same books can be used outside the classroom. Speak to both the school and local librarians. Finally, contact the women's organizations in your area.

The class of 1975 at the P. K. Yonge Laboratory School (University of Florida) was studied over their freshman and sophomore years. Because the school's admission policy increased the size of the ninth-grade class by 50 percent, it was also possible to study the ways in which a group of new students, both white and black, established positions within the existing social structure of the grade. This study was an attempt to bridge the gap between the two major research techniques  generally used in the study of adolescent groups: questionnaires and participant observation. Observations and student and teacher interviews were used to define the social structure existing within the 89 member student class of 1975. The students included in this study completed the &quot;Ohio Social Acceptance Scale&quot; and the &quot;Battle Student Attitude Scale&quot; twice: once during their freshman year and again during their sophomore year. Teachers completed the &quot;Florida Key,&quot; an inferred learner self-concept, on each student while he was in the ninth grade. School records were also examined. (Author/JM)",

Other sources of information drawn on in the study were: (1) census figures (1970) on percentages of first and second generation Italian population in each tract; (2) the boundary lines of New York City's 26  poverty areas and &quot;pockets of poverty;&quot; these poverty areas are federally recognized and funded for a variety of programs; (3) Italian foreign stock population percentages in each health area of the city; (4) New York City health areas designated to be in the greatest need of poverty programs; (5) number of Italian-speaking children in New York City's public schools during the 1973-74 school year; (6) number of Italian bilingual programs operating in New York City public schools during the school year 1973-74, locations of these programs, and number of children said to be involved.

        "description":"In response to the Kerner Report, the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the prodding of a few reporters on the staff, the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; began an internship program in the summer of 1968. With some modifications, the program is continuing in 1973. By early 1971, 21 interns of minority background had completed the 13-week training program. At that time, nine were employed in the news media, three were in college, and one had just completed a move, five were not employed in the news field, and three were job hunting. All but two had considerable college background. By the summer of 1972, the program had added two interns in the regular series and had begun a summertime session. For the winter of 1972-73 plans called for two interns who would participate in  6-month sessions. The program has added, to date, at least nine members to the ranks of working minority journalists, some of whom would not be journalists at all were it not for the program. How was the program begun? How have interns been recruited? What are their backgrounds? How are they trained? How many have found jobs in the news media? Perhaps even more important, how do they feel about the program? And finally, how effective has the program been? In an attempt to answer these questions, the author interviewed individuals at the &quot;Examiner&quot; who have worked with the program in one capacity or another. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential role of selected fiscal incentives in attempting to achieve greater racial and socioeconomic integration through open enrollment programs. Three premises underlie this paper: first, that past experience with district wide unrestricted (color-blind) open enrollment plans indicate that this approach has not generally resulted in increased integration in individual schools even though significant proportions of the total student population voluntarily transferred to nonneighborhood schools; second, that if school integration can be achieved through a program of voluntary compliance, that such a program is preferred to a nonvoluntary program which accomplishes the same objectives at a similar cost; and third, that our society  has adopted the goal of integrating our public schools as a necessary condition for the achievement of an integrated society. The fiscal incentives discussed in this paper are of two major types: adjustments in the direct cost to the family of utilizing the transfer option through a system of transfer fees and bonuses, and adjustments in property tax bills for school purposes in integrating neighborhoods through adjustments in state aid formulas. In each case, the broad outline of a specific plan is presented and evaluated in terms of its probable effectiveness. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The Florida Follow Through Model is one of several federally-funded experimental programs that attempts to modify the type of educational experience that children from low-income backgrounds receive during their first four years (K-3) of schooling. In the case of the Florida model, the emphasis is on home as well as school intervention. Two mothers from low-income backgrounds are trained and placed in the classroom to work as a team with the teacher. Called parent educators, the mothers visit the homes of the children in the classroom weekly and assist the teacher with classroom instruction. The classroom teacher is a key person in the Florida model. She coordinates both the instructional and home visit activities of the parent educators. Her morale is therefore important to the  success of the program. It is the purpose of this article to: (1) briefly examine the nature of teacher morale, (2) look at the ways in which the Florida model affects teacher morale and, therefore, the child through the delicate set of home-school interactions called for by the model, and (3) report empirical data concerning the effect of the model on teacher morale during its first two years of operation. During the first two years of operation, teacher morale was assessed by a means of the &quot;Purdue Teacher Opinionnaire&quot; which is probably the best known and most widely used of all self-report teacher morale instruments.

        "description":"The Black woman has been the transmitter of culture in the black community. Two of the important roles of African women were perpetuated during slavery and continue until today. They are her role in economic endeavor and her close bond with her children. The woman in African society was additionally politically significant. The black woman has been defined as a double nonperson. American women have been denied their history. History in the past has been written by white male historians and has been a story of mankind, utilizing learned spokesmen from a male point of view. Black history has been written by black historians. Their spokesmen have been chosen by a racist society. This study shows that the life of the black woman under slavery was in every respect more difficult and  even more cruel than that of the men. Black women were, though it is little known, active in the revolution and resisted both violently and nonviolently. The matriarch myth is discussed in this study as well as the role of the black woman and women's liberation. The black woman is placed in a historical perspective. The role of the black woman is examined by a black woman, and black women speak intellectually, not only as the \"sexual outhouse\" for white men during slavery but in resistance to prostitution for the state under welfare. It is noted here that the black woman finds practical ways of dealing with and coping with the white world. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This document--one of six closely related studies designed to consider employability of rural labor, the impact of industry, and social adjustments in the Mississippi Delta and the Ozarks--examines the socioeconomic factors affecting employment in industry of black Americans living in a rural area of the Mississippi Delta. Madison, Arkansas, the study community, is 25 miles west of Memphis, Tennessee, in St. Francis County. In 1970, Madison had 985 inhabitants, mainly blacks. Researchers hypothesized that the people in Madison might exhibit physical and attitudinal differences which would affect their employability and social adjustment. Also investigated was the assertion that a general &quot;culture of poverty&quot; exists, especially among southern blacks. Attitudinal factors affecting  employability were measured on five scales by race, sex, age, income, education, and welfare status. Although black groups uniformly scored lower on a scale to measure socioeconomic status (even when balanced by income level and educational attainment), blacks did not uniformly have lower mean scores than whites on scales measuring social participation and job satisfaction potential. Nor were blacks more externally controlled or more tolerant of deviant behavior. Major physical deterrents to employment were lack of transportation and unsatisfactory work environment. (Author/JM)",

No other activity or service received as much as 3 percent of total expenditures. Preschool activities received the highest concentration of financial effort. Local Educational Agency (LEA) attempts at evaluating Title I programs varied widely in quality. On the basis of local perceptions of success expressed on a four  point scale, 85 percent of all activities/services were considered successful or very successful. The average expenditure of funds per participant tended to rise according to LEA perceptions of success. English/speech activities received the highest success rating; media was rated second; and kindergarten/preschool was rated third.

The evaluation was based on examinations of written documents, i.e., component project proposals, the analysis of achievement test results and other pertinent data, interviews with appropriate school personnel, interviews with parents of the participating students, and direct observations of classroom activities related to the component projects being evaluated. Twelve schools involving 12 projects and 17 professional and paraprofessional instructors were involved in the Title I programs of Maui District. Approximately 311 educationally deprived pupils were served by these  educators. The Title I program consisted of nine classroom-based remedial projects and three preschool projects. Completely adequate, reliable, and valid data were lacking for sufficient statistical analysis. Subjective opinion was frequently offered in lieu of accurate and objective data. It was suggested that more standardization and organization of testing and data collection procedures be developed within and between the schools. While all projects appeared to be beneficial for the pupil's education, more effective programs should be developed in future years. (Author/JM)",

This report covers 1973-74 operations. All four high schools in American Samoa are involved in ULA. The program is administered by the Title I staff through the Secondary Division and the Division of Instruction. There are about 1700 students in the program, 36 teachers and 34 classrooms. Each high school has a teacher resource center for the ULA program. ULA students receive 90 minutes of instruction  daily in addition to their other classes. The scope of ULA encompasses several broad areas: classroom instruction for second language speakers, curriculum development peculiar to Samoan students, special instructional materials for Samoa, and teacher training. Teachers are involved in continuous inservice training to increase their competencies to teach students who speaks English as a second language. Considerable progress was made during fiscal years 1973 and 1974 in designing a system for continuously assessing characteristics of the ULA program. (Author/JM)",

ULA's design and program objectives were based upon several needs assessment studies conducted in American Samoa by educational experts in language learning and development, curriculum and instruction, learning theory, instructional media and teacher training. The design of ULA evolved through meetings with parents and community representatives that involved  local teachers and administrators. ULA materials are still in various developmental stages and undergoing constant revision based upon formative feedback from teachers and students. The scope of ULA encompasses several broad areas: classroom instruction for second language speakers; curriculum development peculiar to Samoan students, special instructional materials for Samoa and teacher training. Some teachers report problems in using ULA materials. Some teachers use commercially available materials along with supplementary materials that they produce. (Author/JM)",

Students at all grade levels enrolled in ESEA Title I related programs gained more than one month's growth in reading skills for each month of instruction. Successful reading programs included the use of diagnostic/prescriptive materials, individualized instruction within the regular classroom, and assistance from instructional aides. Students in ESEA Title I related programs typically achieved gains equal to or greater than 1.1 months of growth in mathematics for each month of participation. Successful programs frequently reported the value of active participation by  instructional aides and parent volunteers in both individualized and group instruction in the regular classroom. The health/auxiliary services component provided pupil personnel, library, and health services. The parent participation and community involvement component provided activities directed toward the improvement of communications between home and school. The intergroup relations component implemented activities designed to minimize isolation between different ethnic, cultural, racial, or social groups. A staff development component was active.

This report is compiled from project evaluations submitted by these participating school districts. Title I does appear to be helping educationally disadvantaged students: 60 percent of the districts report changes in their regular instructional programs as a result of dissemination from Title I projects. Districts report that the majority of Title I students fully achieved district performance objectives. For example, 55 percent of the 22,221 students in regular term reading projects fully achieved district performance objectives in reading. The small sub-samples of  achievement data indicate that Title I students make cognitive gains of 1.5 to 2.5 months in grade-level achievement for each month of instruction. Plans for future action include the following: (1) continue to exercise greater vigilance on division of compensatory education responsibilities; (2) continue tightening the feed back loop for project evaluations and audits and monitoring reports; (3) collect data on results of the new fiscal year 1974 monitoring techniques; (4) provide inservice to districts on a regular basis, and (5) improve management of classroom learning programs.

The testimony describes the facts and reasoning which support President Ford's recommended Bill, H.R.2148. Also discussed are H.R.'s939, 3247 and 3501. The latter two bills propose that additional changes should be made in the Act, primarily to protect further the rights of Mexican-American and Puerto Rican citizens. The role of the Department of Justice in drafting the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is noted: The Act was based in part on facts and case law developed by the Department under prior voting rights legislation, and the primary task of federal enforcement of the Act was and is placed on the Department. The Civil Rights Division particularly the Voting  Section--has therefore accumulated a large amount of information pertinent to assessing the need for any extension of the Voting Rights Act in the opinion of the witness. A list of additional information and exhibits developed by the Division's staff is submitted with the testimony presented here. The witness concludes that the most urgent task of the Committee relating to the Voting Rights Act is to agree promptly on a Bill extending Sections 4 and 201 for an additional five years. (JM)",

        "description":"Although planning theory is regarded as an analysis of the relationship of knowledge to action by many theories, a view from the poor and minority strata of this society suggests a different alternative--that planning theory is an analysis of the relationship of \"knowledge\" to inaction, particularly with regard to the continuation of deteriorating conditions in inner cities. This is because the body of thought referred to as \"Planning Theory\" has not provided planners or politicians with any illuminating tools with which to serve the interest of urban poor and minority groups. The proposed models of societal guidance and change may describe existing conditions, but they describe them inadequately to allow required changes to be made in the system. It is the thesis of this article  that this inadequate description stems from three basic conceptual problems that are not addressed in the literature. These problems are: (1) the failure to provide theories which are both rigorous and relevant to the urban experience and the means for their implementation; (2) an incomplete analysis of the urban political and economic milieux; and (3) the confused role of the planner in this setting. This article attempts to explain them as a first step in the future development of a more workable \"Urban Planning Theory\". (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Urban problems have been discussed for so long and with so little effect that the litany of urban crisis is now a hollow incantation. One way out is to go back to the neighborhoods and experience \"urban problems\" as they affect particular people and places. The author's own street-level perspective was gained in five months of field work on the Lower East Side of New York City. Today the area includes Jewish concentrations, Puerto Ricans, Blacks, some Italians, a burgeoning Chinese population, and Polish and Ukranian neighborhoods. To walk the streets of the lower East Side is to see the urban past and how it has evolved--both changing and unchanged--into the present. As a participant-observer in one urban neighborhood, the author tried to answer four different sorts of  questions: (1) How did Government programs affect the neighborhood? (2) What was the impact of street-level bureaucrats' in the area? (3) How did local residents adapt to life in their neighborhood? (4) How did neighborhood organizations respond to local problems? The sidewalk observer's most important realization is that citizen resources and energies remain a powerful but still latent force at the street level and that there is little being done in City Hall to build neighborhood democracy on the foundation.

        "description":"Given the general social thrust toward progress in the 1960's, it is proposed here that the points in the system where black economic progress took place were those points where white resistance was less. Current data indicates the achievement of significant progress by black women--relative to white women and black men--in all regions of the country, significant progress of black men in the South, but astonishingly little relative economic progress of black men in the non-southern states. The progress of black males in the South and the lack thereof in the non-south is a phenomenon for which one explanation is offered here. Arguments regarding the value of full employment in augmenting the black-white earnings ratio, and in facilitating the development of programs for the  disadvantaged, appear to be correct. However, the active pursuance of full employment as a policy has not been greatly evident, except as an artifact of military activity. Moreover, it seems unlikely that any of the special programs initiated during the 1960's were very significant in improving the earnings ratios for women and southern men, even given the favorable economic environment. On the other hand, civil rights pressures presumably had a direct impact upon discriminatory activity, without the mediating activity of specific governmental agencies. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"It is proposed in this document that the selectivity of migration, in terms of both people and places become a more imposing influence in urbanization as the role of natural increase as a source of urban growth diminishes. Recent U.S. growth policy proposals have frequently been marked by a simplistic view of how urban growth works, compounded by an exaggerated sense of what policy has in its power to do. On the one hand, policymakers fail to perceive the full momentum of demographic change that could be guided; but they also underestimate the force of demographic constraints on their intended actions. This paper considers five aspects of the migration process related to these points: (1) the concentration of migratory growth in only a few metropolitan areas; (2) migration's  apparently one-sided economic wisdom, arising out of the weakness of economic 'push'; (3) the potential for return migration, which derives from latent migratory predispositions coupled with new sources of retirement income; (4) wide local variations among metropolitan areas in the rate of migratory circulation; and (5) the intensifying phenomenon of urban population decline, now a characteristic of entire metropolitan areas. It is possible for a national growth policy to be development-oriented and for it to build on the processes of change. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The United States is a highly urbanized nation with space in abundance, yet large portions of its national territory are emptying out. The counterpart of this pervasive population decline is a highly selective pattern of growth, conferred by a national system of migration flows that has increasingly favored a certain few metropolitan areas. This duality of growth and decline, and its dependence on an intricate system of migration flows, are central features of U.S. urbanization. Migration is a key observable phenomenon, expressing the urbanization process and hence promising insight into its workings. This paper examines U.S. migration first from a broad analytical viewpoint and then through the experience of two specific cities. Section Two considers the functions and dynamics  of the migration process: what causes migration to occur, what its effects are on migrants, and how it affects the places they leave and the places to which they go. Sections Three and Four present two specific metropolitan area case studies within which general urbanization phenomena are examined: San Jose, California, a case study of rapid population growth; and the city of Saint Louis which exemplifies central-city population decline.

A large fraction of this literature was first published as Rand reports and papers. The pragmatic question discussed here is the strengths and shortcomings of the state of the art in economic analysis of fertility determinants. Efforts to view fertility as a response to time and resource constraints and market determined exchange prices have begun to yield a substantial and largely consistent literature of empirical investigations. Section 2 outlines the evaluation of this framework for analyzing fertility, and Section 4 evaluates the estimated magnitude and importance of several of the apparently causal relationships assumed by this framework.  Section 3 briefly reviews the problems of statistically modeling reproductive behavior and estimating model parameters. In Section 5 it is argued that if the evaluation of population policy interventions is to become a more precise science, analysis should focus on fertility and not contraceptive services. Section 6 summarizes the empirical results from various evaluation studies of the Taiwan Family Planning Program. The final section considers how the demand approach to fertility determinants might help in the future to choose among broad types of policy interventions. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The standard one-period labor supply model that economists have used is in some ways an inadequate tool to evaluate a Family Assistance Plan (FAP). The principal difficulty is that an FAP will have important interperiod or life cycle effects. The pure life cycle model, an extension of the work of Becker and Ghez, is derived here without reference to its implications for an FAP. The timing of market participation is shown to depend upon the life cycle wage pattern of men and women, the rate of interest and the rate of time preference, and any age-related changes in the productivity of nonmarket uses of time. A comparison of the predictions of the pure life cycle and pure oneperiod models attempts to clarify circumstances under which the life cycle model should be used and those  under which the single-period model is appropriate. The theoretical model is then used to predict and analyze the expected labor supply effects of an FAP. Finally, human capital investments are included in the model. The final section contains an empirical simulation of the predicted effects of an FAP on the hours behavior of men and women. These results suggest what the theory itself implied--a much larger effect of an FAP on the work behavior of married women than on the work behavior of male heads of households. (Author/JM)",

In fact, however, we do not have perfect measures of all that is relevant at this time; and for some of the \"true\" variables that matter, better proxies may be found in variables that describe the families from which the husband and wife came. This study explores the relationship between the number of children that couples have and some variables describing the background of the husband. When a man had an affluent or educated father and came from a small family or from a non-farm background, he and his wife tend to have fewer children than other couples. This is not just because these couples were themselves more affluent or  educated; even when the \"current\" variables are introduced into the analysis, a statistically significant effect of the background variables persists. The effect of the background variables may be due to taste differences or to differences in prices and opportunities not adequately measured by the \"current\" variables. Professor Easterlin hypothesized that those who grew up in affluent parental homes would tend to have fewer children than others because of the tastes for a high standard of living acquired there.

One can explore the effects of a given plan in detail, or one can cull from the set of feasible alternative plans the major changes that these plans will bring about and then analyze the effect of these changes in a general framework. At their most fundamental levels, the evaluations of all alternative income maintenance schemes require accurate measures of family responses to changes in the market wage that household members receive if they choose to work, and the total income at the family's disposal. In the household production model the family is viewed as a firm engaged in the production of basic items of consumption usually called \"household commodities\". Families are  assumed to produce household commodities by combining their own time with purchased goods and services. They obtain these goods and services in exchange for the time they allocate to market work and possibly in exchange for income from other (non-wage) source as well. The workings of this model are illustrated through the derivation of an equation that relates changes in husband's time in the home to changes in \"factor prices\"--husband's and wife's wages and prices of purchased market goods--and family full wealth.

The report attempts to be neutral in regard to whether urban growth should be controlled, suggesting instead that communities should ask themselves why they want to control growth (if they do) as a first question in examining how to control. Two analysis-based views on urban change must not, however, be concealed. First, it is very easy to confuse causes and effects in urban growth. Second, it may be easy to control growth within a limited political jurisdiction, but if the locally determined objective is to control  growth over a broad area, it is very easy for rigorous control of the parts to allow continued chaos of the whole. Following an introduction, the second section of this report takes up various possible objectives of urban growth control and their implications; Section Three discusses the possibilities of different kinds of control; Section Four goes into some detail on issues raised by \"side effects\" of attempting to control urban growth. Then Section Five addresses the question of how urban growth might be controlled. (Author/JM)",

The reorganization can stem from one or more of seven possible strategies; community relations, physical redeployment, administrative decentralization, grievance mechanism, employment of neighborhood residents, new neighborhood institutions, and/or political decentralization. These seven strategies fall into three groups that reflect the degree of intended decentralization along either the client or territorial dimension. The first four are weak  strategies, the next two are moderate strategies, and the last may be considered a strong strategy. The present study is a summary assessment of 269 case studies of urban decentralization, dealing with three major questions: What have been the outcomes of the decentralization innovations, as reported by the case studies? What is the relationship between these outcomes and the attempt to implement weak, moderate and strong decentralization strategies?

The case studies covered such innovations as police-community relations programs, team policing, neighborhood health centers, new neighborhood multiservice  facilities, little city halls, ombudsmen and complaint procedures and district control of schools. The Community Action and Model Cities programs prepared the groundwork for urban decentralization. However, each of these federal programs emphasized only one of the two dimensions of decentralization. The first dimension of decentralization, coming mainly from the Community Act Program, involves a client imperative. A second, equally important dimension coming more from the Model Cities experience invokes a territorial imperative. (Author/JM)",

Considerable public and private debate as to how the existing welfare system should be reformed has fostered renewed study of how welfare related government policies affect people's behavior, particularly how different welfare reform proposals would alter the division of time between market work and other activities. The task undertaken here is a sensitivity analysis of the different methods and formulations by which researchers have previously estimated labor supply responses. The approach taken is a step-by-step exploration of alternative labor supply estimating equatios that attempts to identify the  independent (marginal) effect of each particular change in the form of these equations. The sensitivity of response parameters to changes in the measure of market labor supply by an individual to changes in the way an individual's wage is measured, to how non-wage related income effects are estimated, and to who is included in the estimating sample is considered. By systematically exploring what difference each of these changes makes to the parameter estimates, it is possible to isolate which factors strongly affect estimated response parameters.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to report on part of a research study designed to learn about the interrelationships of racial conflict, change in the institutionalization of social power within an educational system, and adaptive organization of the black community within Newark, New Jersey between 1958 and 1972. The central fact informing the participation of the black community in educational affairs of Newark is that power is institutionalized, as are the rules which govern and influence the educational system. The significant question then becomes how did the black community, between 1958 and 1972, organize to deal with this fact, and with what success. The approach adopted here features an orientation toward black group survival, and successful adaptation with scarce  resources, within a particular situational context. The emergent organizational structure and the strategic designs for inducing social change created by the black community, while coping with the pattern of environmental stress of particular situational conditions and forces, are the dominant orientations of this approach. The consequences of black participation in a particular sphere of public policy determination, and the processes and structures contributing to such consequences, were the focus of this work.

        "description":"Previous studies have reported that disadvantaged children tend to loose the skills and abilities they had acquired in special and/or intervention programs when they are placed in education settings which do not support their needs. Since the 1970 census data tended to indicate that the pupil composition of the schools had changed, it became important to determine (1) whether the impact of the intervention components which had been successful were still intact and (2) whether they were still producing the desired results. If the composition of the schools had changed, did the current allocation decisions address the needs of the pupils and schools. A demographic analysis was made of the 1970 census data to determine the characteristics of the pupil populations in the elementary  schools. A systematic review was made of the kinds of service-inputs of each of the elementary schools reviewed currently and in 1972. Through a component analysis procedure, descriptions of the summative or aggregate inputs of the respective projects formed were developed. Comparisons between the current and 1972 service-inputs were made to determine whether the kinds of services received currently differed from those received in 1972. The reading performance scores of the children in the respective elementary schools were used. The data was from the spring 1974 administration of the California Achievement Test. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper examines whether suburban communities can provide any useful conceptual tools for the examination of the prospects for community control in cities. Several propositions are advanced: First it is argued that the relevance of suburban community control to the poor in the cities is not diminished by the finding that those of high social status participate in politics more than the poor. Second, it is argued that the suburban experience is relevant to urban community control even if suburbs do not have consistently high rates of citizen participation or have less professional autonomy than cities. Moving from these assertions, it is argued that several models of citizen influence over educational governance can be discerned from the literature on suburban educational  politics. These models are applicable with some qualifications to minority group communities. The third assertion is that each of these models has pay-off potential for the urban poor, although each brings certain drawbacks as well. It is argued that what is needed is that we develop community control models which incorporate the important features of each of the current models. The structural similarities between urban and suburban models of community control provide a useful starting point for defining an appropriate model for the cities. (Author/JM)",

The first evaluation was a descriptive-analytical study of the impact of Upward Bound on the community and the high school. This study was carried out through extensive field work, including interviews and observations in high schools, on campuses of institutions of higher learning, and in the community. It was a nationwide study conducted in 16 communities. During the course of the study, 447 persons were interviewed, including secondary school personnel (teachers), librarians and principals, university personnel (faculty, Upward Bound coordinators and administrators), students (both participants and non-participants in Upward Bound), and community leaders (Community  Action staff and board members, public officials and school board members). The second evaluation had three major purposes: (1) to synthesize all of the previous evaluations of Upward Bound; (2) to gather additional firsthand information on the impact of Upward Bound; and (3) to carry out a cost/benefit analysis of the program. This document deals primarily with the third aspect of the second evaluation, although there is detail on the first evaluation and the other two objectives of the second evaluation as well.

        "description":"The Evaluation of the Emergency School Assistance Program (ESAP) for the 1971-72 school year is the first application of full-blown experimental design with randomized experimental and control cases in a federal evaluation of a large scale program. It is also one of the very few evaluations which has shown that federal programs can raise tested academic achievement. Finally, it demonstrated that motivational factors and what are sometimes called noncognitive variables are an important part of the analysis of what happens in schools. A block of ESAP funds was awarded on a random basis to pairs of schools, one member of each pair receiving no funds and serving as control on the other. At the end of the school year, students in both the experimental and control schools received  questionnaires and achivement tests; black male high school students were found to score significantly higher in the experimental schools than in the controls. This experience provides virtually the most convincing data that scientific research can provide that the program had a vavorable impact on student test scores. An analysis of the data using an elaborate multiple correlation and regression design was also performed. This analysis, combined with the experiment, gave some useful insights into why ESAP was a success. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Advocates of community control over local schools seek deference to parental preferences from the professional staff. Specific proposals include: (1) Staff accountability to parental representatives for student learning; (2) parental participation in the selection of school principals; (3) parental participation in school level decision-making, and (4) use of school facilities and resources for community development. To implement these means in New York City, it has been proposed that the new community districts be granted full autonomy. This proposal raises important policy-related questions. The first is whether the structure of suburban schools district governance actually does facilitate local community control over public elementary and secondary schooling? If it does, then  the second question is what can we learn from the suburban experience that would help guide policies directed toward facilitating community control over schools serving inner-city areas? To explore the factors associated with the differential responsiveness of suburban as compared to inner-city schools, it is helpful to analyze several dimensions of educational governance, e.g., conditions that constrain suburban educators to be responsive to parental concerns, and contrasting conditions inhibiting school level responsiveness to inner-city parents.

        "description":"As the problems encountered by big city school systems have increased, the educational establishment has come under sharp attack in some part because professional educators have unilaterally made far reaching decisions, insulated from public scrutiny. In order to voice opposition to these decisions, some community members have begun to form new community educational interest groups (CEIGs). The relationships these new CEIGs have formed with the educational leaders differ from those formed by the traditional school-community groups. Rather than rallying to the support of the professional educators, these new CEIGs often form to oppose the educational leaders so that they can force them to justify or change their decisions. Thus confrontation rather than cooperation has more  frequently become the basis of CEIG-educational leader interactions. To help educational leaders (i.e., administrators and board members) to better understand these new interaction patterns, an exploration of the goals and tactics of the new CEIGs is needed, as well as an analysis of the political interactions that occur between these groups. A systems model is employed here to illustrate, categorize and explore the dynamics of the political patterns of interaction. The model is utilized to interpret data obtained from three CEIGs operating in a large Northeastern city. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Prepaid group practice as a concept for providing health care is now over 25 years old in the nation and in New York City. It has overcome initial opposition by the medical profession and has been adopted by government as a healthy strategy under the acronym HMO or &quot;Health Maintenance Organization&quot;. The author asserts that on two major criteria for evaluating the health care system--accessibility to the health care system and cost of treatment--prepaid group practice compares most favorably with other types of Insurance plans. There are presently estimated to be 170 operational HMOs throughout the country providing service to some eight million enrollees. An additional 262 HMOs are in various stages of planning and development, although only 66 of these have the assistance of  government funds for feasibility and planning surveys under the Federal HMO Act of 1973. The HMO is substantially an urban phenomenon requiring large concentrations of population and large initial sums of money. The HMO Act of 1973 was a Federal Law designed to promote and encourage the growth of prepaid group practice plans. Before and after the Act passed Congress, criticism began to develop and major problems began to emerge. The author advocates definitive and timely Congressional action to amend the Law in order to ensure its success. (Author/JM)",

Previous policy positions in regard to education for the handicapped, students' rights, integration, pre-kindergarten and other compensatory education programs, continuing education  and church-state issues in state aid to non-public schools, provided additional guidelines to the selection of bills for analysis and action.

The specific objective of the research was to explore rural and urban differences among Negro boys on the following aspects of occupational orientations: goals and expectations, anticipatory deflection from goals, and the association of intensity of aspiration with anticipatory deflection. It was found that Negro boys in urban areas have higher occupational goals and expectations than their rural counterparts; however, differences are greater in reference to goals than for expectations. On the whole, rural and urban respondents were found to experience very similar rates  of anticipatory deflection from occupational goals, but, in the case of high aspirants, differences were observed in reference to the nature of anticipatory deflection experienced. Urban Negroes were found to have stronger desires for their occupational goals than their rural counterparts. No meaningful association was found to exist between intensity of aspiration and anticipatory deflection from occupational goals for either grouping. Theoretical and practical implications were drawn and suggestions offered for future research in this problem area. (Author/JM)",

In order to predict the magnitude of such reductions the labor supply schedule of potential beneficiaries must be known. In three previous papers, estimates for married and single prime age (25-34) men; prime age married and single women, and female household heads; and younger men and women were presented. In this paper, estimates are presented for several groups of older men and women. In the first section of this paper, data are described upon which the analysis is based. The next sections present and discuss the results for the demographic groups. The final section  contains a brief summary and conclusion. It is found that, for the most part, the results are consistent with prior expectations. In general, the income effects are negative and the substitution effects are positive. The elasticities for older men and women are larger than those for prime age married men. While the labor supply elasticities of men below retirement age are smaller than those for women, the labor supply elasticities of men over age 65 are generally just as large as those for women.

        "description":"Three obstacles appear to frustrate the potential contribution of empirical research and social science to policy formulation. First there is the inherent conflict in the political decision making process; second, reality is so complex it defeats our ability to locate the sphere of understanding which we should apply; third, knowledge presupposes a framework to interpret it; but in a pluralistic system there are only competing frameworks. The work of Kuhn may be relevant for understanding the contribution of social science research to established social policy paradigms. In this paper, the resistance of personal paradigms to change is illustrated, as well as the stubborness of categories of thought despite alternatives suggested by research. Skeptics take this as evidence that  only a weak link is possible between research and policy. Optimists argue that such a conclusion is premature. Research undertaken within a common framework of thought can both by contention and concensus influence the development of policy; moreover, research and theory can help reshape policy paradigms as well, but their contributions cannot be isolated from the many other forces that impinge on decisions. The final section illustrates how prior-held frameworks shape the ideals sought (the skeptic's view), the theories of action proposed, and the evaluations undertaken. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on partial models for solving urban problems to contrast our achievements as social scientists with our aspirations as prescribers of public policy. The objectives of this paper are (1) to review some of the reasons that an ideal set of solutions for urban problems has not been produced by social scientists and (2) to describe two efforts currently underway at the Urban Institute to arrive at useful, if not ideal, answers. An ideal methodology for seeking answers to urban problems would incorporate the principle that nearly everything is related to everything else. Thus the model would be interactive in the sense that a given variable could be both an independent variable and a dependent variable to allow for \"feedback effects\". The urban metropolitan area and  its population would be regarded as a complex organism in which a diverse set of outcomes would follow from the decisions of various subsets of decision makers, each subset complying with known behavioral relationships within specified constraints. Another paradigm for this kind of modelling effort is a micro-analytic simulation model. The methodological base for this type of modelling is the assignment of behavioral characteristics to individual micro-units according to known probabilities of occurrence of those behavioral characteristics within identifiable subgroups of the population.

        "description":"While debates over the heritability of IQ and the potential for culture bias in measuring instruments have generated much research and public comment, it is also possible to investigate the significance of interracial differences in mean IQ by ignoring both the foregoing issues and instead examining the social psychology of the test situation itself. Male and female students between 12 and 16 years of age completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Performance sub-scales in a variety of settings. The variables of test atmosphere (evaluative or gamelike), tester expectation (high or low), race of tester (black or white), and race of subject were placed in a two by two by two by two factorial design. At a second session some weeks after taking the WISC, subjects  completed a group administered questionnaire. The pattern of mean IQ scores as well as mood and personality data indicated that test performance was optimal at moderate levels of motivational arousal. A replication of the experiment for male subjects increased cell sizes to the point that socio-economic status could be treated as an independent variable in the design. When this was done, the results suggested that interracial differences in mean IQ might be erased depending upon the social-psychological characteristics of the test setting and the socio-economic background of the testee.

        "description":"This report focuses on the increasingly widespread concern over the ability of local government to exert sufficient leverage on population, economic, and spatial growth to make a difference in what happens and to do so in a way so as to effect agreed-upon public policies. Concern over the ability of local governments to manage urban growth and change is important for two reasons--for the rapidly growing concern over growth and subsequent costs, and for concern over the ability of local government institutions to actually function effectively in an area where they are usually held responsible. Two issues are addressed in this report. The first is the extent to which the collection of local governments in a metropolitan area is able to manage urban development. The site for the  investigation and the principal source of data and observation is the San Jose Metropolitan Statistical Area--Santa Clara County, California. The second issue is the extent to which a single municipality within the metropolitan area can exert management control over development within and at its boundaries. This report is intended as a means for developing testable hypotheses about relationships among key variables determining the ability of local governments in a metropolitan area to affect, in a significant way, urban growth and change.

        "description":"The intent of this paper is to illustrate that within the feminist movement there are sub groups that have to be examined if the movement is to be successful. With the heightened consciousness of women across the nation and the increased competition for the scarce number of well-paying, meaningful jobs, it is important that minorities understand not only each other, but also the scope and implications of the feminist movement. Sexism has been of secondary importance to ethnic minority women because of the overshadowing effects of the racist behavior they have been forced to endure. A woman is not just seen as a female in the labor market, but is perceived as part of a specific racial group. If unemployment rates for Black teenagers are examined separately, it is apparent that  this group is even more severely disadvantaged than minority teenagers as a whole. If individual income is examined, it is found that minority women are at the bottom of the ladder. Such examples illustrate that in the labor market the problems of ethnic minorities (women) are compounded. Extensive research is needed in order to gain significant data in areas such as those discussed. This information is also relevant with respect to the formulation of strategies and the implementation of programs in the struggle for women's rights. (Author/JM)",

San Jose, California, was the scene of very rapid growth for more than a decade. St. Louis, Missouri, on the other hand, contained the prototypical problems of a declining central city, including one of the highest rates of building and neighborhood abandonment in the U.S. Seattle, Washington, represented a metropolitan area responding favorably to a strong exogenous shock. Under the high unemployment caused by aircraft industry lay-offs during the late sixties and early seventies, the economy showed unexpected resilience. Rand's research in San Jose, Seattle, and St. Louis represents work done in the first year of  what was conceived to be a five-to-seven year research program during which 12 to 15 cities would be studied in depth. The intent of the research effort was to create a frame work that could guide policy decisions at (ultimately) all levels of government. Comparisons that could be made among these three quite diverse cities related to the topics of major urban policies, constraints on local officials, the people versus territory issue, and other conceptual comparisons.

        "description":"This paper is concerned with research issues that must be faced in assessing the potential subnational effects of proposed income maintenance programs. The paper is divided into discussions of four major tasks that must be performed by policy analysts. The first is simply to list program provisions that may have important subnational effects, either directly or by changing the behavioral patterns of participating families. The second task is to construct a set of socioeconomic indicators whereby these effects can be gauged in a manner readily comprehensible to policymakers. The third task is to develop a theoretical framework appropriate for analyzing these effects systematically. The fourth task involves actually obtaining the information necessary to predict the changes in the  socioeconomic indicators that would result from adoption of the proposed income maintenance alternatives under consideration. Successful completion of these tasks depend on resolving a set of fundamental research issues that do not change as the geographic dimension of primary interest varies. Thus, although all the topics discussed in this paper are relevant to assessing the potential subnational implications of alternative income maintenance programs, many are equally pertinent to examining potential national effects.

        "description":"Pointing out that education is clearly one of society's most basic instruments for achieving social conformity, and socialization in the schools is clearly designed to perpetuate the dominant values of the present social system, the author asks whether it does not seem reasonable that those who most precisely articulate these dominant values are very often those who are most extensively educated. If public schooling results in a considerable degree of conformity, what might be expected from the combination of public schooling, college education, and graduate training? Indeed, will not sociologists of education likely be among the most diligent supporters of the prevailing social institutions, as well as their racial values? By discussing school desegregation as an instrument of  social policy, the author intends to begin a critical examination of some of the values, assumptions, and questions that underly much of the work of sociologists of education. This paper focuses on three broad areas: (1) the historical relationship between national desegregation policy and social science research; (2) the characteristics of the local school desegregation decision; and (3) the actual utility of research on desegregation. The objectivity and methodology of sociologists of education apparently serve values of which they may be unaware. (Author/JM)",

There is also a difference between the early religious experiences of Blacks during the slave days and those Blacks living in the North during the same period. Many of the books listed make references to the religious conversions. The compiler contends that, historically, religion and the church have been the two major entities that have kept Black people and the Black community together. During slavery many Blacks expressed themselves in many ways to  show their belief in God. Many of the early Black leaders were deeply religious men and women. Even during contemporary times, the most articulated Black leaders were and are religious men and women. The outstanding Black leader of modern times was a Southern Baptist minister--Martin Luther King, Jr. The compiler asserts that the epitaph of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life shows us the way to solve out problems and destroy the chains of racial segregation and discrimination and live like brothers in this great world of ours.

Even though Black people have belonged largely to the Baptist and Methodist churches, many have joined and supported other religious organizations and cults. During the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960, Blacks added new denominations and cults to their membership, such as Christ's Sanctified Holy Church Colored, Fine Baptized Holiness Church of God of the Americas, House of God, The Pillar and  Ground of Truth, House of Prayer for All People, House of the Lord, Kodesh Church of Immanuel, The Latter House of the Lord, Apostolic Faith, National David Spiritual Temple of Christ Union, United Holy Church of America, Inc. and the Nation of Island.

Several suggestions are made regarding some relevant characteristics of quality of life. Economic affluence and level of consumption are not considered in this regard. Felt quality of life is considered predictable from a multiple correlation whose predictor variables include: (1) an emotionally stable and socially nurturant infancy and early childhood; (2) an interesting and challenging way of contributing to one's livelihood in the world of work; (3) reasonable security from random or capricious blows of fate and from irrational handicaps and hurdles based on racial, sexual and other prejudices; (4) pleasant and  nurturant physical and social surroundings; (5) a sense of identity; (6) self-respect; and, (7) a feeling that one has reasonable control of one's life direction. It is noted that although traditionally psychologists have focused attention on individual behavior, there has been in recent years an enormous increase in the number of service-providers in psychology. The professionals are expected to become more numerous in the future; the scientists are regarded as destined to decrease both in numbers and resources. (Author/JM)",

Within each subject area the listing is subdivided into a recommended section and a supplementary section. The recommended section consists of materials  which were evaluated as having more potential benefit and application for Comprehensive Health Planning Agencies than those listed in the more general, supplementary section. The bibliography is intended to be an inroad for providing technical assistance and continuing education to the Comprehensive Health Planning Agencies in Region X. The Technical Assistance and Continuing Education Program at the University of Washington is cited as the best place to obtain copies of many of these documents. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The New Orleans Parent Child Development Center Intervention Model hypothesizes a series of effects: the Child Development and Family Life Educators impart curricula designed to change mother's attitudes and behavior toward her child in ways which should encourage the development of competence in the child. The two single most important types of measures of program effectiveness are the mother-child interaction observations and the measures of child development. The New Orleans Parent Child Development Center, as a research and development undertaking, is unique in several ways: (1) Basic research is conducted as regards changes in mother's behavior. (2) Such changes are compared to repeated measurements of infants' development. (3) Both of the above unique research efforts are  used to evaluate a longitudinal intervention program. At the end of two years, there was meaningful advance by the center group infants relative to the serial control infants on four of five subscales of the Uzgiris-Hunt and on the Motor Scale of the Bayley administered at 19 and 25 months of age. These data are contrary to the bulk of previous literature. These significant findings of program effect do not result from group differences in socioeconomic status, basic mother's characteristics, or from differential attrition. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 1972 on a case involving changes in boundaries of a county school district in Virginia which had been operated as a dual school system. Two weeks after a federal district Court ordered a school-pairing plan, the Emporia City Council announced that city's intention to operate an independent school system. The Supreme Court forbade the breakaway. The same day the Court invalidated a North Carolina statute that authorized creation of a new school district for the city of Scotland Neck. The Supreme Court had not treated the extent of the power of federal courts to order remedies for segregation which would affect directly school districts other than the one at bar in a given case. If a formerly de jure segregated district contains at the time of  adjudication such a high per cent of blacks that meaningful racial mixing cannot take place because of the small per cent of whites attending the district's schools, does the federal Constitution require that adjacent districts heavily populated by whites participate in remediating the situation? By a five-to-four vote, on July 25, 1974, the Supreme Court in what has come to be known as the &quot;Detroit case&quot; answered, in effect, &quot;not if those surrounding districts were not themselves involved in discriminatory acts&quot;.

Section One, Public Service Equalization, notes that two major problems that are almost invariably encountered in public service litigation cases are the factual complexity of the cases themselves and the financial limitations of local governments. Section Two, The Current Scene, discusses the activities of such groups as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Inc., Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the UCLA Institute of Government and Public Affairs, and the American Civil Liberties Union, South Texas project. Sections Three through Nine deal with the educational parallel, legal problems and  strategies, inter-governmental remedies, strategic priorities, and an action agenda, respectively. Also included are four appendixes. Appendix A lists Documentary Resources available for Recording and Evaluating Disparities in the Provision of Municipal Facilities. Appendix B is a copy of Court Order in &quot;Hawkins vs. Town of Shaw&quot;. Appendix C is a Bibliography on the Evaluation and Delivery of Municipal Services.

        "description":"The major issue investigated in this paper is whether or not any change appears over a five-year peiod in the differences in performances between minority and non-minority students in that district. Since the relative performance advantage of non-minority students is frequently ascribed to their better backgrounds, socio-economic factors are held constant. The data used consist of test scores obtained for each student in the third, fifth, and seventh grades, plus a measure of the socio-economic status of that student's family. Multiple regression analysis is used. The study concludes that the test scores of minority students relative to those of non-minority students do not appear to change much over time. Although Anglo students score higher than Black or Spanish students,  socio-economic factors, while accounting for a significant portion of test-score differences, do not account for all racial/ethnic differences. The persistence of significant test-performance differences between Anglos and minorities over time leads one to conclude that the school system described in this study succeeded in maintaining the relative performance position of the three major racial/ethnic groups but did not substantially succeed in eliminating the performance deficiency exhibited by minority students.

        "description":"This paper examines the possibility that returns to various personal characteristics obtained from education differ among five Spanish surname ethnic groups as well as for Blacks and non-black, non-Spanish people (Anglos). Numerous studies have found differences in the returns that Blacks and Whites obtain from education, experience, migration, and other personal characteristics. To measure these differences in return, it is now common practice to run entirely separate regressions for Blacks and Whites; especially significant for policy have been findings that Black-White earnings differences stem not only from lower Black educational attainment, but also from lower Black returns to education. The data for this study came from the 1971 Current Population Survey. It was found that  in 1970 returns to education were 30 percent higher for men of Cuban and Central or South American origin than for non-Spanish, non-Black (Anglo) men, Puerto Rican men or other Spanish men. Black and Chicano men had returns of about 70 percent those of Anglo men. These differences are not explained by differences in nativity, mother tongue, years of education, or marital status. Differences in discrimination, quality of schooling, and class origin may be the causes, but data are insufficient to draw firm conclusions. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper uses data on earnings and education from the 1971 Current Population Survey to test three hypotheses of ethnic achievement and assimilation. The evidence does not support the hypothesis that differences among European ethnic groups have melted away during the three generatioons since the end of the second wave of immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. Statistically significant differences in both education and earnings persist. The differences in earnings have definitely been narrowing over time. However, the differences in earnings do not disappear when ethnic differences in education, location, age and marital status are taken into account. However, the differences that persist are not those that the melting pot hypothesis, or other theories, of social  mobility, would predict. The second wave groups, the more recent arrivals from supposedly inferior cultures, in many cases have higher average earnings with and without adjusting for other factors than the first wave groups. Although differences in education and earnings persist among European ethnic groups, contrary to the melting pot hypothesis, these differences completely contradict theories that predict that later groups or Southern and Eastern European groups should do worse than earlier or Northern and Western European groups.

It determines that program objectives match student training in occupations, that the best choice of occupations in which to train students has been made, and that the number and variety of programs in various regions fit those regions' needs. The elements of a targeting system for occupational education are: a body of information from which job market conditions and the effectiveness of occupational education can be determined, together with the processes required to utilize this information and make decisions. Topics covered in the report are: design considerations for a regional targeting system  (information elements and design concepts, identifying service regions, assessing present and future regional manpower requirements, measuring system effectiveness, measuring the effects of population mobility), a proposed regional targeting system (design approach, an overview, information sources and software requirements, targeting system information outputs, using information outputs for first-level targeting decisions, further system design tasks), and other applications of the targeting system.

Concepts to develop (grades K-6), how to use the guide, a primary philosophy, and lower elementary special education objectives are outlined. Career education activities for special education are organized as they relate to three personal and world-of-work oriented objectives. Units are provided in the areas of: seeing similarities and differences in self and others; understanding own strengths and weaknesses; developing realistic values; accepting and respecting self and others; being dependable and responsible; good sportsmanship; understanding that people earn  money to pay for their needs; appreciating that work has dignity; exploring work areas within the student's future capabilities; understanding how school subjects relate to the world of work; and understanding how positive attitudes are related to the world of work. Each unit is keyed to a broad objective, broken down by specific behavioral objectives, for each of which there are suggested activities, teaching techniques, and resource materials. Activities include story telling, field trips, writing, filmstrips, game and role playing, and oral reports. Evaluation forms are appended. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"The Personal Orientation Inventory (POI) was administered to 108 rural disadvantaged students entering the six-State regional Mountain-Plains program. Results indicate a low degree of self-actualization on all scales versus normal adults with no differences observed by sex and only one among States. Ethnic group differences are, however, observed on four scales. In light of Maslow's later conceptualizations, and the nature of the Mountain-Plains program, self-actualization per se does not appear relevant as a general in-program objective for direct attention in educational programs with disadvantaged young adults despite the highly significant differences observed. Rather, self-actualization is seen as relevant only as an ultimate objective for which only foundation work can be  accomplished. (Author)",

The researchers propose the creation of working foundries to serve as vocational training centers and laboratories, where experienced workers could upgrade their skills, young students working with them could learn job skills in their first foundry experience, and research could be carried out. Three stages for the development of the proposed centers are outlined, extending to 1981 and beyond. Attention is paid to the physical lay-out of such centers (the arrangement of foundry, laboratories, and classrooms), and to the educational organization of the centers, which would serve the many small foundry  industries in Brazil with the ultimate goal of increasing the nation's output of foundry products at an increasing rate, in order to compete successfully with other developed nations on the world market.

All private, nonprofit organizations were included whose prime reason for existence was to offer services, or to serve as a vehicle for association, to members of the general public. Six groups of organizations were surveyed: churches; religious other than churches; Y's (YMCA, YWCA, WMHA, and YWHA) and Red Cross chapters; civic; social service; and cultural and other organizations. Of the 4,650 units selected more than a fourth (28.5 percent) indicated they conducted adult education activities of the type requested. Results were obtained on the number of participating  organizations (over 75 percent were churches), size of programs, location, courses and registration, participant characteristics (58 percent women, 14 percent black, median age 38.3), teaching staff (78 percent volunteers, 22 percent paid, totaling more than 654,000), methods of operation, teaching methods, and sources of income. The survey showed that 321,000 adult education programs were offered by 66,770 organizations to nearly 11 million adults in 1972. A detailed description of the survey methodology, the survey instrument, and a bibliography are appended, and make up about one-half of the document. (BP)",

The modular design program, for 16-18 year olds, is characterized by its greater subject matter choice, open door policy, seasonality, free flow of student movement, secondary or continuing education levels, individualization, and enrichment. A step-by-step procedure is offered  to help establish such a program, including a list of personnel responsibilities and duties. Conducting the program involves preparation, module introduction, work experience programs, and youth leadership development activities. Different methods for program evaluation are proposed; forms for both a student and a teacher evaluation are included.

Underlying the system proposed here is the conviction that American adults, like children and young people, should have an opportunity for the maximum development of their talents and abilities, and that a wide variety of learning options should be provided to make this possible. An overview of the current status of adult education shows that it consists of a large number of disjointed, uncoordinated efforts, which can be subdivided into seven distinct functional  components (graduate; baccalaureate degree; associate degree; advanced, intermediate, and primary basic; and occupational), plus special interest instruction for leisure time activities. The needed new system of adult education should be based on these seven elements, and should be a State function, centralized in administration but decentralized in operation, making the maximum use of existing staff and facilities rather than replacing the existing system, as illustrated by the proposed new system for Massachusetts.

The guide provides a flexible framework to provide experiences that will support the learning principles needed to attain the required knowledge, attitudes, and skills essential to productive living integrated into the existing curriculum. A brief explanation is offered of career education--its definition, philosophy for the secondary level, specific secondary objectives, summary of career education objectives, and the need for career education. The needs of the students, involvement in the world of work, and classroom facilities should set the stage for the selection of  resource units to be used. Activities are suggested for use within the home economics areas of child care service, clothing and textiles, dual role of homemaker and wage earner, food service, home and family service, interior design, job aspects, and self awareness. Each broad objective includes specific behavioral objectives, a suggested subject area and grade level, learning activities, suggested teaching techniques, resource materials, and worksheets. Supplemental materials are appended. (Author/BP)",

The manual opens with definitions of a task inventory and other terms, and an overview of the procedure. The first six steps involve the overall construction of an initial task inventory (define scope of performance situation; locate written sources of activity statements; draft task and duty statements; obtain knowledgeable consultants to review, edit and group items; and pilot test items). The second six steps cover the acquisition of information about each task (determine task information needed; determine appropriate job incumbent sources; prepare and pilot test questions; develop sampling plan and analysis  design; print questionnaire; and administer questionnaires). The final five steps describe the analysis of the task data derived from the previous steps (develop inventory record procedures; key punch task inventory data; compute general summary statistics; record additional tasks written in by respondents; and prepare report of analysis results). Each of these three sections concludes with selftest items, designed to help the readers evaluate their learning of the concepts introduced. Duty statements, background information questions, the inventory and instructions, and sample letters are appended. (JB)",

The elementary INFOE (Information Needed for Occupational Education) component was selected for use in the study with the career information presentation being limited to the business and office occupations. Limited to sixth grade students in randomly selected classes in rural Appalachian East Tennessee, the study's experimental design was made up of two experimental groups and one control group, totaling 33 intact sixth grade classes (1,104 subjects, 594 female, 510 male). Means and standard deviations in each of the treatment groups indicated a significant difference in teaching and  recall effectiveness favoring microform treatment over hardcopy treatment. Direct costs of using the microform medium of instruction were significantly higher than hardcopy materials, but maintaining the microform program was less costly than maintaining the hardcopy program.

A one-page large print questionnaire was administered by a staff person except in the cases where a copy of the questionnaire had been made available through a newspaper article and was filled out independently. Of the 9,067 persons 65 years or older in the district, 418 responded to the questionnaire. A segment (from 13 to 36 percent) of the respondents indicated an interest in one or more of the 13 retirement living subject matter areas. Various cultural events and short courses available at Schoolcraft College were of some interest to respondents--films and plays ranked highest at 22  percent; sculpture was lowest at 2 percent. Half the respondents indicated a preference for daytime programs; only 10 percent preferred evening programs. Preference was also expressed for programs in the neighborhood. Transportation and financial assistance needs were also investigated. On the basis of the survey, proposals for programs were offered.

The complexity of the recruitment and selection task, and substantial slippage resulting from sloppy recruitment procedures and the fact that the staff attempted local as well as non-local placements, are revealed in the fact that only 202 of 279 persons interviewed actually reported to potential relocation jobs. Firm offer of a job appropriate to skills and expectations, i.e., careful job development, as well as a minimum of bureaucratic snarls in the funding process, were crucial in effecting  successful relocation. By time of interview all but 51 of 152 actual relocatees had returned home, most because of layoff or anticipated layoff, emphasizing the crucial role of job duration in successful relocation. Regression analysis indiated that relocation success was associated with two principal explanatory variables: appropriate job availability and prior skill training. (Author)",

The nine developmental tasks identified by Havighurst as being the main tasks facing this group were used as an outline for a discussion of tasks and characteristics leading to better understanding of children in this age group. The child was also studied in terms of year by year developmental characteristics. Some States have already initiated programs for the six- to eight-year old group, and there is support for such programs at the national 4-H level. The study identified 10 characteristics of the children which must be considered in program planning. They pertain to learning processes, peer  relationships, and needs. Eleven subject and activity areas of interest were identified, and topical interests tend to suggest that a creative educational program could be developed for the particular age group.

Some areas should serve as a form of recognition to special groups, others can serve as orientation aids, and yet others already fulfilling their objectives need some beautifying effort--lights, pictures, or super-graphics.

The Council maintains the proposed Rule is unprecedentedly severe and contrary to the public interest in its approach to proprietary vocational and home study schools. The NHSC regards the Rule as being based upon unstated biased, inaccurate, unfair and discriminatory assumptions concerning the nature and worth of private vocational education in general and home study in particular. To illustrate and document those assertions, part one (seven pages) shows that home study has a long reputation as an important and valuable  component of the educational system; part two (14 pages) shows how home study already is covered by Federal and State legislation and regulation; part three (four pages) shows how the FTC has failed to make clear the basis and purpose of the Rule; and part four (100 pages) presents a detailed analysis on an item-by-item basis of the Rule's defects which require its rejection.

In section 2 the methodology which characterizes the available scientific manpower forecasts is critically examined, concentrating on three kinds of forecasts: (1) the academic requirements  for new doctorates, (2) the manpower requirements for specific occupations, and (3) the supplies of college educated workers. Finally in section 3 attention is directed to the labor market for Ph.D.'s reviewed with reference to the National Science Foundation projections of doctorate supplies and requirements in 1980. The author outlines a model describing the investment on the part of students in obtaining a doctorate degree and the demand on the part of universities for graduate students, in terms of a market equilibrium.

The study, using an inventory based upon a national sample of ABE teachers by Donald Mocker, attempts to identify, classify, and rank the competencies, behaviors, and attitudes of Iowa ABE educators. The listing of the 291 &quot;competencies&quot;, categorized into 12 groupings combining three levels (knowledge, behavior, and attitude) with four categories (adult education, curriculum, ABE learner, and instructional process), indicate what competencies ABE educators in Iowa felt were appropriate. The demographic data of the  Iowa respondents (experience and education), the listings of the ranked competencies, and a comparison of the rankings of competencies by teachers and administrators are presented and discussed in the succeeding sections. The report concludes that knowledge and behavior regarding the Iowa learner, curriculum, and instruction were ranked as major priorities by Iowa educators.

The program is further described in remarks prepared to accompany a slide presentation: The first year's program took three weeks, during which participants gathered for intensive training. During the first week, participants produced films depicting workers, workers' feelings, and work environments. One month later, an intensive one-week  seminar taught the elements of the Thematic Resources and Activities for Career Education (TRACE); each participant developed an instructional unit in his subject area, infused with career education activities. For two months, the group implemented, evaluated, and refined their units in their classrooms. The third week's training was in human relations and change-agentry, using the Human Development Program small group process model, to equip the teachers to effect change in the attitudes and practices of their colleagues. Funded for its second year, the Institute counts this &quot;multiplier effect&quot; a high success. (Author/AJ)",

Stressing the need for educators to change in order to keep abreast of educational developments, researchers adapted and administered an attitude scale, the Comprehensive Career Education (CCE) Staff Development Questionnaire, to 577 teachers in a large southern school district. The questionnaire measured teachers' attitudes to career education and also to change. Teachers fell into three classes: those enthusiastic about change, those indifferent to change, and those resistive to change. Teachers identified as not being change-oriented were asked to participate in a seminar focusing on changing their attitudes to career education. A random sample of 60 change-resistive teachers  were assigned equally to three treatment conditions: an attitude change workshop, a career education curriculum unit, and a control group. Participants in the attitude change workshop were permitted to self-elect either a pro or con position and then to maintain it during the three day workshop.

This workshop was a cooperative effort of city and county staff to learn methods for integrating career education into the regular school program. The workshop design is briefly discussed, followed by an outline of the objectives of the planning commission, and the importance, assumptions, scope, and limitations of the effort to introduce the new career education program. Three questionnaires were used to evaluate the workshop: (1) a 20-statement &quot;Attitudes Toward Career Education&quot;  questionnaire, administered before and after the workshop and showing an increase from one to four percent in the &quot;strongly agree&quot; category; (2) a 10-question &quot;Final Evaluation of SPACE Workshop by Participants&quot;, administered following the workshop to determine the effectiveness of workshop activities, with field trips to industry ranking first; and (3) a 32-item followup administered one year later, relating to the effectiveness of workshop activities. Broad conclusions and recommendations are based on the questionnaire responses. The three questionnaires are appended. (BP)",

The material is a compilation of the author's extensive experience in this relatively new field with school children, veterans, and those in various rehabilitation centers, and, therefore, contains little documentation. Both evaluation and work adjustment, two interrelated activities within the total vocational evaluation process, are divided into stages: the initial evaluation pinpointing occupation and ability, work adjustment or adaptability and an extended evaluation building upon ability with training and practice. Athorough research program would determine areas of potential employment in communities, develop job analyses and accurately test  workers for various jobs. The first eight chapters briefly focus on the mechanics of the evaluation process (the evaluation unit, the evaluator, standardized tests, simulated work, on-the-job training, initial evaluation, work adjustment, extended evaluation). The next three chapters describe 75 activities illustrating the procedures (staffing and reporting, activities for testing the client, initial evaluation and those for extended evaluation). Chapter Twelve (Enter John Doe) is an application of the discussion using a fictitious person, illustrating the author's main points. (Author/JB)",

The questions and a summary of responses to them are: (1) What role does the Federal Dollar play? VEA funds do not necessarily play a catalytic role; Office of Education monitoring has been inadequate. (2) How is vocational education planned? State and local plans reflect compliance rather than planning; systematic ongoing assessment of needs does not take place; multiple jurisdictions  operate in virtual isolation; advisory council evaluations are limited; data for evaluation is inadequate or unused. (3) How are Federal funds distributed? VEA specifies criteria; State distribution practices do not reflect local needs and resources. (4) How are training resources used? VEA supports maximum use of training resources in the community; several factors limit use of existing resources. (5) Is training related to employment? Changing manpower needs require changing programs; practices occur which limit the relevancy of training programs. (SA)",

The year-round program, conducted at about 80 different locations in Philadelphia, involved 100 11th grade students and 100 different employers. The program consisted of four major elements: (1) a governance structure, (2) an evaluation plan, (3) guidance and counseling activities, and (4) an instructional program. Central to the model was the instructional program of: (1) general education, (2) explorative education (career and life skills), and (3) specialized education (career and life skills). Explorative education proved  to be the most successful aspect of the model, while general education caused severe operational problems. A central conclusion was that a &quot;pure&quot; employer-based model is feasible only on a small, experimental scale due to employer unwillingness and inability to provide general education independent of the public schools. A modified prototype involving career skills, career guidance, and career development units will be developed in the next contract period; students will participate in the program part-time to supplement their educational program in their home school.

Instruction is offered in industrial materials (wood, metals, and plastic ranking as the top three), power, and visual communications (drafting offered most frequently, followed by graphic arts). Class size usually is in the 11-16 student range or the 17-21 student range. 1970-71 enrollment of girls in the programs was about 5 percent, but that is expected to change. Overhead projectors are the most frequently-used supporting instructional device. A consensus prevails that industrial arts relates more  closely to math and science and fine arts than to any other disciplines. Career information and information pertaining to local industry is most often conveyed through regular classes. An increase in the need for additional industrial arts teachers was estimated, and the areas of greatest need were specified.

        "description":"The preliminary study explores the feasibility of a voucher system for purchase of skill training by participants in the Work Incentive Program (WIN) and describes the Portland, Oregon voucher system. Time limits on vouchers, voucherable occupations, dollar limits on vouchers, eligibility of clients, eligibility of vendors, timing and financial assistance for voucher decisions, and client and counselor role content are discussed. Data on personal characteristics of 167 voucher clients (about one-third of those enrolled in the 1974 local WIN program) are compared to data on 161 clients who had taken regular WIN training in Portland in 1973. This section contains tables and discussion comparing the two groups with reference to occupations and the schools, the training occupations,  the training institutions, length and costs of training, and counselor experience with the voucher programs. Conclusions deal with attractiveness of the program, clients' decisions and levels of occupational choice, preference of training schools, use of allowable time and money, and cost comparison. Conclusions point generally to administrative feasibility, and plans are outlined briefly for followup studies. (MDW)",

This involvement, and concern over reported abuses, led to the hearings and other investigations which provided the information reported here. Background information about proprietary vocational schools and their students opens the report. A summary and conclusions section follows, outlining problems and abuses in proprietary school education and training and making recommendations. The bulk of the document provides a discussion  of: the nature of proprietary education; potential problems in proprietary education, including the scope of proprietary school problems and school abuses as defined by the Federal Trade Commission; an analysis of problem areas, (including course and instructional quality, low completion ratios, advertising, refund policies, school collapses, and principal areas for concern); and safeguards against abuses, (including accreditation, State licensing, The Veterans Administration, Office of Education, The Federal Trade Commission, and other influences).

Two other chapters suggest methods for determining employers' and students' needs for cooperative vocational education and suggest plans for meeting these needs. Three chapters deal with implementing plans for: public relations (including a suggested eight point plan and the use of media); instruction in the school (including five teaching methods and the use  of youth organizations); and community laboratories (including criteria for selecting, establishing, and evaluating training stations, and guidelines for complying with appropriate laws). Another chapter analyzes essential elements of the cooperative program including staffing; facilities, equipment, and materials; and program development. A final chapter suggests ways of improving cooperative vocational education in its administrative structure, professional development of teacher-coordinators, instructional materials, and program evaluation.

Attempts have been made to: link adult education to major developmental and productive activities through programs such as the Farmers Training and Functional Literacy Project to increase agricultural productivity; use mass media to communicate programs and agricultural information; develop library services; develop voluntary organizations to carry out pilot projects and encourage public concern; and initiate adult education in urban areas for industrial workers to promote trade union leadership and provide access to continual training and  education. Youth involvement in adult education promotes participation in community development, and adult education in universities integrates both the formal and nonformal education approaches. The period of the Indian Fifth Plan (1974-1979), crucial to the development and reorientation of adult education, demands increased financial allocations, the integration of adult education in the educational system, the entry of nonformal education facilities at all levels of education, the emphasis of mass participation in programs, the development of urban programs, and new programs for the staffing and training of personnel.

The results of this study indicated that job involvement, a basic orientation toward work, may be affected by individual differences brought to the job and by characteristics of the job situation. The results also indicated that job involvement may not be an appropriate variable for moderating the relationships between job characteristics and employee responses to the job. These results were discussed in relation to previous research and theory, and suggestions were offered for future research in this area. A list  of references concerned with workers' job involvement is attached. Three tables offer statistical correlations of job involvement with background factors and values of workers surveyed in this study and of correlations between decision-making participation and job attitudes for rank and file workers and for managers.

What are the services which adult education can deliver to help adults individually, and collectively, resolve their problems? For many low-income adults, the problems of high death and unemployment rates, low life expectancy rates, limited housing opportunities, unsafe environmental surroundings, and deficient food and nutrition give rise to a value system different from the middle-class orientation of the prevalent adult education participant population and the adult education profession. The profession has the responsibility of responding to the special needs of low-income adults by helping to prepare them with the credentials and skills necessary for optimum entry and  progression in the labor market. The profession must also accept differing value systems and ensure that the intended clients are actively involved in the planning, development, operation, and evaluation of programs, and must design new programs and restructure existing ones to meet their needs. The profession, which includes adult educators in business and industry and the armed forces as well as those in educational institutions, has the talent. Most of the programs required to meet the educational needs of low-income adults already exist. All that is needed is the commitment. (JR)",

        "description":"Three problems currently facing education are: reduced public confidence and reduced willingness to support budgets for all government agencies; unnecessarily expensive public education; and no recognized way to determine if an educational program is cost effective. A realistic system of management by objectives may be the best defense against all three problems, but it must be rejected as a system for directly evaluating the performance of administrators, teachers, or other employees. An examination of measurable and unmeasurable objectives and an identification of the constraints to learning lead to this conclusion: when a faculty member and administrator discuss the output of classes (units earned by students) each semester, and their discussion leads to increasing the output  and reducing the cost, this becomes the essence of a management by objectives system. Institutional objectives should also relate to the spectrum of service functions, and faculty should be motivated to work toward a management by objectives system. This process needs to be monitored by an outside educational auditor who can assure the public that a statistically reliable selection of program objectives has been achieved as reported. The best process seems to be an institutional objectives approach to management by objectives with strong emphasis on increasing output and reducing costs. (Author/NH)",

To arrive at a solution to these problems, a philosophy statement and realistic measurable objectives were formulated. The philosophy statement and seven product-centered objectives were submitted to a cost and quality evaluation committee and the New York Board of Education for discussion. The objectives are to be evaluated in two stages. Phase 1 was the collection of data from occupational program graduates prior to their graduation and covered the first objectives: student satisfaction with the program, whether or not they would repeat the program, and determination of  future plans to work or receive further training in their area of specialization. (The results showing satisfactory completion of objectives are presented in the report.) Phase 2 will consist of a six-month followup of the graduates and will deal with the four remaining objectives: successful completion of licensing examination, full-time employment, employment in area of specialization, and employment in an area related to the area of specialization.

The TOPOPS model is an aggregate model which simulates officer accession and training and is directed at optimizing officer procurement in terms of either minimizing cost or maximizing accession quality over a five-year time frame. Optimization is constrained by total production requirements by officer type (e.g., pilot, navigator, etc.), a number of policy restrictions, and the specific characteristics of the various commissioning sources and training programs (including attrition rates and career turnover). The report also contains a simplified mathematical description and hypothetical sample problem. Completed data input forms and  the five computer-generated reports for the sample problem are presented in the appendix. (Author)",

The first part of the document focuses on developing resource units, and offers information on goals and objectives, on the integration of career education into the existing curriculum, on occupational clusters, and on the unit format. Steps to be followed in developing career education modules are outlined. Among the key concepts of career education which are exemplified in the notes are these: Career education focuses on learning experiences related to self-understanding, educational endeavors, and career potential; concrete experiences are utilized to illustrate abstract concepts; and,  career education provides experiences related to a sample of occupations at all levels. Decision-making experiences are provided, but students are not forced to make early career decisions. The second part of the document is comprised of exemplary career education modules incorporating those concepts, for use at primary, intermediate, junior high school, and high school levels. These sample units were developed by 203 educators participating in career education curriculum development classes sponsored by a Regional Education Service Agency (RESA) in an eight-county area in West Virginia.

Section 1 reviews age cycles of adulthood as well as changing career patterns for men and women. Also examined are changes with age in leisure and interest patterns, anxieties, interpersonal relations, sense of time, with special importance attached to recent research on biophysical maturation in adults. Of significance in intelligence testing is the vast range of ability at each age level. Adult losses maturational decline are compensated by experience, knowledge, and wisdom. Section 4 deals with research distinguishing continuing education participants from nonparticipants and points to strength of  motivation as the key variable. Three constant factors of adult programs found across nations were that participants tend to be younger, more educated, and hold more professional jobs than the national mean. Other document sections pertain to institutional role, traditional practices, and evaluation methods of continuing education. Section 6 focuses on adult reaction to change and the tendency for an increasing level of determinism. Two programs of change described are training in achievement motivation by D. McClelland and the cultural literacy programs of P. Freire. (EA)",

Auckland University developed programs in Maori adult education in a bicultural setting, and recognition has evolved of the needs of Maori people for education in coping skills and in Maori language and culture. Best methods and techniques in Maori adult education require facilities and leaders sympathetic to Maori culture. Various agencies represent present and potential sources of adult education. A Working Party of the National Council of Adult Education responded to the need for assessing effectiveness and extent of present-day Maori adult education, and directed its recommendations specifically to New Zealand departments,  agencies, and organizations. Although there are a large number of agencies providing services, recommendations sought to strengthen key agencies which would assist and advise others, rather than to reduce the number of agencies. The proposed solution was a structural network that would involve certain secondary schools and a Department of Education adviser to provide liaison. A functional network would then involve positions and agencies on the community, regional, and national levels. Other agencies, some existing and some proposed, would provide special services and resources. (MDW)",

Chapter 2 consists of first-hand accounts by educational specialists of efforts in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East as well as accomplishments in a single nation, the Soviet Union. It includes tentative statistics and reveals forces at work and the institutions and classes of persons concerned. Chapter 3 through articles and excerpts on major theoretical issues, reflects the tasks of fundamental  education from a world-wide perspective of cultural values, social analysis, and fundamental assumptions (minimum standards of living, adult education principles, priorities). The fourth chapter outlines seven major issues of fundamental education policy and method: (1) scope, (2) content, (3) governmental and State role, (4) language problem, (5) provision of reading material, (6) mass communication, and (7) motivation for learning. A final chapter by the editorial committee recommends establishment of a panel of fundamental education and suggested action guidelines. (EA)",

Opticians engaged in the manufacture or production of optical equipment are not included in the report. Males outnumber females in the profession by a ratio of approximately 8:1 among active opticians; however female representation is increasing, particulary among the younger opticians. Median age was 45 years for males and 39 years for females; median length of time in the occupation was 23 years for males and  9 years for females. Education and training of opticians corresponds to increased education of the general population. Opticians are unequally distributed geographically with more than one-half employed in the Middle Atlantic, East North Central, and South Atlantic States; the ratio of opticians to the population is also unequally distributed. While retail optical establishments employed the majority of opticians, 3 of every 10 were self-employed. Appendixes include supplementary survey information. (EA)",

These problems have implications for the largely minority-group COP participants. The development of career education has  been rapid but uneven, and its future depends on the commitment of schools and communities to solving its problems. (A reading list is appended.) (MDW)",

The results of two surveys provided the data on which the suggestions are based. The first obtained responses from the DE supervisors in 47 States to a series of questions relating to their perceptions of space and equipment needs for a DE classroom. The second, covering similar areas, elicited a 95 percent response from DE coordinators in Nebraska. Although individual classroom and program needs vary, some items were felt to be essential by most supervisors and coordinators, and should be considered when planning new facilities. Emphasis was placed on adequate  space, including storage space, laboratory space, display areas, and equipment (display equipment, sign machines, aduiovisual, student tables, and cash register). The DE classroom does not need a quiet location, and may actually benefit from being situated in a high traffic area. The cost is comparable to that of a typical classroom, particularly if the possibility of rental of equipment from local stores in return for free advertising is considered. Many DE suppliers will assist with classroom layouts. (SA)",

The Career Awareness modules consist of slides and tapes, interviewing  techniques, an elementary dictionary of occupational titles, and instructional units. The instructional units (continued in this document) cover language arts, mathematics, social studies, reading, music or art, and contain behavioral objectives, suggested activities for the teacher, information sheets, student activity sheets, and student and teacher evaluation sheets. The units on the K-3 level attempt to prepare the students for job responsibility, to enable them to experience success, to acquire basic skills, and to identify positive traits of workers. For the intermediate grades, the objectives focus on building on basic skills and doing independent research. (JB)",

        "description":"The study examines the economic implications in Wisconsin of the 1972 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guideline which requires employers to treat maternity leave as a temporary disability. First, the static cost of the maternity leave guideline to employers is estimated for the State of Wisconsin. Second, some examination of the economic response to this cost is attempted. Finally, the relationships between maternity leave and other fringe benefits, wages, and the age distribution of employed females are examined using hospital data. The total cost of the maternity leave guideline for Wisconsin ranges from $4.4 million to $12.8 million annually. Although this cost is not excessive, it may add 3-11 percent to the cost of providing compensated temporary disability plans.  Data for hospitals in Wisconsin were examined for realtionships between maternity leave, other fringe benefits, age distribution of employed females, and wages. It was found that the proportion of nurses ages 17 to 39, the main childbearing years, is inversely related to maternity leave. Maternity leave is not a substitute or complement to other fringe benefits. Maternity leave tends to be negatively related to wages.

Growing shortages of skilled manpower in many occupational areas in addition to unemployment in many job skills are changing work patterns and basic industries.

The 10 recommendations offered by the council to vocational educators urge they: survey job needs and opportunities in communities for retraining program development; provide accelearted courses to retrain unemployed workers for available jobs; coordinate programs with other skill  training facilities; emphasize new programs utilizing community resources to train workers for new occupations and development of curricula; phase out obsolete programs; revise institutional procedures, schedules, and curriculum for greater flexibility in retraining and outreach programs; utilize vocational funds for the disadvantaged; shift funds to vocational education and basic adult education; emphasize home economics education; inventory continuing job opportunities in agribusiness and ways to meet food needs.

It is one of five workshop manuals developed to assist State and local agencies involved in the development of programs for coping with the drinking-driver problem. Workshop goals include: encouraging communication between law enforcement professionals, developing cooperative plans, and motivating implementation of these plans. Activities include: small group exercises, discussions, an examination of two typical DWI case studies, an alcohol awareness seminar involving breath analysis, and followup  discussions of current approaches to the drinking-driver problem. The manual is organized into three parts: (1) introduction, containing an overview, manual synopsis, and workshop staffing suggestions, (2) governor's representative and chairman workshop materials, and (3) appendixes consisting of preworkshop instructions, group moderator workshop materials, and miscellaneous materials. These include information on audiovisual equipment, instructions, evaluation forms, and followup materials. The manual is designed to be self-executing and includes sample letters, fully executed speeches, discussion guidelines, evaluation instruments, and participant selection criteria. (MW)",

The community participation on the steering committees in all  four low-income areas created a broad range of learning experiences and articulated the needs of the communities. Comparing the summary of program intent with the survey results from the questionnaires (115 responses, reflecting a 34.6 percent response rate) and interviews, it was found that there were no discrepancies between the goals and actual practice. Recommendations pointed out several weaknesses: the need to recruit more community leaders, more emphasis on application of skills and knowledge, more technical assistance for projects, and the institution of continuous program evaluation from the inception of the program.

Section B presents resource materials for educators revolving around these eight functions. Section C  examines methods of assessment and goal setting and strategies for the development of local action plans. The report on the use of these committees is divided into six sections covering: problems relating to advisory committees, methodology, the extent to which committees are used, the relationship between the current level of involvement and the perceived level of utilization that advisory committee members project, and comparisons between secondary and post secondary committees.

Tables A through D and other charts illustrate the data taken from the survey on general demographic and professional characteristics of optometrists; characteristics of optometric practice (primary and secondary activities, patient services, and volume of patient-care activity); and the  utilization of supplementary personnel (secretaries, receptionists, general optometric assistants, optometric technicians, dispensing opticians, contact lens technicians, and optical technicians). Comparisons between the practice characteristics of ophthalmologists and optometrists surveyed in 1968 reveal a substantial overlap between services rendered by both and their need for supplementary personnel.

Hundreds of students, teachers, administrators, parents, and community people were asked to respond to 35 statements categorized into five areas: awareness, development, competence, core, and responsibility. The results for each statement in the survey are presented in tables which comprise a large part of the document. The Yonkers Career Development Project combined this data with other relevant research found in the literature to generate a conceptual career educational model illustrated in the document; the specific data obtained in the survey generated seven goals of career  education which provides the model's bulwark. They served as the framework from which behavioral objectives, tailored specifically to meet the individual needs of students, were identified. A listing of these instructional objectives makes up most of the remainder of the document. An historical and philosophical overview of career education introduces the project survey; a very brief summary of the project concludes the document. (AJ)",

        "description":"The monograph examines the efficacy of using career education as an organizing theme around which education can be unified and by which the relevance of education can be restored to a larger number of persons. A systems approach is recommended; systematic efforts begin with an examination of the student's level of development and proceed on the basis of personal variables. It is recommended that only those teachers who are willing should be involved initially, working in small groups in a workshop atmosphere. The key to teacher enthusiasm is involvement in development. The Yonkers experience has strongly indicated that career education becomes most viable and significant when it is offered continuously through the vehicle of total infusion in the curriculum. An approach developed  by the Yonkers project, Reading Improvement Through Career Education (RICE), proved valuable and is described briefly in the monograph as one process involving teachers in the development of products which specified and measured curriculum objectives and were heavily infused with career education and reading skill objectives. Teachers trained in the RICE approach report more personal satisfaction and student success than do teachers without this training. The monograph concludes with five pages of career education curriculum ideas. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"The monograph is intended to demonstrate how the production of a slidetape show can become a multidisciplinary exercise that helps students become creative users of information, rather than passive receivers of information. Career education and audiovisual media instruction are both cross-disciplinary in nature and can be infused into existing curricula, without drastic alterations in instructional plans; the objective: to help youngsters look beyond the production to understand the process involved in putting it together, i.e., the cooperation of individuals who contribute talents and skills to the overall effort. The method has been classroom-tested by the staff of the Yonkers Career Education Project, and is presented step by step in the monograph. In the first phase of the  process, students analyze commercially prepared filmstrips to prepare a list of job descriptions for persons who participate in producing them; in the second, the class organizes and produces its own, first slidetape show. The monograph covers materials, script, location, photo editing, graphics, and recording. Proceeding to more sophisticated productions, the monograph describes an illustrative project entitled \"Workers in Our Community,\" and again offers step-by-step suggestions for later student productions, infused with career education concepts such as labor specialization.

This approach leads to the establishment of an individualized career development program tailored to the special needs of that student. Feedback systems for readjusting prescriptive plans are incorporated on a short-term basis through pre- and posttesting of specific activities. Long-term gains can be observed by a periodic readministration of the complete diagnostic battery. The ultimate aim of the diagnostic prescriptive plan is to provide the type of educational program that will lead to the special needs student's  employability in an occupation which he prefers and in which he feels the greatest degree of self-confidence and competency. Educational characteristics of the mentally retarded, characteristics of an educational program for the mentally retarded, and characteristics of a career education program for the mentally handicapped are outlined, and 16 specific adaptations of a career education program to suit it to the needs of the mentally retarded are suggested.

        "description":"Career education's goal of increasing career opportunities is admirable and sound, but the usual approach (interjecting career information into existing curricula) will not in itself increase students' opportunities, for existing factors limit students' perceptions of what constitutes a real career choice. The conflict between women's changed role and curriculum relevance can be resolved by gearing programs to present alternatives and a process with which to deal with them. A program that examines the barriers to women's full career expression can give an example of the problem and strategies for change. The most pervasive example of sexism in schools is found in textbooks and media; the role-models presented limit both sexes' creative self-expression and development. Role models  in the schools for young girls are limited to teachers, for decision-making positions are usually held by men. Sexism in schools is further exhibited in sex-segregated courses and in sports. Needed are more awareness and sensitivity on the part of teachers and administrators; awareness, not change, of attitudes, is the first objective. Inservice courses can help educators become aware of stereotyping and its results; each district, at least, should have a task force on educational equality, with machinery for enforcing its recommendations.

Younger, less educated youth relied more heavily on informal channels. Increasing age and education led to a slight shift from informal to formal channels, although informal still dominated. As white youth matured they relied less on friends and relatives and schools and more on formal methods except schools. For both races increased education led to a rise in the use of formal techniques, particularly schools. While blacks relied more heavily on friends and relatives than did whites, race was less important than social class with higher social class youth showing a greater use of formal channels. Youth using formal channels  tended to locate white-collar jobs, particularly professional and clerical; those relying on informal had a greater chance of locating blue-collar jobs. Whites found the highest \"quality\" jobs through private agencies, newspapers, and the \"other\" channel. Among both races friends and relatives generally led to lower quality jobs. An extensive review of the literature on job-finding is included. (Author)",

Costs of both formal and on-the-job training (OJT) are considered, as well as the returns from training for first-time enlisted personnel. After a description of the conceptual framework the paper describes the pilot test of the method, conducted among Air Force Aircraft Maintenance Specialists at Norton Air Force Base, California. Data consisted of performance measures of 64 trainees based on 12 supervisors' estimates, and background information on the trainees. Regression analysis of 13 variables concerning the relationship between OJT costs and the personal attribute data demonstrated that OJT costs are a function of the quality and  quantity of prior education, prior civilian job experience, and ability. Regression analysis applied to alternative specifications of the model yielded similar results and further research studies were planned. The study concludes that fundamental changes in military manpower resulting from the all-volunteer force have increased the relative cost of training inexperienced personnel, and that this change may necessitate the military's seeking major increases in retention rates or adopting new training policies.

It was necessary that each school district adopt a set of minimum performance objectives for each program to retain the district's priority for program funding. The document provides an overview, guidelines for writing performance objectives, instructions for writing a performance objectives adoption report, a sample adoption report, an action index, blank forms for use in writing and submitting objectives, and the USOE Code Extracts for the writing of performance objectives. The document lists all the recommended minimum vocational technical performance objectives for the areas  of: agriculture, distributive education, health, consumer and homemaking, occupational home economics, office, technical, trade and industrial, and employability skills. In each of these areas the occupational designation and a USOE code number are followed by the performance objectives stated in terms of topics, conditions, performance and criteria. (PB)",

        "description":"The study was conducted to determine the influence of current parental occupations upon the career objectives of secondary students in Wyoming, including variables related to sex and to mother's employment. The study also sought to delineate the career clusters in which there was scant parental occupation and few students' career objectives, to provide guidelines for career education personnel. Among 18 conclusions (based on a survey of 1,462 students in 19 high schools) are these: boys' career objectives identify more with their fathers' occupations than girls' with mothers'; few girls state \"housewife\" as their career goal, but often their goals are \"traditionally female\" (nursing, teaching); there is no significant relationship between girls' declared career objectives and  whether their mothers work outside the home, nor does the mother's occupation seem to have any influence on her daughter's career choice. Eighty-eight percent of students not planning post-secondary education have no idea what type of job they will seek. Recommendations based on these and other conclusions stress making students aware of all the opportunities available, of total life styles related to various job classifications, and of life style choices for women. All students should be provided entry level skills applicable in various clusters. (AJ)",

Following statements of objectives of both the workshop and the evaluation, a description of the workshop covers course topics, course requirements, and excerpts from various consultant presentations. Pre- and posttest evaluations are presented and analyzed. Detailed tabulations of participants' generally favorable evaluation of the workshop comprise a major section of the report, and their attitudes toward the employability of the mentally retarded are also tabulated. Appendixes include documents used in the workshop, lists and descriptions of participants,  pretests and posttests, contents of topics covered, student course requirements, and the workshop evaluation scale. Recommendations resulting from the evaluation were: (1) have more field trips, (2) have consultants emphasize the practical rather than the theoretical, (3) have fewer consultants but have them available for the entire workshop, and (4) emphasize role playing in future workshops.

Selected characteristics of 24 military occupations (six from each branch of the services) were compared with similar characteristics of civilian sector occupations or portions of those occupations in the areas of: formal education, vocational/technical training, previous experience, licensing or certification, and union apprenticeship/journeymanship. The study found that with the exception of combat occupations, military and civilian occupations can be coherently compared. In all, 71 tables, covering 144 pages are included. One lists the 24 military occupations studied.  Three other tables list the adequacy of military training and work experience for meeting vocational/technical training requirements, previous experience requirements, and licensing/certification requirements of selected civilian occupations. The remaining 67 tables compare in detail the civilian employment standards of comparable occupations with the respective military occupations in the categories listed above. There are four appendixes: two on sources of military and civilian occupational information; and one each on an examination of army crawler tractor operator MOS 62E, and a suggested approach to combat arms occupations.

It stresses the need for career education in light of high youth unemployment rates, lack of skill adaptability to changing job opportunities, overemphasis on college preparation in high schools, and high dropout rates among college students. It offers examples of career education programs with wide community support in: Boston; Potomac, Maryland; Cleveland; Mesa, Arizona; and the State of New Jersey. It discusses the duties of the  following members of the \"career education team:\" school administrators and school boards; classroom teachers; the industry-education-labor-professional community; counseling and guidance personnel; PTA's, ethnic and cultural groups, civil rights agencies, and other service organizations; the family; and student groups.

        "description":"Differences between participants and nonparticipants in an on-reserve Indian adult education program in British Columbia were identified by interviewing 22.5 percent of the adult population in a random sample. Eight of 17 socioeconomic variables and 5 of 13 sociopsychological variables differentiated between the 42 participants and 44 nonparticipants. Social participation, trust, integration with relatives, number of children, and total annual income explained 30.81 percent of the variation in participation, but alienation was found to be the single most important predictor of nonparticipation. Because (1) participants had lower incomes than nonparticipants, and (2) the program is free, few socioeconomic barriers to participation were identified. Participants were likely to be  female, so a need was indicated for more vocational and employment-oriented programs. Participants were more independent of relatives, a factor leading to consideration of informal classes for extended family groups. Overall, program planning for Indians requires analysis of the community, inclusion of community persons in planning, interagency cooperation, and evaluation. Statistical data throughout the report are tabulated and discussed in the text. Appendixes are a bibliography; adult education courses held on the reservation 1968-71; and product moment correlation coefficients for 19 variables. (MDW)",

Stressing increasing self-knowledge through thought provoking activities, the unit provides  guidelines and highly structured worksheets to direct inquiry into the nature and sources of ideas, how they change, and how they are expressed. Assessment is based on the completion of activities rather than on values expressed. Games, projects, and self-monitoring activities are designed to reinforce basic competencies. The 11-hour unit, suitable for group and individual instruction, related primarily to the social studies area. An instructional strategy guide, dealing with discussion and role-playing techniques, and an activities resource guide, are appended. (MW)",

        "description":"The paper is one of a series dealing with different aspects of the fund-raising campaign, which began in mid-1971, for the establishment throughout Kenya of a large number of institutes of technology on a self-help basis. By March 1973, 17 such institutes had been proposed. In the absence of coordination each institute's planning committee is trying to draw up its own plan for curriculum, syllabus, enrollment, etc. It is an aim of this paper to bring together information which will be useful to this task and, it is hoped, will contribute to the public debate about the role that these institutes might play in Kenya's technical and vocational training system. The paper concentrates, therefore, on such fairly narrow, economic questions as sources of staff and students, employment  prospects, and cost and financing. It starts with an analysis of the existing system of training and of plans for its expansion, based partly on a survey carried out by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning in 1971 and on a followup to that survey in 1972. The plans of the proposed harambee institutes are then reviewed and, in conclusion, some observations about their prospects are made. (Author/NH)",

The medical scholarship, proposed variable incentive, and present continuation pay scales are evaluated from the standpoint of financial attractiveness to the physician compared to civilian alternatives and the rate of return on the Navy's investment. The conclusion that a new scholarship program and proposed variable incentive pay would attract and retain enough physicians was based on a study of: the present inadequate military compensation, the new scholarship plan enacted in 1972, and the implications of variable incentive pay and bonus. The method of analysis was to compare civilian and military  physicians' pay on the national level. Within the economic model of occupational choice, monetary costs and benefits were important factors. The study contains statistical data in tabular form, an explanation of the model, evaluations of alternative and present programs, the utilization of scholarship recipients and civilian physicians, scholarships as profitable investment, and a bibliography. The construction of the analytical model, the comparisons of present proposed military nondisability retirement systems, and the potential use of civilian physicians by the Navy are appended.

Seventy of 120 persons who were eligible for the program applied, and 30 were selected. The program was presented in four phases: synergistic studies, to extend communication and clarify or resolve issues regarding vocational technical education; microtopics, 18 short intensive units on the administrative level; travel seminars to acquaint participants with exemplary programs in surrounding States; and contracted studies, in which participants focused on a group project, then a forum, leading to formulation of legislation establishing a new State administrative system. All phases were  converted to course names and numbers so that participants could apply credit to graduate programs at any of the four universities. General objectives were to explore and refine administrative concepts and competencies, formulate sophisticated approaches to administrative roles, and expand awareness of interdisciplinary concepts.

The program served 1,241 participants, ranging in age from 16 to 60 and in grade level from zero to approximately twelfth grade. Average attendance was 24 days, on a one day a week basis. Most participants advanced one to three grades. Three main programing areas received special attention: staff development, curriculum development, and student participation. Curriculum development centered around language arts skills identified as basic tools for content learning in all areas. A reading program for illiterate adults was developed, oriented to the needs and interests of this clientele. Of the 84  participants in this program, 54 developed basic reading skills. About half the document consists of appendixes showing, in chart form: the background of participants and their educational and employment progress; the cost of expanding the program's services; the number and type of services, along with students educational progress; and coordination with various agencies in the provision of services. Logs of personnel training sessions and other activities are included, along with texts, in Spanish, of 14 program evaluation forms showing participant responses. (Author/SD)",

Site visits to outstanding programs in career education in Illinois formed the basis for selection of contents. Beginning with sample correspondence relating to the appointment of a coordinator, the handbook is divided into sections, each focusing on a program objective and a series of obligations or challenges for the career counselor. The sections are: informing the school and community about career guidance; identifying and choosing programs and courses; determining experiences which contribute to the development of career planning skills; helping students seeking  employment and/or further education; and collecting and using followup evidence. Detailed suggestions for activities and resources and sample instructional materials comprise the bulk of each section and are listed by subject area in an appendix. There are also references and a glossary. (MDW)",

Placement services' general objectives are: (1) preparation activities to help students get and keep jobs; (2) placement and followup services for students placed; and (3) development of communication networks between school, business, and industry. The steps needed to establish a school placement service and to set up a cooperative program of business-industry-school communication are described.  Suggestions for collecting data about local employers and their hiring practices are given, along with suggestions for the selection of placement specialists, and their role and function. Methods of developing jobs for youth are presented, along with procedures to evaluate job placement services.

Some educators estimate that by 1984 half of the higher education institutions in the United States will have developed some form of cooperative education. The Federal government's recent involvement in cooperative education (funding authorized in 1968 through higher education amendments, with funding as an independent entity in the fiscal year 1972) has generated much interest among students, educators, employers, and communities. Under this program, colleges and universities contract with outside employers to hire students at current pay scales. Grants are awarded to institutions primarily for planning, implementing, strengthening, and  expanding new or existing program efforts; in addition, some grants are provided for training and research. The latest Federal appropriation for fiscal year 1975 is $10.75 million, with Office of Education funding being limited to programs that alternate periods of full-time academic study with periods of full-time employment. Descriptive examples of programs are included: Trenton State College, New Jersey; Brevard Community College, Cocoa, Florida; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio.

Activities include: small group exercises, the film &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury,&quot; discussions of current approaches to the problem, and drinking-driver treatment modalities. The manual is organized into three major parts: (1) the introduction, containing an overview of the problem, manual  synopsis, and workshop staffing suggestions; (2) the governor's representative and chairman workshop materials providing all materials needed; and (3) appendixes consisting of preworkshop instructions, group moderator workshop materials, and miscellaneous materials (these include information on audiovisual equipment, instructions, evaluation forms, and an optional alcohol-awareness activity). The manual is designed to be completely self-executing and includes sample letters, fully executed speeches, discussion guidelines, evaluation instruments, and participant selection criteria. (MW)",

In an attempt to speed the group process and give maximum coverage to all college students requesting group therapy, pretraining experiences were given to members of three experimental groups and were compared to one control group. The experimental conditions were: (1) there was no active input from experimenter, and the group was left alone \"to get to know one another\"; (2) subjects listened to tapes which explained some of the goals of group therapy and were allowed to role-play; (3) structured T-group experiences were provided. The findings suggested, first, that the types of pretreatments employed were relatively ineffective in influencing the subsequent process in the groups. The  interactions in the groups seemed to be much more highly influenced by the activity, or lack of it, on the part of the leader. More active leaders tended to have groups in which discussion centered on personal material, while less active leaders had groups in which discussion centered on impersonal topics. Groups which rated themselves as most improved tended to be those in which there was more discussion of personal feelings and where the leader was more active. (Author/PC)",

This, however, is only part of the model. The second basic assumption is that the preferred stages of problem exploration and resolution include the three steps, or goals, outlined by Carkhuff: helpee self-exploration leads to helpee understanding leads to appropriate helpee action. The author details these three steps and explores the concept of \"helping is learning\" as an element in training the paraprofessional. The SHRT model allows for different goals for different levels and/or amounts of  training. The model indicates that an internship-type experience with an \"expert\" trainer is the preferred mode for developing a trainer. In addition, this paper reviews the process of training in systematic human relations as well as the qualifications necessary for a trainer or trainee. The author concludes by citing extensive research on groups trained through the SHRT model and proposes areas for future research. (Author/PC)",

The writer attempted to approach the study of human dynamics and humanistic qualities on several levels: the philosophical, the psychological, the organizational, and the experiential. The program sought to discover the economically and culturally deprived underachievers and to help them succeed academically and personally in high school. The student body in College Discovery consisted mainly of blacks and Puerto Ricans. Some of the sociological and psychological aspects of this population were explored in an effort to better counselor understanding and to fulfill the needs of youngsters. The use of the affective domain appeared to contribute  to counselor effectiveness and to the students' understanding and acceptance of themselves. Some insight was furnished as to the organization and administration of College Discovery. As a result of this study and experiences, suggestions and recommendations were made in several areas. Some limitations of the study were also cited. (Author/PC)",

Among the problems discussed are: (1) the use of privileged information, (2) the possibility of harming experimental subjects, and (3) disclosure to subjects of experimental objectives and results. The issue of confidentiality is also mentioned with an emphasis on the problems this requirement creates for the researcher. The author concludes that the new ethical guidelines have neither crippled nor greatly helped those conducting research with human  subjects. Generally, the guidelines remind the researcher to proceed with caution and consider all aspects of working with human subjects. However, this should not interfere with the development of new research techniques and methodologies. (Author/BW)",

Attributing actions to one or the other set of forces is a distorted view of cause. In therapy, attributing actions to external forces, particularly past events, relieves the client of guilt and makes sense out of his actions. Attributing actions to internal sources provides a means by which the client can change his actions by changing his ideas, interpretations of events and attitudes. Using both distortions of cause, this paper presents a method of therapy which emphasizes the client's responsibility for his actions, and develops the client as a causal agent in his own life. A six-point sequence of therapy tasks is outlined. This sequence extends from identifying  undesirable actions to structuring programs of action changes beginning with small changes and systematically requiring larger changes. (Author/BW)",

The third part reports results from a study testing the hypothesis that feeling of anomie and external control relate negatively to attitude and information concerning birth control. The research results offer some support for the hypothesis that psychological anomie and loss of control as two aspects of alienation are related to one's views regarding socially relevant issues. The study also  supports the notion that in order to reach educational goals involving socially relevant issues, it may be important to understand the normlessness and powerlessness aspects of alienation, and the means by which they can be modified.

The 1974 goals and objectives recognize that a society's response to drug abuse is a product of its values, attitudes, and beliefs. In a similar sense, the objectives of the Strategy 1974 rest on present understanding of the causes and consequences of drug abuse and on society's capacity to respond meaningfully to the complex factors as it encounters them. To the extent that disagreement with these judgments  leads to constructive discussion, understanding of the many complex issues will be sharpened. This strategy, therefore, is to be dynamic--continually reexamined and reviewed so that programs and policies reflect the best knowledge at hand. Strategy 1974 sets forth an action plan which describes the way in which the Federal Government is responding to the drug abuse problem through a coordinated program of drug abuse prevention, law enforcement, and international cooperation.

Adult resistance to learning is dealt with through application of counseling awarenesses to the learning situation. If the adult learner can be freed from threat to self-identify in the learning situation, he can learn with much the same ease with which the child learns. This hypothesis was tested at two five-day Counseling-Learning Institutes, one in the United States and one in Canada. Subjects represented primarily the helping professions. Significance of the study lies in the fact that in a relatively short time (five days) significant change can be achieved in adult values. Further research is  needed to determine the permanency of value change thus acquired. (Author)",

        "description":"The value of the college counseling center has been to symbolize the concern for students of the basically depersonalized institutional bureaucracy. The center has permitted others on campus to avoid becoming involved with students. By localizing the problems which are presented by clients within the clients themselves, counselors defuse any questioning of the institution's role in generating student problems. Counselors cannot operate in a manner which ignores their assigned role in the bureaucratic structure. Counselors, although their training has led them to believe that they would be performing essential functions, are actually in a peripheral position in relation to their institution. Most counselors are supporters of the status quo and seem to hold the same biases in  regard to sex- and ethnic minority-appropriate behavior as do people in general. Counselors are their own worst enemies in becoming more effective in their institutional settings because of their tendency to look inward rather than outward for the locus of problems. They must reevaluate their attitudes toward social change not only in relation to their clients but also in relation to themselves. (Author/BW)",

Male social drinker subjects were assigned to form two independent groups of ten subjects each. Baseline measure of heart rate, skin conductance level (SCL), pulse wave amplitude and ear lobe temperature were recorded. Group I then received .3 ml/lb of body weight pure ethanol in orange juice over a five-minute period. Group II received 1 ml of ethanol floated on top of juice, and both groups' physiological measures were continuously recorded over the next 40 minutes. Results showed that reliable effects were not obtained with the SCL measure, and that heart rate increased reliably but nondifferentially for both groups. Ear  lob temperature increased for the alcohol and decreased for the placebo group. It was concluded that, in the dose used, alcohol acted as a relaxant, and that previous experiments found equivocal and conflicting results because they did not utilize a placebo control group but drew inferences from within subject baseline to post-drink comparisons.

In an effort to remedy this deficiency and to insure the future competence of the average person to utilize his leisure time with maximum fruitfulness, some recreational theorists have advocated the establishment of a formal program of training and preparation for the optimal use of leisure. Agreeing with the view of recreation as an important medium for the expression, fulfillment, and enrichment of the personality through the gratification of diverse psychological needs, the position taken in this paper is that, while at present no one profession can justifiably claim to be equipped to assume the necessary role of counselor to the individual in matters pertaining to the  optimal use of his leisure, the discipline which could perform this function is counseling psychology. This paper concerns itself with an attempt to formulate the characteristics and functions of this proposed new area of psychological specialization called recreational psychology, and to develop an outline of a program for training its practitioners.

The initial training procedure was used with 12 college students who volunteered to work with elementary school students having behavior or academic problems. A pre-test, post-test research design was used, with counselor training taking place in five weekly one-hour meetings during which reading assignments were discussed, and  triadic role playing (counselor, teacher and observer) employed with the observer giving feedback to the others following five minutes of role playing. Data from the study showed that college students could be trained to emit specific counseling behaviors. Several other case studies of training paraprofessionals are also presented.

Results showed that advisors' conception of an ideal career strategy and of sophomore students' actual career orientation was relatively analytic. Advisors tend to view career choice more analytically than students. This misperception of student thinking appears to be a source of conflict between students and advisor. Other data suggests that a high percentage of students believe advisor's analytic orientation interferes with helpful counseling and satisfactory career decision. Purely rational career strategies appear to be a source of alienation for students,  especially during the middle college years. This suggests that career counselors should take care that they do not override students' feeling and personal commitments with analytic-rational career strategies and \"objective\" career information.

A systematic analysis was made of 1,069 jokes appearing in two featured columns of the Reader's Digest for the two-year periods 1947-48, 1957-58, and 1967-68. Scoring rules guided categorizing of jokes into anti-women, anti-men and non-sex-related groupings. Results of the analysis were: (1) since the 1940's six times as many anti-women jokes appeared as did anti-male jokes; (2) in the period after WWII, more than a quarter of all the humor in these magazine columns was directed against women; (3) the percentage of sexist jokes has declined steadily over three decades; and (4) the portrait of the  typical woman has not changed over the past 30 years according to the content of sexist jokes. In rank order of prevalence of traits, the female joke subject is: (1) stupid, incompetent or foolish; (2) domineering over men; (3) exploitive of men for money; (4) jealous and catty; (5) irresponsible with money; (6) gossipy and nagging; and (7) overly-anxious to catch a husband.

In the mid 1960's and early 1970's cross-cultural research as a method in psychology gained a momentum that led to an almost unchecked acceleration. The author details the recent growth in popularity of the field and points to the energies that can be called \"hard-core\" cross-cultural psychological efforts. Attention is given to the historical controversy between cross-cultural psychology and psychological anthropology. The author points to the fact that the two disciplines do not share the same data base, that is, ethnographers rely for the most part on naturally occurring mundane events while psychologists rely on  experiments (experimentation versus naturalism). In the future, cross-cultural researchers in psychology will depend increasingly on cross-cultural \"models.\" This will be done so as to integrate strategies and findings which may lead to more complete and valid generalizations about human behavior. The author closes his discussion with a brief summary of four cross-cultural models. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"A review of the literature indicates that on the topic of women's participation in the labor force, the attention of the economics profession has been directed more heavily toward analyses of the supply rather than analyses of either the demand or the interaction between the two. Detailed information on wages, employment and attitudes would greatly contribute to an understanding of the demand-related barriers to entry or re-entry faced by women. Concerning the supply, such variables as low wages, the presence of children and unfavorable attitudes toward women working outside the home can all be considered barriers to the labor force participation of women. However, empirical findings are frequently ambiguous in the absence of reasonably complete models of women's behavior. The  need for more complete modeling of the activities of women over their life cycle, of which labor market participation is only a part, seems apparent. (Author/PC)",

In 1972, the average woman earned only 58 percent as much as the average man when both worked full time. The author directs her discussion toward the large volume of research on the topic of the earnings gap and points to areas where further work might be done. She discusses the fact that the occupational distribution itself may be a symptom of unequal opportunity. In other words, one needs to ask why women with educational preparation and other characteristics similar to men end up in lower paying jobs and establishments. An interesting study was quoted which found that many women have high aspirations but low expectations with respect to occupational achievement, and that behavior is based more on  their expectations about what they can realistically hope to accomplish than on their aspirations. The author also suggests that researchers think more about what kind of analyses might be useful to those government agencies responsible for monitoring equal employment opportunities or equal pay. She concludes by mentioning research issues related to the social impact of the earning gap. (Author/PC)",

These dual concerns, with academic and nonacademic success in college, have led to the development of two publications, this monograph being the first. It is the result of a project on college success inaugurated in 1967 to develop an annotated bibliography on &quot;nonintellective factors related to success in college.&quot; The primary purpose of the present monograph is to give the reader an overview of the research that has been  done and to stimulate thought concerning college academic success. All types of issues are raised, commonly held assumptions are called into question, creative and unique approaches to research on college students are demonstrated.

        "description":"Prevalent among \"third force\" and other humanistic psychologists is the assertion that \"becoming a person\" or \"self-actualizing\" are desirable goals for individuals and for the human race. Major writers such as Rogers and Maslow and their followers have described the high-level humanizing process and have developed techniques for facilitating growth toward it. However, current trends in the so-called humanistic movement have resulted in a situation wherein, in many counseling and therapy groups, and in several humanistic psychology papers, the ultimate good of self-actualization is presented exclusively in terms of intimacy, intense emotional involvement, interpersonal honesty, and almost compulsive self-disclosure. This seems to be produced and maintained by two related  assumptions: (1) that intimacy and interpersonal emotional intensity are what we seek, and (2) that if we don't seek these realms of experience, we should, and we are either mentally ill or somehow less human on account of not doing so. These assumptions are, however laudable for some situations, highly questionable when applied to all humans in all situations. This tutorial presentation explores these theoretical, clinical, and ethical issues by means of lecture and discussion with the audience. (Author/BW)",

The result of economic affluence is viewed as such \"adapting behavior\" in the demand for goods and services, and dynamic sensory feedback provides an intricate means of regulating motion in relation to the environment. However, these phenomena of human behavior, currently evincing themselves in economics and learning cannot be solely restricted to one or two fields. It is postulated that they apply to all facets of human transaction (economic, educational, ethical, psychological, cultural, social, and  political) in all material-reward-oriented societies when each society has attained a modest but adequate standard of living for the majority of its population.

Together, these groups in 1970 numbered about 34.5 million people, or about 17 percent of the population. This paper reports on the status of minority women and, in particular, their status in the job market. A 1973 EEOC report showed that minority women are more underrepresented among \"officials and managers\" than any other job category. On the other hand, these women are considerably overrepresented in the blue collar categories andin \"service work.\" Not suprisingly in 1972 the median income of minority women who worked full-time year-round was $5,320 compared with $6,131 for  white women. The unemployment rate among minority women is almost double that of white women, and there is an especially severe unemployment rate (34.5 percent) among minority teenage women. Most other problems of job status, however, seem to be external to the women themselves. Most of these problems have to do with discrimination in hiring and promotion, low wages paid by employers, the lack of day care and other facilities for working women, and the relatively high general levels of unemployment in the nation that strike women and minorities harder than others.

The problem occurs when one partner is refused while trying to initiate sexual behavior with the other. The author reviews a procedure which has been helpful in overcoming differences in sexual desires and which, theoretically, should develop a new attitude toward intercourse for both partners. Minor successes were reported in an actual study of 10 couples who used this procedure. Success was defined by the wife learning a more positive attitude toward her husband's approach behavior, and the husband perceiving  his wife as desiring intercourse more frequently. Several problems with the procedure are reviewed and caution urged in its therapeutic use. (PC)",

        "description":"It has generally been shown that the high school record is the best single predictor of college-level achievement, and that the most valid predictors accrue when high school record information is given more weight than selection-test scores in admissions decisions. In actual admissions practice, however, test scores are often given the most effective weight. In the first part of this report, four main points are made in connection with past studies on college admissions. Results from a study carried out in Texas by the authors is reported in which the focus of attention was on standards and policies that govern admission to post-secondary education. It was found that exclusive use of either a high school grade-point-average or a high school rank did not provide optimum prediction  of college grades. The authors concluded that in making college admissions decisions and recommendations, it is generally best to use a carefully obtained high school rank in conjunction with an empirically developed high school transcript score in the prediction of college achievement. In the presence of these two indexes, used jointly, selection test scores become redundant. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"Order analysis is a measurement technique for the quantitative and generalizable description of complex structures. Relations between the manifest elements of a data matrix and its underlying latent entities and attributes are considered in terms of magnitudes as basic scale units. Magnitude is conceptualized as a difference relation, translated into the binary units of information theory and linked with the functional relations of the propositional calculus of formal logic. Deterministic and probabilistic models of order analysis are developed. The deterministic model elaborates an algorithm for partitioning of binary relations within the context of Guttman-type scaling. The probabilistic model extends these principles within the framework of graph theory; it permits the  generalization of ordered structures into their latent domains with a known degree of statistical certainty. Relation of order analysis to factor analysis is discussed, as well as components of isolated binary variation. Order analysis is validated on sets of prestructured, distorted and random data and its utility considered within the general framework of multivariate analysis models. (Author)",

Since the study was intended only as a preliminary investigation, no attempt was made to analyze the information statistically. An attempt was made to shed some light on the following questions: (1) to what extent can the diagnostician's interpretation of the subject's life style be based solely on information contained in the protocol itself? (2) how would a pooled consensual interpretation of all three diagnosticians compare to or differ from the original summary as stated by the author? (3) will any non-consensual or contradictory  interpretations affect any one diagnostician's final life style summary? It was concluded that three Adlerian interpreters, operating independently, can arrive at very similar life style summaries based solely on the information contained in a completed protocol. Suggestions for further research are presented. (Author/BW)",

        "description":"The present investigation looked at selective attention in impulsive and reflective children using a central/incidental task similar to that used by Hagen, 1967. In order to examine developmental change in selective attention, children at kindergarten, second, and fifth grades were tested. The central recall task involved presenting the child with a board containing pictures on 3&quot; x 5&quot; cards. The child was then presented with each of the cards and asked to point to the spot on the original board where the picture had been seen. It was hypothesized that impulsive children would demonstrate less efficient selective attention and, as a result, would recall less central information and possibly more incidental information than their reflective counterparts. The results showed that  the impulsive children recalled less central as well as incidental information, which did not support the notion that impulsive children were deficient in selective attention. Results did support the developmental trend in the recall of central information found in previous investigations described by Hagen (Hagen &amp; Hale, 1973). Impulsive and reflective children appear to differ on dimensions other than response latency. (Author/PC)",

The empirical analysis failed to support the hypothesis that within a social class disadvantaged ethnic groups have higher rates of mental impairment than advantaged ethnic groups. In general there was no difference between the rates for advantaged and disadvantaged ethnic groups. Further, this finding was not altered when the conditions of social class, age, sex, marital status, and self-reported physical health were controlled. A secondary analysis is presented which indicates that normative strain as an objectively defined condition of the social system may not directly affect mental impairment rates. The theoretical and methodological implications of objectively vs.  subjectively defined normative strain are discussed. It is suggested that future research explore the differential predictive power of both objectively and subjectively defined normative strain relative to rates of deviance. (Author)",

Information obtained in 1969 has been used to explain these two outcomes. Although 49-58 percent of the variance in both academic performance and educational attainment has been explained for both blacks and whites, very different patterns of explanation result for the two races. The socioeconomic status of the boys' families is a powerful source of explanation for whites but not for blacks. In contrast, early nonacademic school experiences and the desire  for educational attainment assume much greater explanatory significance for blacks than whites. Overall, the performances and attainments of whites follow more fully an orderly process reflecting familial support and academic continuity while those of blacks are much more discontinuous and influenced by extrafamilial and nonacademic factors during the secondary school years.

The conferees sought to explore the reasons why these dramatic attitude shifts have taken place, and the implications of these changes for the life insurance industry, the entire business community, and society  generally. The conferees found, in essence, that student interests and attitudes have become more introspective and less dramatically expressed than they were before, but the students are not, as feared, apathetic.

In Experiment II, 120 3rd and 10th graders were asked to recall items either immediately or following a 30-second delay (the latter presumably fostering conceptual activity). Utilizing a rote-conceptual distinction as potentially relevant in mediating interrelations between abilities and learning, the authors expected that systematic differentiated patterns of recall-ability  covariation would emerge as a function of age, practice, and experimental treatment. However, most of the predictions were not confirmed, even those serving to replicate the previous findings. It is argued that such negative results necessitate a closer examination of the underlying theoretical model--specifically, a more thorough consideration of the appropriate treatment conditions and ability markers.

The subjects were Occupational Work Experience (OWE) students who were randomly assigned to individual guidance from either a computerized occupational information systems, a counselor-based information system, or to a control group. The groups were post-tested on the Assessment of Career Development (ACD) to determine which group learned the most information. The results demonstrate a hierarchical learning effect--computer group learned more than the counseled group, which learned more than the control group. Only the treatment effects were significantly different between the groups since there was no interaction of IQ and treatment. (Author)",

The guidelines and procedures include four major topics: (1) inter-agency agreements; (2) dissemination of  postsecondary education information; (3) in-service training programs; and (4) orientation opportunities.

        "description":"The purposes of this study were to determine which test instruments should be used to report instructional and independent reading levels to tutors or classroom teachers and what recommendations should be made concerning the materials to be used for teaching the child. The subjects were children from grades two through ten who had been identified as problem readers by their classroom teachers. The students were instructed by college students who were instructed in the administration of the Spache Diagnostic Reading Scales, the Slosson Intelligence Test, and the informal reading inventory. The teachers were also given a knowledge test and a performance test on the administration of the measures. The subjects were instructed for approximately 30 hours during a five-week period. The  results led to the following conclusions: the informal reading inventory appears to be the safest and most reasonable device for reporting reading levels to teachers; the Spache Diagnostic Reading Scales did provide for a better analysis of oral reading performance, since it allowed more errors than the informal reading inventory but not enough to produce anxiety; and the Diagnostic Reading Scales measure reading growth accurately if grade equivalents are not considered.

        "description":"A method for stimulating and facilitating organizational writing in the secondary school is described in this paper. Pictorial sequences are coordinated and arranged to typify the four major styles of writing: narrative, descriptive, expository, and persuasive. These sequences both portray a meaningful event in keeping with the writing style and help to elicit the corresponding organization of written discourse. A model is presented showing the pupil-teacher interaction in the visual-writing process. The model proposes that visual compositions can help generate the student's language and feelings to facilitate organizational writing of coherent paragraphs and, at the same time, to improve certain reading skills of sequence and organization. Teaching strategy guidelines suggest  this student involvement in the visual-writing techniques before teaching lessons in style and organization. (Author/TO)",

A discontinuous model of visual perception is proposed, with the discontinuities being phase and temporally related to saccadic eye movements. It is further proposed that deviant duration and angular velocity characteristics of saccades in patients with hypertonic motor impairment relate to information processing deficits. Stabilized retinal images of stimuli, which bypass the effects of deviant patterns of scanning and fixation in the model, significantly increase the ability of these patients to actively recall information presented for durations of less than three seconds, which is essentially greater than the duration of the single scan during reading. Implications of  the informational components of evoked potentials and electrophysiology, for diagnosis of status of fundamental reading skills, figure-ground perception, objective refraction, and visual perception in general are discussed. Also, therapeutic intervention in basic deficits in the reading process is examined. (Author/WR)",

Measures of word recognition and intelligence were obtained in 87 first-, second-, and third-grade subjects. All subjects then performed a visual discrimination task which uses artificial graphemes as stimuli. The task required subjects to match a standard grapheme with an identical form. Errors on this task were classified into six categories. A two-way multivariate analysis of covariance (grade level X word recognition skill) was performed. In the analysis intelligence test scores were covaried. The main effect for grade was significant (p. is less than .0004), while neither word recognition skill nor the grade X word recognition skill interaction approached  significance.

More than 90 percent of the teachers interviewed in both countries perceived the language of children coming from working class homes as being deficient in some way and also, to some extent, children from middle class homes as well. The reasons for their attitudes concerned parental neglect, the education of parents, the language of parents, the interference of social and regional dialects and in some instances a suggestion  of genetic factors. The study indicated a need for further research in language attitudes of teachers and also a need for certain changes in preservice and inservice education relating to the applications of sociolinguistic and psycholinguistic knowledge to the teaching of reading and language at all levels of schooling.

The application of the reading requirement methodology was accomplished by Air Force subject matter specialists (SMS) in each of the 56 career ladders. After collecting all of the relevant reading material in a career ladder, the SMS then randomly selected 150 word samples from the materials. The FORCAST readability formula was then applied to obtain an estimated grade level difficulty,  and trainee and job incumbent scores were converted to estimated reading grade levels using a validated conversion procedure. The results indicated that both reading skills and requirements varied widely between career ladders, that materials in many career ladders were not written to the reading skill level of the user, and that, although the average reading ability level of personnel dropped in many career ladders, the reading demands often did not drop accordingly.

Many kinds of eye movements are used in mathematics--around, top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, diagonal, backward and forward, and follow the arrow. Examples of each kind are presented. The language of mathematics uses many kinds of words--those that are primarily mathematics words, words of everyday usage, and words that have several different meanings, some mathematical and some not. Many examples of each of these kinds of words are presented as incentives for reading and mathematics teachers to cooperatively explore techniques used in reading that may be adapted to mathematics.

The model consists of three dimensions: the degree of structuring of the program, the sequence of gradation of reading units, and the kind of symbol system used in the initial stages of reading instruction. The degrees of structuring refers to programs such as programed approaches (high degree of structuring), basal readers (medium degree of structuring), and language experience (low degree of structuring). The sequence of gradation dimension refers to reading approaches placed on a continuum of part-to-whole through whole-to-part. The symbol system is concerned with the symbol systems used in beginning reading and is subdivided into five parts which range from a sound related system to a  non-alphabetic or non-sound related system.

The subjects were randomly assigned to nine treatment groups containing six subjects each. These groups listened at rates of 78, 128, 178, 228, 278, 328, 378, and 428 words per minute (wpm). A comparison group was administered the tests covering passage content without having listened to the passages. The materials used in the study were the three Standardized Listening Passages and associated tests  prepared by Clark and Woodcock (1967). Immediate and one-week retention data were gathered on each subject. The results indicated that listening rates of 228 to 328 wpm were more efficient for learning and retention than the normal rate of 178 wpm, subjects with lower IQs performed better at rates which were slower than the most efficient rates for higher IQ subjects, and performance curves displayed a secondary peak just prior to the final drop in performance at very high listening rates.

        "description":"Three unjustified assumptions are often made about young beginners in reading: they all are acquainted with books and reading, the children and the teacher are thinking in the same terms when each talks about reading, and children understand the technical terms of literacy. Reading authorities refer to this lack of understanding of what the reading task is all about as cognitive confusion. Many young children do not have adequate concepts of the terms in their teacher's instructional vocabulary. The degree of a child's cognitive clarity about the task of learning to read is linked to the home environment. Research studies have found that many children do come to school without a clear understanding of the functions and tasks involved in reading. To clear up cognitive confusion in  young children and to help them develop an understanding of the nature and function of reading, the teacher needs to give the children many meaningful experiences with the printed word.

Its present status reflects the diverse range of its origins and the snowball sequence of its development. The next stage in the history of the learning assistance center may well be its systematic integration into the campus as a whole, with the center taking its rightful place as the support service  for the academic community.

This paper discusses two lines of research--mathemagenic effects and cognitive style--which are of import to the reading educator and which are derived from the philosophical positions described above.

Subjects were told that all words were nonsense words but that some would strike them as more difficult to pronounce than others. The subjects recorded whether or not each word was an English word. Significant results were found between the legal and illegal types. In the second experiment 35 subjects rated sets of words for  pronounceability and no significant differences were found. When the same subsets of words were presented as a one-word free-association task to 35 different subjects, the results strongly supported the subjects' search for meaning rather than phonemic recoding.

Among the more important controversies are questions pertaining to the existence of a hierarchy of reading subskills and the advisability of using a subskill approach. Several influential writers have warned that when the process of learning to read is fractionated into subskills, the essential goal of reading, extraction of meaning, is lost. This argument has persuaded a sizable segment of the teaching community to begin reading instruction with what is essentially a holistic approach. The purpose of this article is not to take issue with those who advocate a holistic method, but to extract the best from each approach to the reading acquisition process in order to improve teaching effectiveness. In pursuit  of this goal, the controversy between holistic and part methods of instruction is cast in historical perspective, and a comparison between speech and reading acquisition is made. Arguments are presented to the effect that learning hierarchies do exist in reading; that although we do not presently know the precise nature of these hierarchies, methods are available for their determination; and that the most efficient way to teach a complex skill such as reading is to simplify the task by breaking it into subskills.

What did the author say (WDAS) is a technique for reading skill development that maintains a systematic group approach while accommodating individual needs. For the learner, WDAS is a way of discovering how to read actively, organize, recall and understand ideas, and effectively write summary, outline, or precise statements of what has been read. For the instructor, WDAS is a teaching technique interwoven with continuous and contiguous  diagnosis. In WDAS students are asked to read an article within a designated time limit and then answer in writing a single question: \"What did the author say?\" Each answer is shared with the other students in the class, who score each answer by consensus using a scale of one to ten. Teaching of specific techniques is determined by the apparent weaknesses. The process is repeated until the WDAS system for study-reading is internalized by the students. (TO)",

The scores attained by the subjects were used to classify the subjects as reading above actual grade placement or below actual grade placement, according to norms for their respective groups. Further stratification was done on the basis of sex. Thus, the subjects were classified in one of the following four categories: males reading above grade placement, females reading above grade placement, males reading below grade placement, and females reading below grade placement. All subjects in each of the four categories were also given the  Michigan State Self-Concept of Academic Ability Scale.

Students are allowed to progress at their own pace once they are assigned to work through a certain individual reading packet. The students' performance is diagnosed and evaluated continuously from skill to skill and from unit to unit. Teachers monitor students' progress very closely. A minimum of 85 percent accuracy is required on all skill tests before a student is permitted to move from one unit to another. The units in each area progress from easy to more  difficult reading levels. The materials for instructional packets come from many sources. Some materials are commercially prepared while others are developed in the reading and study skills center. A variety of trade books, magazines, newspapers, reading skills laboratories, tapes filmstrips, and films are used as resources in the development of instructional units. (WR)",

From 17 classes in nine schools, four groups, consisting of 100, 104, 84, and 81 subjects, were formed. Samples of 54 subjects each were drawn from these groups; subjects in each group were comparable in chronological age, sex, IQ, number of members in the family, type of housing, level of education of the most-educated parent, and race. The experimental programs were begun in September after the subjects were pretested. Both the PLDK and the i.t.a. were taught by the regular classroom teachers in  self-contained classes. Pupil progress was measured in three areas: school achievement, language development, and intellectual growth. From the results it was concluded that i.t.a. clearly enhances beginning reading skills, especially in word attack, and that the PLDK does raise the IQ and improve overall oral language facility as well as reading skills for disadvantaged boys.

It was hypothesized that changes in meaning levels from a first to a second list would result in less interference than conditions where stimuli remained at constant levels of meaning over lists. Another facet of the study was designed to test the encoding variability hypothesis with children, which suggested that less meaningful stimuli would be subject to less interference. Three separate experiments were conducted as part of this study. The hypotheses were not confirmed by the experiments. The results were discussed in terms of possible characteristics of the learners and the  stimuli that may have contributed to the nonsignificant findings. Fourth graders may have been labeling stimuli spontaneously, and the stimuli may not have retained the same level of meaning after repeated trials. (Author/RB)",

The questionnaire used to assess the attitudes of the teachers was a fourteen-statement inventory which asked the subjects to indicate whether they strongly agreed, agreed, were neutral, disagreed, or strongly disagreed  with various statements. The results indicated that teachers from both groups saw the necessity of incorporating the teaching of reading skills in their classes, but generally, content area teachers felt inadequate to the task of incorporating reading skills without aid.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of real and nonsense pictures with no labels, high-frequency labels, or low-frequency labels in discrimination learning of young children. The subjects were 102 second-grade children randomly selected from several classrooms located in a semi-rural community in Wisconsin. The subjects were assigned to one of six experimental conditions: real pictures with no labels provided; nonsense pictures with either no labels, high-frequency labels, or low-frequency labels provided; and high-frequency and low-frequency printed words. Thirteen pairs of pictures of words, established in a norming study, were utilized in each condition. Each subject was tested individually in a vacant classroom. The results indicated that the picture-over-word  effect was operating. There was a slight increase in performance due to labeling the nonsense type picture. However, there was little or no indication of a word-frequency effect. (WR)",

        "description":"The purposes of this study were to determine if test stimulus was a member of the memory set and if items in an interactive image held in short term memory (STM) could be scanned simultaneously. In experiment one, 50 university subjects compared a test word with a set of one to three words held in STM. The rate of STM search was obtained by measuring reaction time (RT) under four instructional conditions: subvocal repetition, separation imagery, interaction imagery, and sentence generation. The results indicated that RT was a linear function of memory set size in the interaction imagery condition. All other conditions also yielded a linear increase in RT with set size. In experiment two, memory set and test stimuli were both pictorial. Three groups of subjects compared items in  the memory set and test stimuli. There were three experimental conditions: control--two pictured objects side by side but not interacting; provided interaction--two objects shown interacting with one another or overlapping; and subject generated interaction--subjects were given the same stimuli as the control group but were to visualize some kind of interaction between the pictured objects. The results indicated that paired associate scores in both imagery groups were superior to those in the control group. (WR)",

The primary objective is to develop an initial sight vocabulary and word recognition skills in each child by using the child's own language. The children develop their own basic sight vocabularies and use the words in a variety of ways--for building sentences, for classifying according to function or type, for alphabetizing in preparation for using a dictionary, and as materials for phonics instruction. As the children's vocabulary increases, they are introduced to basal readers to develop reading-thinking skills. Beginning with the second grade, equal  emphasis is placed on wide inquiry-type reading, using the library as the principal source of materials. The program places a strong emphasis on language arts and reading, and teachers correlate this approach with other curriculum areas, with the exception of arithmetic and handwriting. (TO/AIR)",

This paper argues that romance demands and deserves a special place in the language curriculum. Romance encompasses the humanistic aspects of language which lie beyond the bounds of linguistics and includes semiotics and man's symbol-making capacity. A course in semiotics is outlined through a discussion of four prerequisites: a semiotics course must have explicit student input; a new set of questions which support and extend student input must be formulated; a new system of symbols and signs must be explored as an instrument broad enough in scope of application and narrow enough to  penetrate material to a sufficient depth; and a scale must be constructed which will chart student progress from one level of understanding to another.

The subjects were 60 second-grade children from three ethnic groups: 20 white SE speaking children, 20 black BE speaking children, and 20 black SE speaking children. The subjects were from elementary schools in the southwest area of Los Angeles and all were administered the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and were then instructed to put together the separate sound they heard on a test tape. The students then took a 48-item test consisting of 12 words in SE form, 12 words in BE form, and 24 non-words. An analysis of the results showed that there are two sequential and partially independent factors in sound  blending. The first factor, blending, is an auditory-articulatory skill which is not significantly affected by word frequency, while the second factor, word recognition, is affected by word frequency. The relatively poor performance of BE speakers on sound blending seems to indicate that they may need additional instruction in mastering this auditory-articulatory skill when it is a component of a beginning reading program.

        "description":"Antebellum slave narratives can be valuable literary materials in four different kinds of literature courses. In a survey of American literature, slave narratives serve as records of the attitudes and activities of early Americans, as examples of travel literature, and as examples of late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century adventure stories. Slave narratives also have an obvious place in courses concentrating on biography and autobiography as literary types or genres and in consciousness raising freshman English courses for which the themes of courage, love of freedom, and perseverance would be evident. For an Afro-American literature course, slave narratives can supply literary records of the mind and soul of a people as well as offer a structural model for other  black literature. (JM)",

The terms &quot;elective&quot; and &quot;teacher specialization&quot; are examined as they relate to the classroom experience. Labeling a course as an elective does not guarantee any changes in teaching which take into account the intellectual levels or the economic and cultural backgrounds of the students. It is suggested that immediate student feedback on attainment of objectives would aid teachers in improving instruction and in building better rationales for all courses, including elective courses.

The problems of storytelling are discussed and five teaching procedures are offered: it is important for the teacher to read several stories before selecting one; the story must be divided into units of action; those sections of the story which need to be memorized verbatim should be identified; the story must be rehearsed; and progress should be monitored, usually by means of a tape recorder. There are three reasons why children should experience stories which are told, rather than read: students should gain an understanding about the oral tradition in literature; telling stories provides active involvement for children; and storytelling acts as a valuable  stimulus for children to begin telling stories on their own.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate both the relative effectiveness of different instructional personnel and the effect of differences in group size upon oral language acquisition for educationally disadvantaged first grade children. Involved in the treatment program were 23 classes in eight schools, all serving lower class areas of a southern metropolitan city. From these classes, a sample of 290 subjects was drawn, half boys and half girls. All of the children had IQ scores ranging from 60 to 110 on the pretest. Language development over the year was measured by the administration of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Peabody Language Production Inventory. Though small differences in progress were observed among  groups receiving their instruction under various conditions, statistical analysis indicated that these differences could not be accounted for by either of the experimental variables. The results suggest that a well designed instructional program can be equally effective under a variety of conditions. (TS)",

The effectiveness of eight treatment combinations was compared. A total of 195 subjects were randomly selected from fourteen fourth-grade classes in schools located in culturally disadvantaged areas of Nashiville, Tennessee. The experimental group and 72 subjects from six other classrooms served as the control group. The experimental subjects were randomly assigned to groups of four, with four groups per classroom. Each group was then assigned to one of the eight different treatment combinations--a single presentation of the story or a double presentation of the story at one of the word-per-minute (wpm) rates  of 200, 265, 331, and 400. The results of this study essentially supported the prediction of highest absolute scores at the lowest high-speed rate (200 wpm). The peak level of efficiency was at the 265 wpm rate as predicted. This study provides further evidence that high-speed listening can be an efficient learning medium for elementary school children. (TS)",

Several major findings are reported. Concreteness of the stimulus materials consistently is an aid to recall; although this is predicted from an imagery interpretation of the coding of concrete materials, some of the results are at odds with such a theory. Children as young as six years seem to chunk sentences for recall essentially the same as adults; however, the storage systems seemed to differ. No relation to functional knowledge of grammar was found. Results from two experiments question the adequacy of a theory that depends heavily on surface structure of the sentence as a medium for storage. The  general discussion proposes that at least four interactive processes are necessary to explain the obtained recall results. (Author)",

        "description":"The possibility exists that another language resource, the Spanish language of the Mexican American, will be lost in the United States due to language ethnocentrism. Mexican American bilingualism is viewed as an intellectual handicap by public educators who do not understand the basic linguistic bias of instruments utilized to measure the intellectual development of Mexican Americans. Educational systems have discouraged Mexican American bilingualism by placing restrictions on the use of Spanish in the public schools and by failing to implement bilingual-bicultural programs for Mexican Americans. What is now necessary is the articulation and adoption of public school acculturation policies that allow these students to retain their bicultural heritage and language and to obtain  the necessary academic skills to succeed in the American mainstream. There is an imminent need for preservice and inservice teachereducation programs that clarify the philosophy and objectives of bilingual and multicultural education programs and that orient public educators to the phenomenon of language variations and their effect on learning styles. A shift to acculturation policies in public education would benefit everyone. (TS)",

Unsophisticated students are defined as adult and other part-time learners, as well as full-time students, who are less academically qualified than students in previous years. Strategy one suggests that teachers directly confront difficult literature and help students to understand deliberately chaotic and alienating contemporary fiction. Strategy two suggests that teachers organize literature courses thematically and teach within defined parameters. Strategy three suggests that teachers encourage students to read a quantity of books rather than to analyze each book. Strategy four suggests that teachers provide a specific reading guide for students, emphasizing important areas of study. Strategy  five suggests encouraging students to work hard in order to gain confidence in their abilities. Strategy six suggests encouraging student response as a means of instigating discussion and interest in the classroom. (TS)",

The 30 lessons included a preview of the course; prewriting concerns, especially audience and persona; five lessons on the paragraph; three lessons on the essay; two lessons on diction; nine lessons on specific reasons for writing; and one lesson each on the persuasive essay, the history of the English language, dictionary use, library use, and style. The students were divided into sections of 30 to 40 people, and  a writing consultant was assigned to each section. The writing consultants were qualified English teachers who made comments on the students' individual writing and suggested supplementary work. Testing was done on campus but writing assignments were mailed in to the consultant. (TS)",

The study compared the way information was organized within the computer model with the way humans retrieve information from their own memory structures.

It is wrong to stress the difference between fact and opinion because it has led to the assumption that there is a style of writing appropriate to the presentation of fact and a different style suitable for other types of writing. The advantage of rejecting the conventional distinctions between fact and opinion in composition classes is that it forces the students to confront their own minds rather than hiding behind a facade of fact. Even in areas such as scientific research, historical investigation, and newspaper reporting, the ideal of objectivity is largely a myth. The use of fictive techniques  in all kinds of writing should be encouraged. (TS)",

Beginning with a discussion of the issue of textbook selection and content in Kanawha County, the interviews move into a brief but broad discussion of educational philosophy (humanism versus absolutism) of morality and the value systems of American children and American society, and of parent role and local input in schools. In addition to Kanawha County residents, school personnel, and a school board member, interviews are conducted with representatives of citizens groups based in California and  Maryland, the president of the National Education Association, a staff member of the National Council of Teachers of English, and the superintendent of West Virginia schools. From these interviews it becomes clear that the controversy begun over textbooks envelops more than a few words or reading selections; it encompasses the foundations of American education and and questions who, indeed, should run our schools.

        "description":"Imitation can be a useful method of teaching students to write well. Imitations may be \"loose\" or \"close.\" Loose imitation aims for faint resemblance; it requires a perception of a particular model that looks at its most conspicuous features, such as tone, arrangement of ideas, and the general character of the diction. Close imitation aims at strong resemblance and therefore requires rigorous analysis. The student must deal with the model concretely, as a piece of writing, and the instructor must track every rhetorical effect to its source. As a procedure, close imitation fills one of the most conspicuous gaps in modern rhetorical theory, the absence of a practical heuristic. Close imitation also may produce in the student a heightened sense of form and sharpens the student's  sense of style. This paper concludes that close imitation formalizes and condenses a natural impulse to write. (TS)",

While the five primary functions (source, transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination) remain unchanged, an additional element--the complex, formal organizations--has been inserted into the process. The formal organizations include the body of interdependent industries involved in the production of primary communication process functions essential to the medium's existence. In the pop music industry these elements include the artist, the producer, record company executives, the promoter, sponsors, advertising agencies, radio programming, radio station  personnel, the audience, sponsor sales, and record consumption. The net output of this interdependent industrial body provides a filtering process through which all messages introduced into the medium must pass prior to reaching their ultimate destinations. A discussion of this process and its effect on communication, five explanatory charts, and a selected bibliography are included in this paper. (TS)",

A ritual at a hospital for the rehabilitation of drug addicts and alcoholics is described, analyzed, and discussed in terms of cross cultural comparison. It is concluded from this discussion that the first task of the ethnographer is to understand the semantics of action within the system being observed and to systematically report this abstraction from the data. When similar operations have been performed for numerous cultures, genuine cultural comparison and a body of valid scientific knowledge will develop. (TS)",

        "description":"This paper traces the history of motion pictures from Thomas Edison's vision in 1887 of an instrument that recorded body movements to the development of synchronized sound-motion films in the late 1920s. The first synchronized sound film was made and demonstrated by W. K. L. Dickson, an assistant to Edison, in 1889. The popular acceptance of silent films and their contents is traced through the development of film narrative and the use of music in the early 1900s. The silent era is labeled as a consequence of technological and economic chance and this chance is made to account for the accelerated development of the medium's visual communicative capacities. The thirty year time lapse between the development of film and the use of live human voices can therefore be regarded as the  critical stimuli which pushed the motion picture into becoming an essentially visual medium in which the audial channel is subordinate to and supportive of the visual channel. The time lapse also aided the motion picture to become a medium of artistic potential and significance. (RB)",

This portion of the study dealt with students, 336 of whom were interviewed. In addition, 40 questionnaires were randomly drawn from two groups of students--those who registered to vote and those who did not. The two questions the study sought to answer were: What are the basic attitude patterns of students toward elections? and Is there a difference in the attitude patterns of the students who registered to vote and those who did not? The Q factoring of results provided a four factor solution which accounted for 34.62 percent of the variance. This solution provided five distinct types or patterns of responses: (1) equivocal for most matters, (2)  concerned with altering the financial arrangements for financing election campaigns, (3) notable for its dislike of the media, (4) politically realistic, and (5) politically idealistic. There was no difference in the patterns of responses of the students who registered to vote and those who did not register. The data partially confirmed a Gallup Poll taken in the summer of 1974.

All cross-lagged correlations between media variables and candidate preference were non-significant. All test-retest correlations for candidate preference and political party preference were statistically significant.

        "description":"The Johnson Administration rationale for commitment to Vietnam was supported by a series of claims about the nature of the Vietnam war and the logic of U.S. involvement in it. This paper states and supports the thesis that the exaggerated tone of certainty in the administration case for commitment had a dual effect, undermining both the rhetorical validity and the effectiveness of the government viewpoint. Stephen Tolmin's &quot;Layout of Arguments,&quot; together with his analysis probability in argumentation provide a vehicle for analyzing both the validity and the effectiveness of Johnson Administration efforts to ascribe close to absolute certainty to its argumentative claims. A brief prototype discussion of Toulmin's layout is included and related to specific quotes from the Johnson  Administration concerning the Vitenam war. It is concluded from this discussion that criticism of the war centered on perceived discrepancies between the claims of and the reservations about the administration's case for commitment. Vocal protest arose from a perception that the administration engaged in overstated propaganda, and critical commentary became an effort to identify and publicize suppressed information. (TS)",

        "description":"On April 15, 1964, two black Mississippi civil rights leaders filed a petition with the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to deny the license renewal of the Lamar Life Broadcasting station, WLBT-TV, in Jackson (Mississippi). The petition was based on a monitoring study which had revealed that the programing on WLBT-TV provided moderate to segregationist views on civil rights, ignored prointegrationist positions, and, in a community which was nearly 50 percent black, aired only fifteen minutes a week of black programing. This paper examines the WLBT case to explain how the public was invested with the right to intervene in FCC action, a power which before 1966 had been restricted to broadcasters and other media owners, and why, for the first time, a broadcast license was  denied for programing reasons. The perspective which such an examination offers is important in considering the three major effects of the two WLBT court decisions on citizen action in broadcasting: citizen action as an antidote for FCC inaction; FCC efforts to increase public regulation of the airwaves; and possible conflicts arising from such public action.

Two problems are discussed in relation to this issue: video tape may distort the way a subject acts during recording: and the techniques, film conventions, and camera angles may be such that they give the best view of one person. Both of these factors may produce an unrealistic picture of the person being taped; in effect, the recording mechanism controls the action recorded. Persons using video tape in self-confrontation exercises would be able to successfully manipulate the results of the observation.

The key implication of the study is that test incentives serve to increase listening achievement scores of students but do not negate or interact with perceived interest, a variable related to the normal listening process.

This paper offers several suggestions for further research into early motion picture history. One glaring deficiency among almost all the early film historians was their lack of interest in the impact of the movies on the new audience. Film historians need to examine primary material such as social workers' reports and records, church publications, and personal diaries. A second area of research is the geographic diffusion of the first movie houses, which can also provide important data for those interested in the history of urban growth and development. Another  area of research involves the forerunners of the conventional movie house, especially touring exhibits and travelling projectionists. A final area of research would include applying the technique of content analysis to a comprehensive study of early film content. This paper concludes that continued development of film history depends on making it an academic endeavor with validity and relevance. (TS)",

The author views the tension between those who favor the expansion of civil rights for students and those who advocate a return to discipline based on the in loco parentis doctrine as indicative of a wider conflict between the Puritan concept of authoritarianism and Jeffersonian democracy. The report surveys major areas of legal controversy, including suspension, expulsion, and due process; corporal punishment; freedom of speech; the press; assembly and religion; freedom from unreasonable search and seizure; and accessibility of student records. The author concludes that the area of student constitutional rights is not  one that lends itself to easy solutions, and that the controversy will continue to plague the schools as long as the conflict in the society at large remains unresolved.

Causes of this condition are attributed to stereotyped role definitions learned by males and females very early in life, leading to lower job aspirations and the acquiring of minimal professional or vocational skills among females. Since only 2 percent of all the professors of educational administration are women, this might cause many to come to the conclusion that the \"know-how\" is with men and it is for men. Sexual stereotyping and the rigid role definition of both females and males is harmful to both sexes. Specific suggestions to help move women into educational administration are presented and some highlights of women attaining entrance  into traditionally male-dominated fields are excerpted from the media.

Most solar heating systems are technically simpler, and more highly developed, than solar cooling devices are. The determination of the best design concept for any particular application is not a simple process. Significant problems remain in the understanding of mechanisms, in the design and operation of cost-effective hardware, and in the understanding of the economic performance that is possible. Because of these remaining research and development problems, many different concepts were explored at the workshop. In addition to the purely technical problems, there are problems of reconciling novel equipment with current buildings and with building practices,  with other present-day hardware, with engineering, architectural, and building trade practices, with codes and other legal requirements, with financial practices and taxation systems, with consumer esthetic and practical needs, and with a myriad of other such \"non-engineering\" interfaces. A specific session on \"implementation\" was devoted to discussion of obstacles facing solar cooling, with the participation of specialists in many of the nonengineering areas. (Author/MLF)",

School boards are the decision-making system that, given the competitive federal, state, and local demands, decides on the particular educational policies and programs available to a cultural system. As such, school boards are meta-mediators in public education. While the school board may respond in either elite or arena council fashion, the tradition of school boards in America dictates an elite council process. This kind of council action provides a poor fit between such boards and the multicultural nature of most urban school districts. The arena type action is a poor fit with homogeneous  cultures. Boards that do not fit with the culture of their district are not effective as meta-mediators. The model suggested here provides an opportunity to evaluate the fit between the culture of the school board and the culture of the school district. (Author/IRT)",

It is a recognized fact that disadvantaged children need special help and attention beyond that required by the motivated student. We must never lose sight of the fact that these are individual children who are living in a particular environment, and that each child has his or her special needs. In some urban school systems, students are still being tracked; blacks and other minority group individuals are placed in special education classes and detention centers to a greater extent than nonminority students. The result is lower self-esteem and its concomitants for minority students. We need to get back to our philosophy  of educating individual students and not be so concerned about classifying students as fast or slow learners. In doing so, we will provide optimum educational benefits for each of the children in our school systems. (Author/JG)",

The characteristics that they attribute to strong or weak staff members are found to correspond to their positions on four dimensions of perceptual behavior: complexity-simplicity, explicitness, decision dominance, and role assumption.

The paper discusses whether punishing stimuli must be physically painful, the appropriate use of painful stimuli, and establishes corporal punishment as one category of operational definition under the larger construct of punishment. The next question discussed is whether a punishing stimulus must be aversive and whether aversiveness is both a necessary and sufficient condition to be able to state that punishment has occurred. Conclusions are drawn about the more suitable construct level definition of punishment. (Author/MLF)",

He then reports on his studies using an individual's expressed and wanted behaviors in inclusion, control, and affection as predictor variables for authenticity. This probe asked, What might indicate that the teacher was authentic, free, or open? The research decision was not to change or to modify the behavior of the teacher, but to learn which variables might help determine the authentic, open relationship between the teacher and any other he might interact with, especially within the school organization. By following existentialist theory and avoiding any traits,  personality, or characteristic approaches in teacher evaluation, especially through group norms or any other normative data, as well as by rejecting totally the neo-behavioral competency/performance-based approach, it is hoped that further systematic evaluation and painstaking isolation of variables contributing to the improvement of teacher evaluation shall be forthcoming through the approach articulated in this report and that other educational researchers will exploit this direction.

The purpose of this research project was to see if market structure has any effect on the output of public educational services, and, if so, to see how this effect would influence the probable outcomes of the major reform proposals. In order to carry out this project, a three equation econometric model of the market for public school teachers was specified and estimated. This market was selected because teachers' salaries are the largest single component of costs for the average district and because the quality of teachers determines the quality of education offered. Results show that  the degree of \"competition\" among school districts is positively associated with both the revenues appropriated for education and the wage paid to the instructional staff. The study concludes that some proposals for educational reform would, in the long run, decrease the total output of the educational sector. (Author/MLF)",

The author's theoretical investigation of existing systems of general state aid to school districts suggests two propositions: school districts do not maximize an ordinary utility function in the light of conventional budget constraints, and school districts are not likely to spend more equally under equalizing percentage grant systems. An analysis of data gathered from observations of 923 school districts in five states supports the first proposition and validates a specific model of school district decision-making. In addition, the author suggests that the same data will serve to test the second proposition after certain specification  problems encountered in the course of the analysis have been resolved.

This emphasis, based on assumptions about parent participation in suburban districts, has neglected the findings of suburban school studies that indicate the significance of community organizations in the articulation of educational interests and has diverted attention from the recent dilution of local school board authority. This paper relates the utilization of both institutional and independent community channels for the articulation of parent interests in a New York suburb and the results of some recent events in New  York City involving the adoption of bilingual programs for Puerto Rican students. The analysis illustrates some of the structural similarities in both types of districts that inhibit parent participation in school-controlled channels and identifies some of the factors related to effective parent participation. Results indicate that reforms are initiated not by established local community groups but by extra-local interest groups. (Author)",

        "description":"Oregon's new graduation requirements represent a bold effort to implement a mandated statewide competency-based program at the K-12 public school level. All the various ramifications of instituting a change of this magnitude cannot be predicted at this early date, but one major effect already evident is that local school districts have begun to conduct, perhaps for the first time in 40 years, a massive critical reassessment of all aspects of their educational programs. The motivating force in the reassessment process has been the need to determine procedures for transforming the theoretical constructs set forth in the graduation requirements into operational procedures for implementation in the local districts. The major purposes of this paper are to present background  information about the new Oregon graduation requirements, to identify several major problems faced by Oregon school districts in operationalizing the new graduation requirements, and to describe the role of the consortium approach in providing technical assistance to local school districts.

A total of 179 principals, 996 teachers, and 41 district level administrators from 39 districts composed the sample. Simple correlational, linear regression, and quadratic regression procedures were used to analyze the data. Overall, 52 significant relationships were found to partially support the hypothesis. Only five of these were curvilinear. The behavior dimensions, two work attitude factors, and the situational variables were the best predictors across the effectiveness types.  (Author)",

Choice objects can range from complex social, scientific, military, or educational alternatives to simple economic alternatives between assortments of branded convenience goods. Two classes of measured input data are used, one cognitive and the other affective. In addition, data on brand choice are needed to fit the parameters of the choice model. The STRATOP technique and the assorted preliminary analytical methods used modest amounts of standard data and yield very extensive findings, explicitly tailored to the needs of strategists and designers. Further experience is being accomulated with the expectation that the methods will find  application in a number of areas involving significant social and economic choices among competing alternatives.

New definitions of leadership are focusing on humanistically oriented, affectively concerned, relational, caring kinds of persons. The basic focus of CFK Ltd. has been on improving schools by improving the leadership behavior of school administrators. The relational concept discussed here emphasizes the individual self as a vital part of the curriculum. The group is a critical resource that can be developed to help learners learn more about themselves. The concept of the school administrator as a relational leader of communities includes continued attention to the school administrator as a leader, extension of the concept of schools into &quot;communities,&quot; and a new perspective on educational climate, which is  termed relational. An effective relational leader is a person who, by working with others, can establish the conditions under which these concepts can become a reality. (Author/JG)",

Although many of the statistics apply specifically to teachers in Connecticut, most of the discussion applies to other areas as well. The author considers the pros and cons of tying salary increases to the CPI and conclude that, although the CPI is a useful indicator of economic trends, it should not be used as the sole basis for  salary determination.

How does one (1) evaluate administrators in a decentralized system; (2) clarify and reconcile personal and organizational goals to achieve accountability; and (3) provide detailed feedback on the consequences of administrative behavior in order to encourage change in ineffective behavior. The scheme depends on careful delineation of system goals, and on the annual development of written statements of personal goals by administrators. These are guided by agreement on major functions and by system goals. The statements must provide criteria for measuring achievement. They are discussed in planning sessions and refined and revised until acceptable both to  the administrator concerned and the school district representative. The initial implementation revealed some practical difficulties, but more importantly suggested that theories that define organizations as goal-oriented systems are incomplete. Exchange or cooperation-based theories seem to be essential adjuncts. The scheme seems to have some utility. At the very least, it may help administrators drowning in a sea of trivia to identify some high priority activities and allocate their time and effort more rationally than at present. (Author)",

A number of adjustments may be made to offset disparities in rental values or home values and to reflect any income differences between renters and home owners.

Voucher systems and value added taxes were not favorably received. When local taxes are reduced, the public favored state aid to schools, but after 1972, when the connection to reduced local property taxes was eliminated, the support for state aid was reduced.

Behavioral and social science knowledge must be deliberately included in the design, structure, and utilization of training programs drawing on the theoretical and empirical literature of socialization of adults in complex organizations. The periods of pre-entry socialization, early on-the-job-socialization, and formal setting socialization should not be neglected. Wheeler's theoretical model of socialization interaction could facilitate effective training programs. The autonomy norms of university professors and the organizational structure of universities are problems retarding the incorporation of socialization knowledge into program designs, but those responsible for  preparing educational administrators need to know that behavioral and social sciences can provide systematic guidance relative to program design and operation, and are means for increasing capability to train more competent educational administrators.

Political promises can be foiled by bargaining outcomes, therefore states with bargaining rights should be exempted from the federal law. Equity between public and private employees is another problem that involves the issue of the right to strike. Equity must be a result of bargaining rather than of law, which involves the issue of public policy and what is negotiable. A third problem occurs when one level of government mandates costs or policies to be observed at another level. Federal law will affect the bargaining power at the local level. A federal law will inevitably result in a new balance of power between management and public  employee unions. Impact will also be felt on matters of job security, retirement, work day, sick leave, and other mandatory issues. If we continue to ignore the genuine dangers of a federal bill, and if we cannot find a way to meet the legitimate representational needs of public employees without sacrificing essential managerial ones, state and local government will be impaled between domination by the federal bureaucracy and domination by public employee unions.

        "description":"The planning, programming, budgeting system (PPBS) is an instrument to help policy-makers assign priorities and allocate resources. It does not seek to computerize what is essentially a political process, nor is it intended that the statisticians and cost accountants take over functions that properly belong to the political decision-maker. PPBS is a method of organizing information in a more effective way for decision-making, with the aid of modern analytical techniques. The principal elements of any PPBS are: (1) the precise identification of program objectives; (2) systematic consideration of alternative means of reaching those objectives in terms of their relative benefits and costs; (3) forecasting the future-year cost implications of present decisions. In addition to  explaining the PPB System, this monograph attempts to dispel exaggerated claims and misconceptions and describes some of the practical problems accompanying implementation.

The LEM staff believes that good public relations call for parents neither being &quot;sold&quot; nor merely kept informed but, rather, for parents to participate in helping to develop the program and the climate for improved learning. Thus, the goal for Project LEM became the total commitment to community involvement on the part of the Project Director and every staff member. This commitment found expression in a citizen advisory council, mini-teas, parent workshops, individual parent-teacher conferences,  home visitations, open houses, class visitations, and an open door policy.

These problems differ widely in their content, in their scope, in the types of people to whom they are important, and in the intensity with which people complain about them. Many schools try to pinpoint the causes of these problems and to look for solutions before the problems themselves are well understood. How can instructional planners rationally determine which of the many problems they face deserve their attention? This training unit presents a systematic approach to the process of analyzing instructional problems. It will take you through a series of steps or decision points by which you can analyze problems. Each step is the subject of one of the six modules in the training unit: Which problem signals warrant further analysis?  What problems do the signals imply? What additional information is needed? How should the information be collected? Are the problems valid? If they are valid, how serious are the problems? (Author)",

This training unit seeks to assist school personnel in one of the essential phases of these three tasks, that of translating long-range educational goals into usable objectives that will provide guidance in selecting curricula that will contribute toward students' accomplishment of the goals and that will provide guidance in measuring the effectiveness of the selected programs. The unit emphasizes the importance of viewing goal refinement as a logical and continuous process. This means that goals are translated into increasingly specific objectives that logically follow the previous level until a useful level  is reached, and that the results of the process should not be viewed as final but as subject to constant review and revision by users. The four modules in this unit cover the goal refinement process, the screening of objectives, the analysis of sets of curricular objectives, and the district planning for goal refinement.

School boards will not meet this challenge if they continue to tolerate certain common obstacles to effective policy-making. New horizons can be reached if boards and their administrators can master and implement the arts and skills of responsible and responsive policy-making. Up-to-date and responsive written policies provide tangible evidence that school boards can indeed govern. Written policies are the chief means by which the school board governs the schools; administrative rules are one of the means by which the superintendent implements the boards policies. A project to codify and update school board policies is much  like cleaning the attic. Once the attic is clean, the board and administrator can finally see what is there. However, codifying policies is a time-consuming service that should not be performed by the board itself. The board should operate at the decision-making level, not at the service level of policy manual preparation. (Author/JG)",

Using standard regression procedures, a model was constructed of the relationship between teacher behavior and student outcomes for 1971-72. The model was verified on 1972-73 data. The findings are ambiguous. The first year model is satisfactory as a post hoc predictor. It is less satisfactory applied to the second year data.

Electing to use a cycled-attendance plan, the program was established in selected schools to ascertain its feasibility in solving overcrowded space problems. Students attend classes for 45 school days and vacation for 15 school days with four such cycles equalling a normal school year. One-third more space becomes available during each 45-day cycle. The pilot project was implemented to generate decision-making data before committing all schools and resources to the program. Evaluation activities were planned to determine the effect of cycle  attendance, year-round education on learning, the community, and the expenditures of capital and operation funds. At the time of this report, evaluation data was not yet available. (Author/DW)",

Questionnaires, telephone interviews, mail, and personal interviews were used to collect data from agencies such as parks and recreation, libraries, Little League, churches, scouting groups, music and dance studios, and the YMCA and YWCA. It was concluded that the 45-15 program does affect the youth agencies with the single exception of the YMCA and YWCA. Each of the community agencies has modified its program in some way to meet the new needs resulting from the 45-15 program. Although program adjustments have been made to accommodate problems caused by 45-15, few provisions have been made for organized activities or supervised  playground facilities for children on the vacation cycle.

        "description":"The Fargo Public School System has completed a three-year project on a Planning-Programming-Budgeting-Evaluation System (PPBES). The two major purposes of this project were to develop a model for PPBES and to implement this system in the school district operation. Project activities included work in all four of the PPBES phases. The planning stage was considered the foundation of the system. Several administrators and teachers were involved with various tasks in this phase. The project staff developed a multilevel program structure outline to encompass and relate all activities that take place in the Fargo district. In the programming phase, the staff sought to select the best route to achieve goals and objectives developed in the first phase. An innovation in the budgeting stage  was the assigning of expenditures to specific school programs. The evaluation phase is used to enable school districts to determine the extent to which their objectives are achieved. The project staff feels that the system has many merits, can be very useful in providing important information to decision-makers, and can be very efficient in assisting districts to provide educational accountability.

        "description":"Reasons for the present emphasis on all-year operation of schools differ from those prevailing 30-40 years ago. During the depression emphasis was on economy. Recently, a more sensible reason for an extended school year is coming into focus--the year-round school has educational value. It is not just something to be considered in order to save money, though that certainly is one of the criteria. The year-round operation of the public schools is necessary for meeting the educational needs of an urban society. After a lengthy review of the research on and practice with the extended school year, the author presents extensive findings in favor of the extended school year. He addresses such areas of concern as academic achievement, remedial programs, graduation rates, mental health,  student maturity, student social needs, handicapped children, and college admission.

        "author":["Deal, Terrence E."],
        "description":"This report builds a case for survey feedback as a useful method of assisting schools to respond actively, rather than passively, to uncertainty and complexity in the school environment. The main argument is that passive responses, such as defensiveness and buffering, reduce educational effectiveness. Planning, an active response, creates conflicts and places demands on time, money, and other school resources. But, in the long run, planning may be a more permanent and effective strategy. The assumption is that educational problems and their solutions are largely organizational. To develop an active response, schools need a systematic information-gathering process, problem-solving capabilities, implementation plans, new organizational designs, and training activities to help  people assume new roles. The field of organizational development has been a source of assistance in training. Survey feedback, an organizational development technique, can provide assistance in the other areas, particularly the diagnostic part of problem-solving. This report describes a survey-feedback approach that combines survey instrument with organization theory and involves school people in defining problems, proposing solutions, and evaluating the impact of the change strategies.

        "description":"This paper describes how the evaluation of teachers by principals is hampered by difficulties in communication. The 131 teachers and 33 principals questioned did not agree on how much teachers knew about the way they were evaluated. Nor did they agree on the frequency of evaluations; the teachers reported less frequent evaluation than the principals believed they communicated. The lower the frequency of communicated evaluations reported by teachers, the more dissatisfied were the teachers and the less helpful were the evaluations in improving the quality of their teaching. Two schools were selected for more intensive examination. They differed dramatically in the frequency of evaluation by principals, and the pattern of findings in the two natural settings strongly supported the  results of the statistical analysis of the larger sample. The current very low frequency of teacher evaluations in many schools is not providing adequate guidance for teachers. An increase in the frequency of evaluation would increase teacher satisfaction, increase the teachers' belief that evaluations can provide helpful guidance, and decrease the teachers' sense of threat to their professional autonomy.

Physical and cognitive territoriality have meaning in the study and exercise of power and status, and are essential elements in understanding, acquiring, and exercising power and status in complex organizations. These territories play an important part in understanding the human networks that are essential to analysis and operation of power within an organization. A matrix analysis, used to analyze group structure, can reveal the connections and subgroups, thus becoming a sound model for analyzing the use of power in complex organizations. Three case studies are presented to  illustrate the uses of cognitive and physical territoriality. (Author/DW)",

These models raise two political questions: In routine, non-episodic decisions, does the board actually control policy? and, Is the board perception of the administration supportive or skeptical? Four power relationships become available to answer the questions--a \"paternalistic\" model, a \"legitimize\" model, an \"enforcers\" model, and a \"reformers\" model. The implications of whether boards should have their own staff raise philosophical and political meanings of school governance. Administration and  board are institutional definitions, derived from the bureaucratic structure, and it is imperative to decide who makes policy. If actual policy is formed and implemented by decisions reached by competing professions, interest groups, and select individuals, then staffing in response to institutional definitions makes little sense.

The independent schools that face this fact and adjust their search and admissions policies accordingly are more likely to find the future less shocking than those that do not; they will also be more justified in their claims to training the leaders of the future. The price of survival for independent schools will  probably be less independence because the judicial system is now hammering out procedures and due process for making decisions relating to the rights of teachers and to the rights of children.

        "description":"In an effort to investigate a broad variety of influences on academic achievement a sample was drawn of seventh-grade students in Uganda. The sample of 2,293 students represented an average of 10.7 percent of the schools, and 13.1 percent of the grade-seven children. A questionnaire administered to these children included five personal statements that were attempts to discover how a child might feel about himself regarding two parallel concepts: ego-control, and self-confidence. Among industrial societies it is common to find measures of socioeconomic status, attitudes towards oneself, and performance on various tests all correlated with each other. Among Uganda primary school children this is not the case. Their attitudes are consistently stronger correlations of performance  measures; furthermore, there is no relationship between those attitudes and placement along the socioeconomic status spectrum. Unlike our own society, socioeconomic status makes little or no difference to how a child might be expected to perform on tests of academic achievement, yet we have in common the fact that how a child feels about himself does affect his performance.

The responses illustrate that resolutions of the local control problems are uncertain, not due to lack of direction by participants, but rather by their conflicting interests. Four general principles are suggested for operating within the many influences and interactions in open school systems: the line for demarcation for maintaining local control should clearly be established; school boards should promote communication among participants in the system and themselves; local power should be in the hands of those local participants who show the most responsibility; and  overall control of power should be within the duly elected school board who is, by action, representative of local participants of the system.

While some argue that federal accountability measures have been only superficially utilized in many instances, federal mandates have probably done more to sensitize educators to accountability than any other stimulus. Different states have approached accountability through state assessment programs, personnel evaluation programs, accreditation, or comprehensive systems involving all the accountability elements. Legislators have often seen accountability as a way to get feedback on the systems that consume much of the state budget. Administrators and teachers have often felt that another system, developed without their involvement, has been imposed on them by the state.  Too often students have felt accountability's impact in an increasing number of tests and a subtle change in curriculum. Some say the accountability movement will be replaced by growing interest in alternative schools or another movement. But even in other movements, accountability questions must be addressed, for ultimately they have validity only as they deal with the purposes of education. (Author/JG)",

There are notable exceptions, but nonpublic schools generally have not been involved as equitable and effective participants in Title III programs. One reason for this may be that many of the problems took a long time to surface. Title III has been one of the lesser known of the ESEA programs, particularly at the local level. It has only been within the past several years that strong voices have been raised about the inequitable treatment under Title III  for children attending nonpublic schools. The bulk of this report presents details on the amount of participation and involvement that have been reported in various studies, recommendations for improvement, the kinds of arrangements and programs that are working, happenings at the federal and state level that relate to nonpublic school participation, a profile of one state, and the regulations on participation as contained in Title IV of ESEA.

In the first half of the document the author discusses the historical background of deaf education and the linguistic and cognitive abilities of the deaf; focuses on the linguistic competence of the deaf in sign language, English, and idiosyncratic (gesture) language (offering evidence that the deaf learn English as a foreign language); and describes some common \"deafisms\", comparing them with constructions found in non-standard dialects and pidgins. Reported is an investigation in which the performance of 15 profoundly prelingually deaf junior high school students on 2 written  repetition tasks in \"Deaf English\" (DE) and Standard English (SE) was compared to the performance of nine fourth grade hearing controls. Among findings noted are that deaf Ss committed significantly more errors in SE than normal children 5 years younger; that the deaf Ss found the DE sentences no easier than the SE sentences to recall and repeat correctly. It is concluded that there is a variety of non-standard English that the deaf use instead of SE, and data on language patterns of the deaf are presented. (LS)",

Ss were assigned to either a visual or audiovisual training modality and subdivided further into a token or non-token reinforcement condition. Evaluation measures included periodic administration of receptive and expressive generalization tests to measure transfer of learning. Among conclusions were that primary students benefited from auditory supplementation of the Project LIFE filmstrips, that  Ss using Project LIFE showed no additional benefit from an extrinsic token reinforcement system, and that Ss retained the receptive language skills acquired during Project LIFE instruction over an interval of at least 6 months.

The Sheltering Arms Parent Interview Schedule was used to elicit responses about the specific program and its recalled influences on the mothers' personal lives; the program's effectiveness in easing family problems; and the degree to which the information and services were generalized to other social and community situations. Statistical analysis indicated a significant relationship between professional help from the director and teachers in individual conferences and the mothers' perceived benefits in management of the retarded child, resolution of family problems and improved feelings of self worth. Among other findings was the professional staff's special assistance  to mothers in matters of child discipline, school or agency placement, sterilization decisions and the mothers' achievement of emotional and intellectual acceptance of the parental role. The study's implications for teacher education and school programs included increased emphasis on teacher experience and training with adults, use of parents to assist teacher training, and the assignment of resource teachers to work with parents. Three appendixes provide such information as a program description of The Sheltering Arms School and The Sheltering Arms Parent Interview Schedule. (Author/CL)",

The areas to which standardization may refer - phonology, spelling, punctuation, grammar and lexicon - are discussed, and problems associated with efforts to standardize them in schools are pointed out. The position taken is that a decision to promote language standards should weigh the advantages against the disadvantages, i.e., clarity in communication against time and effort needed to implement and teach standard usage. The complex nature of the process of language standardization is described by analyzing six interrelated components: isolation of a norm, assignment of value, establishing a purpose for the norm, acceptance, comparison and time span. Finally, the following criteria are suggested for  standardizing or maintaining a standard within the educational domain: the number of styles it is useful to isolate, and whether schools want language standardization.

However, if the matrix clause contains a negative or an interrogative, the complement verb is usually in the subjunctive, but sometimes in the indicative. Examples are the verbs &quot;penser&quot; and &quot;croire&quot; in sentences such as: 1) Elle ne croit pas que Jean est intelligent. and 2) Elle ne croit pas que Jean soit intelligent. Traditional grammar books usually offer confusing explanations of these facts, based on loose, impressionistic, quasi-semantic pronouncements, often contradictory in detail. It is the hypothesis of this paper that an explicit rule can be formulated to account for this class of verbs and that the facts of French are analogous to those of English which are accounted for  by the rule of Negative Transportation. The problems inherent in such a position are considered here, and the conditions of the application of the Negative Transportation rule are examined. (Author/PMP)",

Their general properties are examined as well as the general relations between elements.

The main issue appears to be the question of what determines sentence meaning. Specifically, it is stated that Chomsky's nonstandard theory is in opposition to McCawley's nonstandard theory and to Chomsky's standard theory, the major revision in Chomsky's nonstandard theory being the hypothesis that sentence meaning depends not only on the deep structure but also on the surface structure. Chomsky's nonstandard theory is examined in order to answer two questions: whether it admits a theory whereby it is possible to state whether or not  transformations change meaning; and whether it admits that deep structures, but not intermediate structures, determine certain meanings. It is concluded that Chomsky's nonstandard theory is not clear on these two questions. A nonstandard theory is then proposed which differs from Chomsky's in that it attempts to explain how semantic representations of sentences are determined and how Pi and Pn participate in their determination. It is concluded that the greater accuracy of one theory or the other can only be determined after further descriptive study within the framework of both theories. (AM)",

Following this, there is a discussion of the notion of \"article\" and how it may be described meaningfully.

It is determined that superlatives mark absolute disparity, that comparatives mark relative disparity, and that superlatives and comparatives are more closely related to each other than to equatives. Analysis of degree marker types reinforces the close relationship between comparatives and superlatives as opposed to equatives. Suppletive paradigms furnish yet another link in the chain of evidence relating comparative and superlative on the one hand and positive and equative on the other. The markedness hierarchy theory, i.e., that the  superlative is more marked than the comparative and the latter more than the positive, is further supported by the fact that superlative degree markers may be derived from comparative degree markers but not the converse. Appendixes include: tables of standard and degree markers, of hypotactic marker types, and of formal identity or near-identity of markers. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This is a commentary on Lau v. Nichols, in which the issue is stated as the constitutional right of non-English-speaking children to a meaningful public education. The principal legal argument of the plaintiffs is that the San Francisco school district's \"English-only\" policy denies them equal protection of the laws by placing non-English-speaking students in an educational environment not designed to educate them. Considerations are offered as to the manner in which various equal protection doctrines may be applied by the Supreme Court in this case. Decisions affecting educational discrimination against blacks are cited, as well as other decisions dealing with educational discrimination and constitutional rights. Consideration is also given to legal theories to which the  plaintiff may have recourse. It is concluded that the argument that the English-only policy violates the Civil Rights Act of 1965 may be an alternative to the equal protection approach. The commentary concentrates on these underlying issues and policy considerations: (1) whether non-English-speaking children need judicial help; (2) what the extent and nature of the harm is; (3) reasons for the English-only policy; and (4) whether the problem is judicially manageable. It is noted that in the event of a victory in Lau, problems may arise in the form of efforts to circumvent the ruling or opposition from ethnic groups interested in ethnic culture preservation.

It is argued that the classification systems currently available too often fail to achieve the goals of description and usefulness in promoting effective treatment. Case histories and other data from 82 children with severe language disorders were used to assign each child to one of seven diagnostic categories. The 82 cases were then regrouped on the basis of 32 clinical variables using a step-wise clustering procedure. The seven original categories collapsed to only two definable clusters. A repetition of the analysis using a  larger sample and different variable set resulted in similar clusters. The variables which define these clusters are discussed, as well as the resulting implications for assessment procedures in general. (Author/AM)",

Woo's hypothesis that tone features are to be specified segmentally is discussed as well as Leben's statement that in some languages tone is suprasegmental. The following are criteria suggested as a basis for tonal representation: where tone is a feature of units larger than a segment, or if contour tones fall on single vowels, the representation should be suprasegmental; where phonotactic constraints refer to both tonal and nontonal constraints, the representation should be segmental. However, it is not yet clear what features are generally needed to represent tone either suprasegmentally or segmentally. Furthermore, there are indications that a viable theory of  language will have to take into account varying types of tone languages which require further classification beyond that of requiring segmental or suprasegmental representation.

The generativist conception of linguistics as a science is characterized by the view that the description of a language is a deductive theory in which the sentences of the language are generated from rules of grammar. The language that is studied by a linguist is characterized as \"human\" and \"natural.\" These terms are examined: human language as opposed to animal communication; and natural language as opposed to artificial  and scientific language. Finally, linguistics is distinguished from other disciplines which are also concerned with human language by the fact that language is the primary object of study in linguistics, while in other disciplines language is ancillary. Finally, various branches of linguistics are discussed as they relate to structural and synchronic linguistics. (AM)",

English linguists possess a special expertise in language structure and analysis that gives them a unique advantage in designing and teaching such courses. A look at the training needs of teachers at all levels illustrates the contributions linguists can make. Language and reading courses for propsective elementary teachers should treat morphology and phonology, including suprasegmentals, with special emphasis on their relation to reading and spelling skills. Training for both elementary and secondary teachers should include dialectology; it will promote a positive attitude toward dialects and enable teachers to deal more  intelligently with dialect interference in the classroom. Courses for secondary and college teachers should place heavy emphasis on transformational-generative grammar and should also include discourse analysis and the study of literary language, among other subjects. If linguists are successful in taking advantage of the opportunities discussed here, they will create a demand for other courses, which, in turn, will create a demand for more linguists to teach them.

A main point is that in analyzing speech styles it is important to elecit more than one style from each speaker, as both interview conditions and other factors may influence style. The paper presents some concrete examples of two major stylistic divisions, spontaneous and controlled, and posits reasons for the stylistic variations. From this evidence, psychoacoustic and psycho-sociolinguistic generalizations are stated. An analysis of acousitic data demonstrates that an understanding of speech production in more than one style facilitates understanding of style variation. Spectrographic measurements mapped the speaker's vowel systems as each speaker was tested as to both spontaneous and  controlled speech. Attention especially focused on vowels in a state of flux, as these provide variation. It was concluded that social as well as phonetic factors affect sylistic variation; that variation in stylistic patterns is not limited to only one social or cultural group; and that this type of multistylistic analysis can provide useful information to the dialectologist and the psychoacoustician as well as the phonetician and sociolinguist.

The first step in this part of the project, which involved screening for communication disorders, was the selection of tests to identify language disorders. Step 2, the development of criteria for identifying the disorder, raised the question of when such a disorder should be considered pathological and when it should be considered an identifying feature of some dialect of English. The main question, however, was whether a test developed for one population is valid when administered to another. The Auditory Association and Grammatical Closure subtests of the ITPA were  administered to a random selection of subjects representing the Arizona public school population. Subgroups differences appeared chiefly across ethnic boundaries. From this it is concluded that a test is valid for a specific group only if relevant norms have been developed for that group.

Secondly, patterns should be presented as they are really produced by native speakers: using normal speed, intonation, pronunciation, and pronoun replacement. Thirdly, classroom cues used to elicit responses or to initiate language should be of the kind that a native speaker would respond to.

Bilinguals will often switch languages to suit the topic or the listener; persons who speak both standard and dialect forms of a language will use the standard in formal conversation and the dialect when discussing local issues with local people. This linguistic code-switching theory is applied to D. H. Lawrence's \"Lady Chatterly's Lover\" to examine the author's use of language in the novel. Several conversations involving Lady Chatterly, Sir Clifford Chatterly, Mellors the gamekeeper, and others are analyzed. It is observed that Mellors, the only character to use code-switching regularly, speaks standard English with Sir  Clifford and others, but often uses a Derbyshire dialect with Lady Chatterly to convey intimacy, to confuse her, or to exert power over her. He alternates between standard English and Derbyshire to suit his purpose. That Lawrence employed this linguistic switching consciously is illustrated by his accuracy and his authorial comments on language. The theory of code-switching and similar linguistic developments may be of some use in literary analysis. (CK)",

The crucial factor governing the schwa-dropping process is the number of consonants preceding the schwa. Another constraint is the fact that the schwa cannot be dropped in two contiguous syllables. It is concluded that a global derivational constraint is required to explain the phenomenon within the theoretical framework proposed by Chomsky and Halle, which postulates a principle of simultaneous application of rules. The preferred solution postulates that the process of optional dropping of the schwa in French is applied in iterative  sequence from left to right. (Author/AM)",

Other linguists believe immature perception determines the form of child speech. This paper suggests that children with articulation and/or reading and spelling dfficulties have failed to learn the phonological system of English and that in many cases the deviant phonological system reflects delayed or disordered perceptual abilities. Two kinds of tests, the oral verbal intelligence tests and the \"phonic\" spelling tests, are suggested as ways of gaining insight into the nature of possible misperceptions. It is further suggested that a child's  success in verbal development depends on his ability to perceive the discrepancy between his forms and adult forms, and that the role of perceptual constraints should be considered in the investigation of deviant phonological systems. Studies of children with delayed language skills enable linguists to study phenomena that pass by too rapidly to be studied in most children. (Author/AM)",

Examples of vocalic tension in French are given, and the process from tension to relaxation is described. This tension is also shown to have an influence on the development of the lexicon as well as grammar rules in French. Formal analysis of tension thus shows it to bear a close relation to grammatical rules. A functional (or universal) analysis, on the other hand, would have to be more complicated in order to account for exceptions. (AM)",

A simpler explanation is offered through analyzing auxiliary reduction as a three-step process. The three steps are: (1) unstressed auxiliaries containing lax vowel must undergo the Auxiliary Vowel Reduction (AVR) which changes the vowel to a schwa; (2) the Auxiliary Glide Deletion Rule (AGD) will do away with initial [h] and some instances of initial [w]; and (3) by the rule of Auxiliary Schwa Deletion (ASD), and initial schwa obtained as a result of AVR or AGD can be deleted provided it is preceded by a [-consonantal] segment.

King's (1973) arguments against intrinsic ordering are based on the theory that two reordering rules operate in phonological processes. Through a systematic examination of characteristic examples of King's theory, it is demonstrated that: (1) King's theory is self-contradicting; (2) the theory confuses phonological change with phonological rule; and (3) what has been called reordering of two rules often is simply a restructuring brought about by phonological change. Andersen's (1973) theory of \"adaptive rules\" is considered the most convincing explanation of phonological  change. In conclusion it is reiterated that rule reordering does not exist as a diachronic phonological process, and that, therefore, any argument which uses rule reordering to refute a theory of intrinsic order has no validity.

The first stage of development involves perception skills. Motor coordination, spatial realtionships, depth  perception, and ability to perceive constants are explained, and activities for developing these skills are detailed. Language skills of naming and categorizing and the ability to understand and discriminate visual symbols are similarly treated. Workbook activities and lessons are included as students learn to recognize words both visually and aurally and to form them into sentences. Lessons and vocabulary are based on everyday experiences.

Attitudes toward the U.S. administration vary from the pro-American bid for Commonwealth status by the Marianas to the movement for independence in the Marshalls. The polarization of these attitudes from the northernmost to southernmost reaches of the territory seems to be in direct relation to the extent and intensity of the exposure to an American-English language environment in the various areas. In spite of a 200-year background of Spanish influence on Guam, the dynamic shift in one generation from Chamorro to English as a mother tongue, together with an almost jingoistic U.S. patriotism, exemplifies the significant effect of seven decades of exposure to English, especially through American television. In  Micronesia, English has been the official language for only the last three decades, with the result that there is a much stronger persistence of native cultural patterns and a greater reliance on the local vernaculars, with a more critical attitude toward the U.S., especially among college students, than there is in Guam. These pro and con attitudes toward the U.S. and its culture have not been planned. Language engineering has, unfortunately, never been used to unify Guam and the Trust Territory of the Pacific islands into a social, economic, and political entity. (Author/PCT-PMP)",

The course is divided into lessons, each of which is then divided into objectives with activities suggested by the instructor. The student is evaluated on these objectives only when he feels prepared; however, a minimum number of lessons have to be completed by the end of the quarter in order to successfully complete the course. The four language skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing are emphasized. The class meets periodically as a group for conversation practice and grammar or cultural discussions. At other times, students meet in small groups or individually with the instructor. In  general, class is conducted in a rather informal manner. The student, however, knows at all times what is expected of him and where he stands as far as these expectations are concerned. Inasmuch as students do not all learn at the same rate, it is hoped that such a course will help alleviate some of the problems experienced by both student and teacher in a lock-step system in which slow, average, and fast learners are placed together.

The analysis is intended as a resource in teaching Polish to speakers of English. Consequently, areas of special difficulty for the English-speaking learner are stressed: the phonology of segmental phonemes, the morphology of nouns, noun phrases, verbs, and verb phrases. An outline of basic Polish and English sentence patterns is given. Both grammar and phonology are discussed from a traditional-structural viewpoint, although the section on grammar requires some knowledge of terms belonging to the transformational generative theory. Chapter one deals with phonology (segmental and suprasegmental phonemes), and chapter two deals with morphology and syntax. The bibliography  lists 69 items where specific learning problems are discussed at length. These items may be particularly useful in obtaining more theoretical elaboration or for preparing sets of exercises concerning specific Polish structures. (Author/AM)",

Suggestions for grades 7 through 13 include individual research projects and games for two players. Suggestions for adults include working on legal documents, official forms, etc., according to the students' individual needs, and creating dialogues in pairs.

Error samples are taken from a taped panel discussion containing prepared and spontaneous speech, from a TOEFL test, and from a quiz. Errors are divided into intralingual, or those reflecting general characteristics of rule learning, and developmental, or those illustrating attempts to build hypotheses about English from limited knowledge. Most of the errors were of the intralingual type. An area of specific difficulty was the use of the article; this is shown to be due to a confusion about English syntax, rather than interference from Russian. Problems of interference from French and Spanish are also examined. The structural approach is  suggested as a possible source of error, as well as the practice of having idioms memorized without attention to their syntactic contexts. (AM)",

        "description":"This paper is a description of a college-level instructional program put into operation in the face of the obvious need for individualization of foreign language instruction. The program represents a compromise solution between the limitations presented by institutions and students on the one hand, and the need for greater flexibility on the other. The program consists of an options procedure, whereby the instructor determines the goals for the course and sets up a limited number of tasks, or options, by which students may reach the goals. The instructor assigns a specific number of points to each task. Students then choose as many options as they wish, and grades are computed on the number of points earned. The program's advantages are that it is manageable by one instructor; it  calls for no more than the usual resources; it accomodates itself to certain institutional regulations; and it compromises in the matter of individualization in various manners.

        "description":"Foreign-language methodology courses do not generally provide potential teachers with sufficient criteria for judging either the most reasonable format or the probable cost/labor effectiveness of media materials which could be used to advantage in their classes. Opportunities for practical application of the student's knowledge, particularly where linguistics is concerned, are severely limited in traditional courses by the overwhelming amount of theory deemed necessary. This course was designed to integrate the theoretical aspects of linguistics with mediated instruction in several specific ways, providing a system approach to production and evaluation of instruction of instructor-designed materials. The objectives of the course were to enable the student to: 1) isolate and  evaluate a problem in applied instruction in terms of its relative importance in the total material to be learned in the language course; 2) consider various media solutions to a problem, and judge them by specific objective criteria; and 3) deal with specific media systems, so that he may better utilize available materials and make specific recommendations as to possible future systems whenever the opportunity arises. This paper outlines the course itself, with special consideration given to an evaluation of the student's reactions. Suggestions for future work in this direction are offered. (Author/KM)",

The literature indicates that the nature of the on-campus experience, the characteristics of the student, and the motivation for learning for the commuter student may have significant implications for educational planning. The actual number of commuter students in American higher education is in dispute. It is clear, though, that commuter students compose a larger percentage of the student population in American higher education. For this review, commuter students will be defined as those student living with their parents, spouse, family or by themselves, but are not simply \"living off campus.\" This review of the literature focuses on the commuter student  as a unique person in higher education and with educational needs distinctive from the resident student and the student \"living off campus.\" The review will be concerned only with the literature published in the last 5 years (1971-1975). The literature suggests particular characteristics for a commuter student, effects of commuting on the educational experience, and it reviews several models, proposed and in operation for meeting the needs of commuting students.

        "description":"The admissions offices of 109 large, primarily white universities returned a questionnaire on their minority admission policies for the sixth consecutive year. The median percent of new black freshmen was down to 5 percent nationally in 1974 compared to 6 percent in 1973, with the largest drops occurring in the Middle States and Western regions. Schools tended to use fewer selection criteria for all students, and were less apt to use high school record combined with ACT or SAT. Schools with special programs for blacks increased to 62 percent, compared to 50 percent in 1973. Twenty percent of the schools said they were offering less financial aid in 1974. Also 16 percent of the schools linked tighter budgets to fewer incoming minority students. Additionally, 14 percent of the  schools were limiting their minority student recruiting activities. Eleven percent of the schools cited other effects such as a cutback in support services or a closer coordination among university agencies. It appears that the emphasis given minority admissions has peaked and is now declining. The importance of continuing to monitor the progress of universities in handling minority admissions and retention programs seems even more clear in times of stress in higher education. For it is in such times that we run the greater risk of losing what gains have been made in minority student education, while we are preoccupied with seemingly more pressing issues. (Author)",

She was also more interested in a day-care center, a place to change and shower and stay overnight, black student activities, and counseling services than the typical white commuter. Among the more interesting findings on commuters in general, regardless of race, were that only 5 percent were in carpools, most would prefer to be commuters if given the choice, and most were interested in basic safety and survival needs,  such as personal lockers or a place to take naps, rather than other student services.

        "description":"The educational and social rationale for granting academic credit for off-campus learning grows out of the notion that educational systems now have the capability to change from selective to adaptive systems. If this change is to occur in ways to permit access, not just in terms of admission but in terms of credentials, then concomitant changes in institutional practices must take place. The granting of academic credit for learning acquired off-campus is viewed by some as a socially just method to bestow credentials earned regardless of source and is a logical extension of the access goal. The focus of this paper is the granting of credit for prior off-campus learning, a form of credit awarded for experiential learning that is in contrast to such sponsored programs as cooperative  learning and field experience. Several procedures are in use to grant credit for prior off-campus learning. A traditional method to grant credit for off-campus learning is an examination for college-level credit. The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) is the best known method. Academic credit is also being granted for off-campus learning from life and work experience. Special degree programs, such as the external degree, make great use of the various forms of academic credit for off-campus learning. The emphasis of this report is on learner-centered methods of evaluation that permit institutions to become responsive to the growing market of new students who seek credentials from higher education institutions.

These grants are not intended to cover all college costs nor are they intended to meet the total unmet need of participating students. Ohio Instructional Grants serve as one source of student assistance and should be combined with available funds from other financial aid programs. The major objective of the Ohio Instructional Grant Program is to assist in the elimination of the economic barrier that discourages many promising students in their plans to seek higher education. These grants are not awarded upon the basis of scholarship, as such, but upon the basis of  relative financial need.

        "description":"A 20-month old faculty development program at a large urban university, Virginia Commonwealth University, is examined by discussing the strategies employed to facilitate faculty growth, and analyze, in hindsight, how appropriate or inappropriate they may have been in view of faculty or institutional needs. Virginia Commonwealth University's conception of faculty development covers a broad range. It includes development as a teacher, for example, sharpening of teaching and evaluation skills, getting feedback on teaching behavior, and clarifying values of teaching and learning. But it also includes development of other faculty roles, such a planning and managing curricula and advising students. At a third level, faculty development seeks to help design an organizational climate  whereby the faculty member may work toward accomplishment of his/her own personal and professional goals. In short, the purpose of faculty development is to help faculty members function more comfortably and effectively in the university setting. Based on those observations, implications for the development of other faculty development programs are noted and discussed in terms of guidelines for initiating, implementing, and evaluating them.

The appropriation figures were obtained through a detailed review of all state budget documents and fiscal reports available to the researchers in 1972 and 1973. The source documents included: state executive and legislative budgets, budget analysis reports, and supplemental budgetary issuances. In addition, state university financial statements were reviewed to clarify or validate specific appropriations items. The body of the report presents both a summarization of state patterns of support, and a breakdown of individual state profiles. The state profiles  illustrate the broad spectrum and variation in budget formats and line-item listings. However, the differences were brought as far as possible into some degree of uniformity by the format of this report and were referenced accordingly. This report reviews state appropriations, i.e., appropriations from the general fund derived solely from taxes on individuals, corporations, etc. as a source of financial support for health profession education and training. Other broad areas of financial support are: federal government, local government, and private agencies. The private sector covers a broad range, which includes, in addition to grants, loans, scholarships, fellowships, etc., the tuition paid by students enrolled in educational institutions. A glossary of terms is included.  (Author/PG)",

Soon after the establishment of Soviet power, the libraries of the Supreme Economic Council were formed. Attached to various industrial and scientific institutions and under the centralized guidance of the Supreme Economic Council, they formed the basis of the present technical library network. These libraries have been and are developing as an indissoluble part of the general library system of the USSR, providing close coordination and cooperation within their own system, with other types of libraries, and with scientific and technical  institutions. This well-planned development is the result of carrying out Lenin's principles of librarianship. It has resulted in the creation of a single multisection network of scientific and technical libraries, spread throughout the country and based on both technical branch and territorial principles. At present, a long term plan is being elaborated to carry technical library development through the year 2000, moving toward a single State library system. (Author/SL)",

        "description":"To identify the essential core of statistical data needed to plan improvements in library and information services in the United States, one must examine some recent trends in public administration methods and their potential applicability to the library field. Public administrators increasingly regard planning as a cycle: perception of needs, formulation and comparison of options, transmission of findings to decision makers, and evaluation. In the United States, the local autonomy of libraries has inhibited coordinated planning. However, a formal national focus for planning has been created in the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS). In the absence of adequate statistics, NCLIS has relied on expressions of need from the field. Proposals and projects  are not as likely to secure support on this basis as they would when targeted to well-defined activity loads/needs, cost-effectiveness data, and evaluation plans. To be relevant to these uses, data must meet the standards of timeliness, appropriate coverage, credibility, and clarity. Shortfalls in these respects can be avoided by careful articulation of data needed and by the standardization of formats. Basic library resource and performance data should be systematically available soon. (Author/SL)",

Prior to 1950, African countries relied for their library personnel on Britain, France, or Belgium, where librarianship is not necessarily a graduate profession. Later, some local personnel received training in American graduate schools. The structure of the profession in Africa still reflects these foreign origins in its three-tiered structure: graduate professionals, nongraduate professionals, and paraprofessionals; although the trend is now toward a graduate profession. Between 1960 and 1968, seven library schools were established at universities in sub-Saharan Africa. Of these, only three offer postgraduate  courses. Most of the teaching staffs are foreign, and the curriculum reflects that of Europe and America, although some additions have been made to meet African needs. At their existing growth rates, the library schools of Africa will not be able to supply the manpower to meet the long-range plans for library development specified at the Kampala meeting in 1970. Each nation will have to establish its own school if the Kampala guidelines are to be realized. (SL)",

        "description":"The objectives and programs involved in public library service to children in the Northwest Territories (NWT) are not very different from those of other small public library systems. However, program operation is affected by the vast distances involved, the isolation of the communities, and the presence of ethnic groups whose language had no written form until a century ago. Service to this area is provided by the Northwest Territories Public Library Services. During the six years since a children's librarian was appointed, new facets of the children's program have gradually been introduced. Through cooperation with the Department of Education, visits are made to schools for storytelling and talks on library services. NWT aids local librarians through workshops, booklists, and  the encouragement of interlibrary loan. A wide range of children must be provided for, including those for whom English is a second language. There is still a deficit of materials suited to the languages and cultures of these children. The Department of Education has been given the sole responsibility for audiovisual materials, but improved cooperation between the schools and the NWT libraries will allow for a sharing of media resources and improved service to small communities.

State law specifies that the Illinois State Library compile and publish statistics on libraries. State agencies also play an important and expanding role in this effort. The state library now compiles statistics on all types of libraries, and attention is being given to analysis of this data. Local librarians can aid the statewide data collection program by maintaining accurate records. These records, when interpreted to the community, also have a public relations value for the local library. The uses of library statistics can be divided into several general categories: statewide and institutional comparison and evaluation, legislative justification, administration of  library standards, manpower planning, and budgeting. Those engaged in library planning need not be reminded of the importance of accuracy and comparability in statistical data. The cost of data collection can be reduced through the use of scientific sampling. Inservice training should be implemented to change the negative attitudes of librarians toward measurement, since this is a major barrier to improved statistical reporting. (Author/SL)",

Service to children has a high priority. The Oklahoma Department of Libraries conducts workshops on all aspects of children's services and undertakes those services which can be done most efficiently on a large scale or a comparative basis. A good example is the Children's Statewide Summer Program in which system and nonsystem libraries of all sizes participate.

The general concept of the subject index was to include all of the actions (news), opinions (editorials), and the conditions of the people, places, and things in or bearing on the Territory of Arizona. The subject headings, basically modified Sears List headings, were general is scope, with many &quot;see&quot; references from more specific terms. Businesses were indexed by type and by location. To  save time and money, advertisements were fully indexed only twice a year. The personal name index included all Arizona-related names and articles about that person indexed under the fullest name as given in the paper. This project and manual also provides instructions for the indexing, filing, editing, and typing processes; a list of the subject headings used; and a sample subject and name index for the Arizona Champion 1883-1884.

In the writing and revision of this book, King was attempting a metamorphosis of landscape description into popular reading as he moved from being a symbolic writer to being a writer of surfaces, a literary topographer. In this paper, certain themes on the subject of mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada mountains are described and examined, quoting several passages from the book. It is concluded that in the later 1874 edition of the book originally serialized in 1871, which includes a 21-page preface concerned with Mount Whitney, King's literary achievement is shaken, and his power to fuse literary and  geological observation is diminished. In the later edition, King no longer looks at the land as filled with vibrant significance but only as a neutral pile of rocks. (TS)",

Creative Writing 2 is a poetry class in which students explore such forms as tonka, haiku, triad, ten-liners, and experimental approaches. Creative Writing 3 is a short story and drama writing course in which dialogue plays a major part. Creative Writing 4 is open to  those students who have achieved a quarter grade of A in Creative Writing 1 and 2. This course involves independent work as well as peer teaching of Creative Writing 1 and 2. Creative Writing 5 is open to all advanced creative writing students.

The educational histories selected for the study were categorized by recognized high professional quality and high academic status. Each book analyzed concentrated on different subject areas of educational history, and all were current except one. The first hypothesis of the study was that both pre-World War II and modern American histories of education, under bias and propanganda analysis, reveal bias against women. The second hypothesis was that this bias propaganda in modern American histories of education used, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a significant slanted historical approach that lacked professional objectivity. The third  hypothesis was that modern American histories of education showed at least as much bias against women as that found in the pre-World War II American education histories, despite social, economic, political, and educational changes in the roles and status of women. All of these hypotheses were supported by the findings. (TS)",

The following question is raised: Is a node label ADV necessary, or can the phenomena associated with adverbials be explained in terms of the set of node labels used to explain other areas of grammar? The author argues that a new node label can be justified if and only if some required transformation must be formulated so as to refer to it. Furthermore, it is necessary to demonstrate that no analysis which excludes ADV is tenable. Thus, the author concludes, the existence of any tenable analysis which handles the adverbial data without making use of ADV is strong evidence that ADV does not exist. Presented are grammatical references to ADV; arguments in favor of  an ADV node which examine adverbs without adjective paraphrases, the multiplicity of tranformations, the positioning of ly-adverbs, the -ly ending, and a non-argument in favor of an ADV node; arguments against an ADV node; and alternatives to ADV which examine case analyses and higher sentence (S) analyses.

The author suggests that any department of literature that fails to center its program on the teaching of literature as a special mode of knowledge quite distinct from the modes employed by the social and political sciences forfeits its right to be called a department of literature. Literature can be approached in the following three general ways: reading for pleasure, reading for substantial knowledge, and reading to understand the function of the symbolic imagination. Only the third way  will keep the study of literature alive. (TS)",

Formal language entails continuous effort at verfication or falsification and exploration of the innovative possibilities of recombinations of facts and logical premises. Its chief forms in politics are mathematical propositions, a focus upon abstract processes, self-conscious efforts to perceive from the perspectives of others, and some art forms. Public language occurs when people share norms and political loyalties sufficiently that they need not be explicit about premises and meanings. It validates established  beliefs and strengthens authority structures. The empirical combination of the two forms of language reinforces the evocative potency of both, but it also creates cognitive confusions of a patterned and recurring kind that inhibit effective political action by the poor.

Questionnaires were mailed to 248 English majors graduating from public and private liberal arts colleges during the 1968-73 period. The questionnaire was made up of cognitive learning and affective learning categories following the Bloom, Krathwohl, and Masia taxonomies. Of the 248 questionnaires sent out, 102 responses were received. Seventeen competencies were derived as being essential to English majors. It was concluded that the competencies resulting from this study can be considered as a model for an English major in a competency-based curriculum in a libeal arts college. (Author/RB)",

The material has been organized into units and sequenced using the following criteria: difficulty, confusability, environmental constraints, frequency, and regularity. The kindergarten program consists of fifteen units, one of which is an introductory phonics unit and two of which are reviews of preceding blocks of material. The remaining twelve units present lessons based on eighteen vowel-consonant elements. In the first-grade program, the original  material has been expanded to include seven additional vowel-consonant elements. The second-grade program includes approximately 300 to 350 words, and the third-grade material includes 350 to 400 words. The content of the second- and third-grade programs includes a review of first-grade rules as well as secondary vowel rules, compounds, homophones, suffixes, contractions, numbers, and days of the week.

They should also be aware of the purposes and techniques employed by the American consumer movement, which is attempting to augment the rights and power of buyers in relation to sellers. Since a review of the current rights of buyers and sellers suggests that the balance of power lies with the seller, teachers should consider ways to equalize the situation. For example, students and teachers might discuss the fact that product categories may be classified as either desirable, salutary, pleasing on a short-term basis only, or deficient. Next, students might select several ads. Since studies have shown that a person's predisposition toward a product is a good  indicator of whether or not the person will buy that product, students' predispositions toward the products mentioned in their ads might be measured. If students are predisposed to buy the advertised product, and if, in addition, the product is classified as either deficient or merely immediately pleasing, students might role play a counterattitudinal advocacy situation in order to inoculate them against the advertiser's persuasion.

A sample in-class composition written in black dialect is quoted in its entirety and analyzed, and a personal writing approach is described. The first part of the approach deals with structure, and a linguistic method is used for teaching the form classes of noun, verb, adjective, and adverb. The second part of the approach is the cognitive framework for stages of development in concept formation, interpretation of data, and the application of principles. In the third part of this approach, students are sectioned into individualized groups of five in which they exchange themes and related materials, becoming critics of features and structures not yet overcome by  fellow classmates. It is concluded that this approach allows students psychological freedom in usage and gives meaning to their cultural identity and cultural experiences. (TS)",

Each of these novels exhibits a concern about man structuring his existence through the choices he makes in an absurd world. Gabriel, the protagonist of &quot;Black Thunder,&quot; differentiates himself from the other characters and identifies himself as an existential hero at the end of the novel when he steps out of a trance to surrender; although he is physically destroyed by execution, his act assumes heroic magnitude because he has struggled against the absurd until the end. It is with the death of Mary Dalton in &quot;Native Son&quot; that Bigger, in his own mind, ceases to exist as an object. Bigger's state of mind after the murder allows him to  combat the irrational world. The &quot;Invisible Man&quot; depicts an odyssey as the protagonist moves from situation to situation, encountering disillusionment at each turn; he learns, finally, to &quot;believe in nothing if not in action&quot; when he has been stripped of all meaning by passivity and submission to absurdity.

Another way of teaching or stimulating children to write poetry is to provide them with a rich and varied background of poetry by reading a wide range of poems to them. Poetry should become an integral part of talk and response in the classroom. Children need to know that poetry is a way of responding to something very real in their lives. Another way of helping children experiment with words and get started with poetic expression is by not imposing adult standards on children's writing. A final way of helping children grow in their ability to express themselves through poetry is by introducing various poetic forms for them to use. Children's poetry  should indicate an awareness of an experience, sincerity of feeling, a choice of appropriate and natural language, and the creation of a response to the idea in the reader. Several poems written by children are quoted as examples demonstrating these qualities. (TS)",

It is argued that once the fallacies of the &quot;communicative continuity&quot; and &quot;speech superiority&quot; positions are acknowledged--that man's sign systems are not at the apex of some straight-line continuum of evolution in communication--then it becomes apparent  that there is no reason for limiting the study of communication to the communication of a single species.

        "description":"During teacher-administered tryouts of an instructional program, staff observations of classroom lessons are an important data source for making later revisions. However, such data are often unavailable when needed because of a lack of systematic procedures for data collection and documentation. This paper suggests certain procedures for reporting classroom observation of a program lesson. These procedures are illustrated in the observation of two laboratory programs, &quot;Composition Skills&quot; and &quot;Drama and Public Speaking.&quot; (Author)",

The modes of interpersonal communication which were examined are self-disclosure, touch, and metarelationship communication. Seventy-five questionnaires were completed by college students enrolled in classes in psychology, sociology, and communications. The data indicated that degree of trust and amount of self-disclosure are the primary bases for the perception of the closeness of a relationship. It is suggested that a behavioral index of the closeness of a relationship could be established by observing the amounts of self-disclosure, metarelationship communication,  and touch that occur during interactions.

The author concludes that, although a quadrimester program will save money in the long run, it will require a short-term increase in school expenditures.

Both the laws requiring attendance and the basic high school programs offered in most states must be remodeled. Arizona's system provides a good example. Although Arizona's attendance laws require only that a child attend school through the eighth grade, most students stay through high school. A number of factors account for the schools' retention of students. One is the state's child labor laws that limit the number of available worthwhile jobs for youths under age 16. Another is the state's program of work-study courses, vocational education, and career education. It is hoped that a student's exposure to  these kinds of courses and programs will help him set a personal goal or develop an idea of what he wants for the future. The state also has an extensive special education program for meeting the needs of students who have difficult learning experiences and who are prime candidates to become dropouts. Finally, societal pressure and self-respect help keep students in school until they have acquired enought education to enable them to be self-supporting and productive. (Author/IRT)",

The typical A-B-C-D report seldom tells anything really meaningful; the arguments against this system are many--unless you have straight A offspring. Written comments or reports are good if they tell, in a meaningful way, what the student is accomplishing in school. But teachers often lapse into cliches or vague generalizations, and the comments often reflect a teacher's personal reaction to the child, rather than a report of academic progress. The parent-teacher conference is valuable if it is well planned and conducted, and if sufficient time is allowed for the conference. One other point--all conferences should include the student as well as the parent and teacher. If a child is to grow  socially, emotionally, and intellectually, he or she must participate in the evaluation of the process. During the last two years, our district has been moving toward an individualized curricular program. To make our reporting procedure more effective, we must add to our trait checklist, with comments, a summarization of the basic skills attained by each child. This tells the parent just what specific skills the child has acquired as a result of his school work. (Author/JG)",

To overcome these problems in our district, we have used orientation by the principal, guidance persons, assistant principal, and/or teacher in an attempt to make the pupil feel wanted and worthwhile. We have also used meetings between the child's parents and the principal to enable parents to counsel their child and help him to adjust. A standard system and timetable of record forwarding could also help overcome many adjustment problems. In our district, migrant students are no longer absorbed into the regular school system. Instead they attend a new migrant student facility, which provides teachers, aides, dental care, eye examinations, a social worker, transportation, and other  necessities. An answer to the records transfer problem was provided by the Migrant Student Record Transfer System in Little Rock. During the summer, our migrant facility serves &quot;home-based&quot; migrant children, who are out of the area during most of the regular school terms but return during the summer. (Author/JG)",

        "description":"Many educators react defensively to demands for student assessment, accountability, and so forth. Rather than being defensive, we must turn these challenges to our advantage. If I am responsible in my work, then I ought to also be accountable for my work. We must describe what schools are expected to accomplish and show publicly whether these expectations are being accomplished. An important assignment for any school board member is to understand and be able to hold school personnel accountable for executing the basic functions of elementary and secondary schools, consistent with ever-changing socioeconomic and technological conditions. Essentially, the Michigan Educational Accountability Model is a means whereby school boards, teachers, administrators, students, and parents can  predetermine what they want to do at any educational level in any program and how they hope to get there. Although there have been many changes since the day of the &quot;little red school house,&quot; the concept of local control of education is still important and should continue to be a cornerstone of public education.

Optional alternative schools include open schools, schools-without-walls, continuation schools, multicultural schools, free schools, schools within schools, and the like. Whatever it is called, the alternative school has developed in response to needs within its community. Although each school is individual, most of them share all or most of the following  characteristics: (1) the school provides an option for students, parents, and teachers; (2) it has as its reason for existence a commitment to be more responsive to some educational need within its community than the conventional schools have been; (3) it has a more comprehensive set of goals and objectives than its conventional counterpart; (4) it is more flexible, and, therefore, more responsive to planned evolution and change; and (5) it tends to be considerably smaller than conventional schools, particularly at the secondary level.

        "description":"In 1968 the California Education Code section on physically handicapped minors was amended to include pregnant girls. This change was intended to give school districts the responsibility and the funds to develop special classes or schools for teenage pregmant girls. This special class makes it possible to provide more educational materials, equipment, and interdisciplinary services. Adolescent pregnancy requires the services not only of educators, but also of health, welfare, and social agencies. A major defense of the program is the fact that refusing the pregnant girl the opportunity to complete her education is not only a denial of the girl's rights, it also damages both the girl and society through increasing her chances of unemployment, underemployment, and, thus, welfare  and dependency. This paper describes the program components and implications of two programs operating in three districts on the San Francisco Peninsula. Although operated differently, the goals and objectives of the two programs are similar. Their major goal is to provide each pregnant student an opportunity to earn a high school diploma and to provide her with a marketable entry-level skill for postsecondary employment or further educational achievement.

Research indicates that informational feedback from students is an effective means of influencing teacher behavior--sometimes more effective than supervisory feedback. In considering student evaluation of teachers, the first issue is the purpose of the evaluation. The administration should also decide if it is going to consider only student evaluation of teachers or press for comprehensive client-centered evaluation. If a client-centered evaluation program is considered, Redfern recommends that clients be told how their evaluations will contribute to the overall evaluation program. Various recommendations for developing an effective  client-centered evaluation program were made by Nation's Schools in April 1973 after surveying student evaluation practices from California to New Jersey. However, these recommendations are merely guideposts developed out of the experiences of others; each program must depend on its own constituency. Student evaluation of teachers is still only part of the total evaluation process. It all has to mesh to be effective. (Author/JG)",

The document is being circulated to solicit comments on the soundness of the proposed work. The proposed program constitutes a coordinated attempt to make information, products, skills, and resources derived from research and development and exemplary practice available to educational practitioners to facilitate their problem-solving in targeted areas. The program is a venture into uncharted areas in an attempt to build additional linkages between research and development and the operating system. The apparent semiisolation and alienation of the one group from the other has come from a number of causes, including the  linear-change model implicit in past federal leadership and policies in supporting educational research and development and dissemination. The proposed goal, objectives, strategies, and underlying assumptions of the program are described, as well as the proposed design, its consumer information component, its research and development utilization component, and its assessment.

Facilities for occupational training cannot exist independently of the educational program; an annotated outline of a career preparation plan illustrates the steps to take and the kinds of actions required to get a program operational in a community. The final section, planning career preparation facilities, considers calculating student time, defining the space necessary, describing the spaces requiring new construction or remodeling of existing  spaces, obtaining community support, and the selection and duties of the planning team.

Also included are diagrams that analyze (1) overall program organization, (2) document preparation, and (3) construction scheduling experience. Other graphs and tables plot construction cost experience. This report directs its research to the concerns of various categories of participants through four major phases of building: (1) design and organization, (2) documentation and bidding, (3) control of time and money, and (4) management of  construction operations. Particular emphasis is given to problems of contractual relationships and professional responsibilities as influenced by the techniques of systems building.

        "description":"Given the present economic situation, it is inevitable that more state legislatures and school boards will adopt a \"cost accounting\" attitude toward education. However, schools aren't factories, and using an industrial model for accountability doesn't work. To have a viable system of accountability, everyone who is concerned with education must be involved, including teachers, administrators, school boards, legislators, governors, parents, and students. But what must be done to make this all happen? The answer is leadership. Four years ago, the California Superintendent of Public Instruction appointed a high-level task force of experts in the field of child growth and development. The task force provided the basic philosophic guidance for development of an early childhood  education program as well as many practical recommendations. Staff members of the State Department of Education were then assigned to develop a practical plan for implementation. Later, the completed master plan was taken to the State Board of Education, which adopted it as official policy. Ten months later, SB 1302, the Magna Carta of early childhood education, was passed. This early childhood education program is an example of leadership in an era of accountability. (Author/JG)",

First, the school enrollment trend is known. Second, there are going to be empty classrooms, which means that special programs that were slighted when facilities were crowded can now be adequately housed. Third, the need for outstanding leadership and planning may lead to creative approaches to meeting the district's needs. Fourth, and most important, declining enrollments can provide opportunities for things to happen that might otherwise never come about--in school programs, in community activities, in housing for groups that are financially burdened, and in community involvement in the schools.

In the 1960's, Prince William County faced the serious problem of rapid population growth, and today the school population continues to increase. In 1970, after considering alternative solutions to the problem, a staff committee recommended adoption of a 45-15 year-round plan. In 1974-75, five elementary schools, two middle schools, one kindergarten center, and one high school serve 7,200 students on a year-round basis. A comprehensive evaluation measuring economic, attitude, and achievement components of the Prince William year-round program was conducted by outside research organizations. Last April, the school  board supported the continued study of year-round schools as a viable alternative to space and program needs. In any area where year-round schools have been requested, formal studies will be undertaken first. A plan for community involvement has become an essential element of any educational innovation in our school district. Although there may be economic and social benefits of year-round plans, it is our belief that the educational benefits must outweigh any other reasons. (Author/JG)",

This model also includes minimum objectives for all students at all grade levels in all courses, as well as objectives relating to academic excellence and career preparation. The specific personnel accountability systems used to evaluate the positions of superintendent, administrators, and instructional staff members are presented here. The performance profiles used in personnel evaluations consist of a ratings component and a performance objectives component. The ratings are provided by others who work with the person being evaluated. For instance a senior high school principal is rated by an assistant superintendent; the director of secondary instruction;  teachers; other directors, supervisors, and/or coordinators; his building administrative staff; resource people; and himself. The performance objectives are mutually acceptable to the administrator being evaluated and to his immediate superordinate. The evaluation of teachers is somewhat different from that of administrators. The teacher performance profile is composed of student ratings, principal ratings, peer ratings, self-ratings, and student achievement data. In some cases, parent ratings are also used.

The plan provides that the elements of a basic shelter--foundations, supporting columns and a roof--be furnished in places where primary schools are needed. The local community is to provide the wall panels, windows, doors, and floor, using local materials and at its own expense. The criteria for the design of the prefabricated elements included (1) simplicity in assembly, (2) ease of transport using lorries or bullock carts, and (3) weight low enough to permit easy handling. This case  study details the school designs and the development of the organizational structure to meet the total building program for 5,000 or more schools in a period of three years. (Author/MLF)",

Interviews were conducted with a small sample of teachers at each ESY school to verify findings. More than two-thirds of the primary, middle, and high school student respondents liked the ESY program. The most favorable attitudes were expressed by summer quinmester and primary-level students. Majorities of teachers at all levels favored ESY; however, approval was much greater among those who were involved in formulating objectives and  writing curriculum modules. Teachers not involved in the curriculum development considered their initial orientation insufficient and their understanding of program objectives somewhat inadequate. Administrators and supervisors expressed a feeling of achievement and satisfaction from their work. A sampling of voter opinion in the community indicated that the program of general information concerning ESY was very effective. (Author/IRT)",

Entries are organized into five separate sections. The first section, Alternative Futures, surveys the general literature on the future, including many historical references. The second section, Policy-Making, includes some of the best introductions to how futures-inputs might be incorporated into the policy-making process. Section 3, Planning, covers both the academically oriented and new, systems-oriented approaches to urban planning. The fourth, Forecasting Techniques, covers many of the methodological issues involved in forecasting and futures-planning. The final section, Selected Forecasting  Techniques, is a partial listing of techniques that might prove useful for urban planning and management purposes. Within each section, citations are listed alphabetically by author's name. (Author/JG)",

        "description":"Employee participation literature spans well over three decades, while only in the past few years has the literature on student participation begun to accumulate. Unfortunately, much of the student participation literature is made up of opinion articles on whether to encourage participation, and the relatively few empirical investigations available usually consists of descriptive reports of the perceptions and preferences of students, faculty, or administrators. Consequently, a review of the general literature of participatory decision-making may not only improve group decision-making practices in education but may also suggest viable avenues of hard research on which these practices may be soundly based. The references in this bibliography, selected primarily from the fields of  business, education, psychology, and sociology, focus on employee, faculty, and student participation. Participation in decision-making is identified as the involvement of subordinates in the decision-making processes within a given formal organization. Special attention has been given to nearly all theoretical and research studies available in English. Some opinion literature and committee reports have been included because of their theoretical or planning value, but most have been excluded. (Author)",

        "description":"Growing dissatisfaction with the linkage of educational research and development information and products to actual school classroom procedures has motivated many researchers and practitioners to uncover new linkage systems. Among the new approaches suggested is that of building on already existing communication networks in schools and across the country, attempting to channel information into these informal networks in a manner and shape more readily useful to school personnel. However, little is currently known about what informal education communication networks exist or how they operate, and even less is known about how long these networks endure or the format of the information transmitted through them. This paper is part of a symposium bringing together researchers and  practitioners to explore these underlying questions and suggest future directions for building linkages between research and practice. It discusses research on information networks involved in establishing new or alternative schools. By analyzing data collected at six new schools in New York City, the authors describe the number and duration of networks and the key individuals who compose them. (Author/MLF)",

The primary role of the BIS representative is one of assistance in the development of educational programs for children residing in state institutions. In addition, the BIS representative serves a liaison and coordination role between local education agencies, collaboratives, and parents. This individual also serves in a linkage capacity between the departments of education, mental health, public health, office for children, and the other human service agencies. These educational specialists are expected to assist in transforming the BIS philosophically  based objectives into reality for the benefit of children presently in state institutions. It is the intent of this concept paper to establish guidelines for the BIS regional representatives to follow in an effort to clarify the specialists' role in relationship to his/her regional responsibilities.

        "description":"Not all schools have conditions that resist improvement, nor are all schools led by principals who are part of the problem. Yet, experience teaches us that, no matter what changes are attempted, many schools do not get better. More schools can be improved by leaders who are critically aware of what is blocking advancement of school practices. A means orientation, a teacher and administrator emphasis, and a top-down decision-making process are some conditions that are likely to impinge on school improvement. Principals can use these three conditions to analyze their own school environment. If their school is characterized by some or all of the conditions, they might decide to take purposeful action to eliminate traits that resist change. The first step toward reconstructing the  school environment is arriving at an awareness of the reality that hinders improvement. This critical awareness may result in commitment to action that will make obsolete the persistent notion that schools do not improve. (Author)",

The standard forms have been an improvement and have been readily acknowledged as simplifying the application and funding procedure. Since 1969-70, changes, such as indirect cost procedures and the elimination of documentation, have required revision of the forms. This publication should serve as a valuable aid in the use of the new forms for the application for and administration of federally aided projects. The general procedures used in funding federally aided programs, the proposed budget for the operation of a federal project, and the general audit guides are presented along with the procedures and forms needed for  indirect cost rate applications, special program administrative and supervisory position descriptions, special grant-budget amendments, monthly expenditure reports and monthly/quarterly requests for funds, construction project budgets, reports of construction progress, and final project expenditure reports.

He lists a number of factors contributing to school crime--the breakdown of the family and family control, glamorization of violence on television and film, street crime, drug abuse, anonymity in the neighborhood and school, a philosophy of self-serving expediency, subgroup solidarity with no allegiance to the larger society, and contempt for the value of personal and public property. Six contributing factors perhaps seen more clearly by secondary school principals than by other citizens, are lethargic courts, openness of schools, student rights, teacher apathy, parent ignorance and/or indifference, and the  collateral curriculum (the influences on a child that do not come from the school). The speaker recommends the enactment of legislation similar to the Safe Schools Act, prompt attention by the courts to acts of alleged crime in the schools, curriculum reform to meet the heterogeneity of student needs, involvement of students in all programs, and establishment of innovative programs such as using \"trailer watchers\" on school grounds.

Social development was measured by the Children's Social Relations Rating Scale, the Children's Social Relations Interview Schedule, and the Children's Role Taking Task. The Concrete Operations Tasks assessed cognitive ability. Data supported the hypotheses that Ss would enact the patient (dependent) role and the nondisabled control group woull enact the agent (independent) role. Only partial support was demonstrated for the hypothesis that the Ss' cognitive task scores would be significantly lower than the control group's scores. Analysis of the level of role taking indicated that the social restriction produced by an orthopedic handicap decreased with age.  (CL)",

Survey results in the following areas are analyzed: prevalence of HI/MH persons in institutions for the retarded, procedures for diagnosing and evaluating HI/MH residents, characteristics of HI/MH residents, services available to HI/MH residents, and the operation of selected programs for the HI/MH. Conclusions such as the following are drawn: approximately 9 percent of the  institutionalized MH population was HI; only 48 percent of the facilities had a distinct program for the HI/MH population; in classifying residents as HI, 32 percent of institutions relied primarily on puretone results, 22 percent relied primarily on functional need, and 26 percent considered both puretone results and functional need, while the remaining institutions used various multiple criteria.

        "description":"The second of six monographs on three postsecondary vocational technical programs for deaf students reports evaluations gleaned from deaf former students presently employed, their immediate supervisors, parents, and vocational rehabilitation counselors. Explained are methods and procedures used in interviews and questionnaires. Data from students concern vital statistics, job satisfaction, economic and employment status, aspirations, and views of their training and program. Information reported from interviews with immediate supervisors focuses on current occupational status of the employee, training, communications between supervisor and employee, employee productivity, the attitude of the supervisor, and the size and nature of the company. Replies from vocational rehabilitation  counselors discuss referral procedures, training, and client communication. Also examined are data from parents on the occupational status of their son/daughter, their vocational or technical training, and their reactions to training. Interview and questionnaire responses are discussed and conclusions such as the following drawn: that there was a tendency to cluster in certain occupations such as general office practice and printing, and that most parents favored postsecondary programs for the hearing impaired within programs for students with normal hearing. Appendixes contain interview and questionnaire forms. (GW)",

Each S's linguistic utterances were semantically evaluated in terms of M. Bowerman's, R. Brown's, and I. Schlesinger's semantic relational concepts. Generally, findings suggested that Ss symbolically represented their experiences through the same modes of representation available for normal children, and that there is a 2-year lag for these semantic relational concepts to appear in the language of Down's Syndrome children when compared to normal children. The semantic relational concepts in the Ss' early utterances were charted in the order of their appearance. (GW)",

Prior to the study, research on characteristics of verbal learning deficits in retarded individuals and on verbal skill training was reviewed. A hierarchy of teaching strategies (verbal prompt, verbal instruction, imitation plus verbal instruction, and manual guidance plus verbal instruction) was used in teaching 16 self-help and preacademic tasks. Approximately 40-50 percent of the tasks were not solved by Down's Syndrome Ss with verbal prompting plus verbal instruction alone. Only 14 percent of the tasks were not solved by normal Ss at the same levels of  instruction. Despite additional trials, which were enriched with verbal instruction and made more direct through the use of imitation and manual guidance strategies, Down's Syndrome Ss failed to acquire task solution more than 25 percent of the time. Verbal learning deficits seemed to lie largely in the auditory or integration phases of the task and only minimally in the motor output phase. (GW)",

Results of the component skills test did not prove unequivocally that the materials and instructional program produced higher gains on the subtests by the classrooms using the  materials.

Education and psychology in the USSR are said to be marked by the following major characteristics: a strong emphasis on the importance of practical activity; a concomitant emphasis on the importance of conscious knowledge in the direction of human activity; genetic, sociocultural, and neuropsychological perspectives; and a complete rejection of standardized intelligence testing in favor of clinical diagnosis. The coordination of research efforts by the Scientific Research Institute of Defectology is explained. Clinical characteristics are identified in extensive detail for  three common diagnostic categories: TRPD, cerebro-asthenic syndrome, and psychological infantilism. Psychological and psychophysiological research is thought to contribute to the improvement of multifaceted differential diagnosis and to provide information concerning the development of children's processing capacities essential for the design of effective instructional materials and methods.

School districts offering special education services and 10 colleges offering relevant teacher training were surveyed. Described are special education degree programs offered in Washington at the Associate, Baccalaureate, Master's, and Doctoral levels. Major findings of the study include a belief by school districts that more of the personnel selection process should take place at the preservice level, the preference of school districts for special education personnel with strong backgrounds in basic skills, and a common belief of districts that college faculty know little of district programs and problems. Provided are definitions of terms such  as cooperating teacher. The following recommendations are summarized: (1) that graduation requirements of special education teacher training programs include a greater variety of practical experiences, (2) that teacher training institutions determine criteria for assessing student competence, (3) that regular communications between teacher training institutions and user districts be established, (4) that training needs of regular teachers involved in mainstreaming be met, and (5) that 4-year institutions ensure that their graduates understand the role of the trained paraprofessional.

        "description":"Presented by the Comptroller General of the U.S. is a 1974 report to the Congress on Federal programs for the handicapped in the areas of special education, vocational education, and vocational rehabilitation. An introductory chapter points out that only 40 percent of an estimated 7 million handicapped children are receiving the education they need, lists areas of responsibility shared by Federal and state governments, and details the extent of Federal involvement in education of the handicapped. Barriers in educating the handicapped discussed include limited availability of educational services, involuntary removal from educational programs, and restrictions (such as age) on access to educational programs. Examined are planning problems such as lack of coordination among Federal  programs and agencies, and the lack of integration of Federal programs into state planning. Allocation of funds is seen to suffer from shortcomings in formulas and inadequate guidance to state agencies distributing funds. Assessed are the effects of inadequate program evaluations on program management. It is suggested that the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare implement procedures for systematic planning among organizations responsible for educating and training the handicapped. Other recommendations include the need for systematic collection of data about the handicapped and the need for Congress to eliminate inequities in fund allocation formulas. (LS)",

These are based on individual monaural, puretone, audiometric test results of eight frequencies as obtained in the Health Examination Survey of 1966-70 for a national probability sample (N=6,768) representative of the 22.7 million youths in that segment of the population. Age, sex, race, region, urban-rural, income, and parent-education differentials in hearing levels are assessed. Major findings summarized from the study among youths include: that for their better ear more than half had hearing thresholds below (better than) the American Standard Association (ASA) 1951 standard  for audiometric zero at all frequencies tested except 6000 Hertz; that hearing levels for girls are generally lower (better) than among boys, by mean differences large enough to be statistically insignificant at 2000-8000 Hertz; that the prevalence of hearing handicap as estimated from the puretone audiometric test results in this survey is quite low (only about 1.5 percent, or an estimated 281,000 youths 12-17 years of age in this country, have some degree of hearing handicap); and that youths from families with less than $5,000 per year had higher mean thresholds (poorer hearing) than those from families with income of $5,000 and over.

Preliminary results indicated that teachers were able to implement the CAI system with deaf students; that CAI was beneficial for the hearing-impaired; that students, teachers, and parents reacted favorably toward CAI use; and  that further hardware and software development will be necessary before CAI can be fully implemented and tested with visually impaired students.

Rotter's concepts were developed. The Disability Opinion Survey (DOS) (Form IS) was administered to 99 undergraduate and graduate students in special education and rehabilitation; and a demographic information sheet, the Attitude Toward Disabled Persons Scale, the DOS (Forms IS and IST), and the Social Distance Survey (SDS) were administered to 216 Ss consisting of 99 inservice special education teachers and three classes of special education and rehabilitation majors. Findings led to the following preliminary conclusions: that the Internal-External scale of the DOS measured the degree of respect the S held for the  internal motivations of disabled persons; that Ss having more professional training in working with disabled persons tended to score toward the internal end of the continuum; that the Special Consideration scale of the DOS measured the tendency of the S to extend special considerations to disabled persons; that the Treatment scale of the DOS tended to tap the S's view of the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs for the disabled; and that the DOS (Forms IS and IST) and the SDS appeared to have much promise in measuring affective dimensions in persons intending to work professionally with the disabled.

The system (in use since November 1973) is the first known classroom CCTV system for the handicapped, and it enables students with severely impaired vision to read ordinary print, to write with a regular pen or pencil, to carry out operations requiring precise eye-hand coordination, and to see a teacher's written examples while listening to her verbal explanations. The system is reported to be helpful to educable mentally retarded and hearing impaired students and may also prove  beneficial to similarly handicapped adults. Provided are sections on system components and design features, engineering considerations, and proof-testing the classroom TV system. Appendixes include technical information on system components; a description of nine performance tests (of intelligence, achievement, perception, and school attitude) administered to measure the effectiveness of the CCTV system; and entries from the teacher's log showing how the system has been used and describing associated problems and successes.

A careful examination of the 19 projects funded supported the following conclusions: that resource rooms demonstrated themselves to be efficient ways to serve emotionally disturbed children; that, given appropriate training and technical assistance, classroom teachers could cope with behavior  problems in the classroom; that the use of volunteer aides with both speech and visually impaired children in areas where teachers were working on an itinerant basis continued to demonstrate itself to be an effective technique; and that a project serving developmentally disabled high school youth demonstrated that work experience skills could be taught effectively to such children.

Reported is program emphasis on the development of a statewide diagnostic-prescriptive resource system including target classes (which served as data collection points and demonstration classes), self-contained classes (used to test the efficacy of management system of instruction), resource rooms and assessment classes (used to collect information and develop the diagnostic prescriptive model), and the resource data bank (which matched information on materials and methods with specific learning objectives). Specific goals, activities, and results are outlined such as the development of a system for identifying and organizing learning  objectives. Final recommendations include continuation and possible revision of the diagnostic prescriptive model, development of a uniform system for the identification and retrieval of special education instructional materials, establishment of a central clearinghouse for processing and evaluating efforts of resource centers, and expansion of inservice education concerning the diagnostic prescriptive process.

Educational legislation relevant to the new directions in the French universities is discussed, as well as the organization of the universities, departments, and curriculum. Admission and tuition are also discussed, followed by a brief outline of political affiliation within the universities. Student representation and course and test organization are described. Finally, the following are cited as reasons for the continuing student unrest: (1) instability of laws, (2) growing number of students, and (3) lack of employment opportunities. It is concluded that the  French university as it exists today is an improvement over the old system, but that the problem of higher education for French youth remains unsolved. (AM)",

        "description":"This is the final report describing a supervised program of self-instruction in critical languages at the undergraduate level. The project was begun at a single college in 1963, was expanded to a statewide basis in 1966, and was again enlarged to run on a national basis in 1969. In 1971-72, over 1,000 students were enrolled in these programs at about 45 colleges across the country. The primary method employed in this project was the initiation of self-instructional programs on individual college campuses in order to examine such factors in self-instructional language learning as motivation and aptitude, suitability of existing materials, the roles played by campus coordinators, tutors, and outside examiners, and problems of interinstitutional cooperation in furthering this  method. The basic conclusion was that independent study of critical languages is a financially and academically viable means for the small college as well as the large university to broaden significantly their offerings of foreign languages to the carefully selected and well-motivated student. A major goal of the project was to determine the feasibility of &quot;institutionalizing&quot; the overall program structure to assure continuation of individual programs; this goal was partly achieved with the formation of a National Association for Self-Instructional Language Programs. Appendices contain: program data for 1969-70, 1970-71, and 1971-72; a guide to a film on self-instruction; reports on two conferences on independent language study; a checklist for CLP evaluators; and copy for the back cover  of the SILP Handbook.

The following phonological rules and tendencies are proposed as highlighting significant points of contrast between Standard and New Mexican Spanish: /yy/ becomes /y/; /cy/ becomes /c/; /y/ drops if the first vowel is stressed and is higher or more front than the second (excluding/u/); /Vr#/ becomes /Vre#/; /gw/ becomes /w/; New Mexican Spanish avoids certain Standard  Spanish consonant clusters and sequences; New Mexican Spanish has patterned reductions in the normal stream of speech. The paper concludes that verb patterns in New Mexican Spanish identify it as a distinctive dialect of Standard Spanish; that these modifications are logical and produce more regular patterns; and that New Mexican Spanish deserves to be counted among the prestige dialects of Modern Spanish.

        "description":"This paper examines semantic constraints governing the occurrence of interjections with various other types of grammatical phenomena. Four interjections, &quot;oh,&quot;&quot;ah,&quot;&quot;say,&quot; and &quot;well,&quot; which typically occur embedded in sentences, are discussed in terms of their semantic properties and possible contexts. It is concluded that: interjections do not occur inside sentences unless there is a plausible semantic alternative to the element which follows them and which they refer to; &quot;oh&quot; and &quot;well&quot; can be used if the speaker is simply trying to think of alternatives, but that &quot;say&quot; and &quot;ah&quot; have more stringent conditions attached; and that there are numerous grammatical phenomena with which any or all of these interjections are incompatible. These phenomena include: certain types of  pronouns, idioms, final sentential adverbs, negative polarity items, presupposition-suspending &quot;if&quot; clauses, picture noun clauses, preposed adverbials, and topicalized words. It is further concluded that the behavior of interjections can reflect or reveal unusual and poorly understood properties of phenomena such as picture noun clauses and preposed adverbials.

The paper surveys three loosely knit 'schools' of word formation: (1) the Generative school, (2) the Continental school, and (3) the Slavicist school.

The paper concludes with a list of the 10 most perplexing problems facing word formationists today: (1) semantic-syntactic asymmetry, (2) derivational gaps, (3) lexicalization, (4) semiproductivity, (5) rule order, (6) derivational direction or 'motivatn,' (7) the apparently ineluctable ad hocness in the derivation of relative adjectives and some noun compounds, (8) the location of the word formation component in the  grammar, (9) confusion of nongenerable and nonoccurring forms, and (10) the problem of currency (how to determine which of several generable forms with appropriate meanings will in fact gain currency).

The first results from confusion over the meaning of the term \"Chinese\"; one must decide whether Mandarin, Canton, or Taishan should be used as the language of instruction. It is suggested that Mandarin be used because it is the accepted official language in the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, and the United Nations and because it is necessary for reading and writing. The second question is whether to teach Mandarin or another dialect to the English-speaking students in a bilingual program. Mandarin is again suggested because it has a simpler sound system and because it can be studied further at many U.S. universities. Finally, there is  the question of whether characters or alphabetical writing should be used and whether traditional or simplified characters should be used. The use of characters is advocated because it is the form used by Chinese speakers. The simplified system is also advocated because it offers many advantages, including the fact that it is used at the United Nations. (AM)",

This procedure was compared to two other measures of child language development, a word-morpheme count and an inflection acquisition measure. Lee and Canter's procedure is considered especially significant in that it is based on the actual production of a child, but a main objection is that their approach is not linguistically oriented enough, so that their definition of what constitutes a sentence overlooks valuable information.

Although this system is characterized by deletions, assimilations, simplifications, and distortions, there is a regularity in the system which lends itself to systematic phonological analysis. Based on an examination of sample phonological deviations, the following rules are generalized. (1) In word initial environments: nasals, /1/, and /h/ are not distorted; stops are not deleted, but voiceless stops are generally unaspirated; all other segments are realized as either [1] or [w], except voiced 'predental' fricatives, which are reduced to stops, and initial preconsonantal fricatives which are deleted. (2) In word final and word medial environments: word final consonants are deleted when they follow  another consonant; word final or medial fricatives after syllabic nuclei are deleted if voiced, or realized as [h] if they are voiceless; word final or medial stops occurring between syllabic nuclei are reduced to glottal stop if voiceless, or deleted completely if voiced; in word final position before silence or a word which begins with a consonant, stops are generally reduced in the same manner, but to a much lesser degree. Such a study is deemed important because it provides information for further phonological research. (Author/AM)",

It also attempts to determine the underlying word order in English as well as the developmental sequence of the acquisition of Aux. A sentence-repetition test using positive statements, positive questions, and negative questions was administered to 30 children, aged 2 years, 1 month, to 5 years, 1 month, in order to examine these three questions. Results showed grammatical variation and seemed to indicate that rules are not globally learned and applied. The question of whether statements or questions are the underlying forms of English is unresolved. Rather than a single developmental sequence, varied strategies seem to account for child development of the acquisition of Aux.

        "description":"This is a study of the kinds of processes involved in learning the meaning of individual lexical items, and in particular how the acquisition of lexical meaning is related to the cognitive structuring of events on the one hand and the ability to produce syntactic paraphrases of a word's meaning and other related constructions on the other. It is proposed that errors involving the use of noncausative verbs in a causative sense come about through inference of a derivational or inclusive relationship between causative verbs and their noncausative counterparts and through a generalization by analogy with these causative verbs. It is further argued that when a child first begins to use causative verbs, they are essentially unanalyzed forms, i.e., the child uses a linguistic form  without being aware of its internal structure. The evidence that unanalyzed forms have been analyzed is the creation of novel forms which are made up of same or similar components combined according to the same rules. Thus, a fundamental distinction is made between cognitive knowledge and knowledge of a linguistic structure. (AM)",

The explanation proposed for the phenomenon of syntactic drift is considered superior to the traditional explanation of the erosive effect of phonological change, and to the postulation of a metacondition responsible for the proliferation of free-standing segments rather than bound morphemes. First of all it is shown that Old English and Modern English are structurally more similar than has traditionally been assumed, that changes evident in Modern English can be traced from the earliest documentations of Old  English. It is further shown that the answer cannot be found within the history of English, but rather, that the independent but parallel developments which take place in related languages are due to the structural features of the protolanguage, in this case, the Indo-European protolanguage. Finally it is shown that, while word-order change is not the sole cause of syntactic changes, it can be called upon to relate many diachronic developments which have until now defied explanation.

The scope and nature of the syllabus are discussed, followed by an examination of learning processes and strategies. The focus of the syllabus is seen as being fluency and flexibility, and as possible having some effect on student motivation. Since learning must be seen from the student's point of view, learning-focused materials are considered necessary in the syllabus. Some practical considerations are discussed, specifically general criteria for the language syllabus, sequencing, and item entry. Results of a questionnaire are shown, in which 50 ESL teachers indicated at what point they would introduce each of 45  grammatical structures. These results are compared to responses given by non-ESL educators. The use of Learning Effort Units (LEU's) as criteria for the entry of structures in a syllabus are discussed. It is hoped that this study will demonstrate the utility of an independent, objective teacher consensus in preparing a syllabus based on sound linguistic applications and not necessarily mirrored in existing language learning materials.

One type was engaged in the \"normal\" language teaching activities of the second-year courses.

This report describes the procedures and materials used in the pilot experiment, measurement techniques, and teacher and student selection. Results of the study are summarized, and recommendations are made concerning program materials and teaching  methods. In general, the results of the pilot experiment were viewed as encouraging in that the posttest performance of students indicated no significant differences among the three tracks. The experimental courses were well received by most students who participated, and the multiple-track French program seemed to create needed curricular flexibility in second-year courses.

        "description":"This paper proposes that some but not all &quot;I&quot; causatives in Korean are analyzable, and argues that case markers in Korean are not merely surface phenomena, but are semantically and syntactically significant. The types of Korean causatives are introduced, as well as the major problems involved in their analysis. Previous generative works are summarized. The relationship between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;ha&quot; causatives is investigated; some syntactic and semantic properties of the two causatives are compared and utilized as criteria for evaluating the hypotheses considered. The phenomenon of surface case markers is also investigated, with particular attention to &quot;ha&quot; causatives, and the shapes of the underlying structures for the types of causatives are determined.

The purpose of the questionnaire was to survey student attitudes and to move toward a means of evaluating beginning and intermediate level courses. On the basis of the questionnaire, the following general statements can be made: most students take Spanish because of the language requirement; most teachers are rated favorably; students seem to want accelerated courses for the better students and slower courses for the poorer students; students desire more courses for nonmajors; most students are interested in learning about the culture and people along with the language. A sample questionnaire is  attached. (AM)",

        "description":"This review of Bever's psycholinguistics survey is for the most part favorable. Commentary is centered on sections 1, 2, 4, and 6 of the report. The survey's first part is judged significant in that Wundt's pioneering work in psycholinguistics is discussed. The second section, on grammar as a psychological process, is found obscure in its denunciation of the competence-performance distinction. Evidence presented in section 4, on language perception processes, is not found convincing enough to refute the theory of the psychological reality of linguistically defined surface structure. The failure to present relevant data is cited as another fault of the report as well as forcing conclusions based on weak evidence. Section 6 presents three implications of the theory for research in  automatic language processing. The arguments, that psycholinguistic research is not a constraint on computational linguistics, and that automatic language processing has as a goal the development of man-made communication, are held to be unsound. The argument that the development of computational algorithms based on grammars generates advances in linguistic theory is considered more valid. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"So far bilingual education has had only the most modest success in providing for children of limited English-speaking ability (LESAS) an educational opportunity equal to that of English-speaking children. In fact, to aim only at equality is self-defeating because it is impossible for a LESA child with a five-to-six year handicap ever to catch up with an English-speaking schoolmate. The only solution is to provide the LESA child with a better opportunity in the form of an early start in reading. This paper presents as a reasonable hypothesis a long-range plan for encouraging an LESA child from the age of one and a half to three to learn to read his home language. If he is successful, at age three to five he can learn to read English. In this way, the child overcomes his initial  handicap and develops a firm basis for future schooling and for becoming, through ongoing bilingual bicultural education, functional in both his home language and English.

The philosophical objection questions whether the use of a foreign language in the U.S. educational system can be justified; the practical objection questions the usefulness of bilingual education in increasing educational achievement. Since misunderstandings about bilingual education and cultural identity are implicit in these objections, they are discussed at some length. Finally, a response is made to both kinds of objections. It is argued that bilingual education tends to produce a bilingual whose loyalty to this country is strong, that bilingualism is good for all Americans, and that bilingualism, far from being a fad, is on the rise. The apparent success, so far, of bilingual education is pointed out  in response to the second type of objection, and diachronic studies are called for to determine the actual effectiveness of bilingual education in academic and social achievement. By way of conclusion, bilingual education is termed the single most important effort of modern American education to break with ethocentric rigidity. (AM)",

        "description":"Bull (1965) has proposed that grammatical gender in Spanish is not an intrinsic characteristic of nouns but rather a matter of matching terminal sounds of nouns with those of adjectives and determiners. One implication of this theory is that the child has a cognitive understanding of the matching of terminal noun sounds with particular adjective and determiner forms. This paper seeks to ascertain whether such an understanding of Spanish rules is reached by children and at what age level. A test was administered to 315 Spanish-surnamed children in prekindergarten through Grade 3, divided into English monolingual, Spanish monolingual, and dominant Spanish/English bilingual groups. The task was to assign adjectives and determiners to nonsense words. Results support the first  hypothesis, that both bilinguals and Spanish monolinguals would match the Spanish nonsense word to an appropriate adjective or determiner. The second hypothesis, that monolinguals will master this rule before bilinguals, also seems to be supported, but only at the prekindergarten stage. The third hypothesis tested, that the response pattern is not affected by the type of stimulus presented, is also supported, indicating that the methodology used is a viable one. (AM)",

By a counterbalanced design to neutralize differences between groups and passages, it was demonstrated that the longer the surrounding context, the easier the cloze items; the beneficial effect of increasing amount of context extends beyond the 50 word mark. This suggests that the cloze procedure is a viable device for measuring effects (or knowledge) of discourse constraints extending well beyond the limits of 5-10  words of surrounding context.

The speech studied is that of Puerto Rican and black Harlem teenagers. The data reported here refutes many of Bailey's (1972) claims. Clusters where voicing is not shared are found to simplify differently than shared voicing clusters. Clusters with &quot;l&quot; as the first member are found to behave differently than clusters beginning with a nasal, and nasal clusters behave differently depending on the final consonant. Certain of these clusters also behave differently from previously studied consonant cluster simplification, as well as final postvocalic consonant deletion. That all of these deletion phenomena show  different frequencies of simplification, as well as different constraints on simplification, indicates that variability rules for consonant cluster simplification must be further refined and new rules added. Such refinements and new rules are proposed in the present paper, and the implications of these new rules on the ordering of all deletion phenomena are discussed. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The paper surveys the major projects on the understanding of natural language that fall within what may now be called the artificial intelligence paradigm of natural language systems. Some space is devoted to arguing that the paradigm is now a reality and different in significant respects from the generative paradigm of present-day linguistics. The comparisons between systems center round questions about the level, centrality and \"phenomenological plausibility\" of the knowledge and inferences that must be available to a system that is to understand everyday language.

Therefore, it is deduced that the substratum theory as an explanation of the transformation of Latin into the Romance languages is not confirmed by the development of Spanish in America.

        "description":"When a grammar is expressed in augmented transition network (ATN) form, the problem of detecting syntactic ambuguity reduces to finding all possible paths through the ATNs. Each successfully terminating path through the ATN generates an acceptable parsing of the input string. Two ATN forms, minimal-node and pseudo-tree, are described along with the conventions for traversing each. The two forms are compared in regard to efficient use of computer time and space and in regard to appropriateness for each of the three path-finding techniques. Three techniques are discussed for finding all acceptable paths through ATNs. The techniques are \"Backtracking,\"\"Simultaneous Parallel Analysis,\" and \"Amputate And Re-enter.\" Relative merits of the three techniques are discussed in terms of  computer execution time, required data storage, programmer time, and amenability of the program to modification. A rudimentary ATN-based parser for English has been written in SPITBOL to test the implementation of these techniques. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper attempts to characterize what seem to be key movements in the teaching of EFL at various levels in Europe. These movements reveal that semantic approaches to language teaching are widespread. Recent research into the effectiveness of teaching methods has demonstrated how difficult it is to show whether audiolingual or cognitive code approaches are effective. A strong movement toward semantic syllabuses has developed, partly as a consequence of this, and work undertaken through the Council of Europe has concentrated on this since 1969. The characteristics of these syllabuses are that they aim to provide language structure which will be effective in communication situations, and attempts are being made to specify an inventory of (1) those structures necessary for control  of the fundamentals of English, French, Spanish, etc. (up to \"threshold level\") and (2) those notions which a speaker would require to handle defined language exchanges. An interesting relationship may be traced between these semantic syllabuses and traditional rhetoric. A further link exists between the logic of speech acts and \"notional\" inventories. Examples of semantic syllabuses in use in Europe are drawn from adult English teaching and certain elementary school projects. (Author/AM)",

Broad goals and specific operational objectives should be defined, and performance testing devices developed. Each student's particular psychological aptitudes and physiological and cultural characteristics must be discovered, and the psychosocial uniqueness of each language should be recognized. The student can then be offered a choice of goals and tests compatible with his or her aptitudes, characteristics, and interests; on this basis, overall instructional and interactional strategies can be planned. Individual learning paths should be assessed according to the performance of communicative tasks. Finally, the  instructor should remain flexible at all stages and, together with the students and the administration, involved in a continuous process of self-evaluation and renewal. As students should learn how to study on their own, it is felt that programmed materials would be most helpful. Specific references are made to \"Basic French.\" (Author/AM)",

Information was collected by means of a questionnaire mailed to: all multilingual national and unilingual international language teachers' associations which are members of FIPLV; individuals, institutions, offices, and organizations all over the world; and all diplomatic missions in the Federal Republic of Germany. A list is provided of all countries considered in the report, as well as descriptions of their language situations. Questions covered such topics as: language needs, curricula, language objectives, foreign languages at the preschool level, bilingual education, materials and media currently in use, and  trends in language teaching methods. Generally, little or no research on foreign language needs was found, and little interest in bilingual education. Regarding language instruction, communication seems to be the major objective today; the audiolingual method has fallen out of use; and there is enthusiasm for the use of audiovisual aids. Although these and other findings must be considered tentative, it is felt that the report is important as the first attempt to collect such information. (Author/AM)",

The former emphasizes duplication of the two languages, the latter their compartmentalization. The first position may not justify a carefully planned bilingual program; the second may prove too rigid for a fluid society. A conciliatory solution is suggested which makes extensive use of skillful code-switching, and which avoids compartmentalization and redundancy while in essence being a full bilingual program. An innovative program at the University of Texas as San Antonio is cited as an example of such a bilingual bicultural program. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The role of statewide coordinating/governing agencies in the program review and approval process has grown steadily. It would seem expedient for those involved in the process of state level program review to share ideas, experiences, and concepts of the review process in order to better understand the process itself and to explore possibilities for further development and refinement of their own agencies' procedures. This survey attempts to facilitate the information exchange by the various state agencies in this important area. In January 1975 requests were made to the 50 state coordinating agencies which are members of the State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO) organization for copies of their policies and procedures for program review. For the purpose of analysis,  the review procedures utilized by the various states have been divided into two major sections: (1) review of new and expanded programs and (2) the review of existing programs.

As the work of the project developed, it was found that the issue of \"limits to growth and higher education\" had two facets: (1) what role can the postsecondary education system play in developing or implementing models of alternative futures and solutions to the present crisis; and (2) how can postsecondary education solve or even approach its own \"limits to growth\" of rising costs and dropping enrollments and revenues? In order to recommend funding strategies, six key ingredients of \"leverage\" on the postsecondary education system were identified. These are: (1) interest; (2) understanding of  the nature of the problem confronted; (3) identification of development of curricula appropriate to the problem and to educational goals; (4) models of educational settings that reflect curricular goals and methods; (5) expertise in organizational development to facilitate necessary change and innovations; and (6) incentive systems that reward appropriate curiculum development and institutional change. The document also recommends goals; defines an adequate ecological education; defines resources and needs; and recommends seven possible projects. Appendixes A to I follow. (Author/KE)",

        "description":"This paper provides a broad reexamination of the correlates of faculty age, incorporating several measures of research activity and other related professional achievement variables. The data are derived from a large-scale, nationally representative survey of college and university faculty members; analyses are based on a subsample of all doctorate level teaching faculty in seven major representative scientific areas--physics, biochemistry, earth sciences, chemical engineering, experimental psychology, economics, and sociology. While much of the research focuses either on one discipline or on a broad aggregate of diverse fields, the present study analyzes each discipline separately, consistent with earlier research, which has shown substantial cross-field difference in  research-professional activities. Additionally, no single model of aging is proposed a priori. Rather, a series of plausible mathematical models are postulated and tested. The compelling conclusion is that career age (and possibly tenure status) is a poor predictor of research-professional activity. (Author/KE)",

The plan projected its greatest impact on desegregation as occuring within the first two years of its five-year course, but with the continuing deterioration of Florida's and the national economy, the effectuation of the parts of the plan dependent on greatly increased revenues is not likely. The prospects for a turnabout in state appropriations in the next year or two for the implementation of desegregation are not good. The import of these developments on the enhancement of educational opportunity for black post-high school students, whether at the community college level, or  the level of the senior colleges and universities with their graduate and professional schools is, at this point, problematic, because of the exigencies of a faltering economy.

The program emerged from a recognition of the university's responsibility to provide higher education to those previously unable to attend classes because of family or job responsibilities, geographic isolation, or limited mobility. This paper outlines UESP in terms of its mission, generic classification, organizational structure, selected program data, and supplementary projects. Next, the internal operation of UESP is described in terms of five functional components: curriculum development, marketing, production, student support, and evaluation.

The subject matter of the two conflicts differed greatly, but both involved the same groups of combatants--administrators, faculty members, students, trustees, and external organizers. This review of Monteith's career brings some illuminating and authoritative answers to many questions about what happened at Hamilton during its nearly disastrous early history. The paper also touches on antebellum influences of organized religious bodies and their feuding factions on colleges and universities, and the social reform movements in the United States during Monteith's lifetime. Appendixes 1 and 2 reproduce relevant pages from 1875 and 1941 published histories of  the University of Michigan at whose antecedent institution Monteith held 7 of the 13 blueprinted professorships and also its presidency. Appendix 3 has been typed from an 1833 pamphlet written by President Henry Davis of Hamilton College describing an episode in Monteith's stay there. Appendix 4 reviews the beginnings of Hamilton College. Appendix 5 consists of footnotes and supplementary data. (Author/KE)",

(1) We have an obligation to put a higher priority on teaching than we have done so far. (2) Any evaluation system should be tied to a strong system for teaching improvement. (3) There will probably not be wide acceptance of the proposal because: in times of shrinking resources, support tends to go to existing programs; adoption of the program would require the education of administrators and faculty; there is not a one-to-one relationship between good teaching and good research; there is a strong pay-off to research; there can be no significant change without broad acceptance of the  program.

KHEAA has assumed that the development of model student assistance programs will include administrative procedures, program guidelines, and funding levels and methods as essential elements in the implementation of student assistance systems. KHEAA also believes that the types of programs proposed are significant and feels that, as a minimum, loan, grant, scholarship and work-study programs should be considered, and that any model student assistance  programs developed for the Commonwealth must be tailored to the needs of the potential beneficiaries. This document includes a review and summary of phases I-IV, a review of student assistance plans in other states, and a set of proposed goals and objectives of the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority. Final sections of this report provide identification and assessment of alternative model student assistance programs, development and documentation of alternative strategies, and a summary of study recommendations.

Its overriding concern is with the structure of financial aid. The consortium recommends redirecting benefits under existing laws so that those resources can be more effectively used. The consortium's proposal addresses itself to the six key Title VI programs (The Basic Education Opportunity Grant Program, the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program, the State Student Incentive Grant Program, the College Work-Study Program, the National Direct Student Loan Program, and the Guaranteed Student Loan Program). In addition, there is a commentary that discusses goals,  priorities, and costs. (Author/KE)",

Second, to ascertain if any programs designed to train personnel to work with the aging are currently being offered. Third, to determine what plans for future programs were being made by institutions of higher education in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and fourth, to determine what are the existing attitudes and priorities of those institutions with regard to such programs. Employing an open-end, closed-form survey questionnaire mailed to all institutions in the neighboring states of West Virginia and Tennessee, it was found that, for the most part, little either in the way of currently offered programs or plans for future  offerings is taking place. This finding was contradictory to the self-reported attitudes of the need for such programs surveyed. However, where programs were being offered, services were being rendered, or attitudes toward the extension of education of the elderly to a larger segment of the aging population were reported, it appeared that the community colleges were more aware of the needs and more willing to bear a share of the responsibility for the meeting in comparison to the four-year college and universities.

The intent of the report was to analyze issues concerning nonresident student enrollment, the types and source of constraints placed on nonresident enrollment, and selected constitutional and statutory considerations involved in and determining residency. The methodology of the study included a review of current literature on nonresident enrollment, case law on residency issues, and surveys of state higher education agencies and public institution members of the constraints on resident enrollment. The report is written in three major sections. The first section reviews student migration trends and serves as background  information for subsequent sections. Section 2 deals with the nature of nonresident enrollment constraints and contains a review of results of the state and institutional surveys. Section 3 introduces case law related to constitutional and statutory issues. The introduction is an overview of case laws and is not intended to be definitive since it is viewed from an educator's perspective rather than from the perspective of a legal specialist.

The document begins with a review of earlier discussions of sex discrimination in graduate schools. This review is followed by  attempts to document and explain differences by sex in the admissions process, time spent in graduate study, geographic and interinstitutional mobility, and financial aid practices. It is in these areas that the most explicit charges of differential treatment of the sexes have been made; these are also areas where new data can be brought to bear on the issue.

At Stanford University this period was characterized by controversy, deep divisions within the university community, disruption of classes, student strikes, and the presence of uniformed police on campus. In this environment of turbulence and violence, a major decision was reached to remove ROTC from Stanford. It was a decision that raised questions concerning the legitimacy of the governing role of the board of trustees, the president, the faculty and the students. It caused a crisis in the decision-making process and an altering of the power structure of the university. It extended beyond the single topic of ROTC, beyond the question of legitimate authority, to  include such matters as the ethics of classified research, rivalry between academic disciplines, and the very fundamental question of academic freedom. This document attempts to identify and analyze, from a political perspective, the decision-making process that produced the &quot;ROTC decision.&quot; It begins with an exploration of the Stanford decision-making system and proceeds to describe the &quot;political perspective.&quot; (Author/KE)",

States' statutory schemes vary from absence of any mention of higher education to far-reaching legislation that assumes vast powers over higher education. The pattern that does emerge from an examination of state regulation schemes is that nonprofit, nonvocational, regionally accredited institutions of higher education are often free of any significant regulation. Innovative programs, including external degree programs, that cross state boundaries are almost never mentioned in statutes. As part of a nation-wide study, this document tries to determine through an analysis of state statutes and regulations the approaches that states are taking  toward external degree programs. This document highlights the scope and limits of state power to regulate innovative education programs. It covers: state regulation of higher education; legal restraints on state regulation of external degree programs the \"commerce clause\"; and legal restraints on state regulations of external degree programs-due process of law.

        "description":"The Committee on Educational Planning, Policies, and Programs of the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina has adopted detailed, year-by-year projections of anticipated student enrollments in the institutions of higher education of the state for the period 1975-80, with less detailed projections for the years 1984-85 and 1989-90. Those projections are set forth in this document, which also includes much important historical information on college enrollment in North Carolina in recent years. This document assessed the extent of enrollment growth in North Carolina colleges and universities by relating demographic and high school enrollment and graduation information to college enrollment trends. Projections to 1989 will be made using certain underlying assumptions  as bases for these projections. Several crucial assumptions utilized are: there will be no severe social or economic shifts in the society or the state during the projection period; there will be no drastic diminution in the availability of student places throughout the state planning horizon; and there will be no major programmatic change that will significantly affect the college going rate or cause institutional shifts in enrollment. The ensuing enrollment projections are a result of these assumptions. (Author/KE)",

Their legal status is that of holding a special position in immigrant law which restricts their activities, especially in economic areas. That they are viewed socially as \"outsiders\" is reflected in the nature of their social relationships and activities. Because of the legal and social conditions of their presence in the U.S., foreign students can be viewed as utilizing distinctive social and economic strategies for coping with American society. A number of people function in roles as brokers between foreign students and the dominant society. Many of the financial arrangements of foreign students are shown to be in extricably tied to the legal prohibitions  on employment which are a condition of their presence. (Author)",

This paper proposes a framework for analysis of institutional research report impact. The three major dimensions identified are: (1) time (short-term, intermediate, and long-term); (2) action (accepted, nonresponse, and rejection); and (3) audience (primary or wirter/user the same, secondary or written for someone else, and tertiary or written for someone else but passed on to and read by a third part). A series of longitudinal case studies is proposed as a means of implementing the procedures described. A Research Impact Gram (RIG) that incorporates all three dimensions is described. The RIG draws on the  sociogram techniques developed in the discipline of sociology. While the approach does have limitations, it provides a simple technique for determining the impact of institutional research reports. (DGC)",

        "description":"Two assumptions in support of learner-controlled computer-assisted instruction (CAI) are that (1) instruction administered under learner control will be less aversive than if administered under program control, and (2) the student is sufficiently aware of his learning state to make, in most instances, his own instructional decisions. Some 130 college student subjects were exposed to a CAI module on 12 edible plants native to Texas. The program for one group included pictures of the plants to help in their identification. A second group was never shown the pictures, and the third group had the option of choosing whether or not they wanted to see the pictures. It was anticipated that those subjects having an option would almost always elect to see the pictures. To provide for  investigating individual differences in the use of learner control, a second, less appealing option was introduced--a review of the plants' critical features. It was concluded that learner control over a facilitating treatment did not reduce state of anxiety; the student's ability to use learner control effectively appeared to be a function of personality traits as well as cognitive skills. This suggests that state of anxiety tends to be task specific, and that the relationship of tasks to anxiety should be explored in subsequent research. (Author/DGC)",

There are numerous applications of this design in economics, education, and psychology, although until recently, no appropriate analysis techniques had been developed to deal with the model adequately. This paper presents and develops a complex example of time-series experiments using simulated data with the intent of illustrating the analytic power of the technique for educational methodologists in a number of substantive fields. The simulated data were developed to conform to an autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) model, and three intervention effects were built into the series. The first intervention exerted a constant effect; the  second damped the effect, and the third caused a general drift (trend shift) of the data points. The methodology and results of the simulation--including the simulation data--are provided. (Author/DGC)",

A series of recommendations for changes resulted from the initial evaluation. This report describes the second phase of the evaluation and includes (1) descriptive information on the development of the Columbus VAC from February 1974 to February 1975, (2) a quantitative analysis of television viewing by cable subscribers in  Columbus, and (3) data, based on 200 telephone interviews, on the reaction of Columbus residents to VAC.

Pre- and posttest measures of the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale were used to investigate the hypothesis and confirmed a higher degree of internal  locus of control in the open classroom that crossed levels of academic achievement.

        "description":"A pilot study was conducted to investigate the application of the PLATO IV system to training interpersonal skills. As part of the development of an experimental design to be undertaken in the future, several activities were involved. Suitable interpersonal skills were considered and a single one, giving effective performance feedback, was chosen for the pilot study. Training materials for this skill were developed and coded into the PLATO IV system. A small sample of experimental and control subjects was tested and trained, and data about their feedback skill performance and companies' performance were collected and analyzed. It appears that the training had some effect on skill performance. The proposed experimental design was evaluated as suitable for application to a larger  study. (Author)",

Both learning effectiveness and efficiency were considered. Sixty college students were divided into three groups--19 students studying alone, 16 studying in pairs, and 15 studying in groups of 3 or 4. Students worked together at the PLATO IV CAI terminal and then completed criterion-based tests individually on the material covered and an attitude questionnaire. No significant differences in achievement were found, but very significant differences in the time to complete the module were observed. Pairs of students required the most time, and groups of 3 or 4 required the least time. When total achievement scores for  the group were divided by the total time at the terminal, learning efficiency was found to increase with group size. It may be concluded, therefore, that learning effectiveness is not substantially altered by small group use of CAI terminals, but the relative efficiency is considerably improved. (DGC)",

The theoretical and practical significance of algorithms stems from their applicability to problems of learning, instruction, and instructional design, and they may potentially provide the basis for the development of a paradigm or model of instruction. For the purposes of this paper, an algorithm may be defined as a strictly replicable procedure which always produces the correct result when applied by a user to a problem or class of problems. Examples of the specification and use of an algorithm are provided together with a discussion of the properties and characteristics of algorithms.

        "description":"Recent reviews of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in various journals suggest that the technological and economic barriers to its adoption and use may be overcome in the very near future, and that CAI will be feasible in a number of educational settings. Computer hardware costs have dropped dramatically in recent years, and a variety of programing languages are available to the user. Two major problems remain to be overcome. First, there are problems of instructional strategy including the lack of preservice and inservice teacher education on the use of CAI. In particular, there is a need for better training on the methodology of lesson development for CAI. Second, the variety of computer programing languages together with their technical intricacies presents a significant  barrier to widespread use. In an effort to overcome the latter problem, Boeing Computer Services (BCS) has developed a series of computer routines to aid the instructor in the development and use of CAI lesson modules, SCHOLAR/TEACH. The software is currently in pilot testing and may be available for more general use in the near future. When available to the public, it will include a series of self-tutorial modules to assist teachers in the field with the use of the system for curriculum development. (DGC)",

Each teacher planned the lessons, organized the materials, tried the lessons with several pupils, made revisions, submitted lessons to the project evaluator who suggested further revisions, and finally teachers used them regularly with students. The lessons proved to be expensive in terms of production hours in relation to instructional time. Audiotutorial lessons were useful for reteaching children, giving further practice, and also in presenting new skills and new information to children who have a special interest  in a subject. They did not appeal to elementary age children or to their teachers as much as the literature indicates they have appealed to older students. (Author/DGC)",

Among the reasons for using simulation techniques rather than other methodologies are: expense and time; safety; ethical  or political constraints; past, future, or hypothetical events; and control over real-world events. Several advantages of simulation over other methodologies for training, evaluation, and research are presented together with a conceptual framework for assessing the utility of its application to specific problems.

With &quot;Man: A Course of Study&quot; as the curricular base of the experiment, there will be a Library Experiment Program for Adults using print and nonprint materials and a Library Experiment Program for Children as a parallel nonclassroom learning experience. Both programs will support the educational approach of child, parent, and professional in merged interaction. Evaluation of this experiment will consist of the extent of participation in the satellite classroom session, pre- and postattitudinal surveys, direct evaluation by teachers, the number of participants in a satellite  parent-teacher exchange, and the number of requests for resource materials and the frequency of their use in teaching the course. The experiment is planned for February 1973 through June 1975. A list of job descriptions for key personnel is included, plus a budget for both the developmental and operational phases.

Both groups were pre- and posttested on a Communication Skill Behavior Check List for Empathy and Dogmatism. The experimental group's experience consisted of student construction of communication situations, utilization of the communication process guidelines, observation and increased sensitivity to nonverbal and verbal cues in the communications process, and group discussion of attitudes following replay sessions. Test results showed  no significant differences in scores of the experimental group and the control group. (SK)",

        "description":"Choosing texts, media, and literature about Africa is a difficult task for school librarians who have not studied Africa in detail; however it is possible to evaluate the available materials on the basis of several important criteria. These include the authority of the author, the dates of preparation and publication, and the accuracy of illustrations. Blatant biases can be easily recognized, but attention should also be paid to the more subtle forms of bias in the use of stereotypes or evaluative labels to typify whole groups. Over half of the children's materials on Africa appear in publishers' series, most of which use a European conceptual framework in the discussion of economics, history, religion, and social life. Such a viewpoint distorts the presentation of African life  and invites negative comparisons to western life. African materials should present the African perspective and values and avoid overgeneralization about this very diverse continent. Many of the available books are fiction or folklore for which there are additional considerations: the authenticity and provenance of the tale; and human dignity in characterization, dialog, and plot. A selected list of new materials is appended. (Author/SL)",

The system began with the newspapers of January 1, 1974, the old clipping files being left as they were. The librarian at the Denver (Colorado) &quot;Post&quot; discussed the problems of updating the subject headings of a clippings file--headings which must change frequently to accommodate new names and concepts as they appear in news stories. Under the  supervision of an index editor, a standard procedure was outlined for the daily revision of the subject headings in the &quot;Post's&quot; clipping files. Day-to-day file revision and correction procedures from the Milwaukee (Wisconsin) &quot;Journal and Sentinel&quot; were described.

It was noted that at some newspaper libraries the lack of staff dictates open files, which makes eliciting the cooperation of reporters in signing out and returning files very important. Other libraries try to provide a research service as well as information retrieval functions. The discussion following the formal presentation covered problems of  overdue materials, circulation methods, copying policies, photo files, and microforms. (LS)",

Included are background, description, and statistical data on the five distinct work projects of the BOOKS/JOBS Project: the Ohio Steering Committee; the Summit County Steering Committee; the Pilot Project for Summit County (July, 1, 1968-June 30, 1969); the Continuation Project (July 1, 1969-June 30, 1970); and the Training and Sensitivity Project (July 1, 1970-June 30, 1972). These programs used mainly films and filmstrips to give service and information to the unemployed and underemployed, both directly and through employers  and community agencies. Since films on job-seeking were found to be oriented to the middle class, films on black history and culture and sensitivity training were emphasized during the later stages of the project.

        "description":"In 1971, a management consulting firm undertook a case study of the Columbia University libraries to improve library performance by reviewing and strengthening the organization and recasting staff composition and deployment patterns. To implement the study's recommendations, an administrative structure was proposed which would emphasize functional relationships and take full advantage of subject and operational specialties among the staff. The final report of the study was thoroughly reviewed by library staff of all levels, and opportunities were provided for staff input. Because the study recommendations were not detailed enough to permit direct implementation, a preimplementation planning process was conceived to proceed in three discrete but interrelated phases concerned with  organization, staffing, and operations. With this basis, the library's on-going program of operational planning is taking place in the context of a fully documented organization. Each operating unit and position is fully defined, and a program accounting budget has been developed to provide additional data. The new organization is the starting point for the evolutionary change which the management study and restructuring were intended to permit. (Author/SL)",

        "description":"The concept of bibliotherapy covers both the normal activity of librarians in suggesting books to readers, and the therapeutic adjuvant in medicine and psychiatry where reading is used in diagnosis or other specific phases of therapy. Mental hospitals have been the prime locale for the practice of bibliotherapy in the United States and Europe, but public and school librarians have long practiced it as an unobtrusive form of counseling or guidance. The clients serviced by these types of libraries can be classified into two groups: (1) emotionally ill and (2) the normal individual who is facing a major life task. Bibliotherapy has utility with both groups. The role of the librarian is that of a book specialist with an informed layman's knowledge of human problems and psychology.  This is sufficient for those working with normal clients, but in service to the emotionally ill the team approach--including the physician, psychiatrist, or counselor--is essential. The relationship of bibliotherapist to client is a delicate one. Personal maturity, wide knowledge of literature, and specific training in psychology are essential; anything less opens the client situation to possible coercion or abuse. (Author/SL)",

Using a hypothetical network, two sets of operating policies are analyzed: those emphasizing minimum delay and those that maximize the probability of successfully meeting user requests. Cost constraints and value judgements about tradeoffs between delays and the probability of satisfying user requests are considered in the context of network operating policies. The impact of union listings of holdings, automated circulation at the individual  libraries, and computer-controlled networks is analyzed.

Visual and sound filmstrips, games, puzzles, visual and tactile materials, cassettes, and records which would interest and entertain while reinforcing skills were purchased. The book collection ranged in difficulty from touch-and-feel and manipulative books and easy books with simple pictures of everyday objects to high-interest/low-vocabulary books. Nonfiction books proved more popular than fiction. At first the library was kept open 8 hours a day, Tuesday through Saturday, and was available to residents whenever they  received permission from their aides. Within 6 months an outreach program was developed where the librarian would visit children who were unable to come to the library. Volunteers were used extensively. The hope is that it has been demonstrated that a library is more than a collection of books and that the library and library staff have been accepted by the Bowen Children Center's staff and residents as a necessary and integral part of their institution.

The language processor now accepts ellipses and other nonspecific requests and resolves these from dialog context. A help requesting facility has been provided which will suggest possible faults (based on the student's knowledge about the circuit at the time of request) which could explain the symptoms he has observed. The net effect of modifications is that a dialog is much more like a conversation with a very skilled tutor who can infer what a students means, based on a complete interaction session, and respond appropriately. The resulting program can be accessed through the ARPA  network of computers. (SK)",

One particular application is for instruction of small groups within the classroom. The system is simple enough for any teacher to use and inexpensive to purchase and operate. Although he thought the key to successful learning will continue to be a bright, personable, and dynamic teacher, educators have lacked creative insight in not bringing instructional technology into  teaching and learning.

Three actions must be taken at the federal level to provide legislative authority for combining categorical program funds set aside for dissemination. Two steps are needed at the state level to make a better system a reality. The cooperative efforts should not become a public-relations tool nor a conduit for federally developed information.

In order to assess the attitudes of the faculty of Pensacola Junior College (Florida) toward performance objectives, an Opinion Poll was sent to all 230 faculty members; 163 responded. Opinion Poll results indicated that (1) those faculty members holding the highest educational degrees tended to be least favorable toward  performance objectives; and (2) those with the most teaching experience had the best knowledge and the best attitudes toward performance objectives, but held the lowest opinion of their use in faculty evaluation. In rank order from favorable to unfavorable opinion, the mean responses from six disciplines were as follows: Exact Science, Vocational-Technical, Language and Fine Arts, Adult Education, Health Related, and Social Science.

        "description":"Recent legislation has required affirmative action in the hiring practices of educational institutions. In order to ascertain the effects of equal employment laws on community college administration in California, a questionnaire was prepared and sent to 98 California community college districts; it requested administrators to provide information regarding their personal experiences with Notices of Charge of Employment Discrimination. Of the 74 college districts responding, 28 (37.8 percent) had received such notices; the majority were charges of sex discrimination. Written comments added to the questionnaires indicate the administrators' dissatisfaction with the procedures; they claim that they are assumed guilty until proven innocent, that the paperwork involved in defense is  monumental, and that the length of litigation is extensive. According to the author, the federal and state &quot;Guidelines&quot; and &quot;Regulations&quot; were written to direct employers who hire workers in large numbers to perform jobs whose outputs can be measured quantitatively; they are thus only vaguely appropriate for educational institutions. Also, because the agencies bringing the charges represent the plaintiff and also act as the judge of the case, they are not neutral fact finders. The various laws, agencies, and problems associated with affirmative action are discussed. (DC)",

Results of a questionnaire sent to the 27 vocational-technical program coordinators at the College of DuPage (Illinois) asking them to indicate the frequency with which certain activities were engaged in by advisory committee (AC) members, showed low levels of both commitment and control--AC members were most likely to do that which called for little effort or time and their recommendations were seldom implemented. Because these AC members represent local business and industry, they can be effective in providing employment for the college's graduates and in keeping technical programs in tune with current needs. In order to increase their  effectiveness, (1) they should have more control of the conduct of the programs; (2) they should be directly supervised and selected by the college president or his designates, instead of by program coordinators who have less prestigious business contacts; (3) they should be given more recognition; (4) they should be involved in long-range projects to support the college; (5) they should participate in the recruitment and selection of students; (6) their recommendations should be considered; (7) new AC members should be provided with training sessions; and (8) adequate records of graduate placement and AC work must be kept.

The report includes the background of collective bargaining in post secondary education, the status of collective bargaining in Florida under the recently enacted Florida Public Employee Relations Act, and a comparison between the Florida and Michigan experiences in collective bargaining. The procedure involved developing the educational materials (a summary of the Florida Public Employee Relations Act, a summary of the Public Employees' Relations Commission, and an outline of How Collective Bargaining Works) and implementing the program (one-hour presentations followed by open discussions in the  academic division). Consensus of the participants was that the materials were informative and that they increased general understanding about collective bargaining. It is recommended that these materials be shared with other Florida community colleges in order to promote better understanding of collective bargaining with the aim of making better decisions in this area of concern. The materials are appended. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"This document contains the reports of two studies concerning the graduates of the University of Minnesota Technical College (UMTC) at Crookston. The first report analyzes the results of a survey of all graduates (1966-72) and of 1972 graduates in particular. It was found that most of the graduates were employed; of these, 82 percent were employed in fields they had prepared for at the college, and 88 percent were employed at the mid-management or semi-professional level. Most of the graduates had remained in rural areas, 66 percent in communities of less than 10,000 and 30 percent in communities of less than 2,000. The report concludes that UMTC can be considered accountable in that its main mission is to prepare individuals for future employment at the mid-management or  semi-professional levels in agricultural and related fields and to prepare them for service to rural communities. The second report discusses the results of a survey of the opinions of the employers of UMTC graduates. Results indicate that employers rated the college highly in terms of preparing graduates for jobs, that UMTC graduates compared very favorably with other employees, that a substantial number of graduates had been promoted since their initial hiring, that males were promoted more often than females, and that approximately 99 percent of the employers would hire other UMTC graduates.

Chief administrators must make their attitudes toward nontraditional students known to all college personnel if the climate for learning is to improve. Those who recruit nontraditional students must be aware of various cultures and life styles, must command total knowledge of college operations, academic requirements, curriculum, and job markets, and must honestly present financial aid possibilities. Registration procedures must be improved to facilitate admissions. Counselors should provide the student with a caring image of the college and should help underwrite student success through careful and  non-threatening diagnosis and placement. Study programs should be individualized according to academic skills and interests; career-oriented curricula, learning styles, flexible scheduling, and performance objectives should also be emphasized in educating nontraditional students. Teacher-training should give future instructors a more accurate picture of nontraditional student needs and characteristics. Also, in order to fully integrate nontraditional students into the college, they should be encouraged to participate in extra-curricular activities. (DC)",

A multi-campus district was defined as a district which operates two or more campuses under one governing board with each campus having a separate site administrator, whereas a multi-college district operates two or more individual comprehensive colleges. Results of the survey indicate that: (1) multi-campus districts utilize fewer off-campus instructional facilities (an average of 35 compared to an average of 115 for multi-college districts); (2) while 11 of the 12 multi-campus districts studied have located their district offices off-campus, only five of the 13 multi-campus districts have done  so--however, six of the eight multi-campus districts with central offices on-campus expressed a desire to move off-campus; (3) central administrative functions were similar in both kinds of districts, but there was no indication of the degree to which each function was performed by the central offices; and (4) although multi-college districts tend to be larger than multi-campus districts, the central offices of the latter retain more staff. The fact that the larger districts have less central administrative staff implies a lessening of district office control.

Currently, prospective LPN students are required to obtain satisfactory scores on each sub-test of the Pre-Admission and Classification Examination (PACE). Because this test costs each student $6.00 and because scores are not available for four weeks, an alternative test has been sought. Since October 1973, NSCC has been administering both the PACE and the Differential Aptitude Test (DAT) to prospective students. The DAT is free and scores are available the same day. This study compares the DAT and the PACE as predictors  of success in LPN classes and on the state licensure examination. Results indicate that the DAT is a less reliable predictor of success; however, final conclusions cannot be drawn because of the limited sample size to date. The authors recommend that concerned community colleges give both tests to applicants, admit students in the top 60 percent on one or both tests, and then analyze licensure test scores through time until one test emerges superior.

CAOS uses a battery of aptitude tests to measure verbal and numerical abilities, spatial visualization, clerical perception, and general learning ability. Test scores are converted into a profile which is then related to Aptitude Qualifications Profiles found in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. Before taking the aptitude test battery students make a self-estimate of expected standing on the tests. The California Occupational Survey (COPS), which measures occupational interests, is also administered. This study was undertaken to determine if occupational areas identified for  exploration through aptitude test measurement corresponded to areas identified by student self-estimate of aptitudes. For only one of the 20 students studied was there much mutual identification of occupational areas. The data do not suggest which is the more valid approach; they only show that the two tend not to yield consistent results. Instances in which congruence of areas occurs perhaps offer the most significant leads. The revealed tendency of students to underestimate themselves suggests that more positive encouragement may derive from impersonal objective measurement. Tabulated data are appended. (Author/DC)",

        "description":"In order to identify vocational programs which would meet the educational desires and aspirations of the community and the manpower training needs of business and industry, Eastern Arizona College (EAC) conducted a needs assessment of the Globe-Miami area. During the Spring semester of 1973-74, existing demographic and other data were reviewed; a questionnaire was sent to high school juniors, seniors, their parents, and selected EAC students; a second questionnaire was sent to a ten percent random sample of the adults residing in the area; and a third questionnaire was sent to local businesses and industries. Existing and potential employment opportunities and the amount of training available through other institutions and agencies were also analyzed. Survey results and final  analysis of the data are presented. Identified target groups included the handicapped, persons needing job upgrading, school dropouts, senior citizens, and women returning to the labor market. It was concluded that the vocational programs that would meet the needs of both the community and business and industry were: Business, Sales/Mid-Management, and Secretarial; Auto/Diesel Mechanics; Justice Administration; Home Economics; and Electronics, Drafting, and Mining Technology. The questionnaires are appended. (DC)",

Data for various subgroups (transfer/precareer/continuing, day/evening, full-time/part-time, male/female) and for differing age groups within each subgroup are presented in tabular form. A total of 42 student  characteristic variables are described, and grouped into four major categories: (1) basic classification variables--age, sex, enrollment status, race, marital status; (2) demographic variables--residence, commuting distance, plans for employment, annual family income, parents' occupations; (3) intellective variables--GPA, other institutions attended; and (4) perceptual-attitudinal variables--reasons for college selection, need for counseling, future plans.

The introductory chapters of the report define two-year postsecondary education, analyze existing institutions according to enrollments, locations, and services provided, and present the rationale and  goals for two-year postsecondary education. The chapter on effective means of providing low-cost, easily accessible two-year postsecondary education discusses interinstitutional cooperation and consortia, the extension of program offerings at existing institutions, and state-level contracting with in-state private institutions and with institutions outside the state. Subsequent chapters discuss financial aid to students and to institutions, and methods of avoiding program duplication. The final chapters include recommendations and additional comments by Task Force members. (Author/DC)",

Statistics on graduation, credits earned (in both college-level and noncollege-level courses), and grade point average (GPA) are included. Analyses are given for each entering class according to curriculum and to three high school GPA groups. Findings indicate the following rule of thumb: of any entering class, three-fourths will return for the second semester, two-thirds for the third, one-half for the fourth, and, after the initial opportunity to graduate, 40 percent will return for the fifth semester. Students entering with high school GPA's over 75 percent are seen to have a &quot;success&quot; rate approximately twice  that of the students entering with high school GPA's below 70 percent. Spring entering classes do not differ appreciably from fall classes, nor do earlier entering classes differ significantly from more recent classes. After two semesters, the class entering in fall 1973 appears to be progressing at a somewhat slower rate than the classes entering in fall 1972 or fall 1971. The proportion of college level GPS's of 2.0 and above, after four semesters, has shown a steady increase from the class of 1970 to the class of 1972.

The purpose of the dialogue is to critique Skinner's &quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity.&quot; While actual quotes are incorporated into the text from the work of both psychologists, the overall organization of the statements as well as most of the wording is the author's. The paper contends that neither Skinner's philosophy of science nor his theory of man is tenable, although each offers interesting insights from a limited perspective. Piaget's work provides an understanding of science as a growing organization and reorganization of knowledge which occasionally induces qualitative shifts in people's domain of perception. Piaget's image of man is one of a  developing, integrating, and acting organism in dynamic exchange with its environment. The paper concludes by comparing the position of Piaget and Skinner with Douglas McGregor's conceptualization of Theory X and Theory Y. (CS)",

All schools participated in the full-day, alternate day program in the 1974 school year, which was used as the base year. The Metropolitan Readiness Tests, Form B, were used to measure school preparedness. Analysis of the data indicated that the full-day, alternate day programs did not hinder school readiness. Responses to a parent questionnaire supplied data on  the effectiveness of the program in meeting the physical, social, emotional, and instructional needs of the child.

The purpose of these interviews is to systematically study variations in the learning environments within the center and to develop a complete picture of the various relationships within the classroom environments. The children's interview is made up of open-ended questions about the child's activities in the classroom, the teacher's activities, and some of the child's feelings about the social interactions in the classroom. The parent's interview (which makes up approximately one-half of the document) is aimed at  a description and understanding of the parent's understanding of what is happening in the classroom, and the degree of parental involvement and support for the teacher. The teacher's interview focuses on classroom activities, diagnostic materials, student-peer interaction, classroom problems, teacher's goals, teacher's relationships with parents and community, knowledge of child development, and changes in the classroom over time.

The findings reveal that children from small families secured higher scores on all nine skill areas of the Iowa Test of Preschool Development. However, only in expressive language were the differences of statistical significance. The findings were reviewed in the context of other research which suggests that poor children may experience greater difficulty on oral language tasks than is the case on measures which emphasize receptive language. It is suggested that replication studies are needed to better assess the long-term social and educational implication of the  findings. (Author/CS)",

An implication is made that &quot;all&quot; American children reflect cultural group diversity. It is recommended that early childhood educational programs should be available to all children and reflect their unique backgrounds and needs. Research is needed to identify the specific ethnic values that have served both in an historical and contemporary way to engender positive group identity. It is also necessary to discover effective methods of transmitting these values to young children in an early educational setting. Finally, a question is posed concerning the impact on the interpersonal relationships within  the family that may result from the preschool child's participation in an ethnic-oriented learning environment.

In the second experiment, kindergarteners learned to associate letter names with six lower-case printed letters by the anticipation method. The addition of an active-kinesthetic training component led to performance inferior to that following purely visual or passive-kinesthetic training. The final two experiments, in which nursery school and kindergarten children were studied, compared tactile-kinesthetic training and visual discrimination training on the ability to reproduce and to discriminate letters and letter-like forms. Training effects were \"specific,\" in that discrimination training aided  performance on the discrimination posttest, and reproduction training performance. In addition, the effects of discrimination training were seen on untrained as well as trained forms, but reproduction training effects were limited to trained forms. The results of these experiments did not strongly support the claims that have been made for tactile-kinesthetic training techniques by designers of a variety of remedial programs in reading.

Subjects were 106, 4-year-old children and their parents who participated in a compensatory preschool intervention program. The program consisted of two major elements: (1) an early education program for the children, conducted in a classroom setting five mornings per week; and (2) a parent participation and education component. Participants' racial-ethnic backgrounds were Mexican-American, black American, Yacqui Indian, and Anglo.

For this purpose, scaled batteries to assess the level of conceptual development of children, kindergarten through high school, were constructed and a cross sectional/longitudinal study was begun in 1972-73. Four batteries are used in the study, one each for the following concepts: equilateral triangle, noun, tree, and cutting tool. Each battery has seven subtests, one for each of the four levels and one for each of three uses of concepts. The subtests can be scored to determine whether an individual has attained each level and each use. In 1972-73, to start the study, 50 boys and 50  girls of each grade group (kindergarten, third, sixth, and ninth) were tested. Based on preliminary results, five critical predictions were tested: (1) concepts are attained at four successively higher levels in an invariant sequence; (2) the level of concept attainment varies among children of the same age; (3) various concepts are attained by the same children at different rates; (4) concepts learned at the successively higher levels are used in understanding supraordinate-subordinate relationships; and (5) having the name of the concept and its attributes facilitates attainment of the concept and its uses.

The three major premises of the review are: (1) that word meaning is conducive to empirical study, (2) that rules can be produced that apply to most word meanings, and (3) that human development has implications for the qualities shared by human word meanings. Four psychological approaches to word meaning are identified, discussed, and compared: behaviorist, signal-systems, cognitive, and linguistic. The various theories and empirical research findings which support each approach are examined in detail; common elements are summarized. Implications for research are suggested, and implications for early education (prereading), later  education (including reading), and testing are considered for each approach. (Author/ED)",

The findings reveal that blacks from small families achieved significantly higher scores on 3 of the 9 skill areas: Visual Memory, Expressive Language, and Expressive Concepts. The results were reviewed in the context of Inhelder-Piaget formulations concerning the early growth of the intellect, which provide a possible explanation of how intrafamily dynamics may depress the learning of black lower SES preschool children.

Differences in the status projections of 1966 youth (438 males and 486 females) and their 1972 counterparts (470 males and 448 females) were made on the basis of sex. Research objectives were to determine: (1) the nature and extent of patterns of change relative to educational status goals and (2) the influence of place of residence on change in educational status orientations. Compared by year, the educational orientations of male and female respondents were tabulated for five orientation dimensions (aspiration, expectation, goal deflection,  intensity of aspiration, and certainty of expectation) and for the same dimensions with reference to place of residence. Findings indicated that between 1966 and 1972: educational aspirations had significantly declined; the value placed on education had substantially declined; the certainty of achievement of educational expectations had lessened; the 1972 male respondents had experienced less incongruence between their educational aspirations and expectations than had 1972 females; and the downward change had persisted regardless of residence type.

        "description":"As part of a larger effort to determine marital and procreative trends in the South, an historical comparison was made of two samples of Northeast Alabama high school seniors. Similar questionnaires were group administered to all seniors present on the prescribed contact day in 19 randomly selected high schools in 1966 and again in 1972. The study population was predominantly white residing in rural areas and small towns (Cherokee, DeKalb, Jackson, and Marshall Counties). Questionnaire items included the following components: (1) Desired age at marriage; (2) Desired number of children; (3) Desires as to wife working after marriage; (4) Attitude toward women working with no small children in the family; (5) Importance of marriage and family in the value structure; and (6) Attitude  toward a mother working if the family could use the money for necessities. Findings indicated that the attitudes of youth in the more current of the two samples were different from their predecessors on most variables considered, as they were oriented toward younger marriages and smaller families, and they accepted and approved the working wife and mother. It was found that the acceptance of urbanized attitudes and values was widespread, and it was projected that this will continue to be the case, particularly as additional employment opportunities for women develop in rural areas.

Such a perspective and such a process might be labeled &quot;rural renaissance&quot;, for as perspective, it gives priority to the view of the farming family, and as process, it draws initiative and energy from that same family. Rural renaissance, then, may be defined as the marriage between traditional patterns (values, norms, technologies, and behavior) and those innovative patterns which result in the birth of change. Since values and beliefs vary from one social system to another,  interaction between a rural renaissance stimulation system (outsiders) and a rural renaissance acquisition system (insiders) should facilitate positive change, if consideration is given by both outsiders and insiders to questions of appropriate organization, doctrine, leadership, programs, resources, and linkage systems. The larger rural renaissance stimulation system, then, would be a world wide network of interacting people who are able to learn from each other in the universal quest for improvement of the human condition.

Success in achieving these aims will depend partly on the Chicano's uniqueness as a multinational person. Mexico's presence is of utmost importance for this endeavor. However, having a former homeland adjacent has not provided an example or inspiration to Chicanos for overcoming their problems in the United States. Mexico has offered the Mexican American very little direct assistance toward attaining his aims since the average Mexican is also poverty-stricken and preoccupied with physical survival, his government is largely disinterested in Mexican Americans, and the inter-American political scene is not conducive to intervention in the northern neighbors' affairs. Furthermore, the  Chicano has not seriously sought the republic's direct support. Handicapped by low educational attainment and depressed conditions in health, housing, employment, and political influence, Mexican Americans tend to be preoccupied with local problems and programs. Yet, Mexico represents a cultural image or symbol on which the Chicano can anchor his Hispanic-mestizo personality. The Chicano can utilize his cross-national identity as a counterpoise between Anglo America and Latin America. Therefore, Mexican Americans should initiate a new and more positive association with Mexico and other Latin American republics. (NQ)",

Among its activities were to: establish a career ladder specifically designed to train and promote Indian personnel; assist the Lummis to define their needs and goals, to participate in the planning and development of a community-wide social welfare program, and to use local, state, and Federal systems to their optimal advantage; serve as an interpreter and catalyst in helping social agencies in the larger community to better appreciate and understand the Indian community; and promote a  recognition and understanding of Indian values in the delivery of welfare services. The project was evaluated by documenting activity patterns and results and by subjective observation, coupled with selected findings from a comparison study of a similar Indian population without comparable project resources. Some findings were: (1) locating an office on the reservation resulted in increased usage of available departmental services, more contacts per case, and more rapid caseload change; and (2) involvement of tribal representatives with project staff gave Indians additional opportunities to cope with bureaucratic systems in meeting their needs.

A panel of seven judges, all of whom were Mississippi Choctaw Indians and Bureau of Indian Affairs or Tribal administrators, were asked to rank 94 occupation titles (derived from a sample of Choctaw high school students who had previously indicated that these titles reflected their: occupational aspirations or expectations, parent's aspirations for them, and role model's or family breadwinner's occupations). Working  independently, each panel member ranked the positions from low to high using the criteria of education, responsibility, attractiveness, reward, security, and general prestige. When compared via an analysis variance test with the prestige scores of matching occupation titles in the Duncan Socioeconomic Index, the index revealed significant differences. The product moment correlation (.78) was lower than would be expected between a subsociety and its dominant society. Considerations of occupation relevance and accessibility and the Choctaw cultural isolation seem to have influenced the variations found. (JC)",

Respondents were asked to rate 10 goal block items on a 1 to 4 scale. These 10 items were ranked according to total scores and percents of possible high scores for each item. Utilizing 1966 data, perceived occupational goal block scores for three sample subsets (race, sex, and residence) were computed and then compared with scores of the total sample. In order to see how all respondents rated goal blocks by type and to see if the same relationship held for each of the subset samples, the 10 item list was grouped into three categories (Personal, Enabling, and Structural). Additionally, the  relationship between perceived occupational goal blocks and occupational goal deflection (determined via comparison of 1966 and 1972 data) were examined. Findings indicated that perception of goal blocks varied for different groups and by goal types, and that no relationship existed between occupational goal deflection and perceived occupational goal blocks. Race appeared to be the most consistent differentiating factor, for blacks perceived Personal goal block items as critical, 75 percent perceiving their own intelligence as a negative factor in terms of desired occupation.

        "description":"The Four Corners Mobile Library Project is a cooperative project between the Four Corners Regional Commission and the Arizona Department of Library and Archives. Ending its third year of operation, the project has proven to be a valuable adjunct to the somewhat meager educational and recreational resources available to the residents of this region. This has been shown by the constant increase in the amount of materials borrowed. During 1972-73, there were 2 bookmobiles in operation. This allowed an increased number of stops and a continued expansion and improvement of the overall program. This final report discusses the project's activities during 1972-73. Topics covered include the project's physical facilities, staff activities, collections, circulation, special programs,  communications, public relations and publicity, consultant services, fiscal information, and developments. The appendices include publicity samples, circulation statistics, fiscal report, inventory of equipment, and samples of bookmobile schedules. (NQ)",

        "description":"SHE is a rural California home building corporation founded on the principles of self-help. Lacking sufficient capital to purchase or finance a home by conventional means, a low-income family may elect to &quot;self-construct with SHE&quot;. A participant family agrees to invest its labor, up to 1,500 hours, in the supervised construction of its own home and those of other participant families in its building group. This investment is accepted in lieu of, and taken in trade for, an equity in the completed home. Equity accrued is of 2 types: (1) &quot;sweat equity&quot;, paid for in physical labor and (2) &quot;enterprise equity&quot;, a result of any managerial function in the housing process. Both are considered to have equal cash value. A group of 8 to 12 participant families attend a lengthy series of  meetings over a span of several months prior to the breaking of ground. A self-help home calls for long-term financial obligation and many hours of labor. Therefore, recruitment focuses on those who possess both the will to attempt and the strength to continue. The oldest, largest, most abundantly successful effort of its kind in the U.S., SHE is now entering its 10th year of operation. This paper presents a narrative history of the programs, philosophy, and people involved in SHE. A table of funding sources and a family progress report are also included. (NQ)",

Using group administered questionnaires, whenever possible, 5,396 students were interviewed in 42 randomly selected high schools which were stratified by color of students and size of the 10th grade in 1966-67. Due to lack of resources, the 2nd contact (made in 1972-73 and involving 3,122 students) was derived from 14 of the original schools and 2 private schools and as close as possible approximated the original sample. Student responses were analyzed in terms of historical change for black and white, male and female: (1) educational aspirations; (2) educational expectations; (3) certainty of educational expectations; and (4) intensity of educational aspirations.  Significant findings indicated: a marked increase in aspirations to attend a vocational or technical school among both black and white males; a slight increase in positive goal deflection and a more pronounced decrease in negative goal deflection (expectation lower than aspiration) in all categories of students; a decrease in the proportion of students who ranked education of high importance (all categories of students); and an increase in the proportion of students who ranked education low among both color and sex groups.

Specific Objectives were to: indicate competiveness between migrants and residents for new jobs; estimate the proportion of jobs which directly reduced poverty; estimate changes in employees' salaries and lifetime earnings; and estimate the local sphere of influence of job development in the labor market. In the areas studied, 25 percent of the employees in each of 26 plants were interviewed. Via cross tabulations and mean calculations, data on the study areas were analyzed relative to: (1) wage and salary employment in private nonfarm industries for 1962, 1965, and 1968  with percent of change; (2) employee residential classifications during 1965-70; (3) household income and salary rate by poverty status for 1970; (4) selected socioeconomic employee characteristics for 1970; (5) gross individual benefits from job development; and (6) employee commuting distances in 1970. Findings indicated: about 25 percent of all plant jobs in 1970 were held by employees whose households had been poor; about 16 percent of the total jobs were held by persons whose households had escaped poverty by 1970; and discounted value of the increase in employees' salaries was $12,880, but job impact varied considerably by area.

Thirty-one empirical generalizations were derived from the documents studied and then weighed against the following federally supported policy goals: (1) achieve a more balanced population distribution; (2) decrease the percentage of families below the poverty level; (3) achieve greater equality of income; (4) reduce unemployment; and (5) upgrade the quality and availability of basic services. The following were among 13 statements generated from comparison of the generalizations with public policy:  (1) public money is not needed to induce industrial migration but is needed perhaps to guide industry toward publicly beneficial site selection; (2) low skill, low wage industries should be encouraged to locate where there is a surplus of low skill labor; (3) to prevent residents from being bypassed by industrially generated employment, training programs should be established and antidiscrimination laws should be enforced; and (4) small towns should be carefully selected so that funds are not dissipated on areas with little self-generation growth potential.

Between December 1971 and June 1972, data were collected on 1,059 males via questionnaires administered to either the manager or personnel manager of each of 6 Wyoming uranium operations and via questionnaires taken to county Employment Security Commission offices in the study areas. Utilizing tabular techniques of analysis, the  following variables were analyzed: type of job held, earnings, tenure, formal education, vocational-technical training, age, racial-ethnic classification, industrial and occupational category of last job, and previous place of residence. Findings indicated that the Wyoming uranium industry had: a high employee turnover, favorable median employee earnings, little need for formal education, and inadequate long term information relative to the projected decline in uranium industry. Broader training of young men and retraining of middle-aged men were recommended, therefore. (JC)",

Selected data from the 1970 U.S. Census on persons of Spanish Origin was analyzed in this report. Detailed socioeconomic information on the 3 largest Spanish subgroups in the U.S.--Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans,  and Cuban Americans--was obtained from U.S. Census Bureau publications based on tabulations from the 1970 Census. The analysis of national and local data focused on such characteristics as immigration and in-migration, geographic and age distributions, nativity, family sturucture, education, employment, income, and poverty.

Interviews were conducted with citizens of the Indian community; local, State, and Federal officials; educators; officials from private agencies; and other resource persons. The Advisory Committee found that Native Americans were afflicted with much of the cultural, social, and  economic damage felt by other minority groups. Their situation was complicated by the Federal Government's failure to honor treaty obligations and statutory responsibilities. Among its other findings were: (1) Indian-oriented programs which have had a beneficial impact on the administration of justice, especially the Legal Rights Center, Inc. and the St. Paul American Indian Movement (AIM) patrol, ran the risk of discontinued funding; (2) the dropout rate for Native American students was significantly higher than for students of other races; and (3) at all levels of government employment, Indians held the lower paying positions.

Since their families move so often, these children are never in one school long enough to have a chance to really learn. Complicating matters, many of them can't speak English. Congress recognized the migrant child's special educational needs in November 1966 when it amended the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title I, giving the U.S. Office of Education (USOE) authority and funds to improve the educational programs and offer supplementary services for the migrant child. Today, Title I serves approximately 400,000 children at a cost of over $90 million. In 1974, the use of the Migrant Student Record Transfer System was authorized to trace the whereabouts of each child as he migrates  from one harvest to another. Although progress has been significant since the enactment of the 1966 amendment, USOE is constantly seeking new and better ways to help the migrant child move out of the fields and into more rewarding occupations. Among its future plans are: (1) a career education program for K-12 and (2) endorsement of interstate cooperation. As more and more migrants leave the stream, the migrant education program will focus more on the 5-year-old child--the child who stays in one spot but still needs special help. (NQ)",

        "description":"School districts are compelled by the 1964 Civil Rights Act Title VI to provide special language programs for those children speaking a non-English native language and belonging to an identifiable minority group, generally of low socioeconomic status, including Mexican Americans, Native Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Asian Americans. The form such assistance should take is the subject of debate among educators, concerned language minority parents, and others. The most widely discussed approach is bilingual bicultural education. In this report, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights examines the extent to which this approach is an effective educational approach for increasing these students' opportunities. Due to the commission's civil rights jurisdiction, the report concentrates  primarily on bilingual bicultural education as a means for overcoming a denial of equal educational opportunity. For comparative purposes, the English as a Second Language (ESL) approach which for many years has been the only special program used to teach these students English is examined. Educational principles underlying bilingual bicultural education are discussed. To clarify what bilingual bicultural programs are and how they work, selected programs are described. Information is provided on evaluation procedures for such programs. Federal and State policy on bilingual education is also discussed. (NQ)",

Female homemakers between the ages of 18 and 65 with children in the household were interviewed during 1970-71 and were asked if any in the family were sick all the time or were in any way disabled. Findings indicated there were no consistent patterns in metropolitan and  nonmetropolitan differences but that: metropolitan samples had higher family disability index means in the lowest educational levels, while nonmetropolitan samples had higher means in the highest educational levels; when income levels were controlled, metropolitan family disability index scores were higher than those of nonmetropolitan families; and when size of family was controlled, family disability index scores for metropolitan samples at the first level of family size were lower than those of nonmetropolitan samples in two out of three cases.

        "description":"Originally a federally-funded organization created to serve migrant families in the 16 counties of Western Kansas, the Kansas Council of Agricultural Workers and Low-Income Families (KCAW-LIF) marked the first major effort to cope with the problems of migrant life by providing basic services at public cost. A survey of 245 migrant families was conducted from June through August 1972 in 10 of the 16 counties served by KCAW-LIF. Farmworkers were classified as seasonal, farm, and nonfarm residents. The analysis unit was the family; the family's principle breadwinner was interviewed. Since Chicanos comprised the largest segment of migrants, those interviewed were Mexican American. A questionnaire designed in English and Spanish was administered to obtain data concerning: citizenship,  family size, education, language facility, religion, settling out, living and working conditions, service availability, and basic migrant attitudes about services. Interviewers were 14 local bilingual Chicanos with experience as farmworkers in the survey area. Some findings were: (1) jobs and legal services were most often cited as being needed; (2) more families knew of the availability of services than had actually used them; and (3) 57.9 percent of the migrant families indicated that they would settle out in Kansas if permanent work were available, and 37.7 percent said they would not settle out in Kansas.

Sixteen Indian law students, assisted by 8 Indian lawyers, worked on 17 different Indian reservations during the summer of 1974. Generally working on their own reservations, students performed an objective and systematic evaluation of each tribal government, assisted tribal governments in forming remedial objectives, and prepared substantive research reports. The research reports focused on the following areas: (1) tribal governing structure; (2) economic development of tribal resources and the tribal governing structure; (3) tribal court structure; (4) administration of governing services;  (5) relationship of tribal government structure to the Bureau of Indian Affairs; and (6) the Indian Civil Rights Act and the Federal Government. While specific recommendations proved unrealistic due to the diverse complexity of individual tribes, broad recommendations included: (1) establishment of a tribal resource center for purposes of providing technical assistance in developing and exercising governing powers and (2) development of evaluation standards by which various agencies and individual tribal governments might be effectively evaluated.

Although found throughout the U.S., nearly two-thirds live in the states of Oklahoma, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Alaska (including Eskimos and Aleuts), North Carolina, South Dakota, and Washington. While in 1930 only 10 percent of the Indians lived in urban areas, by 1970 45 percent lived in urban areas. Selected data from the 1970 U.S. Census were analyzed in this report. Detailed socioeconomic information by urban and rural residence was obtained from publications of the U.S. Census Bureau based on tabulations from the 1970 Census. Since data for Aleuts and Eskimos were not available in the 1970 Census, a data profile was derived from data on other races residing in Alaska. The analysis  consisted of national and local data focusing on such population characteristics as family structure, education, employment, income, poverty, housing, sanitation, and health. Data from selected local areas were analyzed to highlight only those situations where local data varied markedly from or were otherwise notable in comparison to the national data. Problems such as rural isolation, language, self-identification, definitions of race and residence, and cultural factors which contributed to the Census undercount were discussed. (NQ)",

Via a comparison of the distribution of outlays for these categories with the distribution of the total population across the 10 county group, insights into the comparative benefits of the total package of Federal programs are provided. A comparison of outlay distributions for individual programs across the  urban-to-rural continuum with the distribution of target groups for specific programs is also provided, along with measurement of per capita Federal outlays among declining and fast-growing and low and high income counties. Presented via tabular and narrative form, this report indicates: $192 billion of the $249 billion in total Federal outlays for fiscal year 1972 were spent on the 209 rural programs; rural areas received 24.7 percent of all outlays, though they constituted 27.2 percent of the population; and total outlays favored fast-growing, high income counties.

The National Committee on the Education of Migrant Children (NCEMC) maintains that it is unwise to assume mere existence of UMSRTS either validates the system or assures its usefulness as an educational tool. The committee raises serious questions relative to: UMSRTS's detraction from development of other needed programs; its cost-effectiveness; the value of its information; evidence of its benefit, harm, or usefulness to both the child and the educational system; violation of the right to privacy; parental  evaluation of data input. A recent study authorized by Congress has indicated that while the system has not worked well technically, a majority of the schools enrolled in the system have found it useful. However, a sizeable number of teachers in those same schools did not find it useful or were reluctant to rely on another's assessment of their students. The committee maintains serious reservations about the present and potential use of UMSRTS, urging extreme security relative to the right of privacy, staff development as a first priority, and further evaluation of UMSRTS.

Three broad areas of concern were explored: (1) the sociological, philosophical, and demographic features of American life in the context of history and political science as related to general educational trends and the cooperative regional approach; (2) the rationale, purpose, organization, and the financial and physical aspects of cooperative regional centers; (3) various denominational needs and solutions via cooperative  action. Among the specific areas explored were: curricular services, administrative services, personnel services, pupil personnel services and special education, mobile services, library programs and services, audiovisual programs and services, telecommunications, and instructional and educational television. Confined generally to the U.S., the study developed specific recommendations for Michigan, Northern California, and Nebraska. Detailed recommendations focusing on economic utilization of resources and organic organization were developed for the Seventh Day Adventist church. (JC)",

Of the total 159 past and present participants, 105 or 66 percent responded to survey questions designed to elicit responses relative to the: program's relationship to grassroots determination of educational priorities and noneducation programs; need for such programs as compared to the availability of other programs; cost-effectiveness factors; professional advancements, salaries, and contributions of program  graduates; types of institutional support found at the campuses. Findings indicated: 88 students had completed the Master's Degree, 7 the Educational Doctor's Degree, and 1 the Ph.D.; significant increases in salaries and responsibilities; significant concern among professors, administrators, and students about program funding and direction; greatest program successes were at Harvard (70.2 percent completion) and Penn State (64.1 percent completion). Recommendations emphasized program continuance, improved funding procedures, and the need for a program director. (JC)",

This evaluation represents data derived from program participant questionnaires; onsite visits; personal interviews (students, directors, professors, and administrators); program records; and community opinionnnaires. Data are depicted via 24 graphs per institution and are representative of a 66 percent student response among 159 students involved in the program since 1970. The survey instruments, which are appended, represent: (1) student responses to questions on academic completion, present participant service to Native Americans, service usefulness, participant evaluation of training, need for  program, recruitment method, selection process, salary benefits, level of responsibility, leadership positions, curriculum, outcomes (degrees and certification), and personal data; (2) administrator responses to questions on organizational structure, institutional support, admission criteria, selection process, per pupil and administrative costs, data on graduates, specific problems, special program features, and certification of Indian blood; and (3) community responses to questions on tribal awareness, tribal educational needs, other more suitable available programs, funding, priorities, and program impact.

One major purpose of the survey was to identify the principal strategies used to introduce environmental education to the school programs. The two most popular methods being used nationwide were integration and course addition. Different questionnaires for grades K-6 and 7-12 were developed and distributed throughout the state. The results of the survey indicated that integration was used most often in both elementary and secondary schools; however, the degree to which this method was utilized decreased in the higher grade levels where more course offerings were available. Also, it was found that the environmental education  programs were primarily science oriented, at both the elementary and secondary levels. Recommendations included the need for more integration of the social, political, and aesthetic aspects of environmental education, as well as for more inservice teacher preparation and dissemination of information on existing environmental education materials.

Students enrolled in a required course, Physical Science for Elementary Teachers, were the participants and were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Group 1 received an investigator-developed comparative advance organizer prior to instruction in the metric system; group 2, an investigator-written historical account of its development; and group 3 received no prior instruction and was used for control purposes only. All participants within  each group were subdivided according to ability and cognitive structure. The McFee Metric Test, the instrument used as a pretest, the study of experimental introductory passages, participation in learning activities, posttesting, and delayed posttesting were incorporated into the study. A 2 x 3 analysis of variance was used and when significant F ratios were obtained, the Scheffe Test was used in a post hoc partitioning of the sum-of-squares. Results suggested that the comparative advance organizers have potential that needs to be more fully utilized. (Author/EB)",

Such materials included television advertisements, brochures, journal articles and feature stories, and ads for radio and newspaper. To validate the results of the project, it was developed as a quasi-experiment.

Sixty first-grade children were administered Piaget's stick seriation task and classified as stage I (non-seriators) and stage III (seriators). From this group 24 were chosen and assigned to strategy treatment groups. Treatment group one, Extreme Value Selection Strategy (EVS), was taught to seriate the materials using a strategy which focused on choosing the greatest element from the unordered elements and placing it next in the row until all objects were in order. Treatment two, Insertion Strategy (INS), was taught to seriate by choosing randomly and then placing in proper position. Treatment group three, the control (CON), simply practiced the  seriation task with feedback on correction. Groups were taught in three separate sessions. Data were collected on number of trials to criterion which was defined as the successful completion of the task using the exact strategy taught. A Kendall's Tau correlation was computed on posttest results to judge the degree of correctness for each task. Multivariate analysis indicated significant differences (p less than .05) with the EVS strategy group's mean scores superior to the INS or CON groups, and the INS group superior to the CON group. Analysis of trials to criterion (TTC) data showed no difference between stage I and stage III children. (Author/EB)",

        "author":["Bedwell, Lance E."],
        "description":"After participating in an inservice workshop designed to improve question-asking skills, nine teachers conducted discussion lessons based on science history stories selected from a fourth-grade reading series. Pupils within each class were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group participated in discussion lessons that involved the extensive use of high level questions by the teacher. The second group's teachers used a preponderance of low level questions. Effects were evaluated using three lesson posttests which measured achievement at six levels of cognition and a measure to determine student attitudes toward the instruction and subject matter. Interpretation of the data analyzed showed it was possible to train teachers to classify and to write questions according to  cognitive level using the procedures of the study, and to raise the cognitive level of their class discussions. Analysis of tape recordings produced before and after the workshop supported this conclusion. The different level of questioning did not seem to effect greater student achievement or more positive attitude. (Author/EB)",

This publication is the result of a study to determine the feasibility of teaching scientific concepts related to the social and historical developments of science and selected concepts related to atomic energy. Presented in this section is a consideration of the scientist and his work toward a more sensible administration of atomic energy, as well as some of the benefits and risks of using atomic energy, and the products of atomic energy and what they may have in store for the future. Chapters 11 and 12 are included as well as a narrative quote source list and bibliography. An extensive teacher's guide,  giving points to consider and teaching suggestions for each chapter, is included in the manuscript. An annotated bibliography of films used in the unit, available from the Atomic Energy Commission, is presented along with slide narratives. (EB)",

        "description":"This study compares the mathematics achievement and attitude toward mathematics of preservice and experienced elementary school teachers. The research population included teachers from public and private colleges throughout the state of Texas and inservice teachers from suburban communities in the Houston area. Subjects were given an experimenter-designed personal information questionnaire, the Stanford Achievement Test (1974 Advanced Battery, Form X), and the Revised Math Attitude Scale developed by Aiken and Dreger. Findings indicated that prospective and experienced teachers did not differ on overall mathematics achievement, but that experienced teachers performed better on the applications subscale (p less than .01). In addition, experienced teachers had a slightly more  positive attitude toward mathematics (p less than .01). Among preservice teachers, mathematics achievement and attitude toward mathematics were higher for those attending private, rather than public, institutions. In both groups, individuals teaching (or planning to teach) grades 4-6 exhibited more favorable attitudes toward mathematics than those preferring to teach K-3. Other findings relate to mathematics background of teachers and size of high school graduating class. The author compares his data with university mathematics requirements, and recommends that the Level recommendations of the Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics be adopted. (SD)",

Students in grades 2-12, college students concentrating in mathematics, teacher preparation, and other subjects, as well as practicing female mathematicians participated in the survey. Data were analyzed to determine sex differences and apparent trends. Many of the findings replicate or extend those of other studies, some of which are cited in the report (e.g., Carnegie Commission Report on Opportunities for Women in Mathematics). An unexpected result is the apparent agreement between sexes concerning liking for mathematics; this agreement is shown to persist throughout the populations considered. The authors cite testimony from other studies and  from women mathematicians concerning the issues involved in motivating women to study mathematics. They conclude that recruitment of women into mathematics courses, especially at the college level, is mandatory. (SD)",

Conference participants examined the rationale for including human values as an area of study in health professional education, the process by which this kind of teaching can be accomplished successfully, and the context in which human values programs can develop optimally. Presentations are included from five small discussion groups, each led by a consultant who had been selected for his acknowledged expertise. The first centers on the role of medical history in the education of the humanist physician, offering some suggestions on how medical history should be taught. The second centers on why philosphy  should be a part of health professional education. The third defines religious studies in the context of health professional education. The fourth examines law and medicine, the myths and realities in the medical school classroom. The author points out that everything a doctor does in the field of medicine is related in some manner to the legal system, and doctors should become more aware of those aspects.

Four major areas are examined in the fellowship reports. The first deals with values, their formation and dimensions; literature and language in relation to value formation and health care; attitudes, feelings, and values in educating a medical student; and observations on the learning of values in a clinical context. The second area involves the study of ethical issues in medicine, international health,  philosophy, and law. Interdisciplinary studies is the focus of the third section of reports. The relations between psychiatry, law, sociology, and health care are exposed. Another report examines participation in an experimental program relating humanistic studies to a premedical curriculum.

The questions included are drawn from American national samples (primarily of the general population) conducted by AIPO (Gallup) NORC, and Roper, and archived at the Roper Public Opinion Research Center. The basic data for over 90 percent of the surveys cited are available only from the Roper Center. The earliest survey included in this index was undertaken in September, 1936, and the most recent survey in October, 1973. The purpose of the index is to make accessible a data base for the measurement and analysis of social change. Seventy major topics comprised of specific research questions range from agricultural farm income trends to Americans' attitudes toward  Yugoslavia. Each entry consists of the question wording, the survey organization which asked the question, the number and date of the survey, and the number of the question. As an aid to researchers undertaking secondary analysis of survey data, Norval D. Glenn has written a guide to survey archive research. Also included are a list of publications on the study of social change using survey data from the Roper Center; a summary of the procedures used in compiling the index; and information on code categories for demographic background question and changes in survey sampling procedures.

        "description":"The study reported in this newsletter looked closely at one community, a city school district in a northeastern state, where the pace of change in public schools was especially rapid and unusual over a seven-year period (1965-72). The purpose was to find out, through interviewing, the thoughts of a selected number of informed individuals and families concerning the school district and the changes taking place. The oral history method of asking open-ended questions and encouraging freedom of response was adhered to. Interviews covered questions on leadership from the superintendent and other sources, causes for change, effects of changes, the innovative elementary school and alternative junior high school, and communication. A comparison of views of the two groups resulted in  findings that suggest strategies for educational planners. These suggestions include a need for (1) assuming a general acceptance of alternatives, (2) careful prior planning, (3) carefully defining and setting of goals, (4) considering the interests of all consumers, (5) using school board meetings as communication agency, (6) maintaining a balance in any change process, (7) financing changes, (8) professional and educational change, and (9) providing an environment conducive to change.

These exercises provide a basis for analysis of the discrepant data teaching procedures in which various media are used to lead students to make certain expectations or generalizations. Students are then presented with additional data which show that these expectations do not always hold true. In attempting to explain the differences, students recognize that they can overlook certain data because of personal biases or stereotypes. The kit is divided into five exercises including (1) An Exercise About Three Neighborhoods in New Orleans, (2) Clarification of the Discrepant  Data Teaching Procedure, (3) Analysis of an Exercise About the Cultural Characteristics of Cities, (4) Analysis of the Video Tape, and (5) Classroom Application.

Formulated by several psychologists, the experiment is an off-shoot of a conference on alternative communities held in Racine, Wisconsin, in 1966. The community centers around an educational strategy that would rear children from birth and show how their academic, social, and emotional development could be accelerated. Some major problems encountered were conflicts among individuals and cliques, cultural separation of the youth and elders, financial difficulties due to withdrawal of grants and other funding, and difficulty in determining a purpose and meaning of the community satisfactory to all and possible to live by. The original community  dissolved from the magnification of tensions; however, another communal group formed around child care needs, developing into a seemingly more stable community. A description of the school, called the Learning Village, is included. It has four divisions: infant program, nursery program, pre-elementary program, and elementary school up to the second grade. In general, the Learning Village program appears successful despite the difficulties experienced. (ND)",

First, a series of basic strategies we call exploring strategies, choosing strategies, focusing strategies, and linking strategies are organized around several fundamental value issues: cooperation, respect, self-awareness, achievement, and celebration. The second set of strategies, for specific value issues and value-laden settings, are organizaed around several special YMCA settings: an overnight, the Christmas holidays, camping, coaching, and the international  scene. Finally the subject of alcohol use and abuse is dealt with through a series of strategies.

Each department developed its own unique program based on the overall objective. The report is divided into three parts. Part one provides an introduction to the background and purpose of the project. Part two provides recommendations on geographic education as the master framework for teaching innovation, student participation,  intended learner outcomes, management models, exploration models, and sharing and delegating authority to be used by future directors of local training programs. Part three provides recommendations for structuring and making a workable national system. Appendices include the individual reports upon which the recommendations are based. (Author/DE)",

Chapter one of the document attempts to define law-related  education; chapter two is concerned with project structure and administration; and chapter three deals with teaching and learning providing guidelines for educational goals, teacher training, curriculum and materials development and program evaluation. Funding is the primary concern of the fourth chapter which includes recommended guidelines for funding. Chapter five deals with the future of law-related education.

As a result of this education, the new Afro-American would merit and gain white America's respect and acceptance by proving his moral worth. However, the abolitionists' notion of education for acculturation was restricted from the beginning of their crusade. Through their moral reform efforts, abolitionists aimed to educate former slaves to dominant, white, Protestant values and patterns of behavior. Their understanding of acculturation did not include fundamentally changing the social structural participation of free blacks within the dominant  American institutions. In addition, acculturation through educational programs meant the development of attitudes and values consistent with lower class working and living patterns. Little was done by the abolitionists to educate whites concerning the equal capacity of blacks and the moral wrongness of slavery through home visitations or campaigns to educate teachers.

Due to the makeup of cadet population, the prejudices found among the members of that corps can serve as valid indicators of contemporary bourgeois attitudes in the United States. At the beginning of the period Jews, Indians, and Latin Americans enjoyed greater acceptance than they did from the mid-1820's onward. While tolerance for alien cultures was decreasing, sectional virulence grew, evolving from harmless teasing in the early 19th century to open violence by the late 1850's. Still, even with the increase in regional hostility,  intersectional friendships continued to exist. West Point attitudes toward religion throughout the antebellum era showed continued preference for the Protestant denominations, especially Episcopalian, while Catholicism gained somewhat grudging acceptance by the predominantly Protestant society.

        "description":"This bibliography complements an earlier &quot;Bibliography for Geographic Education,&quot; ED 092 435. The purpose of the bibliography is to provide a guide to the essential philosophical and methodologic literature in English treating the discipline of geography between 1950 and 1974. A useful reference for educators, students, curriculum developers, and professional geographers, the bibliography begins with an introduction in which the compiler gives a succinct overview of recent trends in geography. The bibliography cites books and articles separately, which are further categorized into nine sections: (1) Bibliographical; (2) Geography and Other Disciplines; (3) Geography in Various Countries; (4) Methodology in Geography; (5) Philosophy of Geography; (6) Professional Training; (7)  Quantitative Geography; (8) Subdisciplines of Geography; and (9) Theoretical Approaches. The arrangement with the categories is alphabetical by author. An addendum of recent books not found in the earlier edition concludes the document. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"In order to directly relate research on children's thinking to curriculum development in the social studies, this study approximates the conditions and substances of daily classroom life and examines the levels of abstraction in children's thinking about complex social problems. The subjects include 210 boys and girls in equal numbers in grades one through seven. The students interpret four magazine photographs depicting scenes of war, poverty, old age, and destruction. The results indicate that there is a direct relationship between levels of abstraction inferred from children's explanations of social problems and the age levels of the children. These levels of abstraction and age correspond to Piaget's stages of cognitive development. There is no significant effect of sex on  the level of abstraction, however, the abstraction levels differ according to the pictures. Results of this research imply a logic of curriculum development in both content and sequence which is not sufficiently applied at this time. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The question of whether foundations should engage in activities having a bearing on public policy development is discussed. Tax exempt private foundations have had a long, controversial history of participation in public policy formation. They contribute to policy development by means of various techniques that include support of established institutions to conduct policy-oriented research, investigation or analysis of issues with policy implications, conferences, partnerships with government on policy related issues, special research commissions, monitoring of governmental programs to assess their impact and effectiveness, and projects to inform citizens of their right to register and vote. Under the 1969 Tax Reform Act, foundations do have the legal right to participate in  public policy formation. At issue, however, is whether foundations tend to bring a set of values into play in their program determination and in making or withholding grants. However, no foundation, can be totally objective because the human beings who manage it have values and shape the foundation's collective judgment. Nevertheless, if the role is played conscientiously and is informed at every stage by candor, openness, and integrity, the public will accept the foundation and it will maintain a viable position in the shaping of public policy.

        "description":"The federal government is the primary source of funds for social research in the United States, and academic institutions are the primary focus of social research performed with federal funds. Five distinct purposes underlying federal support of academic social research and five associated funding patterns are hypothesized. Actual patterns are observed in data from 1,079 faculty members in the disciplines of anthropology, economics, political science, and psychology. Results indicate that federal allocations are consistent with patterns expected if the government's purpose is (1) acquisition of policy relevant research and (2) advancement of basic social science. Observed patterns are not consistent with patterns expected if the purpose is (3) enhancing state legitimacy, (4)  reproducing societal social relations, and (5) legitimizing the conduct of academic inquiry for the government. The impact of federal funding on the social science disciplines is examined in three areas. Significant influence is found in two of these -- research priorities and views of government discipline relations -- however, no observable impact is found in the discipline's social organization in the realm of academic promotion. It is concluded that a central government purpose in funding academic social research is production of research needed by government agencies and that this objective significantly shapes social science paradigms in the United States.

        "description":"While previous research has demonstrated a correspondence between measures of instructional content and psychological structure due to learning, this research report examines whether individual learner differences affect this correspondence. Individuals of the field independence psychological structure were expected to impose greater structure and experience concepts as discrete and organized, while individuals of the field dependence psychological structure would not impose structure but experience the concepts and their interrelationships as global and diffuse. Ninety-six students and 24 teachers divided evenly between field-independent and field-dependent structures provided the sample group. Results indicate that the field independent subjects configures the concepts of a  sample lesson identical to the model of content structure, while the field-dependent subjects did not. The implication for further research concerns the extent to which a teacher's or student's psychological structure affects his or her method of teaching or ability to understand and learn what is being taught.

The underlying assumption and concern of the book is that if international education is to improve, educators need to be more self-conscious of their own world view of international politics since the objectives teachers set for themselves and their students, the instructional strategies they employ, and the curriculum materials they choose are all conditioned by their images of the world. After an introduction, chapters 2-4 (1) present the research findings on preadult international learning in a concise fashion; (2) delineate frameworks for viewing the world in a way which will assist  educators in becoming more self-conscious about the images of the world which underlie their teaching; and (3) consider the problems and issues involved in systematically designing world studies programs that try to take account of preadult international learning and alternative world views. The appendix provides a bibliography on world studies and a set of \"Guidelines for World Studies.\" These guidelines list potential objectives for world studies and include checklists to assist teachers in choosing materials appropriate for their students and community setting.

An overview of international studies and language developments is given along with contrasts between needs and realities, showing that educational practice in this area is out-of-phase. Today, the situation is packaged learning, monothink, jargon, and methodological sophistry, creating irrelevant and inapplicable knowledge. Given a desire for reform and restructuring of education, language training efforts could reinforce and be more closely aligned with international studies. Reasons for promoting this are: (1) survival in an increasingly interdependent world, (2) humanitarian compassion and responsibility of the \"haves\" for the \"have-nots,\" (3)  need for shared brain-power for the intractable problems of mankind, and (4) educating children to appreciate a diversity of cultural expression. An assessment of the nature of the world and the United States' place in the family of nations illustrates the necessity of linking international studies and language training. Points of international studies where language proficiency are essential include area programs, teacher education, technical assistance projects, study abroad, foreign students, problem studies, disciplinary specialities, professional schools, and non-traditional programs.

The life style identified as modern is clearly multidimensional, yet three items -- power, segregation, and containment -- are chosen to study the fertility rates. The hypothesis is that in a family in which the husband makes the decisions (power), in which the wife's attitudes reflect perceptions of a highly differentiated set of sex roles (segregation), and in which the husband restricts the wife's activities (containment), then there will be high fertility due to the limited number of alternatives to the mother role. Data were collected in Ankara, Turkey in 1966 and Mexico City in 1971 by a 300 item questionnaire. The results support the  hypothesis.

The Black church is portrayed as an institution through which Blacks have worked to achieve social, economic, and political equality as well as spiritual guidance and social interaction. In the Colonial era the dominant purpose of having Blacks attend church was to condition them for their life in slavery. Yet after the Revolutionary War, Blacks in the north began to form their own churches to avoid the segregation and discrimination of white churches. Prior to the Civil War, the Black church was slowed considerably by whites fearing the Black church would incite slave revolts. After the Civil War and during the late 19th century, the Black church continued its fight against white discrimination and served as a  center for educational activities. Throughout the 20th century, the theme of the Black church has been civil rights for all Blacks. The 1960's and 1970's have seen the church actively increasing community involvement, and social and economic programs for Black Communities. Blacks turned to the church for leadership because they were severely separated from other social, political, and economic areas of American life. (Author/DE)",

In both courses students examine the changing norms, roles, role clusters, and socialization processes of family members in historical and contemporary contexts. The experimental design includes analyses of variance of posttest scores from 60 classes in three urban high schools. The results of standardized tests for evaluating students' attitudes toward their family  indicate no significant curriculum effects for either unit. The cognitive test results are strong and unambiguous in all schools despite the differences in socioeconomic characteristics and school climate.

This unit, for grades 1-9, focuses on Mexico's revolt against Spanish rule and highlights famous persons and events of the period. The materials can serve as a reference on Mexican historical events and patriotic commemorations in order that the teacher may have some information readily available for classroom use. Historical facts as well as activities for use in the classroom, in the school, or for community presentation are included. This book can be used as a general supplement to the Social Studies Strand of the Spanish Curricula Development Center materials. The unit is arranged in nine sections  according to either famous persons or events. Each section includes presentation of facts, a list of reasons for remembering the day, vocabulary, ways for teachers to highlight the facts, ideas for discussion, and activities. Suggestions for classroom activities include role playing, bulletin boards, reports, and time lines. The listing of commemoration dates is sequenced to allow teachers to plan the school calendar accordingly. (Author/JR)",

In the humanities, especially, there is another way of knowing -- unpredictable, unique, often capricious -- which works creatively through juxtaposition and synthesis and which cannot be measured accurately by objective tests. It is a type of perception often termed metaphoric, closely allied with creative insight, and approaches the authentic understanding and commitment desired by existentialist and humanistic educators. Once a teacher becomes accountable to the school, administration, or society, the rich metaphoric perception of the student  may be sacrificed for the measurable, objective behavior required by accountability -- and the awareness which arises from metaphoric perceptions which, while they must be expressed through measurable behavior, are not identified with it.

One successful technique is the use of the videotape as a teaching aid. Extension of the vote to the eighteen year old, failure of large numbers of students to exercise the franchise, emphasis on the recruitment of racial minorities, and a significant increase in the number of older students who are returning to the classroom are developments which require new methods to reach the \"new public.\" The videotape can be a useful aid in the teaching process, offering students increased access to political personalities, enabling students to learn  more about the specifics of their own immediate environment, enabling students to stay abreast of developing problems and solutions in state and local government, permitting additional material which is normally not covered in traditional textbooks to be brought to the attention of students, and adding a sense of realism to government policies. Two major problems with using the video tape as a supplemental teaching aid are inertia on the part of the faculty and obtaining institutional financial support. (Author/JR)",

Many states have issued framework guidelines for the various school branches and levels to provide teachers with orientation aids. Progressive educators see the goal of political and social studies as being more than just the imparting of knowledge via political, social, economic and legal institutions. They are more concerned with awakening interest in these things with the aid of a knowledge of interrelationships and events. The goal is the articulate citizen capable of criticism and thus the creation of the preconditions for democracy and further democratization. Two learning objectives developed by the state Northrhine-Westphalia are the ability  and willingness to think in terms of political alternatives, and the ability and willingness to work as a member of different social groups and to display open-mindedness. These objectives are to be associated directly with concrete teaching processes so that the school is a public showcase of a democratic institution. (Author/DE)",

Competencies identified have been based on reason, logic, and experience--all insufficient without empirical evidence. It seems that many accusations against C/PBTE are justified, and it is certainly true that C/PBTE has not yet demonstrated its superiority over other bases for teacher certification. Teaching is more than mastery of techniques. A large part of teaching is art, which does not easily lend itself to behavioral description. The major problem with the argument against C/PBTE is that there is no more factual basis for other teacher education programs than there is for C/PBTE programs. All teacher education  programs are based on armchair speculation, reason, logic, and experience. At present, C/PBTE proponents should make no claims for product criteria except in the sense that the product is teacher behavior. Teachers must be included in the essential steps of planning and evaluating C/PBTE programs. Also, research must be designed to funded to continue the validation process. (PB)",

        "description":"Ideas concerning the value of games and sports for school children changed gradually between 1780 and 1860. Although not always condemned by teachers, those activities were not considered part of school in the early period. Sports considered acceptable for nonschool hours were utilitarian activities such as hunting, fishing, field sports, boating, and swimming. After 1830, educators debated the merits of joining students in sports participation in order to provide moral guidance. Parents sent their children to private instructors in the community during nonschool hours in order to learn &quot;refined&quot; sports. By 1860 many sports were advocated as healthy, useful, and pleasurable physical activities for young boys. The need of physical activity for girls was also suggested, but sports  for girls were not strongly advocated by educators of the day. Many academies provided playgrounds and facilities for students to use during recess. A few schools provided special instructors for certain &quot;refined&quot; sports, and in a few schools faculty participated with their students in these activities. Sport clubs were organized in order to compete against other teams, but generally these sport clubs remained under student control until after 1860. The resistance to sports participation by children had decreased by 1860, but it was not until after the Civil War that educators began advocating the inclusion of sports in supervised physical education classes in New England schools.

In the third article, \"Physical Play--It's Vital,\" it is argued that physical education programs should not be too formal and should encourage students to use a variety of motor patterns.

Level 1 refers to assessments of the training experience, level 2 to assessments of the teacher's behavior, level 3 to assessments of pupil behavior, and level 4 to assessments of instruction. The diagram explains that level 4 is influenced by level 3, level 3 by level 2, and level 2 by level 1. It is explained that program decisions based on assessments were traditionally made at level 1. The validity of levels 2, 3, and 4 are then examined. It is held that level 2 is the level at which teaching should be evaluated. It becomes necessary, however, to determine competencies for this evaluation. The document presents a hierarchy of relevant competencies,  including broad concepts, general characteristics, and specific behavior items. Program evaluation is also examined, and the statement is made that it must be demonstrated that teacher education programs can produce the kinds of teacher behaviors which in turn produce more growth in pupils.

This program offeres an education to inmates, ex-offenders, correctional officers, and community members. It was established because (a) prisoners rejoin the community in about four years; (b) ex-offenders need new life patterns on release in order to break the cycle of crime and arrest; (c) confinement costs are high, and inmates are usually nonproductive; and (d) our current correctional system is not working. The union emphasizes teacher preparation (a) in order to address inequities of traditionally barring ex-offenders from teaching; (b) because ex-offenders often have special qualifications, particularly in relating to low socioeconomic class students; and  (c) so that preservice students will learn by teaching inmates who need to develop basic skills or pass high school equivalency tests. The program has demonstrated that (a) it can assist students to develop effective teaching skills, especially for problem learners; (b) students and inmates will be able to benefit their communities in needy areas; and (c) the program can succeed even within the constraints of the penal system.

Three factors formed the setting of the school district's staffing effort: (a) the constraint of available fiscal resources, (b) the constraint of priority on use of in-district personnel, and (c) the need for field-oriented RDD&amp;E personnel. In order to deal with the rising need for RDD&amp;E staff, university-based educational researchers are challenged to (a) pursue the  design and implementation of RDD&amp;E training programs heavily weighted with field-training experiences; (b) develop RDD&amp;E training programs at the undergraduate and master's degree levels, instead of heavily concentrated in the terminal degree programs; and (c) develop a modular training system expecially for inservice personnel. If large-scale RDD&amp;E programs are developed in the cities, with staff at all levels of expertise, personnel with basic skills could be made available to smaller districts unlikely to hire personnel with terminal degrees.

Social play and gemes have important socialization and identity-formation functions. One argument supporting highly competitive sports for children is that they provide additional play opportunities. In fact, organized sports may reduce play opportunities, by leading children away from free and spontaneous games. A second argument is that more highly skilled athletes result from highly competitive sports, although this does not seem to be true for team sports. A third argument is that organized sports are safer and healthier than the sandlot variety. There is considerable evidence, however, to support the conclusion  that highly competitive sports can be harmful both physiologically and psychologically. Lastly, it is argued that it is socially advantageous for children to learn to compete early. (PB)",

The effects of physical activity regimens on general growth, as well as quantitative and qualitative changes, in animal muscle and bone tissue have been clearly demonstrated. Less is known about the role of exercise and related metabolic factors in influencing morphological and functional changes in children. The significance of physical activity in controlling body weight and maintaining a healthy balance among the tissue components of growing children has been repeatedly demonstrated. Similarly, research has shown the positive effects of vigorous exercise regimens on muscular strength, muscular endurance, and physical working capacity of children. Recent  research points to a complex interaction of neural, hormonal, and metabolic factors in response to the stresses imposed by exercise--the effect on tissue and organ growth being a reflection of the nature, duration, and intensity of the exercise regimen as well as the maturational level and exercise tolerance of children. That certain, as yet underfined, levels of physical activity are essential to the normal growth and health of children would seem to be self-evident. Based on present knowledge, these levels will vary with the nature of the physical activity program and the functional capacity and maturational level of the child. (Author/PB)",

        "description":"The methodological aspects of the behavior analysis movement are often overlooked in favor of focusing on the powerful effects of rewards and punsihments used systematically in a behavior-modification paradigm. The methodological aspects are important for the topic of research on teaching because they create a situation where the teacher acts both as a data collector and a verifier of instructional strategies. Such behavior is referred to as analytic teaching. Each of the major behavior-analysis teaching models utilizes one of the following teaching approaches: (a) a precise description of behavior categories under consideration; (b) attention paid to specific relationships among the situations in which target behavior occurs, and the behavior and consequences which accrue to the  behavior; (c) continuous monitoring of the behavior; and (d) analysis of effects of the instructional variable. Analytic teaching requires the teacher to take an active role in educational decision making because the decisions are based on data collected by the teacher. This prevents the passivity that so often characterizes teaching in schools.

Not everyone has wanted to integrate minorities into their physical education and athletic programs, and now not all educators are accepting the broadening of ability levels within the classroom to include the handicapped. Research has not confirmed that children in special classes achieve better than comparable children in regular classes. Research has shown that a similarity of play interests exists between learning-disabled and normal children. While much research shows the mildly retarded child to be one to three years behind peers in motor performance, it is generally believed that many such differences are  environmentally caused. Often retarded school-age children have not received physical education instruction. It is thought that early integration of handicapped and normal children in good physical education programs will result in comparable motor skills for both groups. Lastly, research indicates that ability-segregated classes seem to have detrimental effects on both the feelings of exceptional children about themselves and of others toward them. The issue at hand is not mainstreaming in physical education, but humanizing all of education. (PB)",

It presents a history of the move toward decentralization, considers basic aspects of decentralization, discusses decentralization as it now exists in the U.S., and examines evidence concerning the success or failure of decentralization. The second article asserts that although curriculum-development decentralization has been included in almost all plans for school-system decentralization, there is need for further refinement of roles and services before the former can be achieved. The third article is a study of the impact of school-system decentralization on curriculum development.  It reveals that the trend toward administrative decentralization has accelerated during the past five years, and discusses some resultant effects. The fourth article examines how curriculum development has been affected by school-system decentralization in large cities, using New York City as an example. The fifth article discusses the Atlanta public school system's administrative decentralization and some of the problems it has had regarding instruction and curriculum development. The sixth article looks at the attempt to decentralize the Baltimore city public schools, and at some of the problems encountered.

        "description":"This study was developed to determine if changes in the extent of lifetime sports instruction had taken place in New York State secondary schools since 1967. The subjects of this study were 530 randomly selected New York State secondary schools. Schools were classified into the following three levels according to the number of pupils in grades 7-12: (a) small schools had a pupil population of under 300; (b) medium schools ranged in size from 300-999 pupils; and (c) large schools had 1,000 or more pupils. The sample consisted of one-third of the schools from each of the three classifications, and data was collected through the use of a questionnaire. Initial mailing and three followup letters produced a return of 83 percent. The results show that the instructional offerings in the  lifetime sports of golf, tennis, bowling, and badminton have declined significantly since 1967. Although some of the differences in instructional offerings between 1967 and 1974 may have resulted from sampling variations, it can still be concluded that lifetime sports programs are not any better than they were in 1967. These data suggest that physical education teachers and administrators are not, generally speaking, preparing their pupils well for adult participation in lifetime sports. (Author/JS)",

This booklet attempts to illustrate the value of this psychology in education, not as a complete substitute for traditional educational psychologies, but working in conjunction with them. The first section, &quot;Current Classroom Application,&quot; discusses the following ways of shifting the focus from external to internal awareness: relaxation and concentration, guided fantasy, and creativity. Section 2, &quot;Altered States of Consciousness,&quot; stresses that open discussion of altered states of consciousness can inform students of ways of exploring and controlling  consciousness without the use of drugs. Discussed in this section are dreams, meditation centering, biofeedback, parapsychology, spirituality, and growth potential. The final section, &quot;Future Trends and Implications,&quot; highlights possibilities for transpersonal psychology in research, teacher education, and philosophy. (JA)",

Operating on the assumption that each of these conditions generated progressively greater degrees of fear regarding personal injury or death, the following hypotheses were advanced: (a) firstborn males are likely to indicate a lower preference for all three conditions of dangerous sports than later-born males, and (b) as each condition becomes progressively more dangerous, there is a correspondingly greater difference between firstborn and later-born preference. The subjects of the study were 67 firstborn and 99 later-born male college students. They  were compared on their preference for participation in such sports as judo, football, lacrosse, sky diving, ski jumping, and motorcycle racing, among others. The results indicated that in general, firstborns were more likely to avoid dangerous sports than later-borns. The greatest discrimination was found in those sports in which the severity of physical injury is perceived to be high and the opportunity to attain a measure of security and peer support under stress is perceived to be low.

Pattern A students take specified professional coursework followed by a one-quarter, full-time teaching practicum. Pattern B Students spend multiple quarters in a classroom under guidance while engaged in professional coursework. A formal assessment of teaching performance and attitudes of participants included (a) internal evaluations which examined a pattern in terms of its own stated objectives; and (b) external evaluations which compared a pattern with some outside criterion. Internal evaluations so far have taken the form of individual research projects and dissertations by graduate students. In order to obtain information pertinent to an external examination of both preparation patterns, a  questionnaire was employed to evaluate all students in both programs. Based on a five-point scale, the instrument measured 11 categories of teaching effectiveness. The categories can be broadly grouped as follows: (a) professional and personal, (b) instructional preparation, (c) instructional implementation, and (d) instructional evaluation.

According to the study, aging is a research frontier which has great promise for a deeper understanding of motor skills throughout the life span. So far, the motor learning literature of physical  education is nearly devoid of such work, and it seems that research has totally neglected the latter half of the life span of humans. (JS)",

Rats were run to exhaustion and adjacent portions from the left ventricle or from the soleus were treated with the following fixation procedures: (a) glutaraldehyde buffered with cacodylate, S-collidine, or phosphate and postfixed in osmium tetroxide; or (b) osmium tetroxide (as a primary fixative) buffered with cacodylate, veronal acetate, S-collidine, or phosphate or veronal acetate-Ringers with varying concentrations of Ca2+ ions (dicalcium ion with a plus-one charge). Mitochondria disruption was absent in all tissues prepared in buffered glutaraldehyde solutions. Mitochondria swelling, following exhaustive exercise, occurred in all of the  buffered osmium solutions which did not contain Ca2+. It has been found that the degree of mitochondria swelling following exhaustive exercise was inversely related to the concentration of Ca2+. In this study, the presence of Ca2+ in fixatives for muscles from resting or only moderately exercised rats produced mitochondria swelling.

Information was also obtained on the player's position on the team, her classification  as starting or reserve, and her team's rating. The strongest motive for participation expressed by the athletes was the ascetic. The aesthetic experience was least dominant. Athletes differed from nonathletes on the ascetic, aesthetic, and catharsis subscales. The most striking difference was in ascetic attitudes, where athletes had a much higher score. Athletes also scored higher on the catharsis scale. The only scale on which nonathletes scored higher than athletes was the aesthetic scale.

In his first statement, Hellison presents his image of humanity, emphasizing the human need to feel competent, develop a subjective belief system, and be consciously self-aware in a manner which is both reflexive and creative. Hellison contends that, translated into practice, the self-reflexive capacity of humans requires exposure, self-awareness education, and choice. Siedentop, replying to Hellison, disagrees that values arise spontaneously from within as an expression of the individual's inner nature. He contends that all behavior is  determined, but need not be determined by coercive forces. Arguing that Hellison is implying that the quest for the growing competence of the individual cannot be accomplished through behavioral techniques, Siedentop outlines research at Ohio State University which concerns teaching preservice educators how to maximize student learning probabilities in a loving manner beneficial to student growth and development. In their rebuttals, Hellison embellishes on his remarks about self-control and Siedentop tries to define the difference between their opposing views. (JA)",

        "description":"This paper reports on the first of four phases of a training session, involving 26 occupational teachers, which proposed to devise guidelines, for local leadership. Leadership was conceived as the ability to teach others so that they could teach themselves in a minimum period of time. The local aspect of this leadership was interpreted to mean that each teacher would teach herself or himself, as well as colleagues and students, in such a way as to provide for immediate feedback. Each phase consisted of the following six steps: (a) the author gave an example based on his experience working with teachers interested in using better objectives and test items; (b) at least five participants reacted to (a) by citing a similar example based on their own experience; (c) one or two of  these group-generated examples were analyzed in order to specify implications for instructional and learning objectives; (d) the examples were analyzed in order to explain the implications for diagnostic and mastery test items; (e) the same examples were further analyzed in order to develop a variety of alternatives useful for attaining the preceding objectives as measured by the preceding test items; and (f) when the time allotted to the phase was up, each of the preceding five steps was summarized into one practical conclusion that could be accepted by the majority of the group.

The first section is a pretest which attempts to analyze some measurable dimensions of a master's degree. The second section is a short presentation which shows how education must stress the affective and attitude dimensions of learning. Diagrams presented in the third section demonstrate the differences between two approaches to attaining performance objectives. The fourth section is a short test designed to show the difference between an enthusiastic and an unenthusiastic teacher. The fifth section is an attempt to make the teacher in higher education think of learner benefits that are a direct result of higher education. Selecting the best (although not necessarily the  most qualified) student for entry into a master's program is illustrated in the sixth section. The seventh section attempts to point out the absurdity of certain educational philosophical positions if carried to the extreme, and the last section is a posttest intended to measure the gains score of the reader as a result of studying this document.

Kenneth E. Young, of The Council on Postsecondary Accreditation, provides a historical review of past issues and current developments. Frederick R. Cyphert and Nancy Lusk Zimpher, of The Ohio State University, present the higher education perspective and touch on the following topics: Who should be involved in the accreditation process?, Should accreditation be prescriptive or descriptive?, and Should accreditation be mandatory or voluntary? John R. Profitt, of the U.S. Office of Education, offers the federal perspective and discusses the relationship between the federal government and private accrediting  agencies and related issues. Margaret Knispel, of the National Education Association, deals with the rationale for including teachers in accreditation of teacher education. She discusses the desirability of voluntary versus mandatory systems, improvement of current processes and standards, financing, role of the public, and emerging trends. Sidney Simandle, director of teacher education and certification within the Kentucky State Department of Education, poses relevant questions concerning the roles of state legal agencies, teacher education institutions, local school districts, professional organizations, and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education.

This investigation was conducted to determine the following: (a) if preservice teachers who have acquired and practiced complex teaching skills through microsimulation employ these skills when placed in a microteaching situation, and (b) if these acquired skills are used functionally. Subjects for the study were 12 preservice social studies teachers. Results of the investigation indicate that those subjects who participated in this study employed four moves they practiced in a microsimulation setting in a microteaching situation. The practice moves include the following: (a) structuring moves, which provide a context  within which discussion is to be focused; (b) conditional moves, involving a given premise and a following consequence; (c) wait-time moves, involving teacher utilization of silence; and (d) indicative moves, involving teacher responses which relate directly to student utterances. Eight variables were used to compare the first microsimulation with the microteaching situation. Subjects changed significantly from pretest to posttest on all variables in the directions hypothesized. The results also indicated that teachers may acquire, practice, and learn to use a cluster of technical teaching skills functionally through microsimulations of teaching. (Author/JS)",

The study involved 16 students in a graduate course, all of whom were currently or had been teachers. Each graduate student recorded a lesson conducted with children on audio cassette tape both before the first class and after completing 14 weeks of instruction in the course. Interaction forms were used to analyze teacher behaviors on the tapes. The results of the interaction forms were compared with respect to each of the following variables: (a) teacher telling vs. teacher asking, (b) use of open questions vs. closed questions, (c) student inferences and support for  student inferences, and (d) ratio of teacher talk to student talk. Results showed that the course produced significant increases in (a) the amount of teacher questioning, (b) teacher use of open-ended questions, and (c) causing students to make and support inferences; and significant decreases in teacher telling and teacher use of closed questions. There was no significant difference in the effort to sustain a two-to-one ratio of student talk to teacher talk. (PB)",

To facilitate planning, a survey was conducted to obtain ideas of CCET delegates from California's accredited institutions of higher education, public agencies, and professional organizations. The survey first asked individuals to list events they believed would take place during the next 5-10 years or later, which they thought could affect teacher education in California. The several hundred suggested events were condensed to 77 statements, for which the respondents were then asked to (a) indicate the date when the event was most likely to begin to have a noticeable impact, and (b) estimate the intensity of the effect. A total of 28 events which respondents believed  would occur by 1980, and which would have a high positive or extreme negative impact, were selected for further attention. (This paper lists the 28 events and a few more distant events which need to be kept in mind.) These events were presented to small groups of delegates at the 1975 spring conference. The delegates compiled suggestions regarding each event's consequences for teacher education and the action/strategy which CCET should take to enhance the positive or inhibit the negative effect of each. These suggestions and ideas will be organized and integrated into CCET's five-year plan. (PB)",

The third advises project directors to become aware of current literature on management and leadership by objectives. The fourth examines the problem of motivating all participants in an inservice program to strive toward new professional competency. The fifth considers the importance of being able to count visible and measurable success.  The sixth looks at what can be done to prepare for local implementation difficulties. The seventh discusses followup evaluation instruments. The eighth describes how to develop an instrument to determine the competence level of participants at the beginning of the workshop in relation to the workshop's objectives. The ninth discusses participants' comments on and responses to the workshop. The tenth explains that the objectives proposed for the workshop should be realistic. The eleventh stresses the importance of considering what the participants want; and the last description emphasizes the fact that this catalog is not a blueprint telling the director exactly what to do, but a list of alternatives.

Results indicate that (a) the most important planners and initiators of curriculum change are the teachers and principals, while the state has some control, and the student role is minimal; (b) no two schools use the same evaluation methods or have the same philosophy for what might be the most effective means of evaluation; (c) school districts are not satisfied with their current  means of evaluation; and (d) curriculum revision occurs in a helter-skelter fashion and does not cross school districts.

A questionnaire was sent to 373 individuals and/or universities whose names appeared in the 1972-73 National Intramural Association Membership Directory. A 74 percent response was received. Respondents were asked to answer questions concerning present and future intramural-recreational facilities and participation in various activities during the 1973-74 school year. Results were tabulated and measures of central tendencies were developed for each facility. The study makes it possible to  compare institutions of the same size.

A secondary purpose was to determine if changing the air pressure of the ball would alter the pattern established with standard pressure. A basketball was dropped repeatedly from a height of 100 inches above the floor onto one of three striking implements of different sizes located five inches above the floor. The mean rebound height and the mean area of contact produced by each striking implement and for each pressure was computed. Results indicated that (a) the diameter of the striking implement was a significant factor in how high the basketball rebounded, (b) the diameter of  the striking implement was a significant factor in the size of the contact area, (c) the smaller striking implement produced the greatest rebound height and the least area of contact, and (d) there is an optimum implement diameter for the specific amount of force and the coefficients of restitution for the ball-implements used in this study.

Four variables should be controlled in the prescription of exercise: (a) type of activity, (b) intensity, (c) duration, and (d) frequency. The long-term prescription of exercise involves the use of a (a) starter program, (b) progression program, and (c) maintenance program. The starter program is important when the individual is quite unfit and has been inactive for some time. A starter program may last several weeks or more, depending on the initial level of fitness. The progression program involves application of the overload principle in providing an adequate stress to the body systems. The progression must also be gradual in nature, as  adequate physiological adaptation must occur before additional stress is applied. The progression program yields to a maintenance program once the desired outcomes are realized, and the level of activity of a maintenance program depends on the large-muscle, aerobic-type activity performed over 30 minutes a day at an intensity of 80 percent of capacity at least 3 days a week.

This study was undertaken to test this generalization by examining possible differences in precompetition emotional arousal level of football players who were assigned to different playing positions and whose subsequent game performance was rated optimal. The subjects of the study were three junior and seven senior high school football teams. The precompetition emotional arousal of all subjects was measured by the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which asks subjects to indicate how they feel at a particular moment. The test was usually administered within minutes of actual  competition. After the game, the performance of each subject was evaluated subjectively by the respective coaches on a three-point scale. No significant differences were found between elevations in pregame emotional arousal in subjects playing different positions in high school football competition. (Author/JS)",

Increasing emphasis on community involvement has recently resulted in participation of greater numbers of interested community volunteers in sports club activities.

Three strength and/or muscular endurance tests were administered to male and female physical education majors enrolled in a required exercise class at the beginning and end of the semester. Push-ups, chin-ups, and dips were used because of the ease of administration. The class met three times a week for 13 weeks, and engaged in the prescribed exercise program which took about 15 minutes per class period. During that time, the students performed two sets each of three different exercises involving manual resistance. An average increase of 18.6 repetitions for push-ups was demonstrated among the men. Chins and dips for men had repetition increases  of 3 and 5.4 respectively. The results for women were similar, although the base number of repetitions was different. Women showed increases of 12.9, 1.6, and 2.1 repetitions in push-ups, chins, and dips, respectively. These findings indicate that strength and/or muscular endurance can be increased significantly without the use of weight-training equipment.

Novels of both authors were reviewed in order to study the pattern of usage in each novel. From these patterns, concepts which illustrated the sport philosophies of each author were used for general comparisons of the two. Success and failure, life and life concepts, reality, character virtues, gender roles, sociocultural environment, and literary inferences served as categories for comparison. Updike employed reality concepts in relation to organized sport and life concepts in relation to sport activity, creating illusions of reality in order to describe middle class American life. Mailer utilized agonsitic sport inferences in projecting American  existential philosophy. Three hypotheses were projected and upheld by this study: (a) the authors' personal sport backgrounds, experiences, and pervading philosophies were reflected in their novels; (b) the purpose of the characters' performances in sport reflected the authors' backgrounds; and (c) distinct patterns of sport inferences were consistent throughout novels by the same author.

The substitution of sigma square divided by the reliability coefficient for sigma is proposed. This enables the researcher to incorporate dependent variable reliability information when determining the sample size required for a specified power of his statistical test. An inverse relationship between test reliability and the sample n required to maintain a given statistical power is defined. (Author)",

The second, the Montessori Preschool, served as a vehicle for adopting the Montessori method to the public school setting and to improve the cognitive and social skills of preschool children. Another program, the Continuing Education and Services to School Age Mothers, was to provide educational services to pregnant students and/or mothers and their children. The Rubella Children's Program was designed to  provide educational opportunities to multiply handicapped children. Another, Parent-Partner Traineeship Parent Education Program helped students with social and academic problems work with their parents in learning activities.

Extensive test data was obtained from junior high school students and teachers in two white semi-rural and two predominantly black urban schools. Examination of teacher \"labelling\" of students as socially incompetent (SI) using behavior descriptions and checklist responses revealed considerable individual arbiter idiosyncrasy. In the semi-urban schools, means for students consensually identified as SI were lower on all experimental tests, outside school activity  reports, and home interview ratings and also lower with respect to academic and socio-economic measures. In the urban schools, behavior problem students scored lower on nearly all measures of social awareness, school attitudes, self-concepts, social relations with respect to various groups, classroom teacher ratings and interview reports, and school record comments and file data. Statistical analysis revealed a general nonrelatedness among sets of variables and lack of simplified factor structure. (Author/BJG)",

Criterion-referenced testing (CRT) is contrasted with norm-referenced testing (NRT). CRT stresses mastery and scoring in terms of measurable achievement. Examples are given of CRT items and scoring keys. NRT stresses position in the tank order of a group. NRT is not recommended as an effective measure of career path progress. Diagnostic pretest questions help readers identify needed sections of this  document while mastery posttests help readers verify correct comprehension and application of criterion measures.

In addition, the faculty was asked to include three special items: (1) Percentage of class meetings of this course you attended this quarter, (2) Percentage of assigned reading completed, and (3) How have factors which are out of the instructor's control influenced your evaluation of this course. Results indicate that class attendance is positively related to teacher ratings, that completion of class assignments is  not strongly related to teacher ratings, and that factors outside of the instructor's control have a moderately high correlation with teacher ratings.

The Vocational Opinion Index Transition System (VOITS) was designed to help trainees develop appropriate Job Readiness Posture during skills training. The Transition System uses the VOI to diagnose an individual's JRP areas of concern and to prescribe and implement remedial activities. VOITS was implemented on a pilot basis at four MDT Centers. Results of the pilot implementation indicate the positive impact of the VOITS on center operation and staff effectiveness. (Author)",

Better procedures are needed to reach one of the long-range goals of Center Program III: an understanding of the relationship of curiosity to academic achievement and other cognitive skills, styles and motives. This paper reviews briefly some existing curiosity assessment procedures and reports the development of two new measures: the Behavior Profile (BP), used by teachers to rate curiosity (BPC), achievement strivings (BPA), and achievement blocks (BPB): and the Incongruity Game, used to make a direct assessment of curiosity behavior under controlled conditions. Data were collected on these variables and many others for a sample of white middle class children in grades 1-3.  The Incongruity Game did not relate in predicted ways to other variables, but the Behavior Profile curiosity subscale did. Among the major findings for the curiosity scale are these: (1) high reliability, (2) positive associations with grades, problem-solving flexibility, and scores on recall of novel information; and (3) somewhat different patterns of relationship among the three Behavior Profile subscale scores, IQ, and cognitive-academic performance for boys and for girls. A selection of findings for BPA and BPB is also presented. (Author)",

To equate omits scores with choice scores, the transformation can be chosen so that the score is zero if the examinee indicates complete uncertainty. If this is done, the scoring function depends on the number of alternatives. One could also align uncertainty and response omission by granting credit for omitting items, though it is felt this might be hard to explain. (Author)",

The quantities were selected to be typical of the subjects which would be of interest to a decisionmaker in business or government, and included GNP, consumer prices, draft calls, deaths in South Vietnam, and election results on both the state and national level. Rather than giving a one-point estimate for each quantity, each respondent was asked to give a probability distribution which reflected the likely behavior of the quantity in question. It was found that almost all respondents were able to give meaningful distributions and there was a tendency for the true answer to occur disproportionately often in the tails of the distribution given. The effect  of this type of error can be counteracted to a certain extent by combining the individual responses into a \"consensus\" distribution, which will have a greater spread than most of the individuals' distributions. Of the four ways in which this combining of responses was carried out, the most effective was to average the individual's probability density functions. All four consensus methods produced better forecasts than did the average individual. No clear-cut association was found between forescasting skill and age, sex, academic major, or score on a simple current events quiz. (Author/BJG)",

Two of the three workshops concentrated on National Assessment as one model for large-scale assessments. Presentations were made by National staff members. The third workshop was held between the other two. The program for this workshop concentrated on seven different state assessments, a short up-dating on National Assessment, and small group discussion sessions. Presentations were made by state directors of assessment, contractors representatives, and selected National Assessment staff. Evaluations of the workshops  were quite positive. In all three workshops over 90 percent of the responses indicated a desire to attend a follow-up workshop in 1974. Most questions elicited very favorable reactions. The major suggestions for improvement were for more discussion time and better speakers. The things liked best were the opportunity to interact with other assessment persons and to hear about other programs.

Validity studies in general and some implications for the validation of a  new PSM scale are discussed. A major implication for future studies is that validation of component subscales of PSM, rather than of the multidimensional construct as a whole, should be attempted. (Author)",

Thirty-nine schools used a modified Likert format; a few schools also had a check list of adjectives or short answer questions. Nearly all instruments had some space for general comments. The most frequently evaluated concepts and skills were \"knowledge,\"\"getting along well with others,\"\"hard worker,\"\"ability,\"\"dignity,\"\"history-taking,\" and \"performance.\" Several principles of the design of evaluation instruments were discussed. One of these was that the instrument should be part of an evaluation system, and should evaluate the specific tasks and objectives that have been identified in the first stages of  the learning system. Other principles were that the instrument should be similar to the clinical skill, it should be derived from a content sampling map, it should not be used for two purposes that have conflicting goals, and it should be reliable and valid. Several suggestions were made to increase the reliability of clinical evaluation instruments. The use of comments as a replacement for the measurement of specific objectives and content sampling was discouraged. (Author/BJG)",

This teacher faced the problem of accommodating a large number of students with a wide range of abilities who wanted to take the class. Finding scheduled lectures to be inadequate as they required extensive repetition of information, she developed a method of instruction based on self-pacing and heavy use of video tape. Meanwhile, a comprehensive indepth evaluation, which stressed student reactions to her was conducted in order  to determine course success. The University of Washington Student Ratings Form is appended. (Author/BJG)",

The application of singular value decomposition of nonsquare matrices to this data is described and its relationship to principal components analysis and its data reduction value is explained. Exploratory analyses are being conducted to determine if the same bases occur across age levels, across time from one assessment to its reassessment, and across subject areas.

While educators disagree on the usefulness of criterion-referenced tests the position taken in this monograph is that criterion-referenced tests are useful, and that their usefulness will be enhanced by developing testing methods and decision procedures specifically designed for their use within the context of objectives-based programs. This monograph serves as a review and an integration of existing literature relating to the theory and practice of criterion-referenced testing with an emphasis on psychometric and statistical matters, and provides a foundation on which to design further research  studies. Specifically, the material is organized around the following topics: Definitions of criterion-referenced tests and measurements, test development and validation, statistical issues in criterion-referenced measurement, selected psychometric issues, tailored testing research, description of a typical objectives-based program, and suggestions for further research. The two types of criterion-referenced tests focused on are: Estimation of \"mastery scores\" or \"domain scores\", and the allocation of individuals to \"mastery states\" on the objectives in a program.

        "description":"This report discusses the development of procedures for establishing teacher estimates of minimal acceptable, desired, and predicted levels of student performance on specific reading items and across reading skill areas. Statewide estimates were obtained by collecting and averaging item estimates from samples of teachers throughout the state, and district-wide estimates were obtained by collecting item estimates from groups of teachers using consensus procedures. Item estimates have been compared directly to student performance on the items, and individual item estimates have been averaged across reading skill areas for comparison with student performance across the same skill areas. The minimal acceptable and desired estimates across skill areas have been used as criterion  measures to establish relative strengths and weaknesses in student performance. These criterion measures have also been used in conjunction with normative measures across the same skill areas to establish a more complete profile of the adequacy of student performance. Teacher outcomes studies have been conducted in three assessment projects. The pilot study was conducted during the 1973-74 9-year-old Minnesota Reading Assessment. The questionnaire contained 22 items across four reading domains and various difficulty levels. The 22 items were selected from the 189 items administered to students in one of three independent student samples. The teacher samples consisted of third and fourth grade classroom teachers and reading specialists in a subsample of the schools in each of the student  samples. (Author/DEP)",

It is pointed out that questions, regardless of whether they are addressed to students, teachers, or principals, should be as specific as possible so that complexities of attitudes, aspirations, or behavior may  become apparent.

The specialties studied were pavement maintenance, fire protection, food service, fuel service, and material facilities. The cost per graduate of OJT for these specialties was compared to the cost per graduate of resident school technical training. For three of the five specialties, OJT cost per graduate was below the technical training school cost per graduate. Supervisors were surveyed to determine if there  was a difference in performance between OJT and technical school graduates in these AFS'c. As was true in the previous phase, no evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that either OJT or technical school graduates were superior in performance. Conditional cost models were also formulated and tested. The conditional cost models are based on an alternative or opportunity cost concept and represent a refinement of the original cost models.

The instant case was brought as a class action by black employees of a North Carolina plant of the privately owned Duke Power Company. Some four months after this Supreme Court decision, a Federal District Court issued an injunction halting the use in the New York City school system of certain examinations as a basis for appointment to supervisory or administrative posts. This court, although noting &quot;Griggs vs. Duke Power  Company&quot;, based its ruling on constitutional grounds. At the time the suit was instituted, obtaining a permanent supervisory position required not only meeting State certification requirements but also obtaining a City license. The latter was attainable only on passing an examination prepared by the Board of Examiners. Plaintiffs were a black and a Puerto Rican, both of whom had State Certificates, met educational and experience requirements of the City Board, and were serving as acting principals of elementary schools.

        "description":"This report focused on the goal of investigating, within a path analytic framework, the stability and interplay of two occupational status projection variables in a Texas sample. More specifically, the dynamics of occupational aspirations and occupational expectations, observed in a three-wave rural youth panel, were analyzed using the two-variable, path analytic technique for panel data developed by Heise. Standardized data were collected in a six year, three-wave panel of youth from six southern states. Levels of occupational aspirations and expectations were operationalized as follows. Occupational aspirations were determined by written responses to the open-ended question, &quot;If you were completely free to choose any job, what would you most desire as a lifetime job?&quot;  Occupational expectations were similarly determined. The analysis generally supported the strategy of racial submodeling of mobility processes. That is, the dynamics of occupational aspirations and expectations in the black panel differed sufficiently from the dynamics of the white panel that the composite model would obscure the nature of the change. Findings also supported the contention that status projections are highly dynamic phenomena subject to process submodeling. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper details a method for investigating the equity aspects of distributions within school districts of educational resources. To illustrate how to systematically examine in detail the allocation of school resources, the relationship between the distribution of a large number of resources among Philadelphia's public schools and the distribution of black and low-income pupils among the schools was determined. It is concluded that when plaintiffs use aggregate and few measurements (per pupil expenditures, for example), defendants and the courts will have little difficulty in establishing that proof that any particular pattern of resource distribution indicates the achievement of equality of educational opportunity. It is held that only the extent to which the allocation  matches fiat--the district's public policies of allocation--can be demonstrated; if unequal resource allocations are found, then the source of the fiat must be determined. Finally, it is argued that what is clearly needed is matching well-defined objectives of a school system with well-defined evidence of which school inputs are most relevant for which type of student.

        "description":"This paper discusses a statistical analysis of the impact on student learning of socioeconomic characteristics, certain aspects of the school environment, and the amount of educational resources expanded on students. It is felt that the analysis is quite similar to what economists do when they estimate production functions for films; but that there are several features unique to education, the most important being that the costs of the inputs to education (e.g., teacher salaries) do not vary with the value of the outputs of education (e.g., academic achievement). In an education production function, then, the value of the inputs must be directly estimated, without reference to price. The techniques appropriate to economic agents which maximize the value of outputs according to  the cost of inputs are not applicable. The data base was provided by the Philadelphia school district. From pupil files, as of 1970-71 or 1971-72, detailed data were obtained for 627 sixth grade students in 103 elementary schools, for 533 eighth grade students in 42 junior high schools, and 716 twelfth grade students in five senior high schools. The results of the study are interpreted as suggesting that student achievement is increased when school resources are applied differentially to low income vs. high income students, black vs. non-black students, and, most clearly, to low-achieving vs. high-achieving students.

The primary source of data on the individual students was an interview combined with as much observation as possible during the interview. A profile of the urban Appalachian student was drawn from the data. Highlights include the following: the eighth grade Appalachian migrant student is approximately 13 and one-half years old and, like his parents, probably was born in a southern Appalachian county; he has attended at least two elementary schools prior to enrolling at the junior high level; both of his parents work, usually at some form of unskilled labor; his attitude toward the school can be described as neutral; he prefers those teachers and  administrators who are friendly and personable; in turn, he will be open and friendly; if placed in a threatening or difficult situation by a student, teacher, or administrator he will tend to withdraw; he has average grades and attendance patterns; and, if he attends a school where there are blacks, he will not understand the blacks and will tend to keep to himself or to associate only with other white students. The study concludes that, as a student, he is little understood by his teachers, counselors, and administrators. (Author/JM)",

The effects of this conflict and victimization may have on the students' subsequent attitudes and feelings, their career choices, and their academic performance are examined. Also examined are the socioeconomic and educational backgrounds of the parents. A second group of questions concern the effects that racial  conflict and other school experiences have in drawing or driving students into integrationist versus separatist (segregationist) positions. This study is based on a longitudinal design in which the same students have been interviewed and will be re-interviewed two times more during two different years. In this report, the correlates of separatist versus integrationist sentiments are discussed, but the direction of causality is held to be undeterminable until further accumulation of data.

        "description":"The question of how educational failures lead to or contribute to occupational disability was studied in a youthful Puerto Rican population in an economically poor neighborhood and school district of Chicago. Anthropological field research techniques, supplemented by scheduled interviews and questionnaires, were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data over a two year period, from an original sample of 30 youths, ranging from 13 to 16 years of age, their parents, and their teachers. Quantitative data from youths and parents were analyzed by ethnicity and two categories of length-of-residence on the mainland (non-Puerto Rican families; long-term Puerto Rican families, or short-term Puerto Rican families). Results are stated to show that the Puerto Rican population in this  low-income sector contains a probably substantial population of high achievement oriented and upwardly mobile families, as well as Puerto Ricans approximating characteristics commonly used to describe the whole Puerto Rican population. The report concludes, that, in general, lack of motivation or desire seemed not to be the key to the development of educational and career-entry disabilities observed in youths in the area, but rather a lack of several optional means of reaching educational and occupational goals when problems blocked progress.

In this curriculum, the &quot;cognitive style of the individual&quot; is thought to represent a conglomerate of three &quot;educational sciences&quot;: &quot;Symbols and their Meanings,&quot;&quot;Cultural Determinants,&quot; and &quot;Modalities of Inference.&quot;&quot;Symbols and their Meanings&quot; is defined as that area concerned with how an individual seeks meaning from his environment (either through listening or reading), how he perceives, how he responds, and how he relates to feelings, commitments and values. These characteristics are referred to as theoretical and qualitative elements in the individual's cognitive style. &quot;Cultural Determinants&quot; are defined as indicators of how cultural influences affect  the way the individual gives meaning to symbols and how he gets meaning from the symbols he uses. &quot;Modalities of Inferences&quot; have to do with how an individual thinks or makes a decision. These three &quot;sciences&quot; comprise the fourth &quot;science&quot;&quot;Cognitive Style of the Individual.&quot; A graphic illustration of an individual's status in each science is called a cognitive style map. Each student has his own map--his own cognitive style--which is identified by the teacher. This map is used by the teacher to plan the student's instructional program. (Author/JM)",

Selected census statistics are reported. A unit of black urban concentration somewhat different from the standard metropolitan statistical area used by the Bureau of the Census is defined. A North/South regional classification slightly different from that used by the Bureau is used. In terms of these classificatory devices, it is stated that it is shown that over 95 percent of the non-Southern blacks live in 14 states. These states contain all non-Southern urban concentrations of 50,000 or more blacks. Over 86 percent of non-Southern blacks reside in these urban concentrations. California is singled  out for closer examination. A comparison is made between the median educational attainment of the black, Spanish heritage, and total populations of selected areas in California. Blacks attain a lower median grade level than the total population but a higher grade level than the Spanish heritage population. It is shown that there was a higher proportion of elementary age children in the black population of California than in the total California population. The proportion in the Spanish heritage population was even higher, however. (Author/JM)",

Both studies drew on a population of black junior high school students, eighth and ninth graders, 14, 15, and 16 years of age. In the first study, four potential screening measures were applied to the eighth grade of an inner-city junior high school. For each measure, those students in the top two percent on that measure were given the Advanced Progressive Matrices test and then the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). The WISC performance scores were taken as the criterion identifying the top nine students (approximately two percent), who were to be designated &quot;mentally  gifted&quot; within this population. The second study investigated a method of motivating low-achieving junior high school students to learn mathematics by using them as tutors for fourth graders. Before each tutoring session, the tutors were coached on the material they were to teach. At the end of this brief pilot study, arithmetic tests were given in the fourth and ninth grade classrooms. Results showed significant gains for the ninth grade tutors. (Author/JM)",

It is asserted that child social behavior must be assessed accurately in order to do research on socialization. Socialization is defined as the process by which an individual learns to interact with others. It is proposed that it is possible to design a peer rating approach to overcome weaknesses of the approaches most often used at present, the sociometric and the observation methods. It is noted that such a peer rating approach should employ several randomly assigned raters for each ratee in order to minimize error due to rater response tendencies and unique rater/ratee relationships. It should also employ an item sampling technique to examine as many social behaviors as possible. A  review of the socialization literature and trial runs of measurement procedures led the authors to identify 12 constructs or variables related to the socialization process. These constructs are stated to be logically organized into three groups or scales: Individual Prosocial Action (leadership, independence, assertiveness, competitiveness), Social Interaction (cooperation, conformity, authority relations, control of aggression), and Affective Relationships (liking others, social acceptance, being liked, popularity).

        "description":"Two related questions are investigated in this research: (1) the characteristics which differentiate those schools which extensively use educational innovations from those which do not; and (2) the factors that determine whether innovation will be a carefully thought-out and discriminating process, rather than a process primarily influenced by (and incorporating) the latest educational fads and fancies. Most of the material in the report relates a variety of independent variables to adoption of innovations in schools in major cities. Separate sections of the study establish a typology of innovations with respect to both the quality of, and the frequency with which, specific types of innovations are implemented; discuss the school systems surveyed; examine several characteristics  of schools such as student bodies, community involvement, and student morale; report investigations of the relationship between the availability of both physical and staff resources and the frequency with which innovations are adopted; discuss school structure in terms of both size and complexity; and, focus on individuals involved in the schools. The final section of the study includes a summary of major findings, a discussion of the implications of these findings for policy, and recommendations for future research. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The research reported here examines residence differences (metropolitan ghetto, non metropolitan, or rural) in characteristics purportedly associated with poverty among poor, black Americans--and particularly in family relationships and interaction. Samples, drawn from the eastern part of Texas, were restricted to families with children still in the home. Residence differences were searched for in education and occupations, aspects of family structure and interaction, interaction of the homemakers and husbands with persons and groups outside of their nuclear families, and aspirations and expectations of the black homemakers. Highlights of the findings of the study, as stated, include the following: (1) stable and healthy family relationships, as reflected by the variables of  father-absence, the husband-father role in the family, family cohesiveness and marital satisfaction may be more difficult to maintain by poor blacks of metropolitan ghettos than nonmetropolitan areas; (2) future orientations appear more prohibitive of intra-generational mobility among nonmetropolitan than metropolitan poor blacks; and, (3) nonmetropolitan poor blacks might be more handicapped than metropolitan poor blacks by demands of kin relationships, larger families, the nature of their child-rearing practices, and their goals for their children.

        "author":["Butts, June Dobbs"],
        "description":"Noting that the concepts of sex and race are interwoven into the fabric of American culture to such a degree that it is virtually impossible to separate them; this paper presents three major hypotheses felt to characterize American culture racially as well as sexually. For each hypothesis, specific examples are cited delineating the hypothesized interaction of two variables: sex and race. It is asserted that American culture is characterized by three great quests or pursuits, and that in each of them the concepts of sex and of race are so combined as to make separation impossible. They are, first, the \"Quest for Power Dominance,\" secondly, the \"Quest for Identity,\" and thirdly, the \"Quest for Love.\" It is suggested that, in essence, sex education helps young people to both get in  touch with their own feelings or even to come to the realization that one is not in touch with his or her sexual registration, and also to help the youngster to learn from others. Here, as with race, it is held that the inability to share ideas and to accept feelings which are different from one's own may come as a surprise to the individual whose chances to discuss sex had been severely limited. It is further asserted that young children especially need to be exposed to the ameliorative aspects of love and healthy sexuality. (Author/JM)",

It sketches a rough outline of the central questions within each major area, to indicate some of the work that has been done, and to suggest new directions that might be taken. This review of the current state of interest in research on women's issues grew out of a six-month study sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Several major metropolitan areas--Boston, New York, San Francisco, and Washington D.C. -- were visited. Among the major areas explored in this paper are: (1) the need for research/action programs; (2) the women's movement; (3)  socialization and the educational system; (4) the world of work; (5) marital status and family; (6) health and life cycle issues; and, (7) other issues of practical concern to women. Also included is an appendix focusing on resources for research on women's issues. (Author/JM)",

It is one of a series of six reports to be issued by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights describing the structure, mechanisms, and procedures used by the federal departments and agencies in their efforts to end discrimination against this nation's minority and female citizens. The purpose of these reports, it is stated, is not to criticize particular departments and agencies, but, after a careful analysis, to offer recommendations for the improvement of those programs which require change. Highlights of the findings of this report, as stated, include the following: the regulatory agencies are charged with overseeing significant sectors of the American economy in the public interest; with one  exception, none of the agencies have acknoqledged responsibility for dealing with one of the most important components of their responsibilities--eliminating employment discrimination in the industries they regulate; the focus of efforts by two agencies to ensure non-discrimination in the services provided by the industries they regulate is primarily complaint oriented; and, in other civil rights impact areas, the regulatory agencies have been derelict in the pursuit of their public interest mandate.

It is based on a review of documents produced by that Office, interviews with federal officials, and an analysis of available literature. The stated purpose of this report is to determine how well the Office of Revenue Sharing has done its civil rights enforcement job, from its creation in January 1973 until October 1974. Highlights of the findings of this report include the following: ORS civil rights compliance program is found to have been fundamentally inadequate; abundant evidence indicates that discrimination in the employment practices and in the delivery of benefits of State and local Government programs is far  reaching, often extending to activities funded by general revenue sharing; ORS has been one of the most poorly staffed and funded civil rights compliance programs in the federal government; ORS has not done what it could to make its civil rights compliance effort most effective; and, since general revenue sharing is not only a massive federal program but represents an important new form of federal assistance, it is necessary that the federal government enforce non discrimination in activities made possible by this assistance.
